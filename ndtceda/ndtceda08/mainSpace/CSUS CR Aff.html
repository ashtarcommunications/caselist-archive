CONTENTION ONE: THE FABRIC OF THEIR LIVES<br />
Hypocritical protectionist subsidies by the US globally suppress cotton prices, profiting a few Americans at the expense of over 10 million abroad<br />
Stiglitz 06 (Joseph, Prof. Econ @ Columbia &amp; Nobel Prize in Econ Recipient in 2001, “The Tyranny of King Cotton”, Project Syndicate &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stiglitz76" rel="nofollow">http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stiglitz76</a>&gt;)<br />
&quot;Americans like to … the Doha Round.&quot;<br />
<br />
PLAN<br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all domestic subsidies, for cotton, fully complying with the WTO Dispute Settlement Board ruling.<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: IT’S NOT YOU, IT’S ME<br />
US cotton subsidies deny African nations access to the international market, costing them 24 billion dollars annually and destroying their only source of income and development<br />
Helling et al 08 (Madeleine, Scott and Joshua, Beloit College's Department of Economics and Management, “High Cotton: Why the USA should not provide subsidies to cotton farmers”, Economic Affairs June 4 vol. 28 iss. 2 pp. 65-66)<br />
&quot;Local revenues that …agricultural income annually (Borders and Burnett, 2006).&quot;<br />
<br />
Proposed cuts by the US change nothing, while cotton subsidies condemn tens of millions to abject poverty in Africa<br />
Mgendi 08 – communications co-ordinator for ActionAid International in Africa (Eric, Business Daily Africa, “Why Doha trade talks were bound to fail,” 8-4-2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9215&amp;Itemid=5821" rel="nofollow">http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9215&amp;Itemid=5821</a>)<br />
&quot;The US offered … now in abeyance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Poverty is the deadliest form of violence; it is a genocide of the poor that kills more people EVERY DAY than there are cotton farmers in the US [232 million/15yr = 42,345/day vs. 25,000 U.S. cotton farmers.]<br />
Gilligan, 96 – Prof of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Director of the Center for the Study of Violence. (James, Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and Its Causes, p. 195-96)<br />
&quot;The finding that …as cause to effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Additionally, poverty in developing African nations causes regional conflict<br />
Collier 06 (Paul, Dept. Econ @ Oxford, “Economic Causes of Civil Conflict and their Implications for Policy” April 2006)<br />
&quot;Why is the …of the poor.&quot;<br />
<br />
African regional conflict pulls in other nations, spiraling into global nuclear war<br />
Deutsch 02 (Dr. Jeffrey, PhD in Economics, “Rabid Tiger Newsletter”, December 18th, 2002, &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rabidtigers.com/rtn/newsletterv2n9.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabidtigers.com/rtn/newsletterv2n9.html</a>&gt;)<br />
&quot;The Rabid Tiger … to go fishing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cotton subsidies are key – they are the biggest cause of global poverty and removing them will cut West African poverty in half<br />
Heinisch 6 [Elinor Lynn, Press Officer, CARE, postgraduate student at the Faculty of Humanities, Univ. Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, “West Africa Versus the U.S. on Cotton Subsidies: Why, How and What Next?”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://witsetd.wits.ac.za:8080/dspace/bitstream/123456789/195/1/main.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://witsetd.wits.ac.za:8080/dspace/bitstream/123456789/195/1/main.pdf</a>]<br />
&quot;The International Cotton Advisory Committee …subsidies in 2002-2003 (Goreux, 2004, p. 11).&quot;<br />
<br />
Cutting cotton subsidies solves primary and secondary consequences of poverty, saving 1 million children from starvation and educating 2 million more<br />
Rizvi 2007 (Haidir, “US Cotton Subsidies Cost W. Africa Millions: Report”, June 26, &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/06/26/2116/" rel="nofollow">http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/06/26/2116/</a>&gt;)<br />
&quot;More than 1 million … out of poverty,” he added.&quot;<br />
<br />
You as the judge have to make an ethical choice via the ballot – vote for the affirmative’s interrogation of global hegemony’s effect on Africa, or uphold the status quo and vote negative to deny any responsibility for the Other<br />
Mama 07 (Amina, Prof. Gender Studies at Univ. Cape Town and Chair of Gender Studies, African Gender Institute, “Is it ethical to study Africa? Preliminary thoughts on scholarship and freedom”, African Studies Review vol. 50 no. 1 pp. 1-26)<br />
&quot;To pursue questions of ethics...an ethical choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
The affirmative is key - we must challenge normative political engagement. Only the affirmative does so by lifting cotton subsidies<br />
Mama 07 (Amina, Prof. Gender Studies at Univ. Cape Town and Chair of Gender Studies, African Gender Institute, “Is it ethical to study Africa? Preliminary thoughts on scholarship and freedom”, African Studies Review vol. 50 no. 1 pp. 1-26)<br />
&quot;The current context … and challenges global hegemonies.&quot;<br />
<br />
CONTENTION THREE: FRUIT OF OUR DOOM<br />
U.S. trade officials are intent on reviving multilateral trade talks, but they are unwilling to bend on their demand that developing countries make concessions.<br />
AP, 8/20 (International Herald Tribune, “Envoy: US support for trade deal won't fade,” 8-20-2008,<br />

The United States' chief … or anyone else's.&quot;<br />
<br />
This demand for reciprocity guarantees inevitable breakdown in talks – a unilateral cut in subsidies is key to salvage a minimalist agreement to save the WTO<br />
Ray, 8/27 – former Professor of Economics at IIM Calcutta (Alok, Hindu Business Line, “The Doha Round impasse,” 8-27-2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/08/27/stories/2008082750480800.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/08/27/stories/2008082750480800.htm</a>)<br />

<br />
Brazil’s retaliation on unsubsidized U.S. products more important than cotton will wreck our economy<br />
Zachary, 5 – professor at Stanford (G. Pascal Zachary, “100% Rotten,” 12-1-2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2005/12/01/8364585/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2005/12/01/8364585/index.htm</a>)<br />
But what's different now…their cases,&quot; Lindsey says.<br />
<br />
And, the collapse undermines support for the multilateral trading system and encourages proliferation of preferential trading agreements. A strong WTO is key to prevent protectionism.<br />

Additionally, WTO credibility is key to prevent extinction by sustaining multilateral cooperation<br />
Copley News Service, 99 (“Commentary,” 12-1-1999, Lexis)<br />
For decades, many …. They should be celebrating it.<br />
Reform of ag subsidies starting with cotton avoids backlash<br />
Helling et al 08 (Madeleine, Scott and Joshua, Beloit College's Department of Economics and Management, “High Cotton: Why the USA should not provide subsidies to cotton farmers”, Economic Affairs June 4 vol. 28 iss. 2 pp. 65-66 gngr)<br />

We have a unique obligation to encourage capitalism in policy discussion. Every move toward socialism must be halted to prevent the destruction of humanity.<br />
