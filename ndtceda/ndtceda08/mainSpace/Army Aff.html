CONTENTION ONE IS THE STATUS QUO<br />
<br />
A.) AS A RESULT OF THE MORRISON DECISION THE COURTS HAVE ABANDONED THE RATIONAL REVIEW TEST WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS SET THE PARAMETERS FOR EVALUATING CONGRESSIONAL ACTION UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE. INSTEAD THE US V. MORRISON DECISION APPLIED A MORE NARROWLY DEFINED INTERPRETATION REGARDING CONGRESS’ ABILITY TO REGULATE INTERSTATE COMMERCE. THIS NOTION OF “NEW FEDERALISM” HAS AIMED TO INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THE POWER AND AUTONOMY OF THE STATES AND REIGN IN CONGRESSES ABILITY TO ENACT REGULATIONS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE<br />

<br />
B.) MORRISON USHERED IN A NEW AGE OF FEDERALISM AND STATE POWER THAT HAS GUTTED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S REGULATORY ABILITY<br />
RUSSELL 2003<br />
[Sarah F., Yale Law School, J.D., ARTICLE: COVERING WOMEN AND VIOLENCE: MEDIA TREATMENT OF VAWA'S CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDY, 2003 Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law, 9 Mich. J. Gender &amp; L. 327]cweb<br />
<br />
C.) THE RAICH DECISION IN 2005 WAS NOT A STEP AWAY FROM THE “NEW FEDERALISM” INSTITUTED BY MORRISON AND LOPEZ. INSTEAD IT WAS A PARALLEL DECISION THAT AIMED AT CLARIFYING THE SCOPE OF THE “INTERSTATE MARKET” AND AN UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT BY THE COURT TO MAKE INTERSTATE REGULATION EFFECTIVE<br />
MORRIS, 2005<br />
(David Morris, AlterNet, June 15, 2005, The Sainted Clause, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich</a> ) CWEB<br />
<br />
D.) RAICH HAS LEAD TO AN UNPREDICTABILITY AND INCONSISTENCY THAT IS NOW PERMEATING ALL FEDERALISM APPLICATION. THE PLAN IS THE CONSISTENT STANCE THAT IS NEEDED TO RECTIFY THE CURRENT QUAGMIRE. IT IS NOT AN ISSUE OF RAICH VERSUS MORRISON IT IS AN ISSUE OF A CONSISTENT JUDICIAL PRECEDENT WHICH THE PLAN PROVIDES.<br />

[Law Professors at Tennessee &amp; Samford, Paper Symposium: Federalism After Gonzales V. Raich: Symposium Article: What Hath Raich Wrought? Five Takes, 9 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 915]<br />
<br />
E.) AS A RESULT OF THE CONFUSION SURROUNDING THE INCONSISTENCIES IN MORRISON, LOPEZ AND RAICH LOWER COURTS ARE NOW UNCERTAIN AS TO SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE. THIS LACK OF CLARITY HAS LEAD TO LOWER COURTS ISSUING CONTRADICTORY RULINGS. THE PLAN IS THE SINGLE, CONSISTENT PRECEDENT NEEDED IN ORDER RESOLVE THE CHAOS.<br />

<br />
THUS THE PLAN<br />
RESOLVED: THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE U.S. V. MORRISON, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) AND REVERT BACK TO THE PRIOR STANDARD, ORIGINALLY ARTICULATED IN WICKARD V. FILBURN. 317 US 111 (1942), THAT THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AUTHORIZES CONGRESS TO REGULATE WHOLLY INTRASTATE, NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY IF SUCH ACTIVITY, VIEWED IN THE AGGREGATE, WOULD HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON INTERSTATE COMMERCE<br />

C.) THE GROWING AUTONOMY AND POWER THAT IS BEING EXERCISED BY STATES WITHIN BRAZIL HAS BROUGHT ABOUT MASSIVE REVENUE DECENTRALIZATION OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. WITHOUT A MOVE TOWARDS REAFFIRMING A STRONG, CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT ON ALL FRONTS BRAZIL’S ECONOMY WILL SOON COLLAPSE<br />

<br />
A.) DISTRICT COURTS ARE NOW APPROACHING RULINGS ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IN DIFFERENT AND OFTEN CONTRADICTORY WAYS.

In 1954, the United States Supreme Court decided in Brown v. Board of education that the standard of separate but equal that had authorized American segregation, had no place in education. Over the next 20 years, civil rights groups came together to challenge segregated school districts in courts throughout the country, building bonds that fueled an entire movement. But in Milliken v. Bradley the Court slammed the door on this process by creating a new standard of segregation—one based on class.<br />
Thomas E. Kleven, 2005, professor Thurgood Marshall School of Law, Texas Southern University, BROWN'S LESSON: TO INTEGRATE OR SEPARATE IS NOT THE QUESTION, BUT HOW TO ACHIEVE A NON-RACIST SOCIETY, University of Maryland Law Journal of Race, Religion, Gender and Class, Spring 2005<br />
<br />
Milliken places black children in impoverished inner-city schools and white children in wealthy schools. This creates a permanent, dehumanized underclass of “worker students” to be trained to adhere to the commands of their wealthy suburban counterparts<br />
Jonathan Kozol 2005, The Same of the Nation, The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America,<br />
<br />
The elevation of economic status as a neutral reality, one that cannot be discriminatory, but rather “just is” as Milliken sees it, is a sacrificial mentality—that economic success requires some group to always rest at the bottom of society.<br />
Santos in `03 (Boaventura de Sousa, the Center for Social Studies at the University of Coimbra, “Collective Suicide?”<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html" rel="nofollow">http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html</a>)<br />
<br />
THUS THE PLAN<br />
<br />
RESOLVED: THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE MILLIKEN V. BRADLEY, 418 US 717 (1974), REJECTING THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION THAT THE STANDARDS OF EQUITY DO NOT PERMIT CROSS-DISTRICT DESEGREGATION PLANS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the liberal response to cases like Milliken is to focus on “multiculturalism” and “identity politics” that divide groups disadvantaged by Milliken’s economic discrimination. Overcoming this division is necessary to solve for American education<br />
San Juan Jr. in `04 (By E. San Juan, Jr., Co-Director, Philippine Forum, New York City, Nov 13, 2004, &quot;Post-9/11 Reflections on Multiculturalism and Racism,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/printer_13554.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/printer_13554.shtml</a>)<br />
<br />
The anti-capitalist structure must be at the forefront of our struggle. Capitalism is a dynamic force that will overwhelm small victories unless they are part of a neverending kritik of capitalism. Neo-liberal multiculturalism on its own will fail.<br />

We must unify across races and ethnicity to struggle against capitalism. Division of the forces is not an option.<br />

<br />
<br />
This unified confrontation of capitalism unsettles the accepted neo-liberal capitalist horizon that dominates today’s political scene. By focusing on and enabling a unique struggle against the particular issue of educational injustice in the U.S., groups are mobilized and linkup around a specific problem that carries universal content about the problem inherent in the capitalist system leading to solvency<br />

THE SORDID HISTORY OF ABORTION REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES REVEALS DEEP SEEDED NORMATIVE JUDGMENTS ABOUT WOMEN, THEIR ROLES AND SOCIETY AT LARGE. IT IS ONLY THROUGH A CRITICAL HISTORICAL INTERROGATION THAT THE POWER RELATIONS WHICH CREATED THESE LAWS ARE EXPOSED. WITHOUT THIS EXPOSURE THE ILLICIT THOUGHTS AND DOMINATIONS INHERENT IN ABORTION LAWS WILL BE ENDLESSLY REPEATED.<br />
<br />
THE MEDICALIZATION RHETORIC FINDS ITS BEGINNINGS IN THESE ROOTS OF SOCIAL PREJUDICE, AS WOMEN WERE PORTRAYED AS INSTRUMENTS FOR NATURE’S PURPOSES, BEREFT OF ANY AGENCY BEYOND THAT DICTATED BY THEIR BODIES<br />
<br />
Reva Siegel, 1992, Reasoning from the Body: A Historical Perspective on Abortion Regulation and Questions of Equal Protection, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 261, Acting Professor of Law, University of California at Berkeley<br />
<br />
THE CAMPAIGN TO WREST FROM WOMEN CONTROL OF REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS WAS ALSO INFORMED BY A DESIRE TO MAINTAIN THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE “NATIVE” STATE AGAINST ENCROACHING POOR AND ETHNIC POPULATIONS, REVEALING THE RACIST AND CLASSIST MOTIVATIONS DRIVING POPULATION CONTROL<br />
<br />
Siegel continues<br />
<br />
THE JURISPRUDENCE SURROUNDING ABORTION IS ENTRENCHED IN THE LEGACY OF THE ANTI-ABORTION CAMPAIGN—JUSTIFYING THE SUBORDINATION OF WOMEN DUE TO ANTIQUATED GENDER ROLES, STILL INSIDIOUS YET RENDERED INVISIBLE BY MEDICALIZED DISCOURSE<br />
<br />
Siegel continues<br />
<br />
FROM THIS EXPLICATION OF OUR ADVOCACY IT IS CLEAR THAT IN ORDER TO FINALLY PUT AN END TO THE VIOLENCE AND SUBJUGATION OF ABORTION REGULATION:<br />
<br />
WE STAND RESOLVED THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE ITS DECISION IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY (505 U. S. 833 1992) BASED ON ITS HISTORICAL INVESTIGATION BY HOLDING THAT THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD ESTABLISHED IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY VIOLATES THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.<br />
WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CLARIFY.<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION 1: THE BIOPOLITICS OF ABORTION REGULATION<br />
<br />
ABORTION REGULATION IS THE STATE’S COERCIVE POWER WRIT LARGE, THE DISCOURSES OF WOMEN’S “CHOICE” AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE ONLY OBSCURE THIS POWER<br />

THE SORDID HISTORY OF ABORTION REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES REVEALS DEEP SEEDED NORMATIVE JUDGMENTS ABOUT WOMEN, THEIR ROLES AND SOCIETY AT LARGE. IT IS ONLY THROUGH A CRITICAL HISTORICAL INTERROGATION THAT THE POWER RELATIONS WHICH CREATED THESE LAWS ARE EXPOSED. WITHOUT THIS EXPOSURE THE ILLICIT THOUGHTS AND DOMINATIONS INHERENT IN ABORTION LAWS WILL BE ENDLESSLY REPEATED.<br />
THE MEDICALIZATION RHETORIC FINDS ITS BEGINNINGS IN THESE ROOTS OF SOCIAL PREJUDICE, AS WOMEN WERE PORTRAYED AS INSTRUMENTS FOR NATURE’S PURPOSES, BEREFT OF ANY AGENCY BEYOND THAT DICTATED BY THEIR BODIES<br />

<br />
THE CAMPAIGN TO WREST FROM WOMEN CONTROL OF REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS WAS ALSO INFORMED BY A DESIRE TO MAINTAIN THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE “NATIVE” STATE AGAINST ENCROACHING POOR AND ETHNIC POPULATIONS, REVEALING THE RACIST AND CLASSIST MOTIVATIONS DRIVING POPULATION CONTROL<br />
Siegel continues<br />
<br />
THE JURISPRUDENCE SURROUNDING ABORTION IS ENTRENCHED IN THE LEGACY OF THE ANTI-ABORTION CAMPAIGN—JUSTIFYING THE SUBORDINATION OF WOMEN DUE TO ANTIQUATED GENDER ROLES, STILL INSIDIOUS YET RENDERED INVISIBLE BY MEDICALIZED DISCOURSE<br />
Siegel continues<br />
<br />
FROM THIS EXPLICATION OF OUR ADVOCACY IT IS CLEAR THAT IN ORDER TO FINALLY PUT AN END TO THE VIOLENCE AND SUBJUGATION OF ABORTION REGULATION:<br />
<br />
WE STAND RESOLVED THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE ITS DECISION IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY (505 U. S. 833 1992) BASED ON ITS HISTORICAL INVESTIGATION BY HOLDING THAT THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD ESTABLISHED IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD V.

New Advantage – Wetlands<br />
The Raich decision added confusion about the intent and reach of the commerce clause. U of Cincinnati Law Review 2k6 “The pervasive inconsistency exhibited in all branches”<br />
<br />
Now is the critical time for the court to send a signal of clarity and consistency in application of commerce clause guidelines. BYU Law Review, 2k6 “The Seventh Circuit happened to get”<br />
<br />
Confusion has resulted from the court decision in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, a landmark federalism case that was decided using the standard set in Morrison to rule that congress did not have jurisdiction to regulate wetlands under the commerce clause. This has resulted in corps fragmentation and crushed uniformity. Jonathan May, 2k5, U of Baltimore Journal of Environmental Law, “Due to their enormous and widely known value”<br />
<br />
The delays caused by this confusion will result in complete destruction of the wetlands – the impact is multipal internal links into the economy, oceanic dead zones and a collapse in water supplies. Jonathan May, 2k5, U of Baltimore Journal of Environmental Law, “The need for regulation to protect wetlands stems primarily”<br />
<br />
Water shortage results in nuclear extinction. National Assoc. for Scientific and Cultural Appreciation, 2k4 “Water Shortages – only a matter of time” online “According to the latest estimates…water most certainly is!”<br />

<br />
CONTENTION ONE IS THE STATUS QUO<br />
<br />
THE “A” SUB POINT IS THAT AS A RESULT OF THE MORRISON DECISION AND THE STANDARD SET IN THE HOLDING, THE COURTS HAVE ABANDONED THE RATIONAL REVIEW TEST WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS SET THE PARAMETERS FOR EVALUATING CONGRESSIONAL ACTION UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE. INSTEAD THE US V. MORRISON DECISION APPLIED A MORE NARROWLY DEFINED INTERPRETATION REGARDING CONGRESS’ ABILITY TO REGULATE INTERSTATE COMMERCE. THIS NOTION OF “NEW FEDERALISM” HAS AIMED TO INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THE POWER AND AUTONOMY OF THE STATES AND REIGN IN CONGRESSES ABILITY TO ENACT REGULATIONS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE<br />
IRR, 2001<br />
(Melissa IRR, Partner at McGuire Woods, 2K1)<br />

<br />
THE “B” SUB POINT IS THAT THE RAICH DECISION IN 2005 WAS NOT A STEP AWAY FROM THE “NEW FEDERALISM” INSTITUTED BY MORRISON AND LOPEZ. INSTEAD IT WAS A PARALLEL DECISION THAT AIMED AT CLARIFYING THE SCOPE OF THE “INTERSTATE MARKET” AND AN UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT BY THE COURT TO MAKE INTERSTATE REGULATION EFFECTIVE<br />

<br />
<br />
The “c” sub point is that Morrison ushered in a new age of federalism and state power that has gutted the federal government’s regulatory ability<br />
Russell 2003<br />
[Sarah F., Yale Law School, J.D., ARTICLE: COVERING WOMEN AND VIOLENCE: MEDIA TREATMENT OF VAWA'S CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDY, 2003 Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law, 9 Mich. J. Gender &amp; L. 327]cweb<br />
<br />
THE “D” SUB POINT IS THAT UPON EXAMINATION OF THE DECISION IN RAICH, LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE RULING IN RAICH WAS MORE ABOUT THE COURTS DESIRE TO REGULATE MARIJUANA THAN A REVERSAL OF NEW FEDERALISM. ABSENT THIS POLITICALLY CHARGED ISSUE THE COURT WILL RETURN TO PROTECTING THE POWER OF THE STATES<br />

(Glenn H. Reynolds &amp; Brannon P. Denning, What Hath. Raich Wrought? 9 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 915 (2005)CWEB<br />
<br />
THE “E” SUB POINT IS THAT RAICH HAS LEAD TO AN UNPREDICTABILITY AND INCONSISTENCY THAT IS NOw PERMEATING ALL FEDERALISM APPLICATION. THE PLAN IS THE CONSISTENT STANCE THAT IS NEEDED TO RECTIFY THE CURRENT QUAGMIRE. it is not an issue of raich versus morrison it is an issue of a consistent judicial PRECEDENT which the plan provides.<br />

<br />
THE “F” SUB POINT IS THAT AS A RESULT OF THE CONFUSION SURROUNDING THE INCONSISTENCIES IN MORRISON, LOPEZ AND RAICH LOWER COURTS ARE NOW UNCERTAIN AS TO SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE. THIS LACK OF CLARITY HAS LEAD TO LOWER COURTS ISSUING CONTRADICTORY RULINGS. THE PLAN IS THE SINGLE, CONSISTENT PRECEDENT NEEDED IN ORDER RESOLVE THE CHAOS.<br />

<br />
THUS THE PLAN<br />
RESOLVED: THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE U.S. V. MORRISON, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) AND REVERT BACK TO THE PRIOR STANDARD, ORIGINALLY ARTICULATED IN WICKARD V. FILBURN. 317 US 111 (1942), THAT THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AUTHORIZES CONGRESS TO REGULATE WHOLLY INTRASTATE, NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY IF SUCH ACTIVITY, VIEWED IN THE AGGREGATE, WOULD HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON INTERSTATE COMMERCE<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE IS IRAQ<br />
<br />
a.) THE Iraqi govERNMENT IS modeling ITS CONCEPT AND APPLICATION OF regional self-government AND FEDERALISM off of THE UNITED STATES. IRAQ LOOKS TO OUR APPLICATION OF FEDERALISM as a model the status quo united states application of federalism signals a move towards an increase in states rights<br />
Ignatius ’05<br />
Ignatius, David (Staff writer New York Times, A Shiite Leader Supports 'Grand Plan' for Democracy, Friday, August 26, 2005)<br />

(Brubaker, Stanley(PHD Poli Sci, Constitutional Theorist, Prof of Poli Sci at Colgate University, Colgate professor attends constitution conference in Iraq, September 07, 2005) Cappocia<br />
<br />
C.) A STRONG CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IS KEY TO IRAQI STABILITY. IRAQ IS DEBATING A FEDERALISM BILL THAT WOULD DRASTICALLY WEAKEN ITS CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND SPLIT THE COUNTRY INTO POWERFUL AUTONOMOUS REGIONS. THIS COULD FUEL SECTARIAN VIOLENCE AND SPLIT THE NATION APART ALONG RELIGIOUS AND GEOGRAPHICAL DIVIDES.<br />

<br />
D.) IMPACTS:<br />
<br />
SCENARIO ONE: TERRORISM<br />
<br />
A.) IRAQ IS ON THE ROAD TO STABILIZATION AND SECURITY IN THE STATUS QUO. HOWEVER THE BALANCE IS TENUOUS. IF IRAQ WERE TO BECOME UNSTABLE AND LARGE SCALE REGIONAL INFIGHTING WAS TO ENSUE, IRAQ WOULD QUICKLY DISSOLVE INTO CIVIL WAR AND BECOME A BREEDING GROUND FOR TERRORISTS<br />

CONTENTION ONE IS THE STATUS QUO<br />
<br />
THE “A” SUB POINT IS THAT AS A RESULT OF THE MORRISON DECISION AND THE STANDARD SET IN THE HOLDING, THE COURTS HAVE ABANDONED THE RATIONAL REVIEW TEST WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS SET THE PARAMETERS FOR EVALUATING CONGRESSIONAL ACTION UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE. INSTEAD THE US V. MORRISON DECISION APPLIED A MORE NARROWLY DEFINED INTERPRETATION REGARDING CONGRESS’ ABILITY TO REGULATE INTERSTATE COMMERCE. THIS NOTION OF “NEW FEDERALISM” HAS AIMED TO INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THE POWER AND AUTONOMY OF THE STATES AND REIGN IN CONGRESSES ABILITY TO ENACT REGULATIONS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE<br />

<br />
THE “B” SUB POINT IS THAT THE RAICH DECISION IN 2005 WAS NOT A STEP AWAY FROM THE “NEW FEDERALISM” INSTITUTED BY MORRISON AND LOPEZ. INSTEAD IT WAS A PARALLEL DECISION THAT AIMED AT CLARIFYING THE SCOPE OF THE “INTERSTATE MARKET” AND AN UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT BY THE COURT TO MAKE INTERSTATE REGULATION EFFECTIVE<br />

<br />
THE “C” SUB POINT IS THAT MORRISON USHERED IN A NEW AGE OF FEDERALISM AND STATE POWER THAT HAS GUTTED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S REGULATORY ABILITY<br />

[Sarah F., Yale Law School, J.D., ARTICLE: COVERING WOMEN AND VIOLENCE: MEDIA TREATMENT OF VAWA'S CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDY, 2003 Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law, 9 Mich. J. Gender &amp; L. 327]cweb<br />
<br />
THE “D” SUB POINT IS THAT UPON EXAMINATION OF THE DECISION IN RAICH, LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE RULING IN RAICH WAS MORE ABOUT THE COURTS DESIRE TO REGULATE MARIJUANA THAN A REVERSAL OF NEW FEDERALISM. ABSENT THIS POLITICALLY CHARGED ISSUE THE COURT WILL RETURN TO PROTECTING THE POWER OF THE STATES<br />

(Glenn H. Reynolds &amp; Brannon P. Denning, What Hath. Raich Wrought? 9 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 915 (2005)CWEB<br />
<br />
THE “E” SUB POINT IS THAT RAICH HAS LEAD TO AN UNPREDICTABILITY AND INCONSISTENCY THAT IS NOW PERMEATING ALL FEDERALISM APPLICATION. THE PLAN IS THE CONSISTENT STANCE THAT IS NEEDED TO RECTIFY THE CURRENT QUAGMIRE. IT IS NOT AN ISSUE OF RAICH VERSUS MORRISON IT IS AN ISSUE OF A CONSISTENT JUDICIAL PRECEDENT WHICH THE PLAN PROVIDES.<br />

[Law Professors at Tennessee &amp; Samford, Paper Symposium: Federalism After Gonzales V. Raich: Symposium Article: What Hath Raich Wrought? Five Takes, 9 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 915]<br />
<br />
THE “F” SUB POINT IS THAT AS A RESULT OF THE CONFUSION SURROUNDING THE INCONSISTENCIES IN MORRISON, LOPEZ AND RAICH LOWER COURTS ARE NOW UNCERTAIN AS TO SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE. THIS LACK OF CLARITY HAS LEAD TO LOWER COURTS ISSUING CONTRADICTORY RULINGS. THE PLAN IS THE SINGLE, CONSISTENT PRECEDENT NEEDED IN ORDER RESOLVE THE CHAOS.<br />

<br />
THUS THE PLAN<br />
RESOLVED: THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE U.S. V. MORRISON, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) AND REVERT BACK TO THE PRIOR STANDARD, ORIGINALLY ARTICULATED IN WICKARD V. FILBURN. 317 US 111 (1942), THAT THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AUTHORIZES CONGRESS TO REGULATE WHOLLY INTRASTATE, NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY IF SUCH ACTIVITY, VIEWED IN THE AGGREGATE, WOULD HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON INTERSTATE COMMERCE<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE IS IRAQ<br />
<br />
A.) THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT IS MODELING ITS CONCEPT AND APPLICATION OF REGIONAL SELF-GOVERNMENT AND FEDERALISM OFF OF THE UNITED STATES. IRAQ LOOKS TO OUR APPLICATION OF FEDERALISM AS A MODEL THE STATUS QUO UNITED STATES APPLICATION OF FEDERALISM SIGNALS A MOVE TOWARDS AN INCREASE IN STATES RIGHTS<br />

Ignatius, David (Staff writer New York Times, A Shiite Leader Supports 'Grand Plan' for Democracy, Friday, August 26, 2005)<br />

<br />
C.) A STRONG CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IS KEY TO IRAQI STABILITY. IRAQ IS DEBATING A FEDERALISM BILL THAT WOULD DRASTICALLY WEAKEN ITS CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND SPLIT THE COUNTRY INTO POWERFUL AUTONOMOUS REGIONS. THIS COULD FUEL SECTARIAN VIOLENCE AND SPLIT THE NATION APART ALONG RELIGIOUS AND GEOGRAPHICAL DIVIDES.<br />

<br />
D.) IMPACTS:<br />
<br />
SCENARIO ONE: TERRORISM<br />
<br />
A.) IRAQ IS ON THE ROAD TO STABILIZATION AND SECURITY IN THE STATUS QUO. HOWEVER THE BALANCE IS TENUOUS. IF IRAQ WERE TO BECOME UNSTABLE AND LARGE SCALE REGIONAL INFIGHTING WAS TO ENSUE, IRAQ WOULD QUICKLY DISSOLVE INTO CIVIL WAR AND BECOME A BREEDING GROUND FOR TERRORISTS<br />

B.) A DIVIDED AND UNSTABLE IRAQ WOULD CREATE THE PERFECT CONDITIONS TO FUEL WORLDWIDE TERRORISM<br />

<br />
C.) A FIRST RESPONSE IS CRITICAL TO RESPONDING TO AND DETERRING TERRORIST ATTACKS – UNFORTUNATELY, MORRISON’S COMMERCE CLAUSE DEFINITION PRECLUDES FEDERAL AND STATE INTEGRATION WHICH IS CRITICAL TO MITIGATING THE IMPACT<br />

E.) REVERSING THE COMMERCE CLAUSE JURISPRUDENCE HANDED DOWN IN MORRISON IS VITAL TO CONGRESS’ CONFIDENCE TO PASS NECESSARY LEGISLATION TO THWART TERRORIST THREATS. THE PLAN ALLOWS FOR CONGRESS TO PASS A CENTRALIZED READINESS INITIATIVE WHICH IS KEY<br />
