Our investigation traces multiple paths, finds different treads but it is our goal to ask a simple question: Why do we drink milk? We find traces of milk’s seeming perfection in the billions of little white boxes shipped each year to every public school in the country. It is not simply the moment that they hit students trays that they interact with the body but rather milk is represented at the level of the body. It does the body good after all. A 2007 report by the Notional Academy of Science notes that the majority of school age children do not receive enough calcium and many other nutrients of which milk is a main provider.<br />
<br />
This view is not new but rather marks one of the primary impetuses for the belief in milk’s pure white goodness. Clement Dukes M.D. in his authoritative 1899 text called “The Essentials of School Diet” writes:<br />
4. Milk- Milk is the grand type of all diets consisting as it does … their staple diet.<br />
<br />
With this belief in milk’s overriding purity comes it’s necessary underside – milk begins to demarcate good people from bad, the strong from the weak.<br />
<br />
A National Dairy Council representative wrote in the 20’s:<br />
&quot;The people who have achieved, who have become large, strong, vigorous people, who have reduced their infant mortality, who have the best trades in the world, who have an appreciation for art, literature and music, who are progressive in science and every activity of the human intellect are the people who have used liberal amounts of milk and its products.&quot;<br />
<br />
It only takes a few years for these demarcations become even more explicit. A 1933 history of New York agriculture asserted, &quot;A casual look at the races of people seems to show that those using much milk are the strongest physically and mentally, and the most enduring peoples of the world. Of all races, the Aryans seem have been the heaviest drinkers of milk and the greatest users of butter and cheese, a fact that may in part account for the quick and high development of this division of human beings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Modern proponents of milk would never dare to assert such a thing of course. And yet there is such an acceptance of milk’s perfection no one ever sees a need to offer any other drink. Even among progressive activists for socialized school breakfast there is a unquestioning acceptance of this fact. A 1987 report entitled “Fuel for Excellence” back by two prominent senators outlines a strategy for increasing school breakfast expansion based on a month long meal plan – the only drink offered as every meal? Milk.<br />
<br />
This seems innocent enough of course unless one takes into account that almost 90 percent of African American and “and most Latinos, Asians, and Southern Europeans lack the genes necessary to digest lactose, the primary sugar in milk.”<br />
<br />
These government subsidies for milk through the school lunch program lead to a reverse movement – one bent on the demonization and downfall of milk. Shanti Rangwani writes in an 2001 article entitled “White Poison”:<br />
<br />
Got milk? If not, …discard the moo juice.<br />
<br />
This scientific condemnation of milk is perhaps ironic then considering good science is precisely the way milk invaded the National School Lunch program. Susan Levine explains in her 2008 book School Lunch Politics:<br />
<br />
If school lunch politics hinge on … essential for growth.<br />
<br />
So why is it that we drink milk – because, in a word, it is perfection. Oscillating from a drink of pure white health to a disease carrying colonialism, the story of milk has always been told as one of good or evil. In order to tell the story of milk within this resolution we must take a different path and first question the storytellers themselves. We must employ a new method of analysis not to fill in the politics of milk with predetermined prescriptions but to make such politics possible in the first place. Thus we tell a story neither of triumph nor downfall as a final gesture against the progress narrative embedded within milk. Melanie Dupuis writes:<br />
(“Nature’s perfect food: How Milk became America’s Drink By E. Melanie Dupuis New York university Press. pg. 3-14)<br />
<br />
“Do we need to drink milk? Could we do …<br />
<br />
Advocacy: We believe the ballot represents an endorsement of our genealogical investigation of milk subsidies.<br />
<br />
Our project must remain specific and without transcendental attachment – our goal is play local truths against one another to create a radical political rupture in the narrative of milk’s purity<br />
May (Professor of Philosophy at Clemson University) 95<br />
(Todd, Between Genealogy and Epistemology, pg. 100)<br />
<br />
Our study of milk is incomplete as always – We must investigate without any end point to rupture the self-evident history of those cute little cartons on every lunch tray. In this way genealogy proceeds<br />
