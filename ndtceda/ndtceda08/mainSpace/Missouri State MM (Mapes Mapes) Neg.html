<br />
The affirmative working off historical guilt is an inextricable part of their project- and it is a work that odes not acknowledge its broader social function. To keep history at work for us, facts, laws, individuals, all these concepts circulating condense into the moment of the plan as an opening onto a utopian vision of the future. It is precisely this conviction that the progressive narrative of constitutional evolution will lead to emancipation that constitutes the potential for fascism to remanifest.<br />
Hamacher ’96 “Modernism/Modernity” 3.1 1996<br />
“Of all that has worked toward… readiness for it, survives.”<br />
<br />
The aff creates the law as a tamer of our desires. We become invested in the law as the site of our pleasures and enjoyments. We must continually manage ou dissatisfaction by sacrificing ourselves to the law. The aff is based on sacrifice and prohibition to institutions for the greater good.<br />
Zupancic 2003 (Alenka, “The Shortest Shadow,” p 50-53)<br />
“With the term “ascetic ideal”… “religious” thinking.<br />
<br />
The affirmative sets up a regulative framework in which constitutional due process violations are expressedly forbidden. This prohibitive symbol of “thou shall not violate the constitution” provides the basis for pathological evil. This framework allows individuals to be relieved the burden of ethical decision making.<br />
Schroeder and Carlson, California Law Review, March 2000<br />
“Man cannot sustain diabolical evil… functioning of the symbolic order.”<br />
<br />
This denial of the role individual desire plays in structuring cements the current order and negates a true discussion of how the good can be discovered.<br />

This action asks you to give up entirely. It forces you to accept the horror that our lives may be for nothing- it is the acceptance that we cannot save ourselves no anyone else. It’s the equivalent of standing before a firing squad and demanding death. It is a refusal to beg for mercy. This places us ina n entirely new political landscape and allows us to redefine our existence. (Zupancic 2000 Ethics of the Real 10-11)<br />

Women are not given the choice—in most cases it is subject to coercion. Women should not have a right to kill their babies—they legitimize this decision through ignorance and being uninformed about the outcomes of the abortion<br />

Overruling a supreme court decision represents a negative action, a punitive sanction aimed at restructuring the way psychology and consciousness is related to the law. This combination of law and psychology inhibits a much needed reorientation around the globe. The affirmative will argue that their case is a unique instance in which reform solves,but this view rites violence onto individuals, mandates the production of criminals, and is independently unethical because it sacrifices relationship in the name of political expediency. Exposing false consciousness of the affirmative is prior to its enactment.<br />

“Well-,meaning efforts.. mystification of legitimacy.”<br />

The 1AC’s reliance on generosity and extension of legal rights results in total comination and control. Self-hatred is internalized resulting in the impetus of violence and war by devastating alliance-building.<br />

“Malcolm identified two… of the entire group.”<br />
<br />
The affirmative argument that the political is not the focus of the 1ac is the premise of our whole argument. Their belief thath the political must remain in the background in order to generate change is the ultimate ethical sell-out.—admits their ethical posture is insufficient to create change. Only taking a leap of faith via the alternative solve sthe aff.<br />
Thurschwell ‘3 24 Cardozo L Rev 1193<br />
“Thus, as Derrida puts is… resembles pure faith.”<br />
<br />
There is no rule of law. The idea that the court precedent can create an improved world resultis in the destruction of the self and creares a dangerous form of ordering. Our kritik is a demand to resist the call to law as ethics. Only the denial of this call can avoid domination. The admission of rights allows them to be destructed.<br />

Victims and violence are not the only productws of our increasingly traumatic modern world. Indeed, the process of speaking out and speaking against the sources of violence may very well be he defining theme of our age. These discussions, however, continually circulate toward the discussion of particular institutional practices and their mediation of our relationships. The Aff poses question of ethics only insofar as it relates to the domain of politics. Tying ethical reorientation of ourselves wiht the reorientaiton of our collective political spheres takes precedence and in the process produces these ethics and our relaitonship with others merely as a background for political transformations. The aff makes the question not how much we can change ourselves but instead how we can change our institutions to change ourselves. This process produces mediated relationship that maeks genuine ehical engagement makes impossible Zupancic 00 ETHICS OF THE REAL: Kant and Lacan, pp. 10=11 , March 2000 &quot;In other words, one cannot attain the realm of the ethical. . . faculty of desire as a priori.&quot;<br />
<br />
affirmative focus on the material conditions that create oppression and suffering presupposes that we are inherently alienated from each by these conditions. this forecloses all possibility of ethical relationships to ohers not mediated by violence Oliver 01 Hypatia, 16.3 (2001). &quot;Martin Jay in his comprehensive study of vision. . . light, air, and touch in vision&quot;<br />
<br />
the impact to the affirmative's conception of ethics is the imposition of violence ordering upon the globe. Oliver 01, Hypatia 16.3 (2001) The Lacanian gaze is not the look of another person or another subject . . . do not recognize that makes recognition possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
our problem with liberal notion of justice is genealogy of evil emaciated bodies. Cheapen life. Language of moral wrong seemingly reject all ethical ideology. Abstract suffering Cooppression demonic figures bureaucracy enables us to persevere<br />
aff use of legal reasoning and instuttions of argument are in and of themselves violent. Second, the affirmaive use of pressure and depictions of violence are in and of themselves violent.

Our perception of the world does not come to us innocently from the mere facts of events. Instead, something we call the real mediates this perception. The real is not the reality lurking beneath representation of the world, but instead an excess or lack introduced in the very act of representation, and indeed the very act of forming the social order. Our society lurches forward from crisis to crisis: communities in decline, poverty, nuclear weapons, environmental destruction, etc., each time implicitly believing that each crisis is a historically specific situation that requires some minor corrective course of action. This perspective misidentifies the real as a historically specific situation rather than a feature inherent in the social edifice itself. Lurking beneath every fantasy of peace, stability, and resolution is a threat of disorder and chaos. Catastrophe always hovers; such is the nature of our being.<br />
Zizek 04, conversations with Zizek, p. 78-79<br />
“Here I would agree … inherent, self-blockade.”<br />
<br />
In order to protect ourselves psychologically from the traumatic effects of this ever-present Real, we have all acquiesced to the spell of ideology. Ideology works by constructing a fantasy of reality in which it is possible to overcome the inevitable crises generated by the Real. As a result, we have entered into a cycle of distance and proximity to the Real in which we wait anxiously until catastrophe confronts us as “on the brink,” and then we take some small corrective measure thereby deferring our reconciliation with catastrophe until the next time the threat emerges. This process of constant deferral prevents us from ever fundamentally reordering the world, and instead moves us toward a new world order which selectively constitutes groups of people to eliminate as barriers and risks rather than recognizing the intrinisically risky nature of the entire subjective venture.<br />

The affirmative attempts at reform will fail. They are not radical enough to remain caught in the coordinates of the current system and stuck in the constraints of capitalism.<br />
Zizek 99 (The Ticklish Subject, p. 71-2)<br />
“In States of injury, Wendy … is the ultimate Oedipal myth…”<br />
<br />
The Alternative is an absolute withdrawal from the plan – this negative gesture wipes the slate clear of the real which is a precursor to any positive gesture. This acknowledgement is key to opening the absolute contraction of subjectivity.<br />
