<br />
In the early 1990s…in cotton production.<br />
<br />
<br />
The US is the only WTO member with a significant role in the global cotton market<br />
Sumner, 06 (Daniel A., professor in the department of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis, Reducing Cotton Subsidies: The DDA Cotton Initiative in Agricultural Trade Reform &amp; The Doha Development Agenda, p. 272)<br />

The absence of a consensus…ranks of the militants.<br />
