<strong>An ideology of separation inheres in both the form and content of modern policy debate. The form of debate – an educational activity, mirrors the content of this year’s resolution – agricultural policy. The ideology that provides the hidden link between our activity and our topic of study positions the human a cultural being, capable of separating itself from the world in which it dwells. The need to separate crop from earth equally produces the need to separate adult from child.</strong><br />

<strong>The process of separation obscures the ways in which we as debaters experience the phenomena of agriculture. This causes us ignore that modern policy debate and industrial agriculture are two faces of the same biopolitical apparatus. Industrialized agriculture separates the food consumer from the process of food production. University communications programs try to pump out tomorrow’s information laborers. In both institutions, the goal is the mediation of life through capitalist modes of production.</strong><br />

<strong>Separation or sacrifice is the process by which things are removed from their free use by humanity. Universal separation is the dream of modern capitalism – the capture of all human activities into a system of mediated exchange. We are witnessing the process of absolute commodification, not only of subsidized farm products, but of all aspects of our lives. Politics has become a spectacle of competing images, divorced from our experience. One by one, the things that let us give value to our lives are all withdrawing into the museum space of modernity. The museum represents the impossibility of profaning that which has been made sacred, the inability to find new use or experience outside of the empty march of human progress.</strong><br />

<strong>The Museum space of the university seeks to develop effective producers and consumers. This task of cultural development could also be described as the task of turning children into adults by teaching them how to turn ghosts into ancestors. In our progress from living being to speaking being, we are taught to exorcize the alienated phantoms of death and disorder, the remainders of signification that our society cannot deal with. It is of little surprise that debate, an activity primarily concerned with cultivating skilled communicators, is one that always attempts to manage negativity. This year, our museum is filled with ghosts – the American farmer, as antiquated as the plow in the Kansas wheatfield, the cows and chickens whose remains lie scattered over feedlots in Texas, the impoverished third world farmer. All these ghosts haunt our discussion of farm subsidies, yet our desire for separation treats them as abstract, knowable problems that must be resolved by a rational, detached subject. When we lose our ability to have a playful or symbolic experience with life, death either overwhelms us to the point of destroying us or we lose our ability to find meaning in death, consigning us to nihilism.</strong><br />

 <strong>Political engagements in the capitalist society of spectacle are treated as separate from experience. Politics, like everything in a museum, is separate from our experience of life itself. Debating as detached, alienated policymakers ignores the ways in which our immediate experience contributes to societal control and violent domination. This perpetuates racism sexism and warfare.</strong><br />

<strong>If the sacred is that which is removed from common use, our political response must be that of profanation. To profane is to return that which is sacred to the free and common use of humanity.</strong><br />
<strong>If we are to approach the topic in a meaningful, life affirming way, we must wrest the resolution away from the apparatuses of power that negate our experience by orienting us around a false notion of progress. Capitalist alienation operates by putting things to work, by preserving the sacred economic order. We choose to look for a new use for the resolution, a profane experience of what it means to affirm the topic.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>We affirm the resolution through the act of play. Play happens when any sacred object is used towards profane ends, as an object of fancy and negligence. Like a cat who replaces a ball of yarn for the mouse, or a child playing with an old religious relic, we engage in the form of debate’s political ritual without any of its sacred intent. We refuse to cast a decision on the resolution’s relationship to spectacular political events. We see in the debate game’s call for affirmative role playing a chance for playful symbolic inversion. When confronted with the metaphor of the state as community decision making, we respond with an equally metaphorical investigation of how our community experiences agriculture. We, who are supposed to role play as policymakers, choose to confront the way that we personally subsidize agriculture. The Online Etymology Dictionary tells us that to subsidize means “</strong><strong>to buy neutrality or alliance”</strong><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. *<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=SUBSIDIZE&amp;searchmode=none" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=SUBSIDIZE&amp;searchmode=none</a> </span></strong><br />
<strong>Affirming the resolution through the act of play is a way of ending our neutrality towards the system of alienated commodity exchange that constitutes the reality of modern industrial agriculture.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In play we find the life affirming happiness that is cast out by separation.</strong><br />

<strong>Giorgio Agamben, <u>Profanations,</u> 74-76,</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Confronting the aporia of subsidies with simple yes/no policy solutions only reifies the commodified market exchange of policy works in which life becomes subject to political management. The result is biopolitical control and terminal policy failure</strong><br />

<br />
Not unique in the realm of those machines,<br />
I dream and become, through affectation –<br />
the anagram of this great nation,<br />
acting-out towards those places, races, and faces I know nothing about. <br />
Yet I will to spout pontifications<br />
about these objects<br />
in relation to each and other,<br />
without father or mother – cloned sisters and brothers. <br />
Connected at the hip with a vice-d grip on land mass,<br />
and the masses that pass through the crystal automata<br />
chaining politics to the slick which flows in connection<br />
to the reflection I disperse as the diamond… <br />
Signaling the hearse<br />
with mere annunciation of fatality in strategy,<br />
directing this an-other machine<br />
without intelligence from elsewhere… <br />
To spare towards the corpse of a system<br />
whose only function could be (re)production<br />
of the production it automatically produces –<br />
itself without apparent desire or will to tire  <br />
<br />
…day in and day out … <br />
<br />
As it complicit-ly commits itself to the suicide<br />
of its own drive,<br />
seduced into taking a ride,<br />
apparently subjective and subjectively apparent… <br />
Without ability to hide behind that which<br />
since its own a-sexual inception<br />
symbolically lied and denied pride<br />
from bubbling up and erupting into the realm of the Real. <br />
Breaking symbolic law,<br />
and revealing the position of this position<br />
which became caught up<br />
in intuition, screaming, yelling and selling essence for infinite presence.  <br />
As in the death in Samarkand<br />
the crystal always gets its revenge –<br />
you thought you had the best of me…<br />
well played sir. <br />
In the attempt to sidestep destiny<br />
it caused that ray of light<br />
to put lil’ half dead<br />
in the sight of the hearse driver… <br />
one day away from his scheduled pick up date<br />
for the remains of the man whose body was to perspire and life retire.  <br />
Yet, at this very moment another ray shot out,<br />
or possibly the same refracted,<br />
blinded and distracted<br />
he stumbled into the middle of the street… <br />
Unable to retreat<br />
from death a day early under the wheels<br />
of that same carriage he was to float above<br />
the next day on his way to his eternal resting place. <br />
<strong>II</strong> <br />
I shall say it again: “I want to be a machine”. <br />
I “have found the formula of maximum snobbery here”<a name="_ednref2"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol-5_2/v5-2-jeff-roberts_alex-mcvey.html#_edn2" rel="nofollow">2</a><br />
My only will is to decline my will<br />
and the initial shall never be heard<br />
for it is never spoken.  <br />
Nothing which is spoken is ever what is truly said<a name="_ednref3"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol-5_2/v5-2-jeff-roberts_alex-mcvey.html#_edn3" rel="nofollow">3</a><br />
we attempt to speak “of” a resolution<br />
in the creation of a plan<br />
or position symbolically representing a pose struck by that resolution… <br />
Enframed in its finality,<br />
a production of the resolution<br />
which is more real than real,<br />
more good than good, more true than truth itself.  <br />
Today we have lost our shadows<br />
“we live in a culture which strives<br />
to return to each of us<br />
full responsibility for his own life”.<a name="_ednref4"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol-5_2/v5-2-jeff-roberts_alex-mcvey.html#_edn4" rel="nofollow">4</a>    <br />
These symbolic portraits of a resolution<br />
arise from the position of the subject<br />
who authentically speaks a bidding of the good<br />
believed to be bound up in the resolution itself.  <br />
The most thought provoking thing,<br />
in our thought provoking society,<br />
is that we are still not thinking,<a name="_ednref5"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol-5_2/v5-2-jeff-roberts_alex-mcvey.html#_edn5" rel="nofollow">5</a><br />
and thinking evil we are most certainly not, as we dare not even speak it.  <br />
“The greatest trick the devil ever pulled<br />
was convincing the world he didn’t exist”<a name="_ednref6"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol-5_2/v5-2-jeff-roberts_alex-mcvey.html#_edn6" rel="nofollow">6</a>    <br />
<strong>III</strong> <br />
And so be it,<br />
we no longer think<br />
evil… nor do we speak it.  <br />
“Smart went crazy,<br />
Truth went trendy,”<a name="_ednref7"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol-5_2/v5-2-jeff-roberts_alex-mcvey.html#_edn7" rel="nofollow">7</a><br />
and debate… went Banal.  <br />
<strong>IV</strong> <br />
We can only speak<br />
from the position<br />
of the authentic subject<br />
striving to escape this bitter world with representations of a better one.  <br />
We participate in a form of bad consciousness,<br />
one which denies thinking evil,<br />
in denying that we are all complicit…<br />
With everything that happens to us, be it misfortune or death.  <br />
We seek to produce meaning everywhere,<br />
using a given resolution as a springboard<br />
to derive meaning of all worldly events,<br />
to chain us to the singularity, of our own subjectivity…  <br />
To halt us,<br />
from <em>becoming</em><br />
other…<br />
to even ourselves. <br />
Where did evil go?<br />
A minstrel said:<br />
Where the cold winds blow,<br />
in the pines.<a name="_ednref8"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol-5_2/v5-2-jeff-roberts_alex-mcvey.html#_edn8" rel="nofollow">8</a>   <br />
<strong>V</strong> <br />
Cast off in exile or annihilation<br />
self immolation or personal deprivation,<br />
deposited in the bottom of a prophylactic<br />
on a ship setting sail upon the sewers of modernity. <br />
Sterilized, whitewashed<br />
and tossed out by liberationists<br />
who can’t face the defacement<br />
of their given space within the sacred community soon to be erased. <br />
Rules without impunity<br />
by those weak souls<br />
fearing<br />
their own lack of immunity. <br />
Silence has set in<br />
but evil refuses to go<br />
gentile into that good night<br />
in a society where it is no longer possible to speak it.  <br />
Evil has metamorphosed<br />
into all the viral<br />
terroristic forms<br />
that obsess us.  <br />
<strong>VI</strong> <br />
Cosmetic surgery<br />
cannot purge<br />
the accursed share<br />
without the consequence of catastrophe. <br />
The management of blasphemy<br />
with hyperbolic positivity<br />
can only hope the ink dries<br />
on the death warrant it signed before the reaper calls “time”. <br />
<strong>VII</strong> <br />
“I want to be a machine”  <br />
I want to be<br />
an object…<br />
I want to be<br />
the resolution.  <br />
This is my affirmation,<br />
of the resolution as it is<br />
the evil form of the resolution…<br />
an affirmation that comes about only through a fatal strategy of thinking evil.  <br />
An affirmation from<br />
a position of affectation,<br />
“that affective state<br />
in which one becomes aware of the artificiality of one’s own condition… <br />
In this state<br />
we create a kind of artificial double…<br />
an artificial shadow into which we enter –<br />
an artificial automaton produced from our own essence… <br />
The means,<br />
in short,<br />
to externalize ourselves,<br />
thanks to signs, as <em>other”<a name="_ednref9"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol-5_2/v5-2-jeff-roberts_alex-mcvey.html#_edn9" rel="nofollow">9</a>   – as the resolution itself.</em>  <br />
My affirmation<br />
of the resolution<br />
is meaningless<br />
and therefore it participates in the very form and Intelligence of Evil. <br />
Acknowledging that we are great enough<br />
for our own Evil genius,<br />
that there is nothing that happens to me that I am not an agent of, nor anything that I am fully responsible for. <br />
<strong>VIII</strong> <br />
Affected<br />
and completely seduced<br />
by the resolution at hand<br />
there is no demand for it to strike a specific pose… <br />
To reveal<br />
all it knows of the world<br />
and the world to be<br />
no thinglyness revealed in prose or plain clothes… <br />
As the thing itself<br />
holds the essence<br />
of our subjectivity concealed<br />
externalized behind this sign… <br />
Of the resolutional thing<br />
lies the acute awareness<br />
of my position in submission<br />
to the world at large. <br />
I consume it all,<br />
embracing my individual and systematic downfall<br />
without spite<br />
or the psychoanalytic plight to locate kernels of identity hidden from sight.  <br />
Inauthentic<br />
and without power,<br />
all forms of external alienation<br />
become devoured as I complicit-ly divert my agency towards dis-alienation. <br />
Allowing me…<br />
to be free …<br />
from both my life and death<br />
in one breath. <br />
By assigning himself, as a unique machine, to the realm of machines and machine-made objects, by employing just a touch more simulation and artificiality, Warhol out-maneuvers the very machinations of this system. Whereas an ordinary machine produces objects, Warhol produces the object’s secret aim – which is to be reproduced. He reproduces the object complete with its ultra-purpose, cloaked in the secret non-sense that emanates from the very process of object-generation. Where others seek to add a little soul, Warhol adds a little more machinery. Where others seek a little more meaning, he seeks a little more artifice. Less and less himself, more and more affected, he reaches the machine’s magical core by reproducing the world in all its trite exactness. Less and less the subject of desire – closer and closer to the nothingness of the object.”<a name="_ednref10"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol-5_2/v5-2-jeff-roberts_alex-mcvey.html#_edn10" rel="nofollow">10</a>   <br />
