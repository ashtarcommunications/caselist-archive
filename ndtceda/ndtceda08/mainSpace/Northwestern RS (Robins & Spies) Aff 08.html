<strong>Repairing US-Syrian relations is key to de-escalation and medium-term progress in a Golan swap. Israel and Syria have a deal ready to go – only Us pressure tanks peaceful resolution</strong><br />

<strong>Holding onto the Golan’s postponing the inevitable --- worsens Israeli security and sparks wars</strong><br />

<u>Syria’s main interest …Lebanon <strong>are inevitable</strong></u><strong>.</strong><br />

The Key To Peace Is The Golan Heights…<strong><u>called the Golan Heights</u></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Constructive US engagement with Syria en route to a Golan settlement’s the only way to prevent all scenarios for Mideast escalation --- offering a quid pro quo through engagement solves better than deterrence</strong><br />

For a number of years…40-year stalemate<br />
<br />
<strong>An immediate comprehensive deal fails and causes a coup --- limited CBMs lead to full normalization over time. Military to military contacts over Iraqi border crossing is the best place to start the process of Syrian normalization and create momentum an ongoing process.</strong><br />

<u>To break the impasse …intelligence on Iran.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>Constructive engagement must begin with the verifiable benchmark of anti-terrorism co-operation on the Iraqi border, which can then proceed to Golan brokering</strong><br />
