<u>chapter 1: reclaiming responsibliity</u><br />
<br />
“affected ignorance” is the refusal to acknowledge our personal role in atrocities. through strategic ignorance, oppressive practices become naturalized—CAFOS ARE a prime example—BILLIONS OF ANIMALS SUFFER IN THE NAME OF PROFIT AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY. WE ARE NOT MERE BYSTANDERS; WE ARE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS WHO ALLOW carefully calculate these decisions<br />

subsidies are tax dollars TRANSFERRED FROM OUR BANK ACCOUNTS TO INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE, NOTHING SHORT OF VIOLENCE BEING CONDUCTED in our names. sitting silently while we fuel oppression NATURALIZES the dominant ideology<br />

These comments have not …plant a few seeds.<br />
<br />
complicity makes the oppressive institutional ideology hegemonic—it constrains the parameters of legitimate discussion or political activity and closes off latitude for thinking and making possible a new world<br />
<strong>Jackman 1994</strong>—Mary, The Velvet Glove: Paternalism and Conflict in Gender, Class, and Race Relations, Ch. 2<br />
Implicit Power and Ideology<br />
<u>The institutionalization of expropriative … clumsy basis for durable social control.</u><br />
<br />
SUBSIDIES ARE THE CRITICAL INTERNAL LINK TO ALL OF OUR IMPACTS—LEAVING COMPLICITY INTACT INSULATES THE STATE FROM RESISTANCE BECAUSE WE ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO A VIOLENT WAY OF THINKING THAT USES PRIVILEGE<br />
<strong>Sturgeon</strong> <strong>2001</strong>—Noël, Associate Professor and Chair of Women ’s Studies at Washington State University, Privilege, Nonviolence, and Security, Women and Environment 52/53<br />
<u>At what price is …<strong>And we must succeed.&quot;</strong></u><br />
<br />
THIS LEGITIMATING IDEOLOGY TURNS ANIMAL GENOCIDE INTO A FORM OF POLITICAL CURRENCY VALUABLE FOR HUMAN ENDS<br />

unchecked, economic ideology becomes genocidal and culminates in nuclear war, ecocide, and extinction—plan solves through demystification<br />

In his book &quot;The Nazi …<u>destruction to continue unopposed.</u><br />
<br />
TURN THE DOMINANT IDEOLOGY AGAINST ITSELF—refusing to remain complicit in animal oppression renders visible daily violence and inspires an active citizenry that will not sit idly while massacres are committed in their names<br />
<strong>Nibert 2003</strong>—David, associate professor of sociology at Wittenburg University, Animal Rights, Human Rights: Entanglements of Liberation and Oppression, p. 253-254<br />
<u>The opportunities and …and economic democracy.</u><br />
<br />
oppressions of all kinds are invariably connected and linked by this economically efficient mindset—refusing to participate in hierarchical social relations is a precursor to all kinds of liberation across the board<br />

Voting aff is a refusal to participate in this instrumental way of thinking that makes mass slaughter seem rational and desirable—disalign your self with a version of politics that collapses into instrumentality and totalitarian control over life<br />
<strong>Duarte 2005</strong>—Andre Duarte, Professor of Philosophy at the Universidade Federal do Parana, 4/27/2005, Biopolitics and the Dissemination of Violence, Hannah Arendt Institute, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hannaharendt.net/research/biopolitics.html" rel="nofollow">http://hannaharendt.net/research/biopolitics.html</a><br />

<br />
thus, rahul and i demand: the united states federal government should eliminate the united states federal government’s domestic subsidies for concentrated animal feeding operations.<br />
<br />
<u>CHAPTER 3: THE SCOPE OF ethical RESPONSIBILITY</u><br />
<br />
this debate is about re-negotiating our political identities with the state—subsidization allows violence to be conducted on our behalfs in the name of the dominant, agricultural, economic ideology—we must reclaim politics to make possible a way of existing otherwise<br />
<strong>Fox 2008</strong>—April, M.W., Associate Prof. of Psychology, Washington University, <em>Agriculture, Biotechnology, Bioethics, and the Global FDA Agriculture</em>, Keynote Lecture, 2nd Mediterranean Conference on Organic Agriculture in Croatia, Organic Agriculture – Contribution to Sustainable Ecosystem<br />
The late President of the United States, …Healthcare for the good of all. <br />
<br />
restructuring our personal role in animal politics requires a radical resequencing of our priorities—putting the other before the self makes possible a new form of politics that doesn’t collapse into marginalizing difference<br />

Yet, I wonder, <u>why …</u> the Other's expression can become a teaching. <br />

CONTENTION 1: BLOOD MONEY<br />
<br />
&quot;AFFECTED IGNORANCE&quot; IS THE REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE ONE'S COMPLICITY IN<br />
ONGOING ATROCITIES. WHEN THESE ATROCITIES ARE COMMITTED IN OUR NAMES<br />
AND ON OUR BEHALFS, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RESISTANCE BECOMES EVEN MORE<br />
IMPORTANT. THROUGH USE OF CONVENTIONAL, SOCIETAL RATIONALIZATIONS AND<br />
STRATEGIC IGNORANCE, OPPRESSIVE PRACTICES CAN BE EASILY NATURALIZED.<br />
CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS ARE THE PRIME EXAMPLE OF THIS<br />
POLITICAL APATHY—BILLIONS OF ANIMALS SUFFER AND ARE SLAUGHTERED EVERY<br />
YEAR IN THE NAME OF PROFIT AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY. AS ACTIVE<br />
PARTICIPANTS IN THE FARMING DEPENDENT CULTURE, WE ARE NOT MERE<br />
BYSTANDERS; WE ARE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS WHO ALLOW THESE ATROCITIES TO<br />
BE CONDUCTED FOR OUR OWN SELFISH INTERESTS. THIS COMPLICITY IS NOT<br />
NAIVITY, IT IS A CAREFULLY CALCULATED DECISION WHICH ALLOWS MASSIVE<br />
WAVES OF VIOLENCE TO SPREAD UNABATED<br />

College, Affected Ignorance and Animal Suffering: Why Our Failure to<br />
Debate Factory Farming Puts Us at Moral Risk, Journal of Agriculture<br />
and Environmental Ethics, Volume 21, No. 4<br />
<br />
RUTHLESS AGRICULTURE IS NOT A NATURAL OR INEVITABLE BYPRODUCT OF<br />
MARKET FORCES. ON THE CONTRARY, SUBSIDIES ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR<br />
THE GROWTH AND NATURALIZATION OF SUCH A VIOLENT INDUSTRY.<br />
Nibert 2003—David, associate professor of sociology at Wittenburg<br />
University, Animal Rights, Human Rights: Entanglements of Liberation<br />
and Oppression, p.174-177<br />
<br />
WHLE IT MAY BE THE STATE WHICH ACTUALLY PROVIDES THE SUBSIDIES, WE ARE<br />
ALL INDIVIDUALLY COMPLICIT. SITTING BY SILENTLY AND ALLOWING OUR TAX<br />
MONEY TO SPONSOR THE VAST OPPRESSION OF ANIMALS FOR OUR OWN SELFISH<br />
INTERESTS IS NOT NEUTRALITY, IT FORMS THE BASIS OF PUBLIC ACQUIESCENCE<br />
AND CONSENT. ANIMAL PAIN IS SO WIDESPREAD AND SEVERE THAT NO AMOUNT OF<br />
IMPACT CALCULUS CAN JUSTIFY INACTION<br />
Singer 2002—Peter, Ira W. De Camp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton<br />
University, Animal Liberation, p. 9-17<br />
<br />
SUBSIDIES ARE TAX DOLLARS TRANSFERRED FROM OUR BANK ACCOUNTS TO<br />
INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE. SO, REALLY, SUBSIDIES ARE NOTHING SHORT OF<br />
VIOLENCE BEING CONDUCTED ON OUR BEHALFS<br />

<br />
WE HAVE A CATEGORICAL AND PRIOR RESPONSIBILITY TO REJECT THIS<br />
PARTICULAR FORM OF SUFFERING. ONCE YOU'VE PUT ASIDE PRESUMPTUOUS<br />
NOTIONS OF INTRINSIC HUMAN SUPERIORITY, ENDING SUPPORT FOR CAFO'S<br />
BECOMES THE CLEAR FIRST PRIORITY<br />
Singer 2002—Peter, Ira W. De Camp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton<br />
University, Animal Liberation, p. 219-221<br />
<br />
SITTING IDLY WHILE OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE FILTERED INTO VIOLENT FACTORY<br />
FARMING INDUSTRY IS THE ULTIMATE FORM OF COMPLICITY—THERE IS NO<br />
WORKING WITHIN THE SYSTEM: SUPPORT ANIMAL MURDER OR ACTIVELY DISAVOW<br />
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH IT<br />

DO NOT ALLOW YOUR BALLOT TO CONTINUE THE TRADE OF ANIMAL SUFFERING AS<br />
A FORM OF POLITICAL CURRENCY<br />

<br />
THUS, RAHUL AND I DEMAND: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD<br />
ELIMINATE ITS DOMESTIC SUBSIDIES FOR CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING<br />
OPERATIONS.<br />
<br />
RESTRUCTURING OUR PERSONAL ROLE IN ANIMAL POLITICS REQUIRES A RADICAL<br />
RESEQUENCING OF OUR PRIORITIES—PUTTING THE OTHER BEFORE THE SELF MAKES<br />
POSSIBLE A NEW FORM OF POLITICS THAT DOESN'T COLLAPSE INTO<br />
MARGINALIZING DIFFERENCE<br />

<br />
REFUSING TO REMAIN COMPLICIT IN ANIMAL OPPRESSION RENDERS VISIBLE<br />
DAILY VIOLENCE AND INSPIRES AN ACTIVE CITIZENRY THAT WILL NOT SIT IDLY<br />
WHILE MASSACRES ARE COMMITTED IN THEIR NAMES<br />
Nibert 2003—David, associate professor of sociology at Wittenburg<br />
University, Animal Rights, Human Rights: Entanglements of Liberation<br />
and Oppression, p. 253-254<br />
<br />
OPPRESSIONS OF ALL KINDS ARE INVARIABLY CONNECTED AND LINKED BY THIS<br />
ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT MINDSET—REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE IN HIERARCHICAL<br />
SOCIAL RELATIONS IS A PRECURSOR TO ALL KINDS OF LIBERATION ACROSS THE<br />
BOARD<br />
