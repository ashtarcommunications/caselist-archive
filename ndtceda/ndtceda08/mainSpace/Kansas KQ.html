Contention One – The Struggle to Stop Time<br />
<br />
The US has been steadily marching its way towards the End of History, that point on its line of time where peace and democracy rules the world. Iran stands as a contradiction on this long march – it puts at stake power relations at a global level. The drive to confront Iran is rooted in the desire to close the book on History, to prove that the future we desire has already arrived.<br />

After watching … yes to justice.<br />

This form of politics allows all violence to be justified in our drive to reach our desired future – makes facism inevitable<br />

The quest to eradicate the Evil from the smooth progression of history inevitably creates<br />
this security against the sign of Evil reduces the subject to a condition where all relations are based on hate<br />

The stubborn question of security,…relation to the world.<br />
<br />
Thus this conflict with Iran, with modernity, with the End of History is infinitely deferred. Thus we must engage in a diplomacy without end. This unconditional yet private sharing of desires, pain and sympathy is only way to manage the current war and remain open to the only true possibilities for peace<br />

Plan: The United States federal government should offer a guarantee to the Islamic Republic of Iran that the United States will not attempt to democratize Iran militarily.<br />

Contention Two: Openess to Time Itself<br />
<br />
Every decision we make will be violent in that it we always exclude someone, something. The ghosts of those excluded will always come back to haunt us and spoil the best laid plans. A vote affirmative is no different. No matter how hard we try, we cannot be the Messiahs that usher in a new world. Accepting the plan will not get you a world of peace, it may not even bring peace with Iran. The Islamic Republic may say no, the neocons may swoop in and mess everything up. Every problem is haunted by these same possibilities – of violent response by another, by the possibility of failure, of being co-opted by others. All these anxieties come from the same impossible desire to pre-comprehend the limits of the Event. The question the Affirmative poses is this: Do we accept the ghosts and let ourselves bring them into expression by refusing to pre-comprehend the future or do we accept a politics that poses ourselves as the Messiah calling-forth the End of History.<br />
<br />
The plan does not occur and then fade away. The plan is not a finite, limited event but an ever emerging possibility. The anxiety and even frustration that we feel by refusing to bracket an event with the “what comes next” is the very nature of ethics. We can only conceive of an ethical politics when the future is open not closed.<br />

Derrida also has reservations about … No response. We throw the dice and wait.<br />
<br />
This all may seem debilitating and scary. The drive to be timely is a powerful one, they tell you not to guess wrong or anticipate to late. This politics where every decision is made in the nick of time can never come to terms with time as anything but linear. It cannot come to terms with Events that do not simply begin and end but instead effect with the future and the past. Understanding and accepting these ghostly events is a prerequisite to addressing all global problems.<br />
<br />
It may seem that this politics is indifferent to those it attempts to help – it may seem that the we are ruling the reactions of Iran, Israel, the US and others outside the bounds of our content but only in marking an openness to the future can will begin to make ghosts a part of our lives and gain an understanding that breaks the chain of timely failures.<br />

From Isaac's point of view … as a problem.
