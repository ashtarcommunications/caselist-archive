<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The affirmative fundamentally misunderstands the way ideology works. The capitalist base of society lays the conditions for its oppressive ideological superstructure. Their focus on racial politics completely inverts these base-superstructure relations and makes the absurd assumption that racism is its own root cause, divorced from the social totality. This creates an artifical distinction between black alienation and the alienation of labor, destroying class unity. The affirmative’s project occludes a much more radical project—the revolutionary project to overcome capitalism and its exploitation of all of humanity. This is the only way to solve racism, for racial inequality is the inevitable result of a capitalist social structure based on the reproduction of hierarchy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></strong><br />
