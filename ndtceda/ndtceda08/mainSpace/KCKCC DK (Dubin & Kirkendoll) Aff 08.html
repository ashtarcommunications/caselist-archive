GSU Pre-Tournamnet Disclosure<br />
Melvin Kirkendoll &amp; Anthony Dubin:<br />
<br />
Observation I:<br />
The U.S. Claims about Middle Eastern Society are merely mirrors in which we reflect our own thoughts<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p.82)<br />
In addition?and manipulation.<br />
<br />
Our own threat based positivism creates the threat and results in a self-fulfilling prophecy<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 77)<br />
U.S. lethality?is obligatory.<br />
<br />
The enemy image is so deeply rooted in policy that even laws regarding Middle Eastern civil rights have been effected<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 50)<br />
The HITLit?s?part unexposed.<br />
<br />
The enemy image shapes and justifies anti-Middle Eastern policies<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 48)<br />
The HITLit consists?and William Kristol<br />
<br />
They use this enemy image to make justified action seem like terrorist action<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 48)<br />
The essentialist terrorist?intellectualized propaganda<br />
<br />
The U.S. oversimplifications of Middle Easterners ignores the current climate and further creates the enemy image<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 62<br />
In discussing?academic circles<br />
<br />
The over-inclusiveness that religious terrorists are accused of is the mirror. The U.S. is reflecting its over-simplification and over inclusiveness onto them<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 62)<br />
Despite his focus?prone to violence<br />
<br />
The representations create an us vs. them dichotomy which demonizes Middle Easterners - The limited exposure in the debate round and the coverage of the media results in the perceived threat<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 67)<br />
The essentialist terrorist is designed?the logic of violence<br />
<br />
Plan Text<br />
Therefore we stand resolved that the governmental agency known as the United States Federal Government should break with its current anti-Middle Eastern dominated politics and engage in constructive engagement without the construction of an enemy image with the Middle Eastern countries.<br />
<br />
Observation II:<br />
A. Our framework - representations are meaning<br />
<br />
Representations matter to policy - Action follows metaphor - Our epistemological view translates into a framework for how policies are shaped and guided<br />
Saperstein 97 (Alvin, Complexity, Global politics and National Security, (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndu.edu/inss/books%20-%201998/Complexity,%20Global%20Politics%20and%20Nat?l%20Sec%20-%20Sept%2098/ch05.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndu.edu/inss/books%20-%201998/Complexity,%20Global%20Politics%20and%20Nat?l%20Sec%20-%20Sept%2098/ch05.html</a>, acc. 9/17)<br />
The role of the?the available metaphors<br />
<br />
AND B?Our framework argument is interactive with language - and your speech act creates a unique moment of representational meaning that remains behind as we transmit text orally<br />
Shin 96 (Un-Chol, E. Ky. Univ, ?Teaching Literature for ethical Intelligence and Ethical responsibility,? Proceedings of Conference on Values in Higher Education, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.utk.edu/%7Eunistudy/ethics96/ucs.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.utk.edu/~unistudy/ethics96/ucs.html</a>)<br />
The primary condition?to understand itself<br />
<br />
Observation III:<br />
The U.S. is locked into a cycle of using past events to explain future ones - a framework which can never function<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 55)<br />
The implications?it believable psychoanalysis.<br />
<br />
The racist way in which we define Middle Easterners is the same that was used for slavery<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 86)<br />
Essentialist terrorism?civilizes the rest.<br />
<br />
The U.S.?s enemy image is used to create a threat. The image is based on positivist assumption and denys the obvious about current action<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 53)<br />
To the contrary,?invite Muslims to embrace<br />
<br />
The enemy image the U.S. pushes = genocide<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 50)<br />
The HITLit?s conjectures?is in their being<br />
<br />
And interpersonally our otherization destroys relationships we have as we reproduce the logic of the status quo and destroy the other<br />
Santos 93 (Boaventura de Sousa Santos, Dir. Of the Center for Social Studies at the Unvi. Of Coimbra, (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html" rel="nofollow">http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html</a>), Bad Subjects, Issue #63, April)<br />
This political logic?machine of horror and destruction<br />
<br />
Hostile representations shape policy - Policymakers do not reflect critically and buy into deionization which causes enemy imagery<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 68)<br />
President Bush?innocent way of life<br />
<br />
Exceptionalism has seeping deep into the public consciousness thus creating the enemy image<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 72)<br />
Political speeches?on the defensive.<br />
<br />
The threat based language being used is designed to heard the masses. This provokes actions which lock us into a self-fulfilling prophecy. We must break the cycle or we are doomed to repetition<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 63)<br />
Stern?s?highly purposeful.<br />
<br />
The mindset can be altered and new pragmatic views can emerge<br />
Liaquat Ali Khan 2006 (The Essentialist Terrorist, p. 85)<br />
A few select?to drive cars.
