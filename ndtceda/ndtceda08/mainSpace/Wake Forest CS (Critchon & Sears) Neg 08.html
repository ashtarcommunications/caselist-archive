<h3 id="toc3"><a name="x-Topicality-Include topicality"></a>Include topicality</h3>
 <br />
(A) Interpretation:<br />
<br />
“Include” means “consists of,” excluding anything other than security guarantees and foreign assistance<br />
Justice Carley, November 28, 2006, Certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Georgia, 275 Ga. App. 189, Majority Decision in Berryhill v. Georgia Community Support And Solutions, Inc, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gasupreme.us/pdf/s06g0038.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gasupreme.us/pdf/s06g0038.pdf</a><br />
Ms. Berryhill argues that the word “includes” … supra (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary (5 ed. 1979)).<br />
<br />
(C) Prefer our interpretation:<br />
<br />
1. Limits: “Constructive engagement” is a vague term and allows the aff to add almost any foreign policy change into the plan. “Include must be a limiting term. Extra-topicality is also a voting issue: severing makes it a no-cost option and we shouldn’t have to CP from the start.<br />
<br />
2. Precision: “Include” has evolved into an exact and restrictive term, both in the law and foreign policy, making ours the only predictable and educational interpretation.<br />
<br />
3. Grammar: the use of “include” to modify a more general term indicates it is a definition of that term. Grammar is the only predictable way to read the resolution in context.<br />
Justice Carley, November 28, 2006, Certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Georgia, 275 Ga. App. 189, Majority Decision in Berryhill v.

include Look up include at Dictionary.com<br />
1402, from L. includere &quot;to shut in, enclose, insert,&quot; from in- &quot;in&quot; + claudere &quot;to shut&quot; (see close (v.)). The alleged Sam Goldwyn-ism, &quot;Include me out,&quot; is attested from 1937.<br />

A) Uniqueness—a coalition led by Gates and Rice is preventing the military option against Iran, and the only chance the neocons have to recover to to criticize Rice, if Cheney and his wing regain support, Bush will strike Iran<br />

<br />
After this meeting, Bush immediately tilted away…President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.<br />
<br />
B) *Link/Internal—Rice is particularly vulnerable now—Rice’s ability hold the reins on Middle East policy away from Cheney stems from her ability to stay out of controversial fights—that means avoiding implementing anything similar to the ISG proposals—the Plan forces her to take a large compromising diplomatic lead, which makes her a lightning rod for criticism, pushing Bush back to Cheney and the neoconservatives<strong>*<br />

Syria's failure to prevent Sunni fighters … improve Iraq's internal stability.<br />
<br />
Doubt their evidence – it’s from neocons trying to displace blame for Iraq failures. Syria’s no more than 5% of the insurgency<br />
Raymond Hinnebusch, University of St. Andrews, September 2005 (Defying the Hegemon: Syria and the Iraq War, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mafhoum.com/press9/251P57.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.mafhoum.com/press9/251P57.htm)</a><br />
