Experience K<br />
What happened to sexism in debate after the DCA bios? Who knows? While there was a large cathartic response by the community as a whole, once hostilities had dissipated there was lamost no discussion of the problem generally. Perhaps all the talk over the DCA bios people largely forgot the forest for the trees.<br />
<br />
Our argument in this debate is that because the DCA bios’ discussion of sexism centered around a particularized instance of sexism rather than a broader discussion of sexism generally it became possible to forget the incident afterward. The same is true for the affirmative, the 1AC’s treliance on personal experience (i.e. Lindsay’s feelings about the DCA) as a justification for their political ends ultimately undermines their project. We isolate three different disads to their methodological appeal to personal experience of sexism in debate.<br />
<br />
A – Monolithic scripts<br />
This presentation of a particularized experience ultimately shapes the relations of production of knowledge. Their presentation of personal experience actively shapes consciousness and creates a totalizing meta-narrative.<br />
Experience actively unifes – when the experience isp resented by one indivudal we come to know that as the experience of all like individuals – and then it excdlues realms of human activity that do not fit within the totalizing script of experience within the social – specifically, the implicit assumption with the 1ac’s conclusion tis that those who do not experience oppression in the way descrbied by the 1ac don’t’ really experience oppression. In other words, we come to know Lindsy’s experience of sexism in debate as how all sexism in debate transpires.<br />
<br />
Using one particular identity experience as the category for analysis only magnifies these issues – it excludes whole realms of experience. The absolute authority of the experience nullifies all other experiences.<br />
Joan Scott ’92 [Joan W.;” “Experience”; Feminists Theorize the political; ed Judith butler and joan scott p30]<br />
And yet in his use of it….themselves in their foremothers<br />
<br />
And this exclusion of alternate experiences was apparent in the criticism of the DCA bios. In the discussion of oppression not a single person of color either spoke or was discussed. There was no discussion of how being a woman of color created a different experience. There was aalso a bias towards discussion of hetersexual oppression. For instance only one post raised the question of heterosexuality, largely only to point out that there was no discussion<br />
Abelkop ‘6 [Garret Scott Abelkop at msu.edu [edebate] women &amp; gossip – my thoughts Sun may 14 2006]<br />
Do not get me wrong: men are ridiculed too….sexual endeavors Garrett<br />
<br />
And even if the affirmative’s statement of purpose is to address all oppressions, their presentations of a particularized experience excludes that possibility and we have an external impact – prioritizing personal experience as part of the 1ac’s intellectual methodology denies those who should guide politics and harms progressive political strategies. Their particular strategy is part of a larger discrourse in which a constant failure occurs at capturing agency within politics.<br />
Craig Ireland ‘2 “The appeal to experience and its consequences: Variations on a persistent thompsonian theme”; Cultural Critique 52 (2002) 86-107<br />
Once an arcane philosophical term….for ‘working class’” (Scott, 786).<br />
<br />
C Personalized debates about marginalization encourage therapeutic reformism instead of revolutionary political stances. Debate should remain a stimulated activity related to the resolution. Only community solutiosn can address issues of structural and intitional barriers. Zompetti2k4 Contemporary Argumentation and debate “Personalizing debate”<br />
As such the problems….more lofty efforts<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to affirm the position of the affirmative but only after criticizing their celebration of testimony and experience. Even if their project is productive their reliance on experience as justification turns the case – refusal to give into the revolutionary tourism of the 1ac is key. Such criticism is crucial for developing a pedagogy that does not cloak exploitation in terms of solidarity.<br />
Rey Chow ’98 Ethics After Idealism p 12-13<br />
For the practitioners of cultural studies….intellectual climate.<br />
<br />
Ending the fiew of women of all colors as victims is key to prevent further essentialism of women and supremistit male thinking. To truly combat patriarchy we must stop looking at our commonality as victims but as something else.<br />
Angela Harris 1990 Stanford Law Review<br />
Finally, black women….own self-defintions<br />
<br />
Attempts to solve that lack an intersectional analysis are doomed to fail<br />
Bell Hooks 94 – Feminist Theory from Margin to Center p 39<br />
Individuals who fight….own radical work<br />
<br />
The 1ac is also a moment for those who have been rendered invisible or silent within oppression to speak. The process of making visible fills in the silence with a monologue masquerading as critical dialogue. Stepping in as a witness is a form of complicity that emphasizes visibility and simultaneously renders invisible those not included within experience.<br />
Chow ’93 37-38 (above)<br />
<br />
This turns the case – the metapheor of visibility or freeing from silence that tries to share the experience of the oppressed prevents a deeper analysis of the working of repressive systems. By illuminating difference without examination of social structures the traditional mechanism of authoritarian power are left untouched.<br />

The Passion K 1NC<br />
The affirmative’s use of the Courts as a starting point for social emancipation elevates the law to a status of metaphysical faith ­ creation of judicial precedents to enable social action propagates the law as divine ­ much like the practices of scriptural exegesis the affirmative cobbles together court precedents and pieces of evidence ­ jurisprudence much like religion organizes subjects into a blind faith, believing the law will yield some radical change while simultaneously becoming more deeply indoctrinated in it<br />
*Smith ’99* [Steven D. (Robert and Marion Short Professor, Notre Dame Law School); “Believing Like a Lawyer”; Boston College Law Review; 40 B.C. L. Rev 1041; September; l/n nick]<br />
The apparent commitment to faith in …-- runs through the heart of twentieth-century jurisprudence.<br />
<br />
And their legislating of values through law review articles which prescribe what the court /must/ do enchants us and propagates the implicit presumption that more law is always more good. This model of legal thinking posits rationality and agency behind each legal action in the past ­ in other words we attach particular mindful agency to each case we overrule thereby blaming a decision and not the strategy of using the law for social change ­ its an obsession that sanitizes history which prevents us from viewing other possibilities for understanding. Such a continual legitimization of the law and the courts posit utmost authority in it<br />
*Schlag ’98* [Pierre (Nicholas Rosenbaum Professor, University of Colorado School of Law); _The Enchantment of Reason_; Duke University Press; p. 117-119 <em>nick]<br />
Legal thinkers and actors strive to put reason and rationality …turn, consists largely of justifying the activity described in the previous sentence.<br />
<br />
And the affirmatives faith in the legal system as a stating point for social change is founded on authoritarian ideals of nihilism, submission and stagnation in which the individual is constrained and bound by the external authority of the law. Such uncritical embrace of this ordering of things subordinates oneself to the God like authority of the judicial system, constantly praying for social change while simultaneously detaching oneself from agency to do anything<br />
*West ’89* [Robin (Professor of Law, University of Maryland; Visiting Research Scholar, Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy, College Park, Maryland); “Book Review Exchange: Law, Literature, And The Celebration Of Authority”; Northwestern University Law Review; 83 Nw. U.L. Rev. 977; Summer; l/n</em> nick]<br />
<br />
Using Law and Literature as evidence, I …any particular virtue, but solely because they are authoritative.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>And this binding by the law also leads to an uncritical acceptance of authoritarianism that justifies the worse abuses of authority because we seek to please authority by carrying out their commands ­ such authoritarianism both is the cause for much of the brutal abuses and harms described by the 1AC and is comparatively worse than all other violence ­ it’s the most sever form of authoritarianism imaginable<br />
*Henderson ’91* [Lynne (Professor of Law, Indiana University School of Law at Bloomington); “Authoritarianism and the Rule of Law”; Indiana Law Journal; 66 Ind. L.J. 379; Spring; l/n</strong> <em>nick]<br />
The argument for uncritical …Romanian regime of Ceausecu. 73 &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.lexis-nexis.com/universe/document?_m=a1397ba3bf41b06447f14078d66c4e71&amp;_docnum=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlz-zSkVA&amp;_md5=48f6819f7f58ff398291dbd3b920dc0d#n73n73" rel="nofollow">http://web.lexis-nexis.com/universe/document?_m=a1397ba3bf41b06447f14078d66c4e71&amp;_docnum=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlz-zSkVA&amp;_md5=48f6819f7f58ff398291dbd3b920dc0d#n73#n73</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to stop attending the Church of judicial reason and social change. The critical project must move in a new direction ­ faith in the Court as a starting point for change in our society just reinforces authoritarian values and prevents anything from really happening ­ instead we should lose our faith in the Courts to do anything and instead take our power and resources and mobilize existing or future avenues for social change that do not rely on the Court as the starting point. Becoming a legal atheist doesn’t end in nihilistic deconstruction, rather it empowers people to more effectively create change.<br />
*Kennedy ’97* [Duncan (Professor of Law at Harvard); _A Critique of Adjudication: fin de siecle_; p. 311-312</em> nick]<br />
*And a desanctification of the law erodes the authoritarian quality of its setting ­ emancipatory possibilities for rights victories exist outside the legal strategy and can create change in ways legal arguments cannot ­ the more we reject the blind belief in the law and take control of the means of social change the closer we can get to real change **Gabel ’84* [Peter (Professor of Law, New College of California School of Law); “A Critique Of Rights: The Phenomenology of Rights-Consciousness and the Pact of the Withdrawn Selves”; Texas Law Review; 62 Tex. L. Rev. 1563; May; l/n <em>nick]<br />
Because the emancipatory …heart turned outward that the law in us requires.<br />
Lastly, we must move beyond a social theory that assumes criticism must and can immediately translate action ­ their analysis precludes localized circumstances in which transformation of society can occur ­ what is most problematic about the legal strategy for change in the way in which it blueprints emancipation ­ such demands for blueprinting prevents both productive kritik of the legal system and stifles alternate methods of change ­ even if strategies outside the court are not currently vibrant, it is our obsession with blueprints that render them impotent ­ we need to look for connections with people not the law<br />
*Tushnet ’84* [Mark (Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center); “A CRITIQUE OF RIGHTS: An Essay on Rights.”; Texas Law Review; 62 Tex. L. Rev. 1363; May; l/n</em> nick]<br />

*Agamben ‘2* [Giorgio (Professor of philosophy at the Collège International de Philosophie in Paris and at the University of Verona in Italy); “Security and Terror”; Theory and Event; Vol. 5, Issue 4; ProjectMuse nick]<br />
Today we are facing extreme and most dangerous developments of this paradigm of security...they are irreconcilable with democracy.<br />
B. And the creation of a permanent state of emergency from a security paradigm has become the sole form of legitimization for biopolitical power— however the more we promote security the more vulnerable we become ­ attempts to maintain it ends in a worldwide civil war<br />
*Enns 2004* [Diane (Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto); “Bare Life and the Occupied Body”; Theory &amp; Event; Vol. 7 Issue 3; ProjectMuse nick]<br />
In 1940 Walter Benjamin wrote: &quot;...maintaining a state of emergency.<br />
C. And this biopolitical project makes the worst form of racism and genocide possible ­ it is the ultimate eugenic project justifying the extermination of entire populations ­ a continuation down this path will only culminate in nuclear and biochemical extinction ­ it our attempts to secure against threats through biopolitics means we will end up destroying all life<br />

Consider again the con...population and the exercise of sovereignty. ...functioning of the modern state (232).....<br />

D. VOTE NEGATIVE TO REFUSE THE AFFIRMATIVE AS AN INSTANCE OF THE VIOLENT LOGIC OF SECURITY, AND EMBRACE THE TRAGIC, OR OUR OWN VULNERABILITY WITHIN THE WORLD<br />
1. Refusal creates an important space in which security can be changed into a point of criticism of the law and violence ­ this strategy asserts agency and moves beyond security through transgression , creating a life not founded on violence<br />
*Burke ‘2* [Anthony (School of Political Science and International Studies, University of Queensland); Alternatives 27</em> nick]<br />
It is perhaps easy to ...shimmering possi­bilities might be.<br />
2. Instead of constantly securing the self against threats, we should reject the affirmative as recognition that all of us are vulnerable and insecure—this recognition restores value to life allowing us to love and exist with others despite out flaws<br />
*Dillon ’96* [Michael (University of Lancaster); Politics of Security; p. 137-8// nick]<br />
THE TRAGIC<br />
The tragic is neither the aestheticisation of the political, ...truly been elsewhere because there is no escape from where we are at.<br />
