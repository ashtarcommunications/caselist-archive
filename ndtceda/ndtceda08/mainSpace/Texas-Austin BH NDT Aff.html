We are a pedagogy of interruption – our affirmative interrupts the institutional site of debate through our a) advocacy of impossibility and b) shattering of normative understandings of affirmation.  Beauregard, 2008 [“The End of Canadian Studies, Guy Beauregard, National Tsing Hua University / University of Toronto, <span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://film.ncu.edu.tw/canada2008/discourse.asp" rel="nofollow">http://film.ncu.edu.tw/canada2008/discourse.asp</a></span>]   <br />
First - the negative is only a performative reconfiguration of a particular part of the social – the authentic act relies on a reconfiguration of the entire socio-symbolic field. Zizek, 1997 [Slavoj, “From “Passionate Attachment” to “Dis-Identification”]<br />
Second – Only Lacanian psychoanalysis allows us to undermine our attachments to the norms of the status quo – traversing the fantasy is the act of undermining the fantasy which supports a subjects being, allowing for modes of being outside of the status quo. This is the only authentic act.  Zizek, 1997 [Slavoj, “From “Passionate Attachment” to “Dis-Identification”] <br />
The affirmative is a pre-requisite to the alternative: rascism and sexism represent attempts to account for the ‘jouissance’ the Other has ‘stolen’ from us. Through traversing the fantasy the subject realizes that there is no Other responsible for their dissatisfaction, making sexism impossible.  Sinthome, 2006 [Larval Subjects The Beyond of Fantasy 15 November 2006 <span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://larval-subjects.blogspot.com/2006/11/beyond-of-fantasy.html" rel="nofollow">http://larval-subjects.blogspot.com/2006/11/beyond-of-fantasy.html</a></span>] <br />
Only be refusing to accept the present choices offered by ideology can we achieve an authentic act. Refusing to function within the limits prescribed by the status quo is the only way to break fre from the controlling logic of that ideology, thus achieving what is presently constructed as imposible. McGowan, 2007 [Todd, Assoc. Prof of English @ Univ. of Vermont, The Real Gaze: Film Theory After Lacan, p. 175-178]<br />
Their attempt to snatch a little power from the Master is part and parcel of the very structure which maintains oppressive economies of power, and not the way to actualize structural change.  Zizek, 1997 [Slavoj, Institute for Social Sciences at the University of Ljuljana, The Plague of Fantasies, 32-34]<br />

 Their demand for causality and grand international relations theory ignores the tactical and everyday nature of resistance in realm of dailyness. By calling into question fixed notions of truth, values can be changed at the local level, thereby facilitating deep and lasting change<br />

Cont 1 – Imagination Land<br />
<br />
Modern pltcl struggles are vested in ideology, that which constitutes what is perceived as an objective reality. Such constructions aren’t grounded in benevolence, but rather ultimately produce images of catastrophic circumstances which are used as little more than political blackmail, we fear to deviate from the modern paradigm because such a threat to deviate is instantly met with threats fo the ultimate catastrophe. Tus, ideology thrives upon a myth of wholeness – reality would fit together right again if we only removed the “threatening force” that stole our enjoyment. The ruse is that there s no whole to be found, no space with which our constant deferral with the inevitability of catastrophe can produce anything but control – Iraq proves.<br />
<br />
Daly 04 (Glyn, Risking the Impossible)<br />
<br />
And, we have entered a realm of debate like political world daly describes. Calls for eradication of problems at all costs have displaced meaningful, authentic discourse.<br />
<br />
The starting point of traditional polityc production is complicit with ideology of politics forcing the debate around instrumental desirability imposes mastery, control and violence in to the realm of politics. This replaces debate and plurality with absolutes and totalitarianism. Do not grnat this framework a neutral stance.<br />
<br />

Ruhle, 07 (Michael, “implications ofa nuclear iran”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dtt-net.com/en/index.php?page=preview-article&amp;article=3003" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtt-net.com/en/index.php?page=preview-article&amp;article=3003</a>)<br />

<br />
And to wake up is to traverse the fantasy of stability. Our aff is not the rev nor a literal act of self destruction. Ideolgogy may push us continuously towards a fantasmi and idealized end, but this control is not absolute, nor fantasy inevitable.<br />
<br />
Dark city depicts murdoch’s pusuit of the fantasy of shellbaugh, an image of future satisfaction and an escape from the dreary surroundings which constitutes his social reality. However, when Murdoch finally arrives at shell beach, he realizes that his image of ultimate enjoyment was nothing more than a tattered poster on a wall, a torn an dincomplete version of that which he chases.<br />
<br />
By collapsing the distance between ourselves and the fantasy through the imaginative function of fiat we short circuit its operation. Traversing the fantasy is key to political engagement as no authentic politcs can exsit without it.<br />
<br />
Mcgowan, 04 (“Lacan and contemporary film”, “fighting our fantasies,” pp.160-169)<br />
<br />
Finally, the bush doctrine has become the penultimate ideology of the modern era. The official doctrine, not ulniek the police in Minority Report, attempts to instill the atuhroity for the United States to arrest assumed criminals before they have a chance to commit their crime, portraying any potential contesting nation as irrational and susceptible to control via preemptive strikes or any other requisite means. It is only through confronting the horror of catastrophe that we can break free from this form of symbolic authority. So long as we constantly defer our confrontation with the inevitability of catastrophe we are forced to live within the shackled confines of the permanent threat of catastrophe. Zizek points out that this is a life not worth living.<br />

Harvard: K of Using catastrophic images of fantasy in order to traverse it, creates fear which causes violence. Alt = hope.<br />
<br />
Traversing the fantasy comes from within the discursive limits of the institutions themselves.<br />

The very fact they don’t have nukes makes it more likely that they’ll get them – creates a threat according to Bush<br />
<br />
The Guardian 12-10-07 (“So Iran’s not a nuclear threat anymore? All the more reason for Bush to unleash Armageddon” L/N)<br />
<br />
We control ideological uniqueness – GOP sees Iran as a threat.<br />

logic of hope is bad =&gt; same ideology of the status quo because we don't allow for resistance to oppression now<br />

McGowan 4<br />
<br />
Hope is based on eliminating problems and recreates the same problems - this externalization = root of ideological violence<br />
