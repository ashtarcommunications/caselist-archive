Ethanol Subsidies drive food prices.<br />
Aditya Chakrabortty, economics leader writer for the Guardian, 7/4/08 Secret report: biofuel caused food crisis, guardian<br />
Biofuels have forced global food prices up….while doing nothing to tackle climate change<br />
Subsidizing overproduction of corn risk epic price hikes on all global food commodities.<br />
Henry I. Miller, MS, MD research fellow @ Hoover Institution, 2008, hoover digest, Running on Empty. </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/13871832.html" rel="nofollow">__www.hoover.org/publications/ digest/13871832.html__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br />
In the short and medium term….U.S. corn yields by 30 percent.<br />
Mandate ensures increased production, ensuring unsustainable price hikes<br />

Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies @ Heritage Foundation, 5-2-08, Ethanol and Other Biofules: A Global Warming Solution Worse than the Problem </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/EnergyandEnvironment/wm1912.cfm" rel="nofollow">__www.heritage.org/Research/ EnergyandEnvironment/wm1912. cfm__</a><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">America’s first mandatory policy…more trouble than they are worth.<br />
These price hikes ensure a vicious cycle of market distortions that escalate to food shortages and political instability<br />
C.Ford Runge, Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Applied Economics and Law at the U of Minnesota and Benjamin Senauer, Prof of Applied Economics @ U of Minn, 5-28-08, foreign affairs, How Ethanol Fuels the Food Crisis<br />
In the year since the publication….purses of the world’s poor.<br />
Burning food for fuel must be universally rejected in the face of starvation<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">AT Nommo<br />
Turn—Homogonezation. They presume Nommo interrupts white supremacy because it grew out of resistance. It papers over other views in African American culture. When you assume a language only exresses resistance, it prevents dialectic to change those ideas.<br />
John H. Mcclendon II, Bates College Journal of Speculative Philosophy, Vol. 18, No. 4, 2004. P. 308-9<br />
Additionally, the function….support via vindicationism.<br />
Homogenized Nommo can’t address white supremacy<br />
Lynn Clarke, Dept of Comms Studies and Theatre, Vandy university, Journal of Speculative Philophy, Vol. 18, No. 4, 2004, p. 321-2<br />
The question of Nommo’s compass…white Americans, and others.<br />
Its preaching to the choir: little transformative potential<br />
Clarke 4<br />
Returning to the question….their present and future.<br />
Nommo isn’t a round winner. They don’t win for using it. Claiming it does leaves no space for dissent or deliberation<br />
Clarke 4<br />
Notwithstanding the importance….in the shadow of creative power.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Turn—opens space for white hegemony<br />
Shannon Sullivan, Penn State University, Journal of Speculative Philosophy, Vol. 18, No. 4, 2004, p. 302<br />
This point was brought…necessarily deliberately) produces.<br />
Turn—Appropriation<br />
Sullivan 4<br />
While a white/Anglo person’s….to understand and speak them.<br />
Will crack the code<br />
Sullivan 4<br />
Although he ultimately wants….domination is eliminated<br />
Turn—Ontological expansiveness<br />
Sullivan 4<br />
Letting white people into…they choose to enter.<br />
Their second Yancy card is proof they backfire<br />
Clarke 4<br />
Together, the question of Nommo’s creative compass…deferred until a time yet to be named.</span><br />
