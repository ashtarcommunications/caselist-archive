Observation One: The Status Quo<br />
Despite massive export growth and potential federal dairy support remains locked in the past, these dairy subsidies undercut the dairy industry and block trade.<br />

<br />
Global nuclear war.<br />
Zalmay Khalilzad, RAND Defense Analyst, Spring 1995, The Washington Quarterly, p. 84 <br />
Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because a world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts. Finally, U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.<br />
<br />
Advantage _ Dairy Industry<br />
<br />
Dairy subsidies undermine the industry we outline three scenarios<br />
<br />
A. Price volatility.<br />
Federal dairy supports create price “floors” which increase price volatility.<br />

<br />
Price variation arises from changes ….meals away from home (Jackson-Smith and Barham, 2000).<br />

<br />
The first is that it is far too early … cutting interest rates.<br />
<br />
The impact is global nuclear war.<br />
Bearden, 2000. [Tom, Ph.D., Nuclear Engineering]<br />
<br />
Just prior to the terrible collapse of the World economy, with the crumbling well underway and rising, it is inevitable that some of the weapons of mass destruction will be used by one or more nations on others. An interesting result then—as all the old strategic studies used to show—is that everyone will fire everything as fast as possible against their perceived enemies. The reason is simple: When the mass destruction weapons are unleashed at all, the only chance a nation has to survive is to desperately try to destroy its perceived enemies before they destroy it. So there will erupt a spasmodic unleashing of the long range missiles, nuclear arsenals, and biological warfare arsenals of the nations as they feel the economic collapse, poverty, death, misery, etc. a bit earlier. The ensuing holocaust is certain to immediately draw in the major nations also, and literally a hell on earth will result. <br />
