Afghanistan is near anarchy<br />

The sovereignty of anarchy cannot be denied, as afghanistan continues to revert back to its true identity<br />

Afghanistan is slipping into anarchy<br />

Only an anarcho-Islam can solve for the dangerous and oppressive excesses of the Islamists<br />

<br />
Western media sources are easily subverted by the military - the framing of national security news from Afghanistan is carefully managed to sanitize the violence of the US colonial presence. The vast majority of media exposure is incredibly propagandistic and misleading - the systematic destruction of the people unnoticed<br />

<br />
The USFG effort to sustain a Neo-Liberal global order requires the construction of a stable Afghan State - such efforts at state building thwart the bubbling forth of an indigenous anarcho-islamic communities and syndicates<br />

<br />
Islami is inherently anarcho in character - and only anarchy can help restore Islam's ability to solve oppression, racism, and authoritarianism<br />

<br />
We must work to solidify the anarchist tendencies of non-state society in the Middle East and create a third camp which can solve for sexism, racism, colonialism, and endless wars<br />

ADVOCACY<br />
Micah and I ask you to endorse our ongoing efforts to support Anarcholist-Islam, like RAWA (Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan) by enggaing in ontological resistance to the neo-liberal state colonization of the peoples and nations which comprise the geopolitical space demarked as &quot;Afghanistan&quot;. We reserve the right to clarify intent.<br />
<br />
We should align ourselves with RAWA and provide assistance, but resist their call for political inclusion in the governing apparatus - only RAWA's exclusion will spark the anarchist rebellion that will collapse the oppressive and colonial STATE of Afghanistan<br />

FRAMEWORK (There is a lot of of this that they did not give me)<br />
The Spirit and Body are on in the matter of determining information,, which is for our own pleasure and happiness. We wish to align ourselves with pagan values to information to avoid crucifying the body, and to learn the language of the body.<br />

Weighing Mechanism<br />
<br />
We believe that the ballot should serve as a way to afford our intellectual project credibility in the debate community. Signing the ballot then, requires only that you endorse our argument as a good idea. We believe that over the course of time, as a critic and participant, you have likely developed your own internal calculi concerning the evaluation of arguments. Instead of trying to control your jurisdiction, we would hope to appeal to this internal calculus. After all, this is why we have mutual preference systems. Only by direct experience, can we come to know one another, and we seek out these relationships instead of having blind faith in the traditional mechanics of debate. Sadly, the terminal impact of using such rigid systems of framing means we prefer to embrace ignorance just because the facts can be used like poison gas. Bey 2001 elaborates on this point, claiming ultimately, that this remains a question of choosing happiness over nihilism.<br />
Framework A2 fairness<br />
<br />
First on fairness. There is absolutely no way there would be a topical affirmative that would solve our case. The resolution requiring us to role play as the government is antithetical to our position of anarchy. What preserves debate is that we have stuff to say.<br />
<br />
And, In any case, debate is not supposed to be fair. If we win our impacts, fairness is moot, our shit is real, theirs is fake. If we ruin debate that's okay because our impacts outweigh. No external impact to preserving debate.<br />
<br />
And, limiting out certain forms of debate in the name of fairness is in fact less fair then allowing us to run this argument, it also denies us personal advocacy within the round by limiting out what we would truly advocate within this debate.<br />
<br />
And, fairness is incredibly arbitrary. What is fair? Back in the day, disads and counter plans were considered unfair by the debate community. Fairness shifts over time, it’s fluid. Splitting the block, speed, and even performance affs used to be unfair. Fairness is all about the community norm, which means there is no empirical impact. The debate community still survives, moves on, and evolves. Deciding what is fair and unfair doesn't affect the future of this activity.<br />
<br />
And, we relax the expectation of the judge in regard to your sentiments about fairness. We do not feel it is necessary to hyper-mediate you as the judge. We want to appeal to your sentiments. We believe we should open the dialogue on the role of the ballot every single round for every judge. The debate community is not only ready for this debate but it is necessary to keep evolution within the community prospering, even if it is only at a snail's pace.<br />
<br />
And, their characterization of fairness is about exclusivity not inclusivity, they claim they are trying to keep people in debate. This is incorrect, it’s more about keeping people out. Including but not limited to: anarchists, people of color, and women. Which proves their vision of fairness is a bad thing not a good thing.<br />
<br />
And, is fairness really about quid quo pro? No. It is not the measure of ability given to each side to debate but rather the initiative taken by each side. One team should not be able to dictate which position the other must choose. Although it makes perfect sense that we say government bad that the other side could say government good, but we do not force this argument upon them. They have the choice to say it, or find offense or turns elsewhere. But since we do say state bad, you know you have state good cards. State bad has been run for about twenty five years; if you don't have state good cards then you should probably lose.<br />
<br />
And, our advocacy is one of radical tolerance. We are not abnormal, but rather oppressed and deserve an opportunity, granting of this opportunity is where the real fairness lies.<br />
<br />
And, fairness is objective. Free from bias, dishonesty, or injustice. The debate community has a bias that must be diverted from, and revealed. As long as we don't lie, cheat, or cause great injustice to each other, it is fair.<br />
<br />
And, it is only fair that we are given conditions that allow success. It would be unfair to designate our argument as at the bottom of the hill and that we must do more work because it is not the normative form of debate just to convince you as the judge to hang your hat on our argument.<br />
<br />
And, if we win the question of fairness, we control the uniqueness on ground, predictability, and limits standards. All of these ideals stem from fairness because all three are methods of obtaining fairness. If the other team doesn’t answer this they automatically concede all fairness questions. Or if they choose to dispute this fact, they must show clear empirical evidence saying otherwise.<br />
<br />
And, fairness within the context of the round is at least semi-subjective, in the sense that the judge can never be completely impartial to each side or either argument. You may know one of the teams, and might have even voted for one of the teams before, or even against them. That will still be in the back of your mind, even if improvement is shown in either case, you're less likely to vote for them again.<br />
<br />
Finally, fairness depends upon objective critics, you may be friends with one of the teams, you may hate one of the teams. You may hate me, but you should still vote for me!!!
