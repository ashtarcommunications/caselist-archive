Counterplan<br />
Text: The USFG should eliminate the following subsidies for biofuels:<br />
Renewable Fuels Standard, Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, Small Ethanol Producer Credit, Bioenergy Program, Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements, Business and industry Guaranteed Loans, Rural Business Enterprise Grants, Biofinery Assistance, Repowering Assistance, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels<br />
<strong>Observation I – It is mutally esclusive and any permutation is illegitimate – they eliminate all production for biofuels subsidies as discussed in the cross ex – Value added producer grants are given to ethanol for biofuels.</strong><br />

<strong><u>T – Framework</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Psychoanalysis Bad K</u></strong><br />
- Psychoanalytic paradigm traps us in tautology. As the analyst of our society, the aff positions themselves beyond question – any disagreement is interpreted as “resistance” to the correct diagnosis of the social-analytical. The relationship between analyst and analyzed remains rapped in a cycle of domination masquerading as criticism<br />
Brickman 03 [Celia, Aboriginal Populations in the Mind: Race and Primitivity in Psychoanalysis, p. 192]<br />
This adversarial configuration of the analytic … position of subordination.<br />
- Their paradigm of ideological fantasy is premised on a universal and ahistorical vision of the psyche. The analysts own fantasy of total authority over the psyche arises from a colonial paradigm. Colonized cultures are mined for a glimpse of the so-called primitive psyche, unfettered by superegoic fantasy.<br />
Brickman 03 [p. 118-119]<br />
But a subjectivity … of becoming a subject at all.<br />
- Impact – with the analyst in a position of authority, those being analyzed are treated as raw material. The aff replaces material exploitation with psychic exploitation, turns the case<br />
Brickman 03 [p. 201-202]<br />
The authority of early anthropologists … of the investigation<br />
- Alt is to repudiate their theory of a universal psyche, interrogating the authority of the analyst generates a dialogue between different psychic states and techniques aiding our understanding of ideology and exploitation<br />
Brickman 03 [p. 206-207]<br />
When psychoanalysis supplies … truly come to an end.<br />
<strong><u>GMO DA</u></strong><br />
Cutting subsidies undermines global GM crops<br />
Allen 04 [Will, World Social Forum Speech on King Cotton and US Farm Subsidies, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://organicconsumers.org/clothes/subsidies.cfm" rel="nofollow">organicconsumers.org/clothes/ subsidies.cfm</a>]<br />
We are asking all countries in the G21 … as we know it.<br />

Whittington 06 [Mark, “Underground Farming]<br />

Solves exintction<br />
Engdahl 01 [“Space and Human Survival: My Views”]<br />
I realize that what I’ve been saying … are virtually unlimited.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><u>PIC of “its”</u></strong><br />
- Affs reference to the USFC and “its” agriculture subsidies” constitutes human beings and relationships through an orientation that creates separateness and detachment by constituting the subjectivity of the USFG as an “it”. This identification in their plan text analyzes and describes the world through a lens of objectification<br />
Scott 02 [Alex, “Martin Buber’s I and Thou,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://angelfire.com/md2/timewarp/buber.htm" rel="nofollow">angelfire.com/md2/timewarp/ buber.htm</a>]<br />
According to Buber, human beings may adopt … belongs to I, but not to It.<br />
- Lingustic identification of the USFG using the phrase its is not a neutral practice, but rather carries severe ethical implications. The ability to define others as its, in this case the USFG, fundamentally denies their humanity, enabling people to be treated as instruments of control, which fails to affirm their existence<br />
Wood 07 [Julia, Interpersonal Communication: Everyday Encounters, 5th Ed, p. 21]<br />
I-It Communication. In an I-It relationship, we treat … makes this point.<br />
- The I-It relationship abstracts specific qualities from the USFG and assumes they represent the whole of those beings. This is the basis for racism, sexism, ageism, ableism, religious bigotry, homophobia, and oppression<br />
Roberts 97 [Lani, “One Oppression or Many?” Journal for Philosophy in the Contemporary World, V4 I1/2, Spring/Summer]<br />
Although not a model of oppression, Buber’s distinction … racist, another “It.”<br />
<strong><u>Case</u></strong><br />
- Posing the qiestion of ethics as one of changing institutions is a farce – we sustain our own ethical boundaries without changing a single coordinate<br />
Zupancic 00 [Alenka, “Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan,” 10-11]<br />
In other words, one cannot … desire as a priori.<br />
- Displacement of our ethics on external political institutions culminates in genocidal violence – when we presume ethics to be contingent upon the political, all violence is possible<br />
Zupancic 00 [Alenka, “Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan,” 96-97]<br />
“Another problem still remains … of our actions.<br />
- They are not the act – it must be spontaneous<br />
Robinson and Tormey 03 [Andrew, Simon, “Zizek is not a radical”]<br />
“The answer is that Zizek does not see impossibility as a barrier … on enemy terrain.<br />
- Zizek’s theory encourages violence<br />
Robinson and Tormey 03<br />
As becomes evident ‘class struggle’ is not … awaiting a content.<br />
- Turn – the revolution will collapse into prisons of domination, reproducing the impacts of capitalism<br />
Robinson and Tormey 04 [Andrew and Simon, “What is not to be done! Everything you wanted to know about Lenin, and (sadly) weren’t afraid to ask Zizek”]<br />
Zizek’s Lenin takes his place amongst the various … besides a politics of domination.<br />
- Zizek’s alt can’t transform the current system<br />
Robinson and Tormey 03<br />
So the Act is a rebirth – but a rebirth as what … via the Stalinist purges.<br />
- Zizek’s act is as terroristic as the Nazi genocide – it fetishizes revolutionary violence<br />
Robinson and Tormey 04<br />
The terroristic nature of the Stalinist regime is certainly no problem … immoral and criminal’.<br />
- Zizek’s commitment to the Act at all costs requires that one submit to the messianic revolution depot in order to create the revolution – this leads to totalitarian domination<br />
Robinson and Tormey 04<br />
“Such instances of overt Stalinism … power at all costs.’<br />
- Political change is a result of radicalizing demands, not the pure act – Zizek’s alt eviscerates effective leftist politics<br />
Robinson and Tormey 05 [Thesis 11, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://the.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/80/1/94.pdf" rel="nofollow">the.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/ 80/1/94.pdf</a>]<br />
As useful as such a reading is … politics of the Act.<br />
- Lacanian theory places itself in a double bind – either it loses the universal status or links back to the criticism<br />
Robinson 05 [“The political theory of Constitutive Lack: A Critque,” Muse]<br />
The idea of a “constitutive lack” is supposed … of “I don’t know”.<br />
- Radical act still leaves intact the most violent features of the status quo while reproducing a system that requires authoritarianism and oppression<br />
Robinson and Tormey 03<br />
The choice of the term ‘suspension’ … equally oppressive.<br />
- Extinction comes first<br />
Kateb 92 [George, The Inner Ocean: Indiidualism and Democratic Culture]<br />
What does a theory of rights leave … end the threat.)<br />
- Moral obligation to future generations<br />
Kurasawa 04 [Fuyuki, V11, No 4 Constellations, “Cautionary Tales”]<br />

Psychoanalytic paradigm filters the world through the racist, colonial assumptions of a universal psyche that can be uncovered by the analyst.<br />
