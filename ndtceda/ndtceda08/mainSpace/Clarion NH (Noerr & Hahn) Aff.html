<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 2 - Absolutism sucks<br />
<br />
1. Casey promotes an absolutist vison of abortion rights. extremists on both sides of the debate have used the status quo to fuel a culture war over abortion politics.<br />
<br />
Rosen, George Washington Law Professor, 06<br />
(Jeffrey, The most Democratic Branch, 100-1)<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Current abortion politics promotes a philosophy of absolutism<br />

3. This breeds alientation and promotes conflict as it reduces our concern for the other.<br />

4. Accepting responsibility for the other, willingness to engage and see the other is critical in taking a stand agianst genocide. if we dont take a stand here, the refusal to see and presumption of knowing will rear its ugly head elsewhere.<br />

<br />
Having the court make policy on abortion kills independence<br />
Associated Press Online 10-21-06 “deeply controversial issues like abortion…with the lower courts.”<br />
<br />
Scalia would back the plan which ensures independence<br />

<br />
Independence key to democracy<br />
Center for Justice and Accountability, 1-4-04, www.bepress.com<br />
“this Court has helped to make…diminished not just here but everywhere.”<br />
<br />
Democracy solves Extinction<br />
Diamond, 95<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan: the USSC should use Gonzales V. Carhart to overrule its decision in Planned Parrenthood V. Casey by rejecting Casey's reaffirming of Roe V. Wade. the Court should argue Casey's special justifications approach to stare decisis is unconstitutional.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 4 - the plan kicks major ass<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Given the tenuous support abortion has, the court should not hide behind precedent and instead rule on the substance of the case. therefore Casey's doctrine of stare decisis should be overruled.<br />
<br />
Calabresi, Northerwestern Law Professor, 05<br />
(Steven G. 22 Const. Commentary 311, summer, l/n)<br />
<br />
<br />
2. a return to textualism reinserts the people into the debate and enhances democrartic decision-making<br />
<br />
Calabresi, Northerwestern Law Professor, 05<br />
(Steven G. 22 Const. Commentary 311, summer, l/n)<br />
<br />
<br />
3. rejecting Roe's legitimacy gets abortion back into the public sphere, solves extremism, and allows for a compromise to emerge<br />
<br />
Rosen, George Washington Law Professor, 06<br />
(Jeffrey, The most Democratic Branch, 102-3)<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Germany proves the plan solves<br />
<br />
Glendon, Harvard Law Professor, 91<br />
(Mary Amm, Rights Talk, p. 64-5)<br />
<br />
<br />
5. There's no legitimacy in upholding Casey - upholding a bad precedent simply because an overrule hurts the image of the Court would mean we should still follow Dread Scott<br />
