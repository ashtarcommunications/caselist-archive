 The government subsidizes Tyson foods to destroy small towns like emporia the price of grain feed and operating the factory farms themselves becomes chep- emporia has been under the thumb of Tyson<br />
Thomas frank 4/2004 “lie down for America” harper’s magazine online<br />
“they call places like garden city” “mexico, and points south”<br />
<br />
Tyson’s plant that employed more than 2400 people began to sub plant its native emporian work force with Somali refugees<br />
This transition created racism<br />
Emporia gazette online 11-3-07<br />
“Somali; wake your damn” “out of our town”<br />
<br />
many did not understand that these folks from Somalia represented almost a perfect cross- section of society- doctors, teachers, etc. who simply could not stay in their home towns because of persecution but this person needed someone to blame and it couldn’t be Tyson- they brought the economic growth. It is this assumption that some economy is better than no economy that allows the systemic destruction of locality across the Midwest<br />
Frank, same article<br />
“this is economic growth” “are steadily whittled away”<br />
<br />
Long narrative of how Tyson holds emporia hostage- says that they don’t know whether or not subsidies help or hurt- then says traditional formulas for political demands are incapable of understanding the unique circumstances of locality- ethical obligation- play a different game<br />
<br />
CARDS AGAIN<br />
It is widely assumed that cap determines everything- that you are for or against capitalist development and it is just that simple. Emporians must either want, or not want Tyson. And if the traditional economic indicators say that Tyson is helping emporia, then we must want it. It is through this reductive view of capitalism and economics that we learn to love our own destruction. A break with the traditional notions of capitalism is necessary for emporia. Emporia’s economy does not live or die because of profits and wages. There is a whole field of potentialities in non-capitalist production that the current logic of policy evaluation cannot understand. <br />
Julie Graham and Stephen Healy ‘7 “building community economies: a postcapitalist project of sustainable development” economic representations: academic and everyday<br />
“there is no economy” “inferior or at best peripheral”<br />
<br />
Tyson operates via a reductive system of though- teaching is a form of non capitalist economic exchange- teachers gain more than dollars- emporia isn’t a depressed economy but it creates development vis a vis the cyclical relationship between teacher-students.<br />
Debate is similar- must have a pedagogical practice about locality. Debate now is in a similar form of economic and collective psychological depression as emporia- uncertainty of programs, etc. voting aff could help to spur debate in a direction that would seek to pay off its democratic debt to the universities that sponsor it. Need to ask what your own local identity is- what makes debate and the city you come from unique- this is an important for innovation in debate and a necessary bulwark against endeavors of things like Tyson. <br />

 <strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Neoliberalism is not a set of sacred beliefs and rules that no one violates – it is a hypocritical system of domination that impoverishes most of the world – one way this happen is subsidies – cotton subsidies, it would seem, would be antithetical to the ideal notion of “free trade”. However, the US subsidizes its cotton industry to the extent that smaller suppliers simply cannot compete. The real neoliberalism is not some set of economic values that are immutable and eternal – neoliberalism is the interests of a gang of developed countries always winning out – the lives of the global poor are but a small expense in this global system of control.<br />

US Cotton subsidies are but one example of neoliberalism – the logic of neoliberalism demands the destruction and sacrifice of entire populations, destroying all of humanity in order to save it. Left unquestioned this machine of neoliberalism will lock-in the status quo through the radical rejection of any alternative and will silence any dissent.<br />
Santos in 3 bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The logic of neoliberalism affects every facet of politics, including the education we get from debating and judging –</strong><br />
<strong>On one hand, everything is reduced to simple market efficiency – how many bodies can the plan save?</strong> <strong>Is this number greater or less that than the bodies it terminates?</strong> <strong>Does the affirmative create are fair division of educational ground?</strong> <strong>Who has more ground and how does this affect the market of ideas in college debate?</strong> <strong>Within this room, we are subject to the same logic of neoliberalism that forms the hierarchies of the global market.</strong> <strong>It makes us great think-tankers and calculating politicians BUT leaves us cynical in the face of global atrocities.</strong><br />
<strong>On the other hand, the academic left has retreated into theory-world – hope is a joke.</strong> <strong>The best outcome we can aspire to is the arcane discourse of so-called “radical” academics, the most probable authors of the negative’s kritik alternative.</strong> <strong>We cannot do anything to change to the world so we should veil our cynicism in arcane language and hope for the best.</strong><br />
<strong>Against this cynicism, we must remain hopeful – neoliberalism is a pedagogical form of control that must be countered at that level – the everyday investment of neoliberal logic into debate must be questioned with a radical form of hope that critically re-orients our pedagogical practices around hope – pedagogy must occupy a formative role in shaping our critical agency and our ability to radically imagine a different future.</strong><br />
