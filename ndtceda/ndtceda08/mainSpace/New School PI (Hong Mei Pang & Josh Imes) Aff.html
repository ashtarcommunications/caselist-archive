I simply wish to know if at this very moment you see yourself… as you see, for example, yourself with the benefit of time, that which you were in the past at one point. With all of the illusions that you created for yourself; with all of the things, inside and around yourself, which suited you at the time—and which were entirely real at the time for you<br />
thinking again about those illusions which no longer live with you; about all of those things which now no longer “seem” as they once “were” for you; don’t you feel a bit lost that—in the same way—the “you” that you are at this moment, the entirety of your reality as it is today, is destined to seem like an illusion come tomorrow?<br />

Well, it wasn’t a great traumatic event that shaped my life or anything. It was just one of the reasons I was teed off at you for a few years. When I was about – oh, eight, I guess – we had a big party – it was at the house on Carmelina. Mom let me sleep in one of the bunks in the pool house – partly so the noise wouldn’t keep me awake – partly as a special treat. I remember watching the lights from the pool rippling on the wooden ceiling as I drifted off to sleep. Later, I heard voices – yours and another – a woman – giggling and laughing. I was still half asleep and it took me awhile to realize you were in the same room with me. Anyway, I watched you and the lady having sex. ‘Having sex.’ I mean, at the time I wasn’t even sure that’s what you were doing. After awhile, you both got up and left and I went back to sleep. Six months later you and Mom split up and somehow in my addled little mind I tied in the whole incident with why you had to go away. It wasn’t, of course. At least not that particular woman. Look, as I said it was no great tragedy. Today, I could probably handle it but when you’re eight years old you’re saddled with a very old-fashioned sense of morality.<br />

DRUMMOND: <em>Yes!</em> (<em>His voice drops, intensely.</em>) The individual human mind. In a child’s power to master the multiplication table there is more sanctity than in all your shouted “Amens!” “Holy, Holies!” and “Hosannahs!” An idea is a greater monument than a cathedral. And the advance of man’s knowledge is more of a miracle than any sticks turned to snakes, or the parting of waters! But are we now to halt the march of progress because Mr. Brady frightens us with fable? (<em>Crossing to the jury, reasonably.</em>) Gentlemen, progress has never been a bargain. You’ve got to pay for it. Sometimes I think there’s a man behind a counter who says, “All right, you can have a telephone; but you’ll have to give up privacy, the charm of distance. Madam, you may vote; but at a price; you lose the right to retreat behind a powder-puff or a petticoat. (<em>Pointing to the sky</em>) Mister, you may conquer the air, but the birds will lose their wonder, and the clouds will smell of gasoline!” (<em>Thoughtfully, seeming to look beyond the courtroom</em>) Darwin moved us forward to a hilltop, where we could look back and see the way from which we came. But for this view, this insight, this knowledge, we must abandon our faith in the pleasant poetry of Genesis.<br />

My troubles all began a year ago – two years ago today – two days ago today? Today. We used to have a beautiful old green Buick. The Green Latrine! … I’m not allowed to drive it any more… but when I could drive it… the last time I drove it, I drove to Manhattan, down Broadway – the Crossroads of the world! And I see a scene that you wouldn’t see in your wildest dreams. Four people. One on each corner. All waving for taxis. Cardinal Spellman. Jackie Kennedy. Bob Hope. President Johnson. Taxi! Taxi! I stop in the middle of the street and I get out of my Green Latrine and yell, “Get in. I’m a gypsy cab. Get in, don’t you all know each other? Get in!” They keep waving for cabs. I run over to President Johnson and grab him by the arm. “Get in.” And pull Jackie Kennedy into my car and John-John, who I didn’t see, starts crying and Jackie hits me and I hit her and I grab Bob Hope and push Cardinal Spellman into the back seat, crying and laughing, “I’ll take you where you want to go! Get in!” And the suitcases spill open and Jackie Kennedy’s wigs blow down Forty-Second Street and all my friends run into four different cabs. And then the Green Latrine blows four flat tires and I push the car back over the bridge to Queens. You’re asleep. I turn on Johnny Carson to get my mind off and there’s Cardinal Spellman and Bob Hope, and they tell the story of what happened and everybody laughs. Thirty million people watch Johnny Carson and they all laugh. At me. At me. I’m nobody. I knew all those people better than me. You. Ronnie. I know everything about them. Why can’t they love me?<br />

<strong>WOMAN:</strong> When does man open his eyes to the truth? When he no longer feels the need to hide from himself, having closed his eyes to the redness of his shame, instead he sees, with barren and impassive eyes, that, for what but love did he blind himself? Oh, how disgusting, then, how disgusting all these so-called intellectual complications, all this so-called philosophy that discovers the beast and then wishes to save it, justify it… I can’t stand it! Because when we permit ourselves to “simplify” life—like this, brutishly—throwing out the “human factor” trying to expose each chaste breath, every pure sentiment, the ideal, duty, decency, shame— nothing gives me more disdain and nausea than these so-called regrets: crocodile tears!<br />

you? I'm thinking I'm crazy and I know you [point to<br />

making me think this way and she's stealing my<br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong>Though not explicit, white people are also affected by the schizophrenic nature of whiteness. Whiteness’ need to maintain purity inevitably characterizes its subject within homogenizing frameworks, using the trope of American nationalism to mask its pervasive nature. The white subjectivity is unanchored and fragmented to the point of absolute assimilation under this framework, with no way to identify with any agency or subjectivity.</strong></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong>Palumbo-Liu, 99; David.</strong> Associate Professor of Comparative Literature and the Director of Program in Modern Thought and Literature at Stanford University. “Asian/American: Historical Crossings of a Racial Frontier” Stanford University Press, 1999.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">As we saw above<strong><u>, as white worried about the “Third Worldization” of local space, the very semantic charge, the very integrity of certain key words</u></strong> (white, American, traditional, and so on) <strong><u>came under pressure and doubt. What we find is a close rehearsal of</u></strong> Robert Park’s early disquisition on “<strong><u>marginal man”, which began as a general descriptor for “modern man” and was then reified to name and pathologize specifically <em>racial</em> marginals. What I am suggesting here is a reversal of that trajectory of pathologization and a reinscription of subjects heretofore “unmarked” by race within a more global sense of fragmentation and unanchoring. Within this examination of ethnic duality and schizophrenia, I will argue that such duality and schizophrenia should be extended as well to whites.</u></strong> </span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">If Park’s original notion of marginality was intended to account for the gap between the loss of old-world traditions and the not-yet- proven protocols of modern America, then we should restore that “universal” concept of a crisis in modern social being in own investigations of late modernity<strong><u>. Here the fear of the racial other is complemented by a concomitant and doubt of the purity and integrity of whiteness, and, reading this in terms of nationalism, of “Americanness’</u></strong>. As noted above, Park’s original notion of marginality was intended to account for the gap between the loss of tradition and modern America. <strong><u>Modern man was psychically driven, placed in the margins of, on one side, loss of traditional ethical and political beliefs, and on the other, the not-yet-clear- vision of what would replace them in the modern world. Although this psychic split was not entirely smoothed over for the Euroamerican subject, it was qualitatively different for the raced subject. It becomes characterized by a racial and cultural double default. The neither-nor formula of marginality was not as pernicious for the Euroamerican subject, since it was still placed at the center of a modern teleology.</u></strong> Whichever way modernity was moving, that subjectivity was carried along in its flow<strong><u>. For the American racial subject, however, that forward motion was not in the least guaranteed. Indeed, the psychic split for the racial subject threatened constantly to sidetrack and stall that particularly designated</u></strong> <strong><u>forward progress of racialized subject: assimilation.</u></strong> </span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong><u>The discourse of postmodernity has, however, presented the occasion to rethink that historical bifurcation which tracked differently the white and the non-white American discourse</u></strong>. Much has been said about the new “condition” of postmodernity that collapses prior distinctions and sets all subjects under an equal condition of “hybridity”, “fragmentation”, and so on. This has both positive and negative effects on issues of race and ethnicity (among other things). <strong><u>Setting aside for the moment the liberating and counterhegemonic potential of this conceptualization of the postmodern, we might stop to examine how the postmodern harbors within it a particular anxiety with regard to race and culture</u></strong>. The dark side of postmodernity is haunted by a loss far greater than its modern variety, since the loss is not mourned—indeed, it may be hardly noticeable<strong><u>. We have ceased to sense the less of the modern. But a particular sense of disorientation still pertains.</u></strong></span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong>The attempts made by the (AFF/NEG) serve as an attempt to diagnose the Other. By trying to interpret what we are, and why we do what we do in the (1AC/NC) they continue to interpret the performance in the cultural default norm of whiteness. This causes further alienation and fragmentation for racialized and dispossessed subjects. Just as whiteness fails to understand racial dualities as a product of its cultural hegemony, thus seeking to pathologize the schizophrenia that results from racial subjects, the (AFF/NEG) fails to understand our performance as a reflection of whiteness upon itself thus its interruption.</strong> </span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Deployed as a diagnosis of cultural and racial duality, racial and cultural “schizophrenia” is predicated upon an absolutist, nation-based notion of identity, which is put in crisis by migrancy and racial difference. In the United States, this points up the fundamental dilemma of inclusionist and assimilationist doctrine</u></strong>. This mental pathology may be linked to the historical schisms of the 1970s, the period in which the trope is most often articulated. There are certain, fundamental questions: How was this pathology an outgrowth of earlier notions of the “marginal man”? How was the recourse taken to “cultural nationalism” the logical response to this stigma, and yet how does this alternative remove from view other modes of identification? Crucially, <strong><u>how can we turn the schizophrenia pathology reserved for racialized people back on the pristine notion of “whiteness”, which seeks to project schizophrenia solely onto the minds of racialized peoples and therefore allow itself to stand above such concerns.</u></strong></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong><u>The tropology of alienation, fragmentation, and conflict so common to modernity has, as we have seen, been adapted particularly to designate and diagnose the racial Other. Yet with every instantiation of this tropology there is a movement of recombination, if only to make some graspable perceivable entity for ideological circulation. The standard reading of the modern migrant subject has been the image of the “marginal man”,</u></strong> which we have traced from the influential writings of Robert E. Park. The “margin” can be mapped at the fringes of American society; however, that was not the site of Park’s original formulation. As we have noted, Park extends “marginality” to a wide range of individuals who are caught between the old world and the new. <strong><u>The “margin” is read in that <em>luminal</em> space: the mental processes that inform the negotiation of that space then form a key component of the modern psyche. Those people who are marginal are those who have lost contact with the values, customs, and mores proper to the old world—they are inscribed in the logic of modern economies, without, as yet of cultural coherence.</u></strong> Yet this general notion of a seemingly universal decline of modern men and women becomes particularly attached to those whose racial markings set them off most dramatically and tellingly from the first waves of American immigration. These people are <em>particularly</em> marginal; they are marked by their more distant and distinct racial and ethnic identities. <strong><u>Marginality thus is transformed from an overall condition to one that applies specifically to racial others. The marginal in its racial formulation is thus located not in a temporal and geographic gap</u></strong> (between the old and new worlds, premodernity and modernity), <strong><u>but at the outer fringes of American subjectivity. The process of assimilation narrates the gradual movement from the margin haunted by race to the supposedly colorblind center of American idealism.</u></strong></span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><a name="REF1"></a> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">In the last ten years, <u>a variety of cross-disciplinary scholars have illuminated</u> (<u>and</u>, in that effort, <u>sought to deconstruct) racial privilege and disadvantage by examining whiteness as a cultural, political location—as an identity created and maintained through our everyday communication</u>.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ezproxy.bgc.bard.edu:2053/journals/theatre_topics/v014/14.2warren.html#FOOT1" rel="nofollow">1</a></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> In some of these studies<u>, whiteness is revealed as a strategic rhetoric</u>, <u>a means by which people, working in concert and often unreflectively, levy power and cultural influence</u>. For example, communication and film scholars examine rhetorical constructions of whiteness (see Crenshaw; Dyer; Nakayama and Krizek; Shome). While <u>this perspective may help us understand the role of language (and how social systems and individuals work in concert to create racial oppression</u>) recent <u>efforts by scholars to maintain a focus on the white subject have underscored the importance of deconstructing and challenging white subjectivity in order to promote a more equitable and socially just society</u>. Research here has taken many forms. Critical scholars in theatre have led the way, <u>creating critical performances of whiteness</u> (see Jackson; O'Brien; Warren and Kilgard) that <u>function to mirror, particularly to white audiences, the mechanisms and machinations of their oppressive actions, however unreflective</u>. <u>Ethnographic portraits of whiteness have given depth and immediacy to our understandings of people in lived context</u> (Hartigan; hooks; Warren, <em>Performing</em>). <u>Autoethnographers, because they plumb their lived experience for particular details and contradictions about how they create and are created by culture, have constituted a rich repository for the study of how each of us works to understand his or her own ethnic identity</u> (Clark and O'Donnell; Pelias; Warren, &quot;Absence&quot;). <u>Studies in education have also created a critical context for understanding how whiteness permeates our classrooms</u> (see Giroux; Hytten and Adkins; McIntyre); <u>such work functions to remind us of the power of pedagogy to help us see and re-see the actions we take, challenge, or leave unquestioned.</u> </span></span></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">In an earlier essay, one of us organized, from across the variety of disciplinary perspectives, <u>four key scholarly approaches to the study of whiteness to help create a nuanced understanding of this</u> seemingly inescapable and overwhelming <u>political and cultural thicket</u> (Warren, &quot;Whiteness&quot;). First, <u>scholars <strong>[End Page 412]</strong> have analyzed whiteness in order to promote antiracism</u>. For example, Ruth Frankenberg, in her classic book <em>White Women, Race Matters</em>, deconstructs white women's talk in order to uncover (and to help them discover) how racism and whiteness saturate their talk. Second, many researchers have investigated how whiteness is embedded in literature, film, and scholarship. Such works explore how taken-for-granted sites, including popular cultural texts or scholarly research, are never politically neutral. For instance, in <em>Playing in the Dark</em>, Toni Morrison uncovers how writers of American literature almost always assume a white reader to the exclusion of other ways of seeing or interpreting a text or series of events. Third, scholars who advocate an understanding of whiteness as a rhetorical construct have shifted researchers' attention from whiteness as a stable identity (i.e., this person is or is not white) to whiteness as a discursive way of levying power (i.e., whiteness as a discursive space, existing in our communicative interactions). For instance, communication scholar Christina W. Stage explores how a small-town celebration discursively invokes and rewards whiteness through a series of powerful communication strategies—that is, through the re-historicizing of the community, members recreate the past and locate that past within the discursive space of white power (e.g., settlement narratives that locate the beginnings of the town within a white subject). The fourth and final research trend involves <u>reading whiteness as a performative construct</u>. Judith Butler's analysis of Nella Larsen's <em>Passing</em> <u>provides a thought-provoking example of how whiteness as an identity is communicatively reproduced through our everyday actions</u>. In her analysis, <u>white identity is</u> considered <u>a discursive construct that is made and remade through our reiterative patterned communication choices</u>. </span></span></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>We</u> <u>draw</u> strength <u>from</u> each of <u>these modes of analysis as they function to call out whiteness as a political and social force.</u> However, what is often absent from the extant literature are strategies for actively and publicly deconstructing and undermining whiteness as the cultural center. That is, these microanalyses provide hope and incisive critique, but lack sufficient theorizing to change our behavior. In this way, all the approaches here are ways of seeing and critiquing, but few are actively documenting progressive action with others. Alice McIntyre, an education scholar, perhaps comes closest with her action-research-oriented teacher groups in which she debates and teaches about whiteness as she draws her dissertation research data from them; however, the members of the research team have long disbanded by the time the book is written. Thus, <u>what we see missing is an action-oriented research project that holds accountable ourselves and the members of the community we want to inform</u>. <u>How do you make meaningful the critiques</u> above <u>in a way that experientially demands that participants put their bodies on the line</u>? Is there <u>a research process that could make the invisible and naturalized processes of whiteness more visible, more visceral, more present</u>? </span></span></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">We begin this essay with this political and ethical claim: <u>as researchers concerned with whiteness as a means of levying power and privilege over others, we must articulate a process for combating whiteness as a political force in our schools, in our homes, and in our communities</u>. In this writing, <u>we offer our own attempt to call out and combat whiteness</u>: <u>a series of workshops for white students</u> (although nonwhite students were not excluded) <u>that asked them to move past apologia and guilt for their ethnic identity, toward the development of actions that have the potential to challenge cultural oppression</u>. For us, such <u>a process must be both an exercise of the mind and a rethinking through the <strong>[End Page 413]</strong> body</u>—<u>it must hold both our everyday talk <em>and</em> our everyday actions accountable for the ways we each reproduce whiteness as a socially powerful, culturally centered location</u>. </span></span></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>We ground</u>ed the frame and method for our workshops <u>in Freire's <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>, employing his methodology for critical literacy groups. This participatory, ethnographic method is ideally suited for engaging and incorporating the body into theories of liberation, thus helping us to maintain our focus on the process, the performances, by which individuals come to enact and constitute oppressive social systems. In addition to articulating our use of this method for enfleshing, engaging, and challenging whiteness,</u> our essay explores how <u>such a mode of engagement allows for participants to see whiteness as a performative process</u></span></span></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong>The debate round becomes a space in which these power dynamics between whiteness and otherness could be mitigated. As long as the (AFF/NEG) is willing to surrender their white privilege derived from their performance of whiteness, racialized subjects can vocalize their narratives and not be discounted of their experience as being inferior or abnormal, as determined through the white default cultural norm.</strong></span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong><u>What is left for us is something Jameson calls “schizophrenia nominalism”, which includes “the rubble and the ruins of much of that—place, personal names, etc-- without the personal identity or the temporal and historical progression, the coherence of the situation and its logic (however desperate), that gave bourgeois realism its tension and substance”. Again, this loss of identity, of distinction, is inseparable from a loss of historical consciousness. The “present” has superseded and obviated both past and future time. Jameson’s analogy for this “overcoming” is profoundly provocative and germane for our discussion of racial schizophrenia, for he equates the new “present” with a “demographic” change that alienates the Eurocentric Self from history.</u></strong> It is worth quoting at length:</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">The dispersive impact of demography is another very different and perhaps more characteristically postmodern effect, felt first and foremost in our relationship to the human past. It would seem, according to some reports, that the quantity of human beings now alive on earth (some five million) is rapidly approaching the total number of humanoids who have already lived and died on the planet since the beginning of the species. The present is thus like some new thriving and developing nation-state, whose numbers and prosperity make it an unexpected rival for old traditional ones. As with bilingual speakers in the United States, one can at least predictively calculate the moment when it will overtake the past: that demographic moment is already part of the moment is already at hand, as a rapidly approaching point in the most so distant future, and thereby to that degree already part of the present and the realities with which it must reckon. But if this is so, then the relationship of the postmodern to historical consciousness now takes on a very different appearance, and there is some justification, and a plausible argument to be made, for cosigning the past to oblivion as we seem to be doing; now that we, the living, have the preponderance, the authority of the dead—hitherto based on sheer numbers—diminishes at a dizzying rate (along with all the other forms of authority and legitimacy). It used to be like an old family, old houses, in an old village with only a few young people around, who had to sit in the darkened rooms at night and listen to the elders. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">What that past has to tell us is therefore little more than a matter of idle curiosity, and indeed our interest in it… comes to look like an in-group hobby or adoptive tourism… the salute to non-great-power-languages or extinct provincial traditions is, of course, politically correct and a cultural spinoffof the micropolitical rhetoric discussed earlier [emphasis added].</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"> Let me try to untangle this depressing and yet potentially conterhegemonic scenario. <strong><u>The present, represented in the live body count of the world’s extant population, virtually overnumbers the past. The “old family” (of modernity) is cosigned to a mythic “darkened room”. But most significantly, the numerical superiority which has produced that relegation is not simply a matter of more people, but of newly <em>visible</em> populations, those “Bushmen and Hottentots, bare-breasted island women and aboriginal craftsmen” that are now to be not only <em>counted</em>, but counted as the <em>Same</em>.</u></strong> Jameson’s choice of analogy (bilingual speakers in the United States) is not accidental, and we may link it to his later remarks about non-major power language and “extinct” provincial traditions. <strong><u>In the flattened out temporality of the present, everything can claim equal status. The “old family” is dead; nothing can cohere the disparate and dense population of the present since History</u></strong> (secured by the traditional tale passed down from elder to child in that cold dark space of tradition and history<strong><u>) is simply one tale among many</u></strong>. <strong><u>(That is, unless one follows Jameson in naming late capitalism as that nonstory, that non narrative, that links “us” all under its spell.)</u></strong> Jameson is distinctly ambivalent about this state of things (“there is some justification, and a plausible argument to be made, for cosigning the past to oblivion”). <strong><u>He cannot foreclose the possibility of “mapping a totality”, of imagining the possibility of again thinking historically. One central question is what can count as history now, given this newly populated terrain.</u></strong></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong><u>[Now the schizophrenic can be read racially. If before it was simple a matter of a lack of history in late capitalism, now it is (also) a lack of history because “new voices” have joined in the cacophony of the postmodern. Postmodern schizophrenic meaninglessness is directly correlated with the fact that racial others are now too much like us in the flat(line) space of postmodernity—there are no hills or valleys to secure our geographies, no way to “map” a position. “We” are just as randomly postmodern subjects as “they”. In other words “white” is no longer distinct. This particular brand of colorblindness is part and parcel of Jameson’s end of History</u></strong>.] It is no accident that William Gibson’s work, singled out by Jameson because its “representational innovations… mark his work as an exceptional literary realization [of global paranoia], <strong><u>equally reflects what I will call “postmodern white schizophrenia”. This new schizophrenia may be seen as a contemporary elaboration of the notion of “marginality”</u></strong> introduced in Park’s sociology. <strong><u>While that troubled notion of modern life was later exclusively foisted upon racialized peoples as ‘dual personality,’ here I read those symptoms back into whiteness</u></strong> (although admittedly that formulation may be too symmetrical). In the next chapter I will substantiate my case for Gibson as conveyor of Jameson’s postmodern racial anxiety, as I develop a context for cyberspace as an extension of Pacific space; here I consider this notion by way of an examination of three earlier science fiction texts: Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (1982), the novel from which it was adapted, Phikip L. Dick’s brilliant Do Androids Dream of Electirc Sheep? (1968), and other novel by Dick.</span><br />
