The future has been colonised. Its already an….If that seems empowering and inclusive, it is only an illusory surface seduction that obfuscates how that future is made. Sardar et al 99, Ziudian. Rescuing All Our Futures: The Future of Future Studies. Pg 6<br />

The future is being colonised by yet another force. Conventionally….The aim is to preserve a future landscape where technological advances can be employed to maintain the hegemony of the West. Sardar et al 99, Ziudian. Rescuing All Our Futures: The Future of Future Studies. Pg 11-12<br />
<br />
The late 20th century is wold full of fears, the most prominent of which is the fear of uncertainty….this century, which, despite all our advances, is considered one of the most violent centuries in history, producing fascism, two world wars, countless other wars and genocide on a mass scale.<br />

Tolerance of diversity and change must be respected and promoted….we will be left with a future in which individualism has no meaning.<br />

<br />
Conventions of security act to suppress rather than confront the fears endemic to life…the collective reaction against fears has created an even worse danger: the tyranny of the herd.<br />

<br />
Plan: We encourage the creation of a space for dissent in which each person can create their own vision of the future. We affirm our engagement with this process as a “constructive engagement” with the individuals residing in “the countries” listed in the topic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Given the myopic vision and one-dimensional logic with which Western civilzation pursues its goals…evolving a discourse of social involvement: in raising the future-consciousness of communities, in articulating visions of socieities and in involving citizens in efforts to shape their own futures.<br />

<br />
Awareness of the future involves rescuing the futures studies from any disciplinary constraints and from the clutches of tame professionals and academic bureaucrats…if the future is a state of awareness then that awareness can have genuine meaning only if it emanates from the indigenous depths of a culture.<br />

I am koorosh and I want to talk about my connection to the topic<br />
<br />
We first offer a quote of Heibrun in 1988<br />
In their own voices : interviews as resistance to hegemony<br />
We live our lives … new narratives<br />
<br />
We engage the village of neve Shalom/ wahat al-salom through our reading and telling of stories. We feel that any outside assistance or interference should be pretexted with stories from those whom we would be acting towards<br />
<br />
<br />
Imagine being at war with someone whom you did not speak the same language. One must wonder how there could ever be peace. Not peace as the absence of war, but peace as in being able to effectively deal with conflict.<br />
<br />
Our 1ac is a about living a space between borders<br />
<br />
We will encourage all to be border crossers. We want to look beyond this debate offer this method of pedagogical approach to every day life<br />
<br />
There is a village amongst the place mentioned in our topic called Neve Shalom/ Wahat Al Samlam. This is a place where people from different place and with different places and with different languages learn to live in a world of accepting difference without sacrificing identity.<br />
<br />
1)First Chapter – Authors story Author ethnographer, participant storyteller, researcher and boarder crosser Gra Feuerverger writes in her book Oasis of Dreams in 2001<br />
<br />
Neve shalom/ Wahat al Salam can be….. complex moral community<br />
<br />
2) I spent my first morning in the grade-one…….aspects of classroom activity<br />
<br />
3)This chapter is based on the conversation that I shared with several…..what we thought we knew<br />
<br />
4)Now more stories from the book<br />
<br />
In order to explore the discourses of peace…. . I shall have to account for<br />
<br />
5) Language awareness is defined as…… mainstream society<br />
<br />
6) During my participant observation…..of the individuals pg 33-34<br />
<br />
AFFIRM we encourage boarder crossing as a method of understanding and pedagogical manifestation. We affirm our engagement with Neve Shalom/ Wahat AL as a metaphor for “constructively engaging” the “government” listed in the topic<br />
<br />
7) Lasted Chapter We do not endorse the concept of peace as the absence of war. Our position is that understanding how to respect other perspectives while maintaining your own personal identity is critical in learning how to enlarge ones moral vision.<br />
Feurverger continues<br />
<br />
Narratively speaking, our implicit…..religion and tradition pg20<br />
<br />
Pg 80 concluding remarks<br />
The innovations at the……. Multi-faith global society
