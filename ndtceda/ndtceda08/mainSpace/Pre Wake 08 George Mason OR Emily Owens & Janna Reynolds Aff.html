The future of humanity depends on individual decisions (on a collective level) to detach policies from their political and numerically-distorted consequences.</strong> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Observation Two: The Ontology of Zero-Sumness</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>[] The root cause of each of the impending catastrophes outlined in observation one is the ontology of zero-sumness – a hostile relationship to the world in which individual and national well-being is understood to be inversely related to the interests of everyone – and everything else. Americans are not free “to;” they are free “from.” Cotton subsidies are the ultimate expression of this negative conception of freedom – they are premised upon a perverse distortion of free market principles wherein US economic prosperity is conditioned on global poverty. The logical culmination of this way of thinking is global annihilation and that limit is rapidly approaching.</strong></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>[] US Cotton Subsidies are the modern expression of this zero-sum Ontology of domination, insidiously shielded by “fair trade” deceitful rhetoric.

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>[] US cotton subsidies are a blatant example of racism.

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Thus, Emily and I offer the following plan:</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The United States federal government should eliminate domestic subsidies for cotton.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Observation Three: Dreampolitik</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>[] We believe the plan should happen even if status quo political realities mean it is a fantasy. The concept of fiat was not introduced to encourage debates over whether the current composition of the Congress is most amenable to pushing the legislation; it was intended to eliminate “workability” debates because those arguments disable the imaginative and progressive potential of policy debate. We are not policymakers: we are college students with good ideas. 230 years ago the notion that “all humans are created equal” was worse than a fantasy, yet the authors of the Declaration of Independence had the wisdom to know that enshrining that impossible demand into the foundation of American democracy would serve as a guidepost to unfold new political possibilities. It was endorsed because it was a GOOD IDEA. Had it been rejected on the grounds that immediate and universal suffrage would fracture political unity in Congress – or due to some ethereal criticism that dismisses anything associated with an imperfect system – two centuries of activists and progressive lawmakers would have had no platform from which to demand reforms. Likewise, you should not vote negative unless they prove that eliminating cotton subsidies is not a good idea. FIAT IS DREAMPOLITIK.</strong></span><br />

[] Racism murders the spirit, and reduces us to nothing more than masters or slaves. The life of a slave becomes imaginary and self-deprecating. The life of the master is a distorted image of power based in a notion of social domination which creates domestic violence and obliteration of the self.<br />

</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">When income supports for farmers were first passed during the Great Depression, nearly 1 in 4 Americans lived on a farm. Today, 1 in 75 lives on a farm, and 1 in 750 on a full-time commercial farm. Still, the subsidies flow, with cotton and rice producers in the Delta among the largest beneficiaries. </span><br />
