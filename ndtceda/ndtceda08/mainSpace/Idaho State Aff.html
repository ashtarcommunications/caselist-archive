If a war is waged on behalf of “us” we can isolate a “them,” but when it is waged on behalf of everyone it raises a host of question. The Nazis, the communists, the Terrorists are not our enemies, they are **not human** because everyone has agreed that everyone does not include them. Of course we can say their crimes merit an exception but this thinking is dangerous. So long as humanity is evaluative our inclusivity will have limits and all opposition to the liberal order is exposed to the capacity to “merit that exception.” this danger is without precedent. Resistance to this order cannot merely be fought – it must be **consumed without remainder making possible new and unimaginable modes of absolute annihilation.">In Ex Parte Quirin the Nazis were expelled both literally from U.S. legal protections and figuratively from our conception of humanity.

we must draw bold and symmetrical lines in the sand. declaring our enemies lawful makes power visible and enables an antagonistic nation-state system grounded in reciprocal violence that limits the nature and scope of warfare. enmity and conflict are here to stay. the liberal attempt to eliminate them merely renders exclusions invisible making violence and warfare unilmited and the postmodern hope for ‘new political possibilities’ ushers in new forms of violence as we sit, paralyzed, waiting for godot.<br />

Observation 1- Quirin, the camp, and the exception...<br />
<br />
The Ex Parte Quirin precedential basis for the Bush administration's rapid expansion of presidential power, it allows the president to declare the law silent in the name of democracy<br />
<br />
Hasian 2003 (Marouf Arif, “Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wartime Anxieties, and the Saboteurs' Case” Rhetoric and Public Affiars – Volume 6, Number 2, Summer 2003, pp. 223-235<br />
<br />
<br />
Ex Parte Quirin is the legal grounding for the exceptional measures taken in the war on terror, it authorizes the creation of detention camps that occupy a liminal zone that is both inside and outside the law.<br />
<br />
McClintock 2004 – (Scott, “The<br />
Penal Colony: Inscription of the Subject in Literature and Law, and Detainees as Legal Non-Persons at Camp X-ray” Comparative Literature Studies – Volume 41, Number 1, 2004, pp. 157-158<br />
<br />
<br />
All understandings of the political must reckon with the camp, the camp is a human made hell and the fullest expression of biopower, the camp is the logical outcome of classical politics.<br />
<br />
Agamben 1998 (Giorgio, prof. Of aesthetics at the University of Verona, Homo Saver: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, pp.119-120)<br />
<br />
Recent events prove the executive stands both inside and outisde the law, making it clear that that what was previously onsidered exceptional is becoming the rule, as exceptional sovereignty coincides with legal rule all spaces can potentially be exempted from legal atrocities found in the camp will spread across the entire globe.<br />
<br />
Agamben 1998 (Giorgio, prof. Of aesthetics at the University of Verona, Homo Saver: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, pp.37-38)<br />
<br />
The sovereign's ability to be both inside and outside the law is the foundation of the legal order, the ability to decalre and exception is the original activity of sovereignty.<br />
<br />
Agamben 1998 (Giorgio, prof. Of aesthetics at the University of Verona, Homo Saver: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, pp.15-17)<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 2 - On the proper use of law...<br />
<br />
Thomas Hobbes wrote: “ To make a more curious search into the rights of States, and duties of Subjects, it is necessary... that they be so considered, as if they were dissolved, that we rightly understand... how men must be agreed among themselves, that intend to grow up in a well grounded State.” We use the tools afforded to us here, i.e. Fiat, to play with the law, not to return law to an acceptable standard of equity, rather to dissolve or deactivate it at it most fundamental level.<br />
<br />
Giorgio, Prof. Of aesthetics at the University of Verona, State of Exception, translated by Kevin Attell, pp. 63-64<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The structural problem can only be realized in a house ravaged by flames! The best possible relation to the state of exception is through an act that arrests the functioning of the machine. Burn down the House!<br />
<br />
Franchi 2004 ( Stefano, University of Auckland, “Passive Politics,” Contretemps 5, December, pp. 31-33)<br />
<br />
Without the power of exception, the law would be a dead letter. We have reached this stage of biopolitics because the exception has been allowed to operate unchecked.<br />
<br />

[Sandra Day O’Connor’s Ghost pops up behind obstruction (sock puppet)]<br />
<br />
SDOG: Excuse me sire, the words you are babbling <em>do</em> have strict and clear meanings you know, all you have to do is see it.<br />
<br />
Dekeyzer: Hey I am trying to give a speech here, do you mind? Who <em>are</em> you?<br />
<br />
SDOG: Wha-! You don’t recognize me? I am obviously Sandra Day O’Connor’s Ghost.<br />
<br />
D: Fair enough. Wait a second, Sandra Day O’Connor isn’t dead!<br />
<br />
[SDOG slowly turns her head and smirks at the judge]<br />
<br />
SDOG: As I was saying, you need to look hard to find the meaning.<br />
<br />
D: Meaning! Where?<br />
<br />
SDOG: Down here, look closer… [moves his face closer to the puppet] that’s right, look even closer, search for it… [Dekeyzer falls behind obstruction] aaahhhh…<br />
<br />
[Justice Roberts pops up (sock puppet)]<br />
<br />
SDOG and JR say in Unison:<br />
ACT I: THE CULT OF THE ROBE<br />
<br />
JR: Good morning Ghost of Sandra. Ready to get down to business?<br />
<br />
SDOG: Good morning Justice Roberts. And what business is that?<br />
<br />
JR: Ghost, today we must make some essential rulings!<br />
<br />
SDOG: In what case? Don’t tell me, don’t tell me, I know it… Milliken v. Casey? Morrison v. Bradley?<br />
<br />
JR: Ex… Parte… Quirin<br />
<br />
SDOG: Oh yeah, this is important. The impacts are huge! This will be fun.<br />
<br />
JR: Let’s begin; and thus the plan:<br />
<br />
<br />
SDOG: Here, here! For the harms outlined above John and I present the following plan: THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ALSO RULES ON EX PARTE QUIRIN THAT PREDICTABILITY AND LIMITS ARE UNPREDICTABLY LIMITLESS: JURISDICTION IS ONLY TACITLY RELATED TO TRUTH AND USES THE CONSTITUTION AS ITS WIPING PAPER.<br />
<br />
JR: Excuse me Ghost, what does that mean? Hmm?<br />
<br />
SDOG: Let me clear that up, uh, PLAN: AS JUSTICES OF THJE SUPREME COURT WE RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN SPECIFICALLY, WE ARE HOLDING PINEAPPLES, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY ON THE GROUNDS OF HAWAII.<br />
<br />
JR: [looking at judge] How’s that for grounds specification? Will you clarify intent?<br />
<br />
SDOG: Of course.<br />
<br />
JR: And thus the plan: ON A 5-4 DECISION THIS COURT RULES THAT THOUGH THE FEET WERE BOUND AND HALF THE UNIFORM WAS WORN THAT THE COMBATANT FELL WITHIN THE PREDICTABLE REALM OF ENEMY COMBATANT-NESS, AND THUS IN HASTE WE RULE IN CONCERT WITH THE PROPOSED, EX PARTE QUIRIN.<br />
<br />
SDOG: I don’t know. Nothing clarifies things like the Voice of the People. Let’s invite a real person here, perhaps they can help.<br />
<br />
JR: I guess so. There is a smelly one that constantly sits outside my chamber, he has been knocking on my door for weeks. Let’s let him in. [goes behind the obstruction and comes back with Hippie Activity Puppet]<br />
<br />
HAP: [hippie voice] Wow man, it’s even more privileged and sickening than I imagined. Ok what do I do? My hands are so close to the levers of power. I just had an idea for my screenplay. No stick to the plan. CLOSE GITMO! The blood is on our hands! The Supreme Court has greased the skids for dictatorship and authoritarianism. The <em>current administration</em> has repeatedly denied prisoners in Guantanimo the rights guaranteed by the Geneva Convention. STAND FOR RIGHTS. CLOSE GITMO. STAND FOR RIGHTS, CLOSE GITMO! Uh, man<br />
<br />
JR: [saying to SDOG] Ghost, did you hear any of that? I don’t think he’s signed the contract. Would you mind?<br />
<br />
SDOG: No problem, Justice Robert. [goes behind the obstruction, comes back up with the contract] Here smelly, just sign here, there are certain procedural limitations here which must be abided by. Don’t worry, its all meant to facilitate fair communication.<br />
<br />
HAP: [signing the contract] There you go dude.<br />
<br />
JR: You may now proceed.<br />
<br />
HAP: Thank you. I have prepared a speech. In order for us to respond to the calls of justice we as…… [lips moving but no sound coming out]…human… acceptable… Supreme… court… law… rights… rights… obligation… rights.<br />
<br />
SDOG: That’s about right, I prefer the more topical version.<br />
<br />
JR: Well I’ve had about as much clarity I can take. Send him away.<br />
<br />
[SDOG takes HAP away]<br />
<br />
SDOG: [pops back up] Well I am pooped, and I need to take a nap before I go haunt the real, so why don’t we take off?<br />
<br />
JR: OK, it was a productive day.<br />
<br />
[Alex Iftimie bursts into the scene]<br />
<br />
AI: Hey!!!<br />
<br />
SDOG and JR say in unison: Alex Iftimie!?!<br />
<br />
AI: Hey, I just thought I would stop by, hey uh, where can I get a copy of the pairing?<br />
<br />
JR: Aren’t you scheduled to argue before the distinguished court tomorrow morning? What are you doing here?<br />
<br />
AI: Yeah well they usually release the presets the night before day one, hey is that Sandra Day O’Conner’s Ghost? I don’t think you were on the pref sheet, but you’re looking good baby. I didn’t know you were dead.<br />
<br />
SDOG: Shouldn’t you be preparing for court tomorrow? The prosecutor you face is highly skilled and he’ll be arguing on the grounds of the 5th amendment. What will you say?<br />
<br />
AI: [reads a Khalilzad card at high speed]<br />
<br />
JR: What the hell are you doing? This goes far beyond the realm of acceptable court-room speech.<br />
<br />
AI: Speech! Speech!?!<br />
<br />
JR: Calm down, calm down. Just relax. What are you going to <em>say</em> tomorrow?<br />
<br />
AI: Oh, that’s easy. Framework.<br />
<br />
[All characters laugh]<br />
<br />
AI: I guess we’ll just have to agree to disagree!<br />
<br />
[All characters laugh again]<br />
<br />
Dekeyzer: [standing up] Ok, ok that’s enough. God, I can’t take any more of this. This is totally absurd. This is my speech and I won’t let your playtime interfere with it anymore. You have a sock puppet on your hand, you are pretending to be Alex Iftimie for god’s sake. I know Idaho State has done some crazy things in the past but this is just stupid. In all seriousness… [shuffles papers]<br />
<br />
And Thus the PLAN:<br />
<br />
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, THE SOVEREIGN CANNOT BE BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE LAW. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO OBFUSCATE.<br />

PLAN:<br />
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, WITH GROUNDS BUT WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION. TO IMAGINE THAT STATE AS IF IT WAS DISSOLVES. GEORGE BUSH IS AN ACTION FIGURE. PUT AWAY YOUR PICS GOOD BLOCK. NORMAL MEANS.<br />
<br />
THUS WE PRESENT THE FOLLOWING UNCONDITIONAL PLAN:<br />
IF YOU WANT TO READ EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT NORMAL MEANS, MEANS, THEN WE WILL CONCEID THE MEANS AND ATTACK THE ENDS, SEE WHAT I MEAN? OH YEAH, AND RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN.<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN ON THE GROUNDS THAT UNITED STATES V. MORRISON SHOULD BE OVERRULED. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO THE PLAN PLAN AND SEVERENCE. WE’LL CLARIFY.<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
THE UNITED STATE SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE EX PARTE QUIRIN ON THE GROUND THAT ALL OF THIS SHIT IS WORDS. WORDS, WORDS AND MORE WORDS. WORDS. FUNDING VIA NORMAL MEANS.<br />
<br />
THUS THE PLAN:<br />
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE EX PARTE QUIRIN ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD DECLARE WAR ON CHINA. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BUILD A GIANT LAND BRIDGE ACROSS THE PACIFIC. FUNDING VIA INSUFFICIENT MEANS.<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND THEN STOP. AND THEN THEY SHOULD RULE ON IT AGAIN. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO NORMAL INTRINSICNESS PERMS AGAINST TOPICALITY. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM.<br />

The ex Parte Quirin presidential basis for the bush administration rapid expansion of prez powers. It allows the president to declare the law silent in the name of democracy<br />
Hasian 2003 Marouf Arif, “Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wartime Anxieties and the Saboteurs’ Case” Rhetoric &amp; Public affairs – volume 6, Num2 summer 2003 pp. 233-235<br />
<br />
Ex Parta Quirin is the legal grounding for the exceptional measures taken in the war on terror, it authorizes the creation of detention camps that occupy a liminal zone that is both inside and outside the law<br />
McClintock 2004 Scott, “The penal colony: Inscription of the subject in literature and law, and detainees as legal non-persons at camp x-ray” Comparative literature studies – vol 41 Num 1 2004 pp. 157-158<br />
<br />
All understandings of the political must reckon with the camp, the camp is a human made hell and the fullest expression of biopower, the camp is the logical outcome of classical politics<br />
Agambem 1998 Homo Sacer: sovereign power and bare life pp. 119-120<br />
<br />
Recent events prove the executive stands both inside and outside the law, making it clear that what was previously considered exceptional is becoming the rule, as exceptional sovereignty coincides with the legal rule all spaces can potentially be exempted from legal rights and protections, if the soverign power of exception is not called into question the atrocities found in the camp will spread across the entire globe<br />
Agamben 1998 sovereign power and bare life p. 37-38<br />
<br />
The sovereign’s ability to be both inside and outside the law is the foundation for the legal order, the ability to declare an exception is the original activity of sovereignty<br />
Agamben 1998 sovereign power and bare life p. 15-17<br />
<br />
PLAN: The United States Supreme Court should grant cert to the next available test case and overrule Ex parte Quirin [317 U.S. 1](1942) on the grounds that the sovereign cannot be both inside and outside the law<br />
<br />
Obv 2:<br />
We do not claim this plan will bring about a better world. Without the power to be inside and outside the law the law is a dead letter. We ask you to imagine the plan collapsing the entire legal order. We ask for a certain way of seeing the plan. Imagine what could occur to the law if it upholds a decision that it cannot contain. If the sovereign cannot stand both inside and outside the law, it cannot trace a limit between what is law and what it isn’t, without this power of exeception, there can be no way to speak of the law. Imagine the state as if it was dissolved.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thomas Hobbes wrote<br />
To make a more curious search into the rights of the state and the studies of the subject, it is necessary…that they be so considered, as if they were dissolved, that we rightly understand….how men[sic] must be agreed among themselves, that intend to grow up in a well- grounded state.<br />
<br />
We use the tools afforded to us here ie fiat to play with the law to an acceptable standard of equality rather to dissolve or deactivate it at its most fundamental level<br />
Agamben 2005 State of exception pp. 62-64<br />
<br />
The structural problem can only be realized in a house ravaged by flames! The best possible relation to the state of exception is through an act that arrests the fuctioing of the machine. Burn down the House<br />
Franchi 2004 (“passive politics” contretemps 5, December pp.31-33<br />
<br />
Without the power of exception the law would be a dead letter. We have reached this stage of bio-politics because the exception has been allowed to operate unchecked.<br />

Observation One: the Mystery of Human Life<br />
<br />
The pro-choice ideology secured by the Casey decision grounds the law in a paradigm of secular rights-talk that eviscerates the very freedom it attempts to uphold by granting unlimited authority to the sovereign to make the decision on life. This promotion of the autonomous self necessitates the creation of the enemy “other” devastating the potential for authentic human community. Any coherent assertion of rights must be anchored in a recognition of God.<br />
Charles E. Rice 2005 3 Ave Maria L. Rev 259 l/n<br />
“For an assertion of rights to be fully coherent…insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned.”<br />
<br />
Justice is an empty signifier—the rights afforded by a secular reading of the Constitution invariably collapse in on themselves. This is why the “right to choose” simultaneously necessitates the “right to kill.” Legal positivism is moral relativism—any content is acceptable enabling endless wars and turning human beings into nothing more than “superior animals.” Only by grounding the law in an immortal destiny can there be a coherent basis for asserting transcendent rights of the person against the state.<br />
Rice 05<br />
“The above examples lead us to ask…Hitler is correct.”<br />
<br />
Freedom isn’t free. The conception of liberty made possible by the reasoning in the Casey decision attributes personhood to the ability to define one’s own moral universe. This serves as the foundation for the designation of the nonhuman—all life is exposed to the capacity to be deemed “insufficient.”<br />
Jay Alan Sekulow and John Tuskey 40 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 945.<br />
“Second, Casey grounded the abortion right in an extreme…to draw the line objectively between persons and nonpersons.”<br />
<br />
The notion of the atomized individual made explicit in Casey enforces a state soteriology cherein salvation is only to be found in a social body of enemies. This religion of liberalism is inevitably totalitarian.<br />
Richard John Neuhaus 1996 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL572.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL572.cfm</a><br />
“This is most explicitly spelled out in the 1992 decision…the national creed established by the Constitution.”<br />
<br />
Grounding the abortion debate in a legal paradigm of rights creates a social body bound by nothing more than a mutual fear of death. Our bodies are not private, they are shared. The notion of inalienable rights reduces the sacredness of the body to a piece of property.<br />
Stanley Hauewas 1991 “abortion, Theologically Understood” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lifewatch.org/abortion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifewatch.org/abortion.html</a><br />
“Christians in America are temted to think of issues like abortion…the abortion issue our issue.”<br />
<br />
Life is a gift—not a supreme political value. The debate about when life begins obscures our obligation to bear witness to the kingdom of heaven. Our hospitality to children cannot be conditional—to welcome the others is to see the face of God.<br />
Hauerwas 1991<br />
“When many people start talking about abortions…everything else that we do and believe.”<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule the Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), decision that at the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, or the universe and of the mystery of human life.<br />
<br />
the function of the law is primarily pedagogical. the supreme court did not make abortions “legal” it made them socially acceptable without regret for the unborn. the plan is key – we must unteach this institution of hedonism.<br />
Goldstein, 96. (Robert D., Prof of Law, UCLA School of Law. William and Mary Bill of Rts. J. 787. Summer. P.L/N)<br />
<br />
“For Glendon, the expressive…. …. by persons holding a plurality of views.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the reasoning in the casey decision should be overruled. the mystery passage obliterates any criterion for wrongess – making it impossible to oppose national socialism which paradoxically cripples the liberalism it attempts to uphold. the plan clears the space for A new politicalS grounded in a more complete conception of the human.<br />
Scaperlanda, 2K5. (Michael A., Gene and Elaine Edwards Family Chair in Law and Associate Dean for Research, University of Oklahoma College of Law. 55 Cath. U.L. Rev. 5 p.L/N)<br />
<br />
“What are these anthropological assumptions?..... thick conception of the human person.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
finally, Demarcations are inevitable – every position has an enemy – but the defining feature of a law rooted in God is that all enemies fall under the same category of being. Only in a paradigm of liberal humanism can the conditions for the subhuman arise<br />
Rasch, 2K3. (William, Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies at India University. “Human Rights as Geopolitics:” Cultural Critique 54 120-147. p.MUSE)<br />
<br />
“Yes, this passage attests to the antiliberal prejudices…… the irrefutable benefits of the liberal order.”<br />
<br />
<br />
2AC Answers to Agamben<br />
And, our participation in Christ overcomes the aporias of will, power and difference. The only way to create a sovereignty no longer reliant on bloodshed is for political institutions and all of God’s children to be guided by the light of Christ. The self-giving exchange of the plan with China is necessary to reconcile all of us, despite nationhood, gender class, race and so on, in the harmony of the good. We must embrace the covenant even in the face of death.<br />

We must submit ourselves to the master narrative of God—in exchange for our free will we are granted a freed will. Postmodernity’s quest for autonomy is irrelevant in light of this—freedom is without content is meaningless.<br />

This is impact turned by the 1ac: the law in its current form is not something that should be preserved – the prevailing notions of legal positivism make any human behavior an acceptable content to the law. This renders law meaningless – all life can be excluded from the juridical order. Only the plan can infuse meaning into the law.<br />

We outweigh – a law rooted in God infuses the world with meaning.<br />
We are the only possibility of overcoming the nihilism and plagues the judicial order – (Rice) – if the law is not rooted in a recognition of God, any content is acceptable. This makes opposition to atrocities impossible because they can be written off as “One’s own conception of existence.” Only the 1ac establishes a criterion for wrongness – (Scaperlanda) – this means we are a pre-requisite for evaluating any of their impact claims.<br />
And, we are the precondition for an authentic human community.<br />

Observation One: the Mystery of Human Life<br />
The pro-choice ideology secured by the Casey decision grounds the law in a paradigm of secular rights-talk that eviscerates the very freedom it attempts to uphold by granting unlimited authority to the sovereign to make the decision on life. This promotion of the autonomous self necessitates the creation of the enemy “other” devastating the potential for authentic human community. Any coherent assertion of rights must be anchored in a recognition of God.<br />
Charles E. Rice 2005 3 Ave Maria L. Rev 259 l/n<br />
“For an assertion of rights to be fully coherent…insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned.” Justice is an empty signifier—the rights afforded by a secular reading of the Constitution invariably collapse in on themselves. This is why the “right to choose” simultaneously necessitates the “right to kill.” Legal positivism is moral relativism—any content is acceptable enabling endless wars and turning human beings into nothing more than “superior animals.” Only by grounding the law in an immortal destiny can there be a coherent basis for asserting transcendent rights of the person against the state.<br />
Rice 05<br />
“The above examples lead us to ask…Hitler is correct.” Freedom isn’t free. The conception of liberty made possible by the reasoning in the Casey decision attributes personhood to the ability to define one’s own moral universe. This serves as the foundation for the designation of the nonhuman—all life is exposed to the capacity to be deemed “insufficient.”=<br />
Jay Alan Sekulow and John Tuskey 40 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 945.<br />
“Second, Casey grounded the abortion right in an extreme…to draw the line objectively between persons and nonpersons.” The notion of the atomized individual made explicit in Casey enforces a state soteriology wherein salvation is only to be found in a social body of enemies. This religion of liberalism is inevitably totalitarian.<br />
Richard John Neuhaus 1996 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL572.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL572.cfm</a><br />
“This is most explicitly spelled out in the 1992 decision…the national creed established by the Constitution.” Grounding the abortion debate in a legal paradigm of rights creates a social body bound by nothing more than a mutual fear of death. Our bodies are not private, they are shared. The notion of inalienable rights reduces the sacredness of the body to a piece of property.<br />
Stanley Hauewas 1991 “abortion, Theologically Understood” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lifewatch.org/abortion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifewatch.org/abortion.html</a><br />
“Christians in America are temted to think of issues like abortion…the abortion issue our issue.” Life is a gift—not a supreme political value. The debate about when life begins obscures our obligation to bear witness to the kingdom of heaven. Our hospitality to children cannot be conditional—to welcome the others is to see the face of God.<br />
Hauerwas 1991<br />
“When many people start talking about abortions…everything else that we do and believe.” PLAN: the united states supreme court should overrule planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v. casey on the grounds that there is no constitutional right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe and the mystery of human life. Observation two: the stories we tell the function of the law is primarily pedagogical. the supreme court did not make abortions “legal” it made them socially acceptable without regret for the unborn. the plan is key – we must unteach this institution of hedonism.<br />
Goldstein, 96. (Robert D., Prof of Law, UCLA School of Law. William and Mary Bill of Rts. J. 787. Summer. P.L/N)<br />
“For Glendon, the expressive…. …. by persons holding a plurality of views.” the reasoning in the casey decision should be overruled. the mystery passage obliterates any criterion for wrongess – making it impossible to oppose national socialism which paradoxically cripples the liberalism it attempts to uphold. the plan clears the space for A new politicalS grounded in a more complete conception of the human.<br />
Scaperlanda, 2K5. (Michael A., Gene and Elaine Edwards Family Chair in Law and Associate Dean for Research, University of Oklahoma College of Law. 55 Cath. U.L. Rev. 5 p.L/N)<br />
“What are these anthropological assumptions?..... thick conception of the human person.” finally, Demarcations are inevitable – every position has an enemy – but the defining feature of a law rooted in God is that all enemies fall under the same category of being. Only in a paradigm of liberal humanism can the conditions for the subhuman arise<br />
Rasch, 2K3. (William, Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies at India University. “Human Rights as Geopolitics:” Cultural Critique 54 120-147. p.MUSE)<br />
“Yes, this passage attests to the antiliberal prejudices…… the irrefutable benefits of the liberal order.” Our participation in god rests upon an ontology of unity<br />
Cavanaugh, 99. (william t, Radical Orthodoxy edited by John Milbank et al. p.183-5) and, this question of being precedes all other considerations<br />

<br />
A/T util:<br />
1. No link-ev is a criticism of Kantian deontology which the 1AC indicts as aesthetic humanism. Deontology is the defense of abortion in the status quo. This is our Rice evidence-we signal a radical break from those notions of autonomy “util good” doesn’t assume our framework for morality-it assumes a false choice between categorical imperatives and hedonism which our faith in God transcends<br />
2. Their framework is incoherent-begs the question “what is a human”. That’s our Neuhas evidence-all life is exposed to the capacity to be excluded from their utilitarian calculus which renders its saving potential pointless<br />
3. This is impact turned by our Rice evidence: reduces humans to superior animals<br />
4. we solve the terminal impact: utilitarianism places its orienting principle as the “common good” this is only coherent if we can figure a vision of the content to the good (rice and scaperlanda)<br />
<br />
Topicality:<br />
Counter interpretation: a topical affirmative should overrule the decision by rejecting the ratio decidendi<br />
Dorf ’94 (“In some sense, one case never overrules anything but the rationale of an earlier case, since the facts of the overruling case…employers’ right of free contract”)<br />
<br />
We meet:<br />
A) Extend our Neuhas evidence-the mystery passage formed the basis for the decision in Casey-it’s also the most frequently evoked precedent<br />
B) We overrule the ratio decidendi<br />
Hickey ’98 (Justice Scalia, however, overvalued the weight of…ratio decidendi)<br />
<br />
<br />
Prefer this interpretation:<br />
A) Best for Casey-it’s a bidirectional decision-either no Casey aff meets their interp or a thousand do. We overrule the basis of the ruling-this gives the best ground-it was the bottom line in Casey<br />
Santorum 2005<br />
“The strands of these Court cases…philosophical extreme”<br />
<br />
B) The holding in a decision is the ratio decidendi<br />
Solum 3<br />

<br />
C) Only we meet the term “decision”-it always refers to the ratio decidendi<br />

<br />
D) The precedential force of a decision lies in its rationale-overruling it is the only way to change precedent<br />
