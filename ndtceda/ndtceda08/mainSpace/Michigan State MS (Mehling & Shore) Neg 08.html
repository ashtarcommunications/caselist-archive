The US should inform Iraq that they will remove their forces if Iraq continues any cooperation with Iran. After completing negotiations with Iraq and Russia, the US should offer to allow Iran to continue building light water reactors for the purpose of generating electricity, provide fuel for the reactors and return the spent fuel to the host country, support Iran's bid for membership to the World Trade Organization, provide additional economic aid and re-establish and maintain a diplomatic dialogue (in exchange for _) &quot;if Iran agrees to normalize relations with the US, agrees not to build nuclear explosive devices and agrees to allow inspections of all Iranian nuclear facilities in accordance with the Additional Protocol of the treaty commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty.&quot;<br />
