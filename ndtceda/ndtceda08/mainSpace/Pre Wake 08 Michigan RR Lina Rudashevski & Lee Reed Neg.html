Heidegger<br />
They may remove subsidies, but the ultimate goal is to create a more sustainable world that better meets the agricultural needs of people. The goal of producing maximum yields posits all things as resources and reduces humanity and the world to the standing reserve.<br />
Von Maltzahn 1994 (Kraft, Nature as Landscape: Dwelling and Understanding 48-50)<br />
<br />
&lt;Insert specific impact for aff's case&gt;<br />
The alternative is to do nothing. Their claim to finally fix the problem is just the latest grasp to calculate the world. Doing nothing allows us to reflect on the search for solutions itself, and our very positions in the world<br />
McWhorter prof phil @ Northeast Missouri state 1992 (Ladelle, Heidegger and the Earth Page 3-4)<br />
