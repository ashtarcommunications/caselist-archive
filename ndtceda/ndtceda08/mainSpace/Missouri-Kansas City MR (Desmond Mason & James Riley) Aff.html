Note: Want to rethink the political as well as plan text<br />
The Israel/Palestine conflict is based of the idea of territorial rights in the status quo there is nothing that both parties will agree on<br />
Johan Galtung. “NON VIOLENCE AND ISRAEL/PALESTINE” 1989 pg. 35-36<br />
However, I see the core area….… territory for themselves alone.<br />
<br />
And the Israeli’s belief that the Palestinians are only trying to bring violence upon them leads them to the mind-set that Palestinians are terrorists, leading Palestinians to a life of exploitation , repression<br />
Galtung again pg. 65-66<br />
And yet one might hope for more substantial levels of nonviolence …… …the ubiquitous equation Palestinian = terrorist.<br />
<br />
And, Our capacity for expansion and conquest allows and creates the myth that violence starts revolution. Each use of violence further affirms its ultimately in our society, creating a cycle of violence<br />
Stephen P. Wink and Walter Wink. “Domination, Justice and the cult of violence” Saint Louis University Law Journal, 38 St. Louis L.J. 341, Winter, 1993-94, Lexis<br />
The Fundamental belief in domination and redemptive violence……drains any hopes of escape.<br />
<br />
And Politics of security seek to define qualities that make others different and violently creates borders to keep the other out. It is not the size of the threate we construct toward the other, But the fact that it can be existentially threatening. This is what perpetuates an ontology of violence.<br />
Michael Dillon “The politics of Security” 1996 pg 97<br />
The political enemy he elaborates……exposes the violence of it. &lt;gender paraphrased&gt;<br />
<br />
The Strive for Security through violence has become so embedded in us that we accept it as being nature. Violence allows for systems of domination to continue, blocking a view of a new society where violence is not see as an option.<br />
Wink and Wink Again<br />
The most fundamental stories of our……desperately tries to keep hidden.<br />
<br />
The modern international system of security has put us on the brink of annihilation- we must question the structures of political powers in place or risk the real prospect of human species extinction<br />
Dillon again pg. 14-15<br />
The way of sharpening and focusing ……Prospect of human species extinction.<br />
<br />
<strong>Plan Text- The United States Federal Government should offer Palestine a security guarantee stating that the United States Will Never initiate or be complicit in any violent action on Palestine</strong><br />
<br />
The US is funding an propping up the Israeli war machine in Palestine—Without the US, it would not continue<br />
Palestinian Monitor www.palestinemonitor.org/factsheet/US_Aid_to_Israel.htm<br />
United States Aid to Israel: Funding the Occupation….…for the past thirty-four years.<br />
<br />
Palestinian nonviolence movement solves the border dispute between Israel/Palestine—Israel would have no choice but to respond with violence<br />
Galtung again pg. 54-56<br />
I use this as a background for the ……Islam started, from Mecca to Medina!<br />
<br />
Violence as a means of resistance only perpetuates the cycle of violence. Nonviolence allows the recognition of the others’ essential humanity and allows individuals to engage the system without succumbing to its methods.<br />
Wink and Wink again<br />
Violent opposition to the dominating system risks……of his “rightful” position<br />
<br />
Nonviolence allows for an acceptance of the others humanity and can open new possibilities<br />
Wink and wink again<br />
The old images may yet have …… humanity of all is affirmed.<br />
<br />
Security must be the point of departure in exceeding the current limites set by IR- It is the sole obsession of Modern IR<br />
Dillon again pg. 9<br />
Its contribution to that beginning derives…… than the metaphysical imagination.<br />
<br />
International Relations must be the focus of rethinking the political. It represents the most violence manifestations of modern political power and risks global catastrophe. Only by challenging the political thought behind modern Ir can we escape.<br />
Dillon again pg. 2<br />
Reimagining politics is …… remains largely unthought.
