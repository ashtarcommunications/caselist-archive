At the global level, arms limitation or prohibition …risks to their national security.<br />
SUBPOINT B: WORLD WAR III<br />
STRIKES ON IRAN RISKS NUCLEAR WORLD WAR III -- CHINA AND RUSSIA WILL INTERVENE.<br />
JAN, ‘06 (ABID ULLAH, “WHY AMERICAN WILL REAP IN IRAN WHAT IT DOESN’T EXPECT”, POSTED FEBRUARY 20, HTTP://MATHABA.NET/0_INDEX.SHTML?X=528456)<br />
Many analysts believe …the title &quot;World War 3&quot; can convey.<br />
Plan: The USFG should offer the government of Iran the following: an end to the economic embargo, unfreezing of all Iranian assets, full diplomatic relations, the initiation of talks on Iran's entry into the WTO, the encouragement of foreign investment, and a pledge to not use military force against Iran or Iran's neighbors. In return, the government of Iran must agree to the following: a verifiable and indefinite suspension of all uranium enrichment, an end to support for terrorist groups and activities, an affirmation of basic human rights principles under international covenants and a recognition of the legitimacy of domestic and international monitoring of these conditions, and a pledge to not use military force against the United States or Iran's neighbors.<br />
IRAN WOULD SAY YES TO AN INCENTIVE PACKAGE THAT OFFERED MANY THINGS IRAN SUPPORTED –THE PACKAGE MUST BE BIG<br />

Unless and until the US and Iran …regime were ruled out.<br />
OFFERING IRAN OPTIONS THAT IT FINDS VALUABLE WOULD SOLVE PROLIF AND TERRORISM<br />
TAKEYH, 07 (Ray, Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, March/April, “Time for Détente With Iran”<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070301faessay86202-p40/ray-takeyh/time-for-detente-with-iran.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070301faessay86202-p40/ray-takeyh/time-for-detente-with-iran.html)</a><br />
The most effective way for Washington …to achieve its national objectives.<br />
A GRAND BARGAIN OFFER TO IRAN IS KEY TO PREVENT WAR<br />
HUNTER, 06 (Robert, senior adviser at the RAND Corporation, “Time to talk with Iran” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rand.org/commentary/042606WP.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.rand.org/commentary/042606WP.html)</a><br />
The United States has given …continue drifting toward war.<br />
The time is right for the plan – we can’t continue to pursue narrowly tailored solutions to Iran – only an overarching comprehensive package of inducements spurs denuclearization and democratization<br />
MCFAUL, DIAMOND, AND MILANI, ’07 (FELLOWS AND COORDINATORS OF THE IRAN DEMOCRACY PROJECT AT THE HOOVER INSTITUTION AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. WASHINGTON QUARTERLY. 30:1 PP. 121–138)<br />
Perhaps our best guide for what …Heads we win, tails they lose.<br />
EVEN IF THE OFFER IS REJECTED IT WOULD STILL ENHANCE U.S. SECURITY INTERESTS AND SPUR DEMOCRATIZATION IN IRAN<br />
MCFAUL, DIAMOND, AND MILANI, ’07 (FELLOWS AND COORDINATORS OF THE IRAN DEMOCRACY PROJECT AT THE HOOVER INSTITUTION AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. WASHINGTON QUARTERLY. 30:1 PP. 121–138)<br />
If the logic of our argument is so clear, why wouldn’t …a comprehensive agreement.<br />
EVEN IF THE U.S. OFFER FAILED, AN ATTEMPT BY THE U.S. TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH IRAN WOULD RALLY INTERNATIONAL AND GRASSROOTS SUPPORT THAT WOULD PRESSURE IRAN TO ACCEPTING THE DEAL<br />
AMIRAHMADI , 06 (Hooshang, Professor of Planning and International Development and Director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Rutgers University, and President of the American Iranian Council, “US-Iran Relations: Perils and Promises)<br />
The opposition should follow by making …arena to competition.<br />
