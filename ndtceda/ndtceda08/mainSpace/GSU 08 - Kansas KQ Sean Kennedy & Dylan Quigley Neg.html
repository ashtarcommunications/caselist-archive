<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><strong>Gurze'ev K vs. Giroux/Critical Pedagogy Affs</strong><br />
<br />
The aff is an attempt to fight power with knowledge, treating marginalized epistemes as though they were self-evident- this pedagogy inevitably becomes uncontestable and totalitarian as it gathers politics towards an absolute telos of liberation<br />
Gur-Ze'ev (Faculty of Education @ University of Haifa) 98<br />
(Ilan, “TOWARD A NONREPRESSIVE CRITICAL PEDAGOGY”, EDUCATIONAL THEORY, Fall, V48 N4, BlackwellSynergy)<br />
<br />
From this perspective...realm of self-evidence.<br />
<br />
Giroux's critical pedagogy is the worst form of positive utopianism- he treats his project of liberation as self-evidently valid and ethical, and his educational model imposes a development path that forces the critical inquiries of students towards ends and conclusions decided in advance- this mode of politics can only re-create the hegemony it criticizes<br />

<br />
Giroux realizes and<strong>...</strong>politically very dangerous.<br />
<br />
Giving a to the oppressed reverses existing hierarchies, allowing the Third World to create positive knowledge about the world, to name it and integrate it into taxonomies of their choosing- this model reproduces the worst assumptions of Western knowledge<br />

<br />
The postmodern and<strong>...</strong>according to Freire<strong>.</strong><br />
<br />
Their politics fail and results in terroristic violence:<br />
1. Uncritical faith in liberation<br />
2. Deeply flawed understanding of power<br />

<br />
For such a...of this disregard.<br />
<br />
This project of counter education is one founded on a negative utopia, a refusal to accept philosopy as merely another attempt to return home. This is philosophy of diaspora can open a gate to an alternative way of being. This religious way of being promises no salvation, no redemption, no room for a secured overcoming and yet this manifests as the only ethical act<br />

FOUCAULT’S GENEALOGICAL CRITICISM AND ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE REDUCES BODIES TO ANIMALS INTERWOVEN WITH LANGUAGE- THIS CREATES A FORM OF FREEDOM THAT IS NEGATIVE AND ETHICALLY DEFENSIVE, ENTIRELY BASED ON FINDING A SPACE OUTSIDE OF POWER INSTEAD OF GAMBLING ON THE FUTURE<br />

<br />
This is why<strong>...</strong>under democratic materialism.<br />
<br />
POSTMODERNISM EMPLOYS A DEFENSIVE ETHICS THAT REDUCES BEING TO THE BARE, FINITE BODY AS A REMOVING THE EXCESSES OF LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE ONE INDIVIDUAL SUPERIOR TO ANOTHER- THIS REDUCTION IS NOT ONLY DANGEROUSLY BIOPOLITICAL BUT ALSO USHERS IN A NEW ERA OF NIHILISM AND IMPERIAL INTERVENTION<br />

<br />
First : democratic materialism<strong>...</strong>from Deleuze: 'minoritarianism'.<br />
<br />
THE DEFENSIVE ETHICS OF DEMOCRACY CULMINATE IN A BRUTAL AND CONSTANT WAR AGAINST THE OTHER- ALL THOSE WHO ATTEMPT TO ASSERT TRUTHS ARE LABELED AS INTOLERANT AND TARGETED FOR EXTERMINATION- THIS IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL THE IMPACTS THEIR ETHICS SEEKS TO RESPOND TO<br />

<br />
Communities and cultures...bodies and languages&quot;.<br />
<br />
THIS DEFENSIVE ETHICS HAS THREE IMPACTS-<br />
<br />
A.) IT ROBS THOSE WHO SUFFER OF ANY AGENCY TO ACT ON THEIR OWN BEHALF<br />
B.) IT JUSTIFIES CONSTANT WAR AND INTERVENTION INTO SOCIETIES WHO TRY TO CREATE POSTIVE CONCEPTS OF THE GOOD<br />
C.) IT MAKES ALL VICTIMS AND VILLAINS THE SAME, OBSCURING REAL NEEDS IN FAVOR OF THE IMAGE OF EVIL, KILLING SOLVENCY<br />

<br />
First, it turns...and totalitarian evils.<br />
<br />
THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO CONSTITUTE OURSELVES AS TRUTH-BODIES IN OPPOSITION TO THE AFFIRMATIVE’S CONSTRUCTION OF BODIES AS MERE VESSELS OF DESIRE- THIS POSITIVE CONCEPT OF THE GOOD OVERCOMES DEFENSIVE ETHICS AND CREATES AN INFINITE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD THAT ALLOWS US TO HAVE TRUE FREEDOM<br />

<br />
THE AFF’S REMOVAL OF SUBSIDIES IS THE WRONG REACTION TO THE EXISTING FINANCIAL CRISIS- RATHER THAN RECOGNIZE THE INCREASINGLY DEVASTATING CONTRADICTIONS WITHIN GLOBAL CAPITAL, THEY CONTINUE TO REMOVE TRADE BARRIERS AND ADVANCE THE POLITICS OF NEOLIBERAL INSTITUTIONS, ARGUING THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED FULLY ENOUGH AND THAT IMPERFECTIONS ARE INHERENT TO THE SYSTEM- THEIR CERTAINTY THAT THEY HAVE FOUND A SYMBOLIC SYSTEM WHICH PERFECTLY MAPS ONTO THE REAL IS THE HEIGHT OF IDEOLOGY, LOCKING IN CAPITALISM AND ENSURING GLOBAL STARVATION<br />

<br />
Compare the $700 billion...of human nature.<br />

THE AFF TREATS THE MARKET AS A NEUTRAL MEDIATOR FOR REALIZING ETHICS- THIS RELATIONSHIP OF DETACHMENT IS AT THE FOUNDATION OF IDEOLOGY AND MAKES HAILING CAPITALISM A PRE-REQUISITE TO JUSTICE<br />

FURTHER, THE AFF PARTICIPATES IN THE REDUCTION OF HUMANITY TO BUREAUCRATS, CONSIGNED TO UPHOLDING THE NEUTRAL LAWS OF THE MARKET AND DEMOCRATIC TOLERANCE- TRAPPED WITHIN THE SPELL OF IDEOLOGY, WE REMAIN UNABLE TO CONFRONT THE VIOLENCE OF THE SYMBOLIC ORDER, LEAVING US HELPLESS IN THE FACE OF THE MASSIVE GENOCIDAL VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY THE CONTRADICTIONS WITHIN CAPITAL<br />

“Another problem still...of our actions.<br />
<br />
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS OPENED A SPACE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF TRUE POLITICS- THE AFF STANDS FOR A RETURN TO BUSINESS AS USUAL, RENORMALIZING THE SITUATION AND ENSURING THE STABILITY OF THE EXISTING ORDER- THE NEGATIVE CHOOSES A DIFFERENT PATH- RATHER THAN VIEWING EXISTING CRISES AS THE FAILURE TO APPLY THE LAWS OF CAPITALISM FULLY, WE ASSERT THAT THE EXISTING CRISES ARE THE RESULT OF CONTRADICTIONS IN CAPITALISM- ONLY A VOTE NEGATIVE CAN CHOOSE TO DISRUPT THE CURRENT IDEOLOGY’S INEVITABLE TREND TOWARDS WAR AND ECONOMIC COLLAPSE AND SUPPORT THE POSSIBILITY OF RADICAL ALTERNATIVES<br />

<strong>Ecology K vs. Sustainability Affs</strong>-<br />
<br />
REMOVAL OF SUBSIDIES IS PART OF A STATE SYSTEM THAT REGULATES THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH ACTION ON PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS- IN THIS WORLD, PEOPLE ARE ATOMIZED AGENTS LIVING LIFE AS A SERIES OF BUSINESS DECISIONS, AND ONLY CORRECTING INCENTIVE STRUCTURES CAN CREATE POLITICAL CHANGE<br />
<br />
THE STATE IS THUS TRANSFORMED INTO AN ARBITER OF PRIVATE INTERESTS, REGULATING CONSUMER CHOICE IN ORDER TO PRODUCE DESIRABLE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES, LEAVING POLITICS TO EXPERTS CRUNCHING NUMBERS IN RATIONAL CHOICE THEORY EQUATIONS<br />
<br />
THE RESULT IS TWO-FOLD: FIRST, BECAUSE CONSUMERS REMAIN ATOMIZED AND THE STATE NO LONGER UNDERTAKES GRAND SOCIAL PROJECTS, ONLY FEAR FOR PERSONAL WELL-BEING CAN JUSTIFY POLITICAL ACTIONS, TRANSFORMING THE STATE INTO AN APOCALYPSE FACTORY CAPABLE OF MOVING CITIZENS TO ACTIONS- SECOND, THE TRANSFORMATION OF POLITICS INTO EXCHANGE OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE CEMENTS CAPITAL’S CONTROL OVER THE MODERN SOCIAL ORDER<br />

<br />
So where do we stand today… triggering a catastrophe.<br />
<br />
APOCALYPTIC SCENARIOS BECOME NOT SOMETHING WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID, BUT RATHER SOMETHING THAT WE INVITE AS A POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO CONTROL THE IDENTITY OF THE POPULATION- WARS BECOME A NECESSITY FOR MAINTAINING SOCIAL COHERENCE<br />

Perhaps. But to claim… scarcely be done without.<br />
<br />
SUSTAINABILITY’S FOCUS ON MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS AND ITS ASSUMPTION OF A HARMONIOUS NATURE LOCKS IN A POST-POLITICAL CONSENSUS THAT MAKES POLITICAL ANTAGONISM IMPOSSIBLE- THIS DOES NOT PRODUCE POLITICAL STABILITY, BUT RATHER SENDS POLITICS UNDERGROUND, LEAVING TERRORISM AS THE ONLY POSSIBLE RESISTANCE- THE IMPACT IS CONTINUOUS CYCLES OF VIOLENCE<br />

<br />
Post-political parliamentary rule… it into its radical travesty.<br />
<br />
THE OBSESSIVE ACTIVISM OF THE 1AC IS COTERMINOUS WITH PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT ECOLOGICAL CRISES ARE ON THE WAY, YET CONTINUE TO BE UNMOTIVATED TO ACT- BOTH ARE MEANS OF AVOIDING ULTIMATE CONFRONTATION WITH THE FACT THAT NATURE IS NOT A SYMBOLIC WHOLE, BUT INSTEAD IS A SERIES OF CONTRADICTORY NATURES THAT DEFY SYMBOLIZATION- THIS MAKES THE CASE IMPACTS INEVITABLE BECAUSE WE ARE UNABLE TO CHALLENGE THE IDEOLOGY THAT PRODUCES THEM<br />

the aff's impact claims are based upon appeals to certainty, as though their impacts had always already been weighed in advance, by god or by history - this makes their action not something they take responsibility for, but instead something that must be done, that is out of their hands - even if they actualized their dream of a world where our decisions are merely spit out by ethical calculators the result would not be peace, but an absolute violence that would preclude any possibility of interpretation<br />
Martin Hagglund 04 - diacritics 34.1, 40-71, The Necessity of Discrimination, MUST<br />
kw - thus, a rigorous deconstructive thinking maintains that we are always already --&gt; idea of absolute violence<br />
the aff's mechanism rule-based ethics cast off responsiblilty - the moment of uncertanty in every decision - have discoverd truth according to which the world operates - these caluclations inevitably have remainders - in a world of their ethics these become invisible - only a form of decision that sees the world as to-come and affirms moments of aporia can have ethical responsibility for the creation of others like the refugee - you should evaluate this first b/c it begs the question of the ethics of thier mpx calculus<br />
Dillon 99 Another Justice &quot;Political Theory&quot; Vol. 27 no. 2 april 1999<br />
kw - in the realm of undecidability, decision is precisely --&gt; that strangeness to the lapse of Time itself.<br />
And, this abandonment of responisbility for moments of interp is not merely an abstract problems w/ their aff but literally sanctions the on-going sacrifice of millions<br />
Derrida 95 - The Gift of Death pgs. 84-87<br />
kw - this applies all the more to political or legal matters -_&gt; nothing more than a murderer?<br />
<br />
ALT TEXT - the judge should affirm the plan as the possibility of the to-come<br />
Rather than passing our decisions off onto metaphysical rules, we should take radical responisbility for the moment of interpretation required in those decisionzillingness to simultaneously realize that justice is not being done and that a perfect justice is always impossible can allow us to probelmatize those others that are excluded by our decisions<br />
Derrid 04 - Rogues, p. 84 - 91<br />
kw - To this I would oppose, in the first place, all the figures --&gt; indeed of substantial or subjective substance.<br />
<br />
Our fwork interp is that the judge should suspend their faith in metaphysical basis for making decisions and take responsibility for the very act of decision itself -<br />
Every aff is simultaneoously a decision and an affirmation of a particular interp of what it means to decide - their attempt to elevate their particular method of decision to the status of metaphysics links to all our offense and begs the question of their justificaiton for exclusion<br />
Michael Dillon 99 - Political Theory Vol 27. no 2, april 1999 &quot;Another Justice&quot; p. 155-175<br />

kw - 2. while comprised of diverse interests, contemporary liberal thought centres --&gt; conform to constitutional expectation.<br />
structuralism DA - the perm solves none of the links to the 1ac - treats the alt as a new set of knowledge to be added to the aff's ethical computer - this strat treats the problem as merely one of finding the right way to make certain decisions and remains unable to question the concept of certainty itself as the basis for deciding<br />

kw - nevetheless, the center also closes off the freeplay it opens up and makes possible --&gt; God, man, and so forth.<br />
Hailing DA - the perm requires us to hail the ethical structure of the 1ac as a pre=condition for affirming difference - ensures that the to-come becomes subordinated - solves NONE of the links and makes massive violence inevitable.<br />
