Life begins at conception – abortion is inconsistent with scientific and moral reasoning.<br />
Diamond, MD, 2005<br />
[Eugene, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.culture-of-life.org/?Control=ArticleMaster&amp;aid=1444&amp;c=1&amp;p=1" rel="nofollow">__http://www.culture-of-life.org /?Control=ArticleMaster&amp;aid ?1444&amp;c?1&amp;p=1__</a>]<br />
The existence of life is intrinsic and .... Wade is on a collision course with itself.<br />
The refusal to grant constitutional personhood to the fetus depersonalizes life, fosters a culture of death that sanctions mass killing in the name of rights – the supreme court must address this wrong.<br />
Rice, Professor Emeritus of Law @ Notre Dame, 2005<br />
[Charles E, Spring, 3 ave Maria L. Rev. 259]<br />
The supreme court took this same route… “rights” runs contrary to their own “interests.”<br />
Plan sends abortion back to the states = racist culture wars.<br />
Nagel 2001<br />
[Robert, Colorado Law, 574 Annals 52, March]<br />
“There are plenty of reasons to think that we may be entering.. of violent opposition to school desegregation.”<br />
Court will overrule Stenberg v Carhart to ban partial birth abortion.<br />
Long, prof of law @ Willamette Law, 11/8/06<br />
[Bill, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.drbilllong.com/CurrentEventsIX/PartialBirthII" rel="nofollow">__http://www.drbilllong.com /CurrentEventsIX/PartialBirthII__</a>]<br />
“So contentious was the 2000 case of <em>Stenberg</em>… negatively through eliminate this procedure.”<br />
<br />
Planned Parenthood was founded by a racist eugenicist, duh – and it continues to locate its clinics in disproportionately black communities in order to cleanse the planet of “bark others” so the master race can rule the planet.<br />
Voth, prof of comm @ Miami, 2003<br />
[Ben, Life and Learning XIII, “Making the Best Arguments for Unborn Life,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://uffl.org/vol13/voth03.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://uffl.org/vol13/voth03 .pdf__</a> ]<br />
“The power of race is haunting legacy in America. . . silent compared to more shrill racial advocates on the other side of the debate.”<br />
Legalized abortion facilitates sex-selected killing of female fetuses – this sets society down the road to total gender-side.<br />
Voth, prof of comm @ Miami, 2003<br />
[Ben, Life and Learning XIII, “Making the Best Arguments for Unborn Life,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://uffl.org/vol13/voth03.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://uffl.org/vol13/voth03 .pdf__</a> ]<br />
“Sex-selection abortion makes abortion the most serious life threat… political bodies is an important basis for turning the argument of “women’s rights.”<br />
We must adopt a precautionary principle when it comes to the abortion issue – the risks are simply to dire if the fetus is a human.<br />
Oliver 2005 (Daniel, National Review, 5-9)<br />
“There are two possible errors… about the humanity of the fetus.”<br />
<u>Solvency</u><br />
The language of choice reifies consumerist values, comodifies the fetus, and leads to the worst atrocities in history.<br />
Liz, No Date Given (Pro Lifers For Peace and Justice, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ppj.bravehost.com/whybyliz.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://ppj.bravehost.com /whybyliz.htm__</a>)<br />
“The language of “choice” playus into the hands of consumerist values that the left claim to reject… shout for easiter access to abortion and sometimes arrange them for their students.”<br />
“Reproductive self-determination” is only a vehicle for the middle and upper class to perpetuate their class privileges.<br />
Zavarzadeh 2002 (Mas’ud, “The Labor Theory of (Anti)Abortion”, <u>Red Critique</u>, September/October, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.redcritique.org/SeptOCt02/labortheoryofantiabortion.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.redcritique.org /SeptOCt02/labortheoryofantiabo rtion.htm__</a>]<br />

It’s Legit:<br />
<ol><li>Literature – Its What Their Authors Actually Advocate, Not Topical Action.</li><li>They Get Resolutional/Advocacy Statement based offense – every aff that reads a text should be ready to defend it. Allowing them to read the text and not defend it is worse than not reading one at all – ruins pre-round prep and avoids stable ground, ruins strategy.</li><li>Crucial to test critical affs – hard to strategize when they take away our best ground, which their own authors advocate – opposed to supreme court action.</li><li>Presumption is Neg – Until They Read Evidence Defending Supreme Court Action To Overrule Casey.. the Status Quo is the Only Option.</li><li>It’s Net Benefit – see..

<strong>“FAITH” Critique</strong><br />
Debating our ideal constitution sidesteps the question of whether we should have fidelity to it – our hands aren’t on the leves of power.<br />
Balkin, Lafeyette S. Foster Professor @ Yale Law, 1998<br />
[ Jack M, “Agreements with Hell and Other Objects of Our Faith – Part II,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articlesagrhell2.htm" rel="nofollow">www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin /articlesagrhell2.htm</a><br />
“I emphasize this point because we might think that one… wonder whether the good we thought we were worshipping was actually a demon.”<br />
No Reason to vote affirmative – They cannot articulate any linkage between their prescriptions and practical, worldly effects.<br />
Schlag, Professor of Law @ University of Colorado, 1990<br />
[Pierre, Stanford Law Review, November, L/n]<br />
“In fact, normative legal thought is so much in a hurry… put any of its wonderful normative advice into effect.”<br />
AND, their conception of communication is normative – the affirmative views language as a neutral conduit for thought, which neglects that much of language is ineffective.<br />
Schlag, Professor of Law @ University of Colorado, 1990<br />
[Pierre, Stanford Law Review, November, L/n]<br />
“One answer is precisely that normative legal thought conceives its own linguistic situation.. participants in constructing communication.”<br />
Constitutional fidelity psychologically shapes the self on an ontological level – if the constitution is evil, fidelity to it as an institution enslaves us in the service of that evil.<br />
Balkin, Lafeyette S. Foster Professor @ Yale Law, 1998<br />
[ Jack M, “Agreements with Hell and Other Objects of Our Faith – Part II,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articlesagrhell2.htm" rel="nofollow">www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin /articlesagrhell2.htm</a><br />
“But constitutional fidelity, I think, is more than simply.. we do to ourselves in order to be faithful to it.”<br />
Turn – their rhetorical performance shields us from responsibility for our own contributions to material pain and suffering.<br />
Delgado, Colorado Law Professor, 1991<br />
[Richard, 139 Pa. L. Rev. 933, April, l/n]<br />
“But what is the cash value of all this priest-talk in the law reviews.. Supreme Court has been face with subsistence claims.”<br />
<br />
Constitution is evil it fails to solve – solidifies inequality.<br />
West, prof of law @ Georgetown, 1992<br />
[Robin, Boston University Law Review, September, 75 B.U.L. Rev. 765]<br />
“If that progressive insight is basically correct.. to be fundamentally at odds with progressive ideals.. its conception of equality.”<br />
The Affirmative’s rhetorical performance is premised on the idea of a rational subject with free will who can act upon the law and bureaucratic control – this is the basis for their solvency claims and the claim you should vote them – this normative model of subjectivity in fact is bureaucratic control – its essential meaning is the infliction of pain and death.<br />
Schlag, Professor of Law @ University of Colorado, 1990<br />
[Pierre, Stanford Law Review, November, L/n]<br />
“All this can seem very funny… academic and otherwise.”<br />

Andrew Cline, 2006, Rhetorica, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://rhetorica.net/argument.htm" rel="nofollow">http://rhetorica.net/argument.htm</a><br />
“Pathos:….appeals.”<br />
<br />
Framework: the aff must have a topical plan-focus advocacy and the negative should defend either the status quo or a competitive policy option. The framework for evaluation in this debate is the free marketplace of ideas- the only rules in debate is there is an annual resolution, and there are 2 teams who speak for the same amount of time, to ensure competitive equity and fairness.<br />
<br />
Perm- we can still do the aff and make a push for a l/e/p framework. Abortion si murder under logos, it has extreme emotional appeal. (Then they discuss how the act of an abortion has an emotional appeal.<br />
<br />
This is net beneificial- it allows us to affirm an ethical act and we engage in their format.<br />
- Community members would backlash in a world in which we stopped debate as we know it. Some people just won’t conform.<br />
-Logos is better because it is harder to manipulate<br />

Violation- Quirin wasn’t decided on the issue of Posse Comitatus. Plan creates new grounds that were not decided on. Plan does not overrule Quirin- Quirin no in the plan text, and plan doesn’t act on original grounds<br />
<br />
Additionally, “IN” not “ON”- Dictionary.com proves plan flaw. “On” defined as “so as to be or remain supported by” or “so as to be attached to” or “So as to be a covering or wrapping for”, where as “in” defined as “used to indicate inclusion within space, a place or limits.” As written, plan has zero effect and thus doesn’t overrule, because there are no US citizens “on” US territory<br />

Constitutional Faith<br />
A. They don’t have their hands on the levers of power. The aff team has confused their role with supreme court justices in it’s attempt to construct their ideal shadow constitution. Jack Balkin, 1998, “Agreements with Hell and Other Objects of our Faith – Part II” online “I emphasize this point because we might think that one answer to the problem”<br />
B. Plan doesn't happen, simulating plan as a supreme court justice without knowing the political future is the worst way to address injustice as it serves to sanitize constitutional evil. Mark Graber, 2k2 University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law, “This Essay explores the practice of theorizing about equal”<br />
C. The constitution is evil – fails to protect while aggressively reinforcing societal injustices and inequality. Robin West, 1992 Boston University Law Review, “If that progressive insight is basically correct”<br />
<br />
Capitalism<br />
Aff ignores the impact of integration on class stratification. Joseph Jaramillo 1996, La Raza Law Journal “People of color are more stratified along socioeconomic lines now than at”<br />
<br />
Integration undermines political solidarity among minorities – plan is a wedge for capital. Joseph Jaramillo 1996, La Raza Law Journal, “As people of color become stratified along class lines”<br />
<br />
Judicial focus on race blinds us to the heart of all oppression – class inequality. Wilson 2k, Akron Law Review, “the federal judiciary’s focus on race frequently came at the expense of”<br />
<br />
The constitution serves capital interests – a rethinking is necessary. Wilson 2k, Akron Law Review “Focusing on the relationship of the written Constitution”<br />
<br />
The drive for hegemonic imperialism is inevitable according to the logic of capitalism – only the alternative avoids multiple scenarios for inevitable extinction. John Foster Sept. 2k5 “Naked Imperialism” <em>Monthly Review</em>, vol. 57, Iss 4 “From the longer view offered by a historical-materialist”<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to not do the aff – capitalist relations should be withdrawn from and rejected, we must stop participating in rescue operations for capital. James Herod Jan. 2k4 <em>Getting Free</em> 4th ed online “It is time to try to describe, at first abstractly and later concretely”<br />
<br />
Regardless of our alt solvency, we have ethical obligation to get over capitalism – our utopian thinking is key to resistance and transcendence. James Marsh 1995 <em>Critique, Action, and Liberation</em> p. 334-5 “An example …. profoundly irrational”<br />
<br />
Cap wants to reorganize the ghetto to create a buffer class keeping dominant capitalist order intact. Robert Allen, <em>Black Awakening in Capitalist America</em> 1969 p 162-3 “In recent time…capitalism preserved.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Case<br />
The aff replicates structural racism of American history – invoking the myth of the court enforced racial equality while actually entrenching the very system of discrimination they claim to solve and distracting us. Girardeau Spann 1995, Cornell Law Review, “The present Supreme Court is very stingy on the issue of standing”<br />
<br />
Their conscious decision to use their agency within the construct of sovereign power is a decisive element that enables sovereign biopolitical control – the placing of individual subjectivity within the nation-state system is an integral component for biopolitics. Agamben 1998, <em>Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life</em> p. 5-6, “One of the most…techniques apart.”<br />
The state has the power not over our death but over life. Our biological entities are commodified into pawns of the state. Agamben 1999, <em>Remnants of Auschwitz</em>, 155-6, “4.9 As we have seen…human – survival.”<br />
<br />
Plan makes problems worse – focusing on federal desegregation policies masks the ways in which transracial education disenfranchises Black students. Pamela Smith, 1999, “Our Children’s Burden,” 42 How. L.J. 133, “The educational segregation of Black students is also not controlled directly”<br />
<br />
<br />
Disenfranchisement resulting from desegregation and transracial education is vicious and deadly. Pamela Smith, 1999, “Our Children’s Burden,” 42 How. L.J. 133, “The strategy of sending Black children to white schools”<br />
<br />
Desegregation led to transracial education and further White dominance over Black students. Pamela Smith, 1999, “Our Children’s Burden,” 42 How. L.J. 133, “During desegregation, the initial dominance of white educators”<br />
<br />
Focus on interdistrict desegregation repeats the mistake of making minority students bear the brunt of reform efforts that fail to address the systemic causes of racism. Pamela Smith, 1999, “Our Children’s Burden,” 42 How. L.J. 133, “And poor education does indeed place a horrible”<br />
<br />
Conservative courts will actively circumvent the Aff goals. Kenneth Jost 2k6, “Courts &amp; the Law: The Bush Bench” CQ Press, online, “Bush’s appellate judges often vote to make it harder for people”<br />

<br />
THE THREE CARDS I’VE READ ARE FROM PAGE 35<br />

<br />
PAGE 39-44 THE SECTION LABELED “THE DISCOURSE OF DEVELOPMENT”<br />
“What does it mean to say that development started to function … development became a force so destructive to Third World cultures, ironically in the name of people’s interests.”<br />
<br />
PAGE 34<br />
“The relationship between military concerns and the origins of development … a growingly unified North, despite the latter’s localized ethnic wars.”<br />
