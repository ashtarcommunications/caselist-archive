In establishing the relationship to the law, the affirmative provides it with the power of total subjection. In exchange for recognition before the law, we give ourselves over to its control. The law is like biopolitical quicksand – the more we struggle against it, the more it pulls us in, as our bodies become the very vehicle for state power. Unless we abandon the law, the law will abandon us, reducing us to bare life which can be exterminated with impunity<br />
Agamben 98 <u>homo sacer</u> p 49-55<br />
“4.1 In the legend…from the citizen.”<br />
Within this paradigm of sovereignty’s concern for biological life, the dissolution of boundaries between humanity, but reduce everyone to bare life, subject to sovereign management and control. This precludes an open, questioning relationship between different forms of life<br />
Agamben 2004 <u>the open</u> p 76-7<br />
“Today, at a distance of nearly…animalization of man.”<br />
Inclusions can only be defined in relation to exclusions and vice versa. As the 1ac points ou, humans are currently included in opposition to animal others. But collapsing the distinction between humans and animals forces the emergence of a new outside from within the more expansive definition of valued life. From this new exclusion emerges a zone of indifference that produces bare life, continually separated from itself – production of the camp turns thir suffering impacts<br />
Agamben 04 the open p 37-8<br />
“The contradiction that Steinthal…only a bare life.”<br />
Alt is a refusal to draw lines between bios and zoe<br />
Only such a strategy can reinstitute political power relations that allow for resistance to exercises of power. The affirmative’s move within the paradigm of sovereignty is no more than a violent call for lines to be drawn differently.<br />
Edkins and pin fat 2004 <u>sovereign lives</u> p 14-15<br />
“However, while possible and sometimes…refuses its grammar.”<br />
The animal in modern politics operates in a space alongside the refugee where they are perceived as part of a natural state where political vgalue is not extended towards them. The natural codes of freedom we assume in the modern liberal democratic state presupposes these distinctions which allow their active exclusion<br />
Laura Hudson 2008 “political animal: species-being and bare life” mediations, volum 23, no 2<br />
“The rise of environmentalism…the human and the animal.”<br />
Extension of animal rights merely creates new forms of exception, reinforcing sovereign power’s control over existence<br />
Richard kahn. Animal liberation philosophy and policy journal, vol 3, issue 1, google<br />
“Thus, via Agamben, Snaza…makes Snaza nervous”<br />
A2 perm<br />
By expanding sovereign control over life, the plan remains within a relation of violence that precludes resistance to the exercise of power. Only a total refusal to draw lines can reinstitute a productive power relationship<br />
Edkins and pin fat 2004 <u>sovereign lines</u> p 13<br />
“One potential form of resistance…preferably more inclusively).”<br />
Regulations of factory farms can respond to previous abuses, but they’re powerless to preclude and prevent future harms. The meat industry can simply adapt its practices to avoid the regulations imposed by the 1ac.<br />

Their radical destabalization of meaning, and focus on symbols, comes at the expense of understanding solidarity in the material realm. The aff shies away from state politics because of a fear of alienation and power. This ignores that any change in economics must be revolutionary, and unified. Only embracing material politics and institutions like the state can solve.<br />
