1AC—Inherency—1/2<br />
Observation 1 Inherency<br />
A) Reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan have been steady rolled back due to increased security issues.<br />
MORARJEE, Financial Times, July 26, 2007<br />
RACHEL, “Expanding Afghan no-go zones take a toll on health,”<br />
B) The U.S. is not supplying enough Provincial Reconstruction Teams to Afghanistan for reconstruction.<br />
Stockman, The Boston Globe Staff, July 10, 2007<br />

Observation II Advantages<br />
Advantage One Stability<br />
<br />
A) Afghanistan’s drug trade is flourishing, undermining U.S. security efforts and sustaining the Taliban.<br />

B) We have a unique brink—The Taliban is using narco-traffickers to smuggle weapons, fund the insurgency, and undermine the government; this will result in Afghan collapse.<br />
Schweich, Ambassador, U.S. Department of State, Coordinator for Counternarcotics and Justice Reform in Afghanistan, U.S. Department of State, August 2007<br />
(Thomas A., “U.S. Counternarcotics Strategy for Afghanistan,” Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, 2007 UNODC Rapid Assessment Survey, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.state.gov/p/inl/rls/rpt/90561.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/p/inl/rls/rpt/90561.htm)</a> mko<br />
C) And, we isolate two impact scenarios<br />
1) Afghani instability spills over into Pakistan, spreading terrorism.<br />
Fedor 02 – Nixon Center Staff Member ( Gregory, &quot;Afghanistan and Pakistan: Is the Glass Half Empty or Half Full?,&quot; August 8, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nixoncenter.org/Program%20Briefs/vol8no13Afghanistan.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.nixoncenter.org/Program%20Briefs/vol8no13Afghanistan.htm)</a><br />

4) Kashmir war ends in extinction.<br />
Washington Times, 2001 (July 8, LN)<br />

(Michael, “America is becoming more multilateral. And it needs help,” The Age (Melbourne, Australia), lexis)<br />
2) Unchecked terrorism will lead to extinction<br />
Alexander, August 25, 2003 (Yonah, professor and director of the Inter-University for Terrorism Studies, &quot;Demolish the myths,&quot; l/n) cnb<br />
Advantage 2 is Trafficking<br />
A) Afghanistan is a key source and transit country for human trafficking.<br />
US State Department, Trafficking in Persons Report, June 17, 2007 (RAWA News, “AFGHANISTAN: Human Trafficking for Sexual Exploitation,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2007/06/17/afghanistan-human-trafficking-for-sexual-exploitation.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2007/06/17/afghanistan-human-trafficking-for-sexual-exploitation.html)</a> mko<br />

E) And, we must preserve people’s dignity. It must be valued before survival because a world in which people’s dignity is not valued is not worth living in.<br />
Callahan, 1973<br />
(Daniel, director of Institute of Society, Ethics, and the Life Sciences, The Tyranny of Survival, p.99-101)<br />
Advantage 3 is Quebec<br />

James, 2/1 “Distance between Harper and foreign affairs won't be bridged soon”, Guelph Mecury, lexis<br />
