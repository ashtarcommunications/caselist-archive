FRAMEWORK: THE AFF DOES NOT DEFEND PLAN PASSAGE - INSTEAD THEY CLAIM THAT THEIR (JUST THE TWO OF THEM) ACT OF IMAGINING THE WORLD OF THE PLAN IS ENOUGH TO SOLVE FOR THEIR ZIZEK CATASTROPHE CLAIMS.<br />

UT BH 1AC – AS READ AT UCO TOURNAMENT IN EARLY NOVEMBER<br />
Contention 1 – imagination land<br />
Ideology thrives upon aim of the wholeness – reality would fit together right again if only we removed the ’thretening’ forces that stole our enjoyment. There rule however is that there is no whole to be found, no space where our constant deferral with the inevitability of catastrophe can produce anything but control Iraq proves our point.<br />

Zizek has been concerned crucially to…The way things actually are<br />
<strong>PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD INCRASE ITS CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN BY GIVING IRAN ALL OF THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S AVAILABLE NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY.</strong><br />
<strong>Contention II: traversing the fantasy</strong><br />
The fear of catastrophe is a biopolitical tool used to maintain the existing order, allowing life’s pleasure only when it is deprived of that which makes itpleasruable. Only by confronting the present system in the face of hthe risk of catastrophe can we make room to break free of the existing order.<br />
Zizek 2003 [ slavoj, “puppet and the dwarf”]<br />
Insofar as “death” and “life” … a kind of opium without opium.<br />
To wake up is to traverse the fantasy of stability. By realizing the fantasy directly through the imaginative function of fiat, we short circuit its operation. Traversing the fantasy is key to political engagement as no authentic politics can exist without it.<br />
McGowen, 2004 [Todd, “fighting our fantasies” pp 160-69]<br />
Because symbolic authority … authors a radical break. (this card is like 4 pages long)<br />
The affirmative resolves the crisis of ideological control by taking advantage of the opening that is provided by the lack of authority – critique serves political action by exposing the lack in that authority because it desire resistance. Without psychoanalysis we are caught in a hopeless engagement with politics where we are unable to confront our own investment in authority vote affirmative to wake up.<br />
Mcgowen 150-43<br />
“But ideology penetrates … the way ideology functions” (like 3 pages long)<br />
The point of reading a disadvantage against ourselves is simple: it is only through our acceptance of catastrophe as inevitable that we are able to adopt ourselves to sthat standpoint, and retroactively insert ourselves into the past. Such an act pens the space for counterfactual possibilities making real political engagement possible.<br />
Zizek 03 puppet and dwarf pp 163-66<br />
One should thus … in our present.<br />
<strong>Contention II (III?) Don’t fear the catastrophe</strong><br />
It is only through confronting the horror of catastrophe that we can break free form symbolic authority. So long as we constantly defer our confrontation with catastrophe we are forced to live within the shackled confines of the permanent threat of catastrophe. Zizek points out that living under such a threat is not a life worth living.<br />

In the war on terror … meant its exact opposite.<br />
Psychoanalysis is a pre-requisite to politics: understanding the philosophical underpinnings of status quo policymaking and failures key to formulating a viable alternative<br />
