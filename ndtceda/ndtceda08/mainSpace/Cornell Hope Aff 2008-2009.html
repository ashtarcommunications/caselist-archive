<strong>1. The Politics and Policies of Pessimism.</strong><br />
<br />
For centuries we have adopted policies and politics of pessimism toward Africa as a place of despair and inferiority. From the physical shackles of the slave trade to the financial bondage of the WTO, so-called developed nations have positioned themselves in the international hierarchy as superiors. Labels such as Dark Continent are examples of this false positioning based on the incorrect assumption of superior knowledge, status or right and result in protectionist agriculture policies that embrace the image of Africa as hopeless.<br />

</strong>Pessimism and negative stereotyping cause Africa to become invisible in mainstream representations, obscure reasons to be hopeful about Africa, and lead to devastating political paralysis.<br />

Invoking the caricature of Africa as the hopeless continent reinforces our racially-laced assumption that nothing positive can result there, entrenching the destructive pessimistic politics and policies of status quo .<br />

Ongoing politics of despair will have devastating effects  we must remain engaged constructively in the politics of social change to prevent looming global catastrophes.<br />

Politics and policies of hope toward Africa will move us beyond the self-fulfilling constraints of pessimism.<br />

Hope creates critical social reflection and constructive discontent  so by framing the world minus destructive Afro-pessimism we can successfully critique the oppressive politics that pass for everyday events.<br />

Grounding change in the policies and politics of hope will convert destructive notions of pessimism over inadequate conditions into a constructive and powerful pessimism  or skepticism  that promotes critical and practical struggle.<br />

Our political orientation is necessary to make lasting social change  hope provides us with the power to sustain our faith in movements  while relying on the politics of pessimism causes us to set our sights too low and fails to achieve real change<br />

A politics of absolute hope prevents sliding into despair and acceptance of the status quo, resulting in radical conservatism and withdrawing from politics.<br />
