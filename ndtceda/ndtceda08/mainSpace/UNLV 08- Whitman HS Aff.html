First, despite disrupted food and commodity markets the US is still increasing ethanol subsidies and refuses to acknowledge causal links between ethanol and food prices<br />

<br />
&quot;The current biofuels craze is neither clean nor green. Instead, it has disrupted food and commodities markets &quot;<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
&quot;subsidy from 51 to 45 cents per gallon--hardly a significant change. &quot; <br />
And, biofuel demand will increase despite food and environmental concerns<br />
<br />
Oil &amp; Gas Journal, April 7, 2008, “World biofuels demand rising, report says” NEWSLETTER; Processing -- Quick Takes; Pg. 10 Lexis<br />
<br />
&quot;World biofuels demand is expected to expand at 19.5%/year to 92 million tonnes in 2011 despite concerns &quot;<br />

Advantage One – Food Prices<br />
<br />
Advantage One is the price of food: <br />
<br />
Corn-based biofuels are the root cause of high food prices – The World Bank report proves alt cause arguments are simply wrong<br />
<br />
The Guardian, secret report: biofuel caused food crisis, july 4 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront</a><br />
<br />
&quot;Biofuels have forced global food prices up by 75% - far more than previously estimated - &quot;<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
&quot;subsidising higher food prices, while doing nothing to tackle climate change.&quot; &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage One – Food Prices<br />
<br />
Biofuels have caused a structural shift in the food market causing corn to replace staple crops – Shifting away from corn-based ethanol is a prerequisite to solving food prices<br />

High food prices are fueling instability in Pakistan – the government will collapse in six months unless the situation improves<br />

&quot;The problem is, however, that Pakistan may not be able to wait that long. By the time a new administration has begun to &quot;<br />

<br />
Bringing down food prices is necessary to stabilize the transition away from Musharaffs rule and preventing extremist takeover in Pakistan<br />

<br />
&quot;Second, developed countries should eliminate domestic biofuel subsidies and open their markets to &quot;<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
&quot;farmers should make decisions about what to cultivate based not on subsidies, but on world market prices for various commodities.&quot; <br />

Sugar ethanol captures all the benefits of corn with none of the harms.  Making the transition to sugar-based ethanol immediately decreases global food prices, avoids the economic damage caused by corn ethanol, and revives the economy by creating employment and government savings from the elimination of subsidies<br />
