 <ol><li>The negative must either accept this framework for evaluation in the 1NC or offer ONE competing framework and rationale for it. This is not to say that the negative does not have the right to conditional alternatives and counterplans, but rather that conditional frameworks should not be allowed. This demand is not unreasonable. Implied or assumed frameworks in the 1NC should not be considered by the judges at the end of the debate. This is the best model for deliberation and policy making because it allows the debate about framework to be at minimum discussed in more depth. – Edward L.

Round # 4<br />
<br />
vs Team: Georgetown FM<br />
<br />
Judge: Brovero, Morris, O’Donnell<br />
<br />
Plan Text<br />
<br />
Hence the plan: The United States federal government should offer the central government of Lebanon all necessary military assistance for the Lebanese Armed Forces to secure Lebanon’s borders contingent on the Lebanese Armed Forces conducting operations with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the Lebanese Armed Forces deploying to the Blue Line.<br />
<br />
1ac w/ cites<br />
<br />
Contention One: Hezbollah<br />
<br />
Initially not that LAF refusal to coordinate with UN peacekeepers to secure the border or disarm the Hezbollah undermines the power of the government and risks a future conflict with Israel.<br />
William Mooney, Autumn 2007, “Stabilizing Lebanon: Peacekeeping or Nation-Building,” Parameters, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carlilse.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07autumn/mooney.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carlilse.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07autumn/mooney.htm</a><br />
“Perhaps more significant than the increased size… something that could enhance the capabilities of the Lebanese force”<br />
<br />
And US aid to the ISF has made us look biased while weakening the LAF- US military aid to the LAF is necessary to stabilize the Blue Line, prevent Israeli over flight and avert war<br />
William Mooney, Autumn 2007, “Stabilizing Lebanon: Peacekeeping or Nation-Building,” Parameters, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carlilse.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07autumn/mooney.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carlilse.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07autumn/mooney.htm</a><br />
“The impact of targeted security assistance on internal Lebanese… military capability that might be considered threatening to Israel.”<br />
<br />
Reigning the Hezbollah and preventing over flight is key to stop an Israel-Hezbollah war<br />
International Crisis Group, 11/1/06, “Israel/hizbollah/Lebanon: avoiding renewed conflict” pg 13<br />
“With only few exceptions, the truce has held… an unsubtle hint that it might then heat up one or more of them.90”<br />
<br />
That new Israeli-Hezzbollah war will include full-blown missile strikes against Tel Aviv causing Israel to respon with nuclear weapons at Hezbollah and their allies<br />
Joel Leyden, 8/5/07, “Hezbollah Iran Missiles Slam Hadera Israel – Nuclear War Approaching?”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.israelnewsagency.com/harderaisraeliranrocketsnuclearwar4848070805.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.israelnewsagency.com/harderaisraeliranrocketsnuclearwar4848070805.html</a><br />
“Tel Aviv----August 5…… The only good hing about the terror group Hezbollah…. weapons to vaporize those who threaten our children”<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Leadership<br />
<br />
First note, failing to help Lebanon pissed off American allies damaged global US perception, and increased regional anti-Americanism – only by supporting the UN mission there can we regain leadership<br />
Philip Gordon and Jeremy Shapiro, 8/21/06, “America Has Emerged as a Loser in the Middle East,” Financial Times, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brooking.edu/views/op-ed/gordon/20060821.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.brooking.edu/views/op-ed/gordon/20060821.htm</a><br />
“As Israelis and Arabs continue their debate over who won… some credibility and diplomatic influence in the Middle East.”<br />
<br />
As US engagement of Lebanon restoring regional hegemony<br />
Elise Labott, 7/16/06, “US diplomatic options limited in Israel-Lebanon conflict” CNN, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://editionn.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/15/btsc.labott.diplomacy/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://editionn.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/15/btsc.labott.diplomacy/index.html</a><br />
“A peaceful end to the crisis… and particularly perhaps inside Lebanon.”<br />
Middle Eastern hegemony prevents power vacuums that make regional proliferation inevitable<br />
Khalilizad 95<br />
“In the Persian Gulf, U.S. withdrawal is likely… including the United States, would be harmed.”<br />
<br />
Middle East proliferation causes global proliferation that quickly escalates to nuclear war<br />
Stanley Kurtz, 8/28/06, “Our Fallout-Shelter Future” National Review, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OWU4MDMwNmU5MTI5NGYzN2FmODg5NmYyMWQ4YjM3OTU=" rel="nofollow">http://article.nationalreview.com?q=OWU4MDMwNmU5MTI5NGYzN2FmODg5NmYyMWQ4YjM3OTU=</a><br />
“Right now, the Indians and Pakistanis… difficult to stop them from escalating into nuclear confrontations.”<br />
<br />
Global Proliferation risks massively destructive nuke wars<br />
Utgoff, 2002, survival v. 44 no 2 summer<br />
“Widespread proliferation is likely… bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations.”<br />
<br />
And the world is waiting for the US to cooperate on stabilizing Lebanon and halting Israeli over flight. Failure to do so destroys US-European relations and allows counterbalancing alliances that risk great power conflict<br />
Al Santoli, 8/206 “Consequences of Lebanon, Iraq: New Alliances and Expanding Conflicts” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.asiaamerica.org/publications/aif/aif-08-2--6.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiaamerica.org/publications/aif/aif-08-2--6.htm</a><br />
“The high toll of civilian casualties and relentless… would be a major setback for the creation of civil society institutions”<br />
<br />
And support fo the European led border solution of UNIFIL is vital to restore US-European relations<br />
Liao Yuan 8/8/06 “Disagreement between Europe and US on Lebanon-Israel conflict” The People’s Daily, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.0437.gov.cn/Print.Asp?ID=585" rel="nofollow">http://en.0437.gov.cn/Print.Asp?ID=585</a><br />
“The Lebanon-Israel conflict has been upgraded… the United States had to coordinated with Europe and give way to it.”<br />
<br />
And US-European relations are key to maintain the global economy<br />
Robert Hunter, Winter 2003, Washington Quarterly, LN<br />
“Nothing has happened to lessen the importance of the continent of Europe… and European powers – politically, economically, and militarily.”<br />
<br />
Global economic collapse risks extinction<br />
Beardon 00<br />
“History bears out that desperate nations… and perhaps most of the biosphere, at least for many decades.”<br />
<br />
And US support of the UN shows a preference for multilateralism and increases US soft power<br />
Shashi Tharoor Sep/Oct 2003 “Why America Still Needs the United Nations” Foreign Affairs<br />
“The United Nations is the preeminent institution…. it becomes legally binding on all member states.”<br />
<br />
This soft power is key to leadership<br />
Nye, 2004 “the Decline of America’s Soft Power” Foreign Affairs<br />
“Anti-Americanism has increased in recent years… reducing U.S. leverage in international affairs.”<br />
<br />
US leadership prevents apolarity and multiple nuclear wars<br />
Niall Fergusion, 2004 “A World without Power” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2579&amp;page=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2579&amp;page=3</a><br />
“The worst effects of the new Dark Age… forces than rival great powers would benefit from such a not-so-new world disorder.”<br />
<br />
And US involvement in the UN is key to sustain the organization and prevent extinction<br />
Stephen Schlesinger, 9/28/03 “U.N. needs support form the U.S. to thrive” LN<br />
“The ultimate outcome of the San Francisco Conference… United Nations is as timely now as it was 58 years ago.”<br />
Contention Three: Solvency<br />
<br />
US conditioning is vital to galvanize UN-LAF cooperation<br />
William Mooney, Autumn 2007, “Stabilizing Lebanon: Peacekeeping or Nation-Building,” Parameters, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carlilse.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07autumn/mooney.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carlilse.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07autumn/mooney.htm</a><br />
“The provision for more and better-armed peacekeepers… that it has suffered for the past 30 years.”<br />
<br />
UN-LAF coordination along the Blue Line will undercut Hezbollah’s support<br />
William Mooney, Autumn 2007, “Stabilizing Lebanon: Peacekeeping or Nation-Building,” Parameters, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carlilse.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07autumn/mooney.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carlilse.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07autumn/mooney.htm</a><br />
“Second, UNIFIL need to coordinate… and diminishing the population’s reliance on Hezbollah.”<br />
<br />
And UNIFIL success is vital to UN credibility<br />
Kelly and White 12/5/06 “The UN Response to the Lebanon Crisis: An OCHA Lesson Learning Paper” Evaluation and Studies Section of PSB-OCHA<br />
“The scale, duration and intensity of the conflict in Lebanon… in the early days of crisis, but hen recovered, when the large relief program was implemented.”<br />
<br />
And US support of UNIFIL is the only way the UN can succeed just as US military aid is vital to strengthen the LAF<br />
James Phillips, 9/11/06 “Strong International Support is Required to Build Peace in Lebanon” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritgae.org/Research" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritgae.org/Research</a> /MiddleEast/bg1969.cfm<br />
“While the disarmament of Hezbollah should remain… and a similar one should be drawn up for the Lebanese police.”<br />
<br />
The government would say yes – they want military aid to compete with Hezbollah<br />
Stratfor 1/28/08, “Geopolitical Diary : Regional Games and Communal Tensions in Lebanon” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/geopolitical_diary/geopolitical_diary_regional_games_and_communal_tensions_lebanon" rel="nofollow">http://www.stratfor.com/geopolitical_diary/geopolitical_diary_regional_games_and_communal_tensions_lebanon</a><br />
“In this latest incident, the fact that Lebanese troops were… fragile political system, quite possibly triggering a new civil war.”<br />
<br />
The government want a storng UNIFIL and Hezbollah wouldn’t backlash<br />
Emile El-Hokayem, 9/1/06 “Can an International Force Solve Lebanon’s Woes?” Journal of International Peace Operations <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ipoaonline.org/journal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=28" rel="nofollow">http://ipoaonline.org/journal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=28</a><br />
“The Lebanese government wants an international force… beefed-up UNIFIL but not a new international force.”<br />
<br />
UNIFIL’s strength is vital to securing the border and preventing another Israel-Hezzbollah conflict<br />
William Mooney, Autumn 2007, “Stabilizing Lebanon: Peacekeeping or Nation-Building,” Parameters, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carlilse.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07autumn/mooney.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carlilse.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07autumn/mooney.htm</a><br />
The United Nations and American-led international response… the organization has deployed just over 12,000 troops, as of late January 2007.6”<br />

“In unravellin…military intervention”<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should publicly offer to the Islamic Republic of Iran that the United States should refrain from any preemptive use of military force against Iran or any threat of preemptive military force on the condition that Iran enter into a dialogue about Iran's human rights practices, including but not limited to the existence of free and fair elections, lifting restrictions on the freedom of expressions and the allowing the creation of trade unions.
