<strong>A. Microsoft Will Win Now – Key to Tech Sector</strong><br />
Farrand, December, '06 (James, Law Prof @ Loyola, Computer and Internet Lawyer)<br />
AT&amp;T: World-Wide Damages and Injunctions to be Restricted?<br />
In three controversial decisions in 2005 and 2006… <u>broad pro-patent rulings seems likely</u>.<br />

2NC ECON Scenario<br />
<strong>Extraterritorial Application Dooms Economy and Tech Sector - International Patent Law Solves Better</strong>Rafilson, '06 (Ari, JD Candidate, Computer LR &amp; Tech Journal, Winter)<br />

Gender K<br />
Dichotomizing masculinity and femininity essentializes identity rendering non heteronomrative expression invalid<br />
Butler 99 (Gender Trouble, p. 6-7)<br />
<br />
Category of woman is an example of how identity is controlled through commodification<br />
Rosemary Hennessy 2000 (Profit and Pleasure: Sexual identities in late capitalism)<br />
As an example of how identities….and very effective.<br />
<br />
Alt: vote negative to escape these hegemonic forces as the only way to articulate consent and choice differently from the 1AC context<br />
Hennessy 2000 (same as above)<br />
Materializing the tales of popular films…the shades and shadows of late capitalist myth<br />
<br />
Not voting negative is deadly—it renders certain people unintelligible, the root of oppression<br />
Butler 2004 (Undoing gender)<br />
One of the central tasks of lesbian….recognition takes place are not in your favor.<br />
<br />
And vote for our criticism as we have a better methodology for sexual politics<br />
Hennessy 2000 (same as above)<br />
Critique is a political practice and a mode of reading….consumption, and exchange.<br />
<br />
Cap K (only against Milliken)<br />
Supreme court serves as an oppressive mechanism to prop up capitalism<br />
Johnson 2000 [“is the supreme court impartial?” new youth magazine online]<br />
Yet ultimately,….to keep the masses subjugated.<br />
<br />
Racial politics reentrenches and masks capitalist hierarchies<br />
Young 2006 (redcritique.org, “putting materialism back into race theory: toward a transformative theory of race”)<br />
Here, then, is one of the primary effects…development of all (Marx 31)<br />
<br />
Ethical obligation to reject global capitalism<br />
Daly 2004 (conversations with zizek, 14-16)<br />
<br />
Alt: Embrace the immanence of revolution<br />
Zizek 2004 (Revolution at the Gates, 259-260)<br />
<br />
<br />
CMR DA to QUIRIN<br />
CMR stable now<br />
Rucgard D. Hooker 2004 (“Soldiers of the state: reconsidering American civil-military relations” online)<br />
For military officers working….the soldiers of the state<br />
<br />
Military hates being told what to do at tactical levels<br />
Ascribe Newswire 2005 (“Kansas State University Professor’s new Book discusses finding a balance between presidential power and military culture,” lexis)<br />
Dale Herspring, now a Kansas…tactical and operational levels,” Herspring said.<br />
<br />
Generals put us on slippery slope—now is key<br />
Center 2006 (Generals put us on Slippery Slope, google news, april 18)<br />
Now we have this unusual spectacle…for the resignation of a leader you supported<br />
<br />
Impact: breakdown of CMR leads to global conflict<br />
Cohen 1997 (“Civil-military relations—are US forces overstretched”)<br />
Left uncorrected…security cannot be taken for granted.<br />
Case—Against Quirin (Terror D)<br />
Terrorists prefer conventional weapons<br />
Parachini 2001 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2001_10/parachinioct01.asp" rel="nofollow">www.armscontrol.org/act/2001_10/parachinioct01.asp</a>)<br />
In the last 25….dramatic and deadly ways<br />
<br />
<br />
Terrorists won’t use or pursue nukes<br />
Waltz 2003 (The spread of nuclear weapons: a debate renewed, p 130)<br />
<br />
<br />
Terror attacks wouldn’t be catastrophic<br />
Mueller 1999 (Foreign affairs may/june, lexis)<br />
Nuclear weapons clearly deserve….the end of civilization<br />
<br />
<br />
Threat of retaliation solves<br />
Campbell 1998 (Senate judiciary committee subcomitee on technology, terrorism, and government information, april 22)<br />
Perhaps a much more compelling…convincingly self-defeating.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pres powers DA (v quirin)<br />
Judicial oversight destroys pres powers<br />
Ashcroft 2004 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fed-soc.org/publications/transcripts/ashcroft04.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.fed-soc.org/publications/transcripts/ashcroft04.pdf</a><br />
I regret to say…in a time of war<br />
<br />
<br />
Current battles will set precedent<br />
Knight Ridder 2003 (“Congress begins to push back administration,” april 1, lexis)<br />
Its to be expected that….vis a vis congress<br />
