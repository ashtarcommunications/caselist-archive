<strong>CP</strong> – The United States federal government should condition distribution of their business on farmers following better management practices including crop rotations, no till planting, and planting of high albedo reflective crop varieties. Excess production will be diverted to grain reserves from which dumping below the cost of production on markets in other countries will be prohibited. Oversight and enforcement will be guaranteed.<br />
