<strong>Piedmont EW (Lauren Evans &amp; Mary Beth Williams) Pre-Tournament Disclosure</strong><br />
Piedmont College will be running the following Affirmative cases:<br />
1.<br />
Thus we affirm the resolution:<br />
Resolved: that the US Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies, for biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat.<br />
<br />
Our Affirmation: We affirm the resolution as a site within which ruralism can and must be recognized. We DO NOT affirm the policy implications or the resolution because, as all of the 1AC evidence suggests, policy is always crafted from an urbanized mindset that marginalizes, excludes, and discriminates against rural dwellers. Therefore, we will argue that a recognition of ruralism and a shift in the way in which we think, talk, and construct policies with regard to rural dwellers and locales is a NECESSARY PREREQUISITE to both affirmatives and negations of policy action. Furthermore, it is particularly urgent that this act of recognition of ruralism precedes discussions of agricultural policy because it is precisely in questions of agricultural policy that rural dwellers are most explicitly overlooked, ignored, and disadvantaged. This happens because the federal government continues to view agricultural policies, like increasing OR decreasing farm subsidies, as “rural” policy, despite the fact, as Debra Lynn Bassett points out “only approx. 6% of rural dwellers are farmers. “Given this striking statistics, it becomes clear that agricultural policy is an insufficient remedy to the harms that persist in rural areas – harms that are largely the result of previous, historically destructive agricultural policies. <br />
Let us be clear: we are not saying that policy is always bad or that no policies can ever be good, but simply that in order for policy to be effective , an epistemological consideration of ruralism must be considered first.<br />
<br />
Framework:<br />
