<strong>AFF:</strong><br />
There is no plan<br />
<br />
<strong>Our affirmation of the resolution begins with an examination of the intersection between content and form, between agricultural policy and the education institution that is policy debate.</strong><br />
<strong>Education is the product of an agricultural ideology that positions humanity in an act of progress or cultural transcendence over nature. Both agriculture and education are rooted in a symbolic separation of humanity from the world in which it dwells.</strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">Modern agriculture and debate both serve to mechanize human sociality. Industrialized agriculture separates the food consumer from the process of food production, always seeking to perfect the act of food distribution. University communications programs try to produce more effective, alienated knowledge workers, always working towards an empty notion of progress.</span></span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">This signifying function of human progress could also be described as the task of turning babies into adults by teaching them how to turn ghosts into ancestors. Where we once had rituals and games, today progress is never complete; children must constantly manage the ghosts of our past in museums and and universities. It is of little surprise that debate, an activity primarily concerned with cultivating skilled communicators, is one that always attempts to manage negativity. In our progress from living being to speaking being, we are taught to exorcize the alienated phantoms of death and disorder, the remaiders of signification that our society cannot deal with. This will inevitably result in psychosis and nihilism</span></span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">Traditionally, debate puts us into this museam by forcing us treat the resolution as an abstract object that can be known and understood so it can be argued. This process of separation prevents us from finding a new use for the resolution. It is here that debate confronts its alienation in the world.</span></span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-style: normal">The resolution is intended to define a desirable direction of progress, but these are little more than abstractions that alienate us from agricultural politics as experience.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-style: normal">We propose a new way to approach the question of subsidies; We, who are supposed to role play as policymakers, choose to confront the way that we personally subsidize agriculture in the United States. The Online Etymology Dictionary tells us that to subsidize means “to buy neutrality or alliance”</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-style: normal">Our confrontation with experience in a world of alienation exposes the mechanization of social interaction at play both in debate and in modern industrial agriculture. We affirm the resolution as an act of experience, an act of ending our neutrality towards alienation.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-style: normal">We are not concerned with the political ramifications of the resolution. We instead open up the resolution for the possibility of a new use. We open it up to the possibility of play—we assume the alienation of the resolution, and give it a new use.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-style: normal">Rather than using the language of the resolution to produce a better political community, we recognize its emptiness, its impossibility. We free the resolution from its obligation and task.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-style: normal">Like a cat who replaces a ball of yarn for the mouse, or a child playing with an old religious relic- we turn the resolution into an object of fancy.</span></strong><br />
