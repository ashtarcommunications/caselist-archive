<strong>Plan: The United States Federal Government should eliminate its domestic subsidies for fisheries.</strong><br />
<br />
Contention One: Friends of Fish<br />
<br />
<strong>The US is already a leader in WTO negotiations, reform of subsidies is key to enhanced credibility. WTO regulation is inevitable, it’s only a question of how effective it is.</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Three Impacts:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First, EU Approach is Bad:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The European Union is resisting the US coalition by citing environmental benefits of subsidies</strong><br />

L. 141, “Negotiating WTO Fisheries Subsidy Disciplines: Can Subsidy Transparency and Classification Provide the Means Towards an End to the Race for Fish?”<br />
<br />
The EC agrees with the Friends of Fish … for vessel decommissioning and capacity withdrawal. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.592621.6581443885&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1221181606144&amp;returnToKey=20_T4545267860&amp;parent=docview#n146" rel="nofollow">n146</a></span><br />
<br />
<strong>The European approach allows overfishing to continue</strong><br />

<br />
While the EC's proposal appears … great difficulty overcoming the presumption of nonactionability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Second, US Approach is Key:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>US coalition, the Friends of Fish, are advocating an environment based standard</strong><br />
<br />
Chang, Dec 2003 Seung Wha, Professor of Law, Seoul National University, judge of Seoul District Court and taught at Stanford, Georgetown, Duke and Geneva Universities, founding member of the Permanent Group of Experts under the WTO SCM Committee, served on several occasions as a panellist and an arbitrator for the WTO dispute settlement, Journal of International Economic Law, “WTO Disciplines On Fisheries Subsidies: A Historic Step Towards Sustainability?”<br />
<br />
Not surprisingly, Friends of Fish collectively … and have led anti-WTO groups in the world.<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>A trade approach is useless - fish disruptions don’t fit into a trade model</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Third, Conservation Subsidies:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Status quo model of conservation subsidies are bad - abolishing subsidies doesn’t end the conservation mandate – plan forces the fishing industry to pay for government services.</strong><br />
<br />
FFITF 99<br />
Federal Fisheries Investment Task Force. 1999. Report to Congress, July 1999<br />
<br />
15. Government expenditures in support … such, they must be viewed as subsidies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>This is key to international solvency – 90% of US subsidies are conservation services and these are the main cause of overfishing</strong><br />

The most recent data collection by the … expands their unsustainable fishing methods even further.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention Two: Uniqueness</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The ocean is on the brink – overfishing destroys resiliency, outweighs any other alternate causalities</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
It is a matter of grave concern, therefore, that … major services to the planet – is degenerating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>This problem is vastly underreported – official statistics ignore subsistence fishing, underestimate fishing levels by as much as 17 times</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Contention Three: Predators</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The best study indicates that fishery subsidies directly cause overcapacity and overfishing</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
His field, bioeconomics, had been invented in the 1950s …difference between a renewable resource and a dying resource.<br />

<br />
Second, fisheries subsidies contribute to the inefficiency … even under ideal management conditions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Overfishing uniquely overwhelms resiliency – it destroys predators</strong><br />

<strong>Contention Four: Some Perspective</strong><br />

<strong>Probability outweighs Timeframe:</strong><br />
