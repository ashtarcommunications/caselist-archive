PLAN: The United States Federal Government should constructively engage the government of Afghanistan to provide support to the protection of the Trans-Afghanistan pipeline. This will include all necessary training and support of Afghanistan security forces and logistical support for the Trans-Afghanistan pipeline. The support of the United States Federal Government will be conditioned on the ability of Afghanistan to provide individuals who will become part of the pipeline protection forces.<br />
