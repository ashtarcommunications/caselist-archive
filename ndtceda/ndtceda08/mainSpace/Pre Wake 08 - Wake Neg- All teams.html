Text: The United States federal government should eliminate nearly all domestic subsidies for agrofuels. The United States federal government, specifically the Environmental Protection Agency, should waive the requirements of the Renewable Fuel Standard Mandates for ethanol production.<br />

<strong>Agrarian Myth K</strong><br />
<br />
The aff hopes to return to a world that never existed of homesteads, small farms, and pristine nature. Unfortunately, this pursuit of innocence constructs “what it is to be American” and responds violently to racial and sexual difference—<br />
<br />
Schlatter, Assistant Professor of History and Anthropology at Columbia State, 2006<br />
(Evelyn A., Aryan Cowboys, pg 104-5)<br />
Popular opinion and an American agrarian myth... that is exclusive, xenophobic, and, in some cases, deadly. <br />
<br />
<br />
The alternative is to reject the aff for their agrarian justifications, the presence of which make policy analysis impossible and call into doubt the objectivity of their harms—<br />

Browne, professor of political science at Central Michigan University, 2001<br />
