 <strong>First, the colonization of rural America is underway but the triumph of agribusiness is not inevitable – CAFOs are the vital node in the destruction of rural culture and ecosystems – agribusiness will destroy the land before initiating global flight.</strong>  <br />

Today, rural America is being “colonized.” … and begin rebuilding their own communities from the inside out, and this time, to build them sustainably – economically, ecologically, and culturally.  <br />
<br />
<strong>Specifically, large CAFOs will attempt to map out and ‘lock up’ one particular genetic biological model – this places all life at the brink of corporate-driven extinction</strong>  <br />

Like many other sectors of farming, the livestock industry has been …more often than ever before.  <br />
<br />
<strong>This industrial model ignores the lessons of 400 generations of farmers who left the Earth as it was offered to them – present behavior guarantees the extinction of all humanity – even if an element of the AFF’s method is wrong, making public stances against the influence of politically powerful agribusiness is a key site to generate social knowledge and political agency<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></strong> <br />

<strong>The AFF is a key form of counter-hegemonic discourse against the dominant social paradigm which dismisses sustainability in favor of profit – challenging the way material power is concentrated and accumulated is part of a re-orientation in favor of sustainable practice</strong>  <br />

<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span> <br />
<strong>Only sustainability can invigorate the intergenerational meaning of life – there is no social incentive or economic reward for environmental sustainability – the AFF is an act that transcends a single value order to instead enable a more basic focus on generation</strong>  <br />

Reaching agreement on the goal of sustainability … agree that a sustainable agriculture must be ecologically sound.  <br />

Many of the same institutions that oppress animals … see how complex the problem of animal suffering is.  <br />

PLAN <br />
<br />
<strong>The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support by eliminating eligibility for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program for all operations where animals are confined for a total of 45 days or more in any 12-month period and crops are not sustained over a normal growing season over the lot, and that either:</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>-- meet the limits established by 40 Code of Federal Regulations Section 122, or</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>-- have been designated by the Environmental Protection Agency as a significant contributor of water pollution</strong> <br />
<br />
SOLVENCY<strong>  <br />
<br />
</strong>Ending EQIP subsidies makes CAFOs impracticable – the plan is a key public rebuke of CAFOs<strong>  <br />

[Elanor &amp; Timothy, Research Fellow and Deputy Director of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts UniversityConfined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), sometimes called factory farms or industrial animal operations, are defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as livestock operations that do not sustain their own crops or other animal feed and that, “Living High on the Hog: factory farms, Federal Policy and the Structural Transformation of Swine Production, Global Development and Environmental Institute, Working Paper No. 07-04 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/07-04LivingHighOnHog.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/07-04LivingHighOnHog.pdf</a>]  <br />

Like many other sectors of farming, the livestock industry has been through a process of radical change over … farmers need to buy replacements more often than ever before<br />

At an intergovernmental conference organised by FAO later this year, pastoralists and small-scale livestock keepers … livestock breeds will continue to be lost at an alarming rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
This loss of diversity will lead to extinction.<br />

<br />
There is a future for small farms. Or, to be more precise, there can be … all of us share responsibility for the cultivation of agricultural biodiversity<br />
<br />
SCENARIO TWO is DESTRUCTION –<br />
<br />
The consolidation of livestock has devastating impacts on soil and water resources – directly as a result of animal waste and indirectly from feed production.<br />
PEW Commission, ‘7<br />
[Farm Animal Waste Management, “Environmental Impact of Industrial Farm Animal Production” Technical Reports, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ncifap.org/reports/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncifap.org/reports/</a>]<br />
<br />
Like many industries, Industrial Farm Animal Production (ifap) results in a number of environmental impacts … production model to continue to be viable.<br />
<br />
Second, feed crops place enormous stress on water resources – contaminating ground water and aquifers.<br />
Pew Commission, 8 [“Putting Meat on the Table: Industrial Farm Animal Production in America,” A Project of The Pew Charitable Trusts and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Industrial_Agriculture/PCIFAP_FINAL.pdf, pg. 27]<br />
<br />
Like other aspects of ifap (such as manure disposal), … drinking water supplies for a huge area of the United States.<br />
<br />
There is no alternative to the Ogallala aquifer – its collapse will spark a global food crisis.<br />

[Marq, veteran journalist, magazine editor and writer, who has worked as a foreign correspondent in Moscow, South Africa, and other places, Water: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource, Pg 161-162]<br />
<br />
The problem, though, is that the bankrupting of agriculture in the region … the geopolitical- consequences that constitute water's most potent crisis.<br />
<br />
SCENARIO THREE is FOSSIL FUELS –<br />
<br />
CAFOs use consume enormous amounts of fossil fuels<br />
Steinfeld &amp; Gerber et al, ‘7<br />

<br />
The share of energy consumption accounted for by the different stages of livestock production … fossil fuel for machinery generally exceeds that for fertilizer production.<br />
<br />
<br />
This reliance of fossil fuels makes the collapse of agriculture inevitable and will lead to extinction.<br />

<br />
The coming end of the petroleum age involves much more than the question … The coming collapse of the petroleum economy endangers us all – even the heads of the oligarchs are on the block.<br />
<br />
Alone these effects are devastating, but combined they constitute another degree of magnitude that must be considered on par with nuclear war &amp; global warming.<br />

<br />
Cattle are capable of receiving all or most of their dietary requirements from pasture … productivity was about 3 percent below that of conventional animal operations.<br />
<br />
Solvency –<br />
<br />
Subsidies to CAFOs are responsible for the industrial consolidation of animal farming – elimination subsides is key.<br />

<br />
FACTORY FARMING Factory farms are growing … It should require transparency and make polluters accountable for the harm they cause.<br />
<br />
CAFOs are at a unique economic climate – high grain prices have virtually eliminated indirect subsidies exposing the artificial supports that prop up animal confinement operations.<br />
Starmer &amp; Wise, ‘7<br />
[Elanor &amp; Timothy, Research Fellow and Deputy Director of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts UniversityConfined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), sometimes called factory farms or industrial animal operations, are defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as livestock operations that do not sustain their own crops or other animal feed and that, “Living High on the Hog: factory farms, Federal Policy and the Structural Transformation of Swine Production, Global Development and Environmental Institute, Working Paper No. 07-04 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/07-04LivingHighOnHog.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/07-04LivingHighOnHog.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
We conclude that in an economic climate of full-cost feed … favored large-scale industrial animal production.<br />
<br />
<br />
High grain prices support a shift to diversified animal operations but ending EQIP subsidies and loopholes is the only way to reverse the economic slide of small farmers.<br />

<br />
The corporations that dominate the industrial livestock sector … might begin to reverse their downward economic slide (NFFC 2005).<br />
<br />
EQIP subsidies uniquely impact small farms – the new language is designed to support industrial operations.<br />
Gurian-Sherman, ‘8<br />

<br />
EQIP originated as part of the 1985 farm bill and was renewed … Most EQIP applications therefore remain unfunded.<br />
<br />
The NEG will say we should more strictly enforce new pollution controls – but absent the plan new regulations will favor large operation and increase consolidation.<br />

<br />
The animal feeding industry is actively seeking new technologies … then acquired by larger firms, increasing industry concentration.
