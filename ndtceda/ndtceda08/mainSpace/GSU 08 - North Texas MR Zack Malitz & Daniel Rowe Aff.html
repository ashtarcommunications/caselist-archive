Part 1 – The Father of Chemical Warfare<br />
<br />
Fritz Haber was born December 9 1868 into a family of German Jews living in Breslau. From an early age Fritz dreamed of transcending his life in Breslau, not content to inherit his father’s business. This desire brought Fritz into constant conflict with his cautious father who refused to support Fritz’s dreams of attending university. Finally, in response to his cousin Hermann’s urgings, Siegfried relented and Fritz left for Berlin in 1886.<br />
<br />
The conflict between the younger and the elder Haber was more than a family conflict it was a generation gap. Fritz was of the first generation of Prussian Jews to expect equal treatment…as a German citizen. In 1871, under Kaiser Wilhelm I, Germany abolished all restrictions on civil rights based on religious difference. Haber’s desire to transcend his past was very much that of his nation as a whole – now unified, the German future was bright and open.<br />
<br />
Germany’s unification and subsequent rise to power profoundly affected Haber. He drank in the nationalism of the time and, along with it, adopted a profound faith in science and progress. Germany’s industrial revolution was driven by coal, after all, and each new scientific or industrial breakthrough was cause for celebration.<br />
<br />
This is what led Haber to the science that he would study and practice for his entire life: chemistry. Coal was the benefactor of the newly industrialized German state, and it was chemistry that had unlocked its secrets. His patriotism also led him to be baptized a Christian in 1892, all the better to be a loyal civil servant for Germany.<br />
<br />
By 1900, European scientists had realized that unless a new way to fix nitrogen was found, human population growth could not continue. Up until this point, all fixed nitrogen used in agriculture came either from nitrogen fixing bacteria that live on the roots of legumes or from nitrate mines in Chile. But the mines were running out and a new, industrial process of fixing nitrogen became necessary. Agriculture at the time set a fixed limit on the human population – the inability to manufacture nitrogen caused famine when the demand for food outstripped the amount that could be grown on existing fertile land.<br />
<br />
In 1909 Haber discovered a process that, through immense amounts of heat and pressure, could break the bonds that held together atmospheric nitrogen and fix it with hydrogen. Hailed as “bread out of air” this discovery won Haber the Nobel prize 1918 for “improving the standard of agriculture and the well-being of man-kind.”<br />
<br />
By 1910 Haber had grown successful and wealthy. Now the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of physical chemistry and electrochemistry in Berlin Haber believed himself to be fighting an arms race between nations that took the form of scientific knowledge. This metaphorical military endeavor soon became quite literal as Haber explored the dark side of fixed nitrogen, which is the key ingredient in modern munitions and explosives.<br />
<br />
At the dawn of world war I Haber volunteered for military duty and worked to discover an industrial process for churning out enough nitrate and nitric acid to fuel the German war machine.. By May 1915 the first nitrate factory opened and began producing the raw ingredients for the war effort.<br />
<br />
Haber then turned his attention to a new kind of warfare: poison gas. Originally developed as pesticides to be used in agriculture, these gases were now deployed on the battlefield to force soldiers from their trenches. At 6 PM on April 22 1915 German forces, with Haber on the front lines giving orders, released the first chlorine gas attack on French and Canadian lines. Haber defended gas warfare from its critics by calling it a technological imperative, just another expression of progress. <br />
<br />
On May 15th of the same year, Haber’s wife Clara, also a talented chemist, walked out into the garden of their home and shot herself in the chest with Haber’s service revolver. Clara had been unhappy since she and Haber married. Though she was the first female to attain a PhD from the University of Breslau she was forced by her marriage to Haber to leave her profession. She continued to work as Haber’s assistant, translating his work into English, but never received recognition as anything but a homemaker. Fiercely opposed to the use of poison gas, it is possible that her suicide was a protest against Haber’s research.<br />
<br />
Fritz Haber had absolute faith in two things: scientific progress and the German state. It is the tragedy of his life that both had a dark side and that his arrogant faith made him blind. His nitrogen and gas research made industrial agriculture possible and, at the same time, industrial warfare. Similarly, the patriotic “spirit of 1914” that he loyally served for most of his life was ultimately resurrected as the Third Reich.<br />
<br />
The Nazis had a new definition of Jewishness based in blood rather than belief, leaving no place for those patriotic Jews like Haber. The same process of nitrogen-fixation that Haber had rushed to re-engineer for the production of munitions at the dawn of World War I was once again put to use to feed the German war machine; the chemical Zyklon B that traced its lineage from Haber’s chemical weapons research during World War I through his illegal research after the Treaty of Versailles was now put to use in the gas chamber of Auschwitz and Haber fled Germany - a broken man never again to know a home. He died in Switzerland on January 29 1934 after fleeing the Nazis. <br />
<br />
Our intent is not to judge Haber – his life is undoubtedly tragic, but our goal is to learn from his life. In the history of agriculture Haber stands above the rest – though he was until recently banished from history, he gave to agriculture everything that it needed to truly begin to make history, enter the industrial age and shape, in ways we are only beginning to understand, planet Earth. <br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">All life depends on nitrogen; it is the building block from which nature assembles amino acids, proteins and nucleic acid</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt">; the genetic information that orders and perpetuates life is written in nitrogen ink. <u>But the supply of usable nitrogen on earth is limited.</u> Although earth's atmosphere is about 80 percent nitrogen, all those atoms are tightly paired, nonreactive and therefore useless; the 19th-century chemist Justus von Liebig spoke of atmospheric nitrogen's &quot;indifference to all other substances.&quot; <u>To be of any value to plants and animals</u>, these self-involved <u>nitrogen atoms must be split and then joined to atoms of hydrogen.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">Chemists call this process</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt"> of taking atoms from the atmosphere and combining them into molecules useful to living things <u>&quot;fixing&quot;</u> that element. <u>Until a German Jewish chemist named Fritz Haber figured out how to turn this trick in 1909, all the usable nitrogen on earth had at one time been fixed by soil bacteria living on the roots of leguminous plants</u> (such as peas or alfalfa or locust trees) <u>or,</u> less commonly, by the shock of <u>electrical lightning</u>, which can break nitrogen bonds in the air, releasing a light rain of fertility. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt">In his book Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch and the Transformation of World Food Production, Vaclav Smil pointed out that <u>&quot;there is no way to grow crops and human bodies without nitrogen.&quot; Before Haber's invention, the sheer amount of life earth could support</u>--the size of crops and therefore the number of human bodies--<u>was limited by the amount of nitrogen that bacteria and lightning could fix.</u> <u>By 1900, European scientists had recognized that unless a way was found to augment this naturally occurring nitrogen, the growth of the human population would soon grind to a very painful halt.</u> The same recognition by Chinese scientists a few decades later is probably what compelled China's opening to the West: after Nixon's 1972 trip, the first major order the Chinese government placed was for 13 massive fertilizer factories. Without them, China would have starved. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt">This is why it may not be hyperbole to claim, as Smil does, that <u>the Haber-Bosch process for fixing nitrogen</u> (Bosch gets the credit for commercializing Haber's idea) <u>is the most important invention of the 20th century.</u> He estimates that <u>two of every five humans on earth today would not be alive if not for Fritz Haber's invention.</u> We can easily imagine a world without computers or electricity, Smil points out, but <u>without synthetic fertilizer billions of people would never have been born. Though, as these numbers suggest, humans may have struck a Faustian bargain with nature when Fritz Haber gave us the power to fix nitrogen.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt">Fritz Haber? No, I'd never heard of him either, even though he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1918 for &quot;improving the standards of agriculture and the well-being of mankind.&quot; But the reason for his obscurity has less to do with the importance of his work than an ugly twist of his biography, which recalls the dubious links between modern warfare and industrial agriculture: during World War I, Haber threw himself into the German war effort, and his chemistry kept alive Germany's hopes for victory, by allowing it to make bombs from synthetic nitrate. Later, Haber put his genius for chemistry to work developing poison gases--ammonia, then chlorine. (He subsequently developed Zyklon B, the gas used in Hitler's concentration camps.) His wife, a chemist sickened by her husband's contribution to the war effort, used his army pistol to kill herself; Haber died, broken and in flight from Nazi Germany, in a Basel hotel room in 1934. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">His story has been all but written out of the 20th century. But it embodies the paradoxes of science, the double edge to our manipulations of nature, the good and evil that can flow</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt"> not only from the same man but <u>from the same knowledge. Even Haber's agricultural benefaction has proved to be a decidedly mixed blessing.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">When humankind acquired the power to fix nitrogen, the basis of soil fertility shifted</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt"> from a total reliance on the energy of the sun <u>to a new reliance on fossil fuel.</u> That's because the Haber-Bosch process works by combining nitrogen and hydrogen gases under immense heat and pressure in the presence of a catalyst. <u>The heat and pressure are supplied by prodigious amounts of electricity, and the hydrogen is supplied by oil, coal or</u>, most commonly today, <u>natural gas</u>. True, these fossil fuels were created by the sun, billions of years ago, but they are not renewable in the same way that the fertility created by a legume nourished by sunlight is. (That nitrogen is fixed by a bacterium living on the roots of the legume, which trades a tiny drip of sugar for the nitrogen the plant needs.) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt">Liberated from the old biological constraints, <u>the farm could now be managed on industrial principles, as a factory transforming inputs of</u> raw material--<u>chemical fertilizer--into outputs of corn.</u> And corn adapted brilliantly to the new industrial regime, consuming prodigious quantities of fossil fuel energy and turning out ever more prodigious quantities of food energy. <u>Growing corn</u>, which from a biological perspective had always been a process of capturing sunlight to turn it into food, <u>has</u> in no small measure <u>become a process of converting fossil fuels into food. More than half of all the synthetic nitrogen made today is applied to corn.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">From the standpoint of industrial efficiency, it's too bad we can't simply drink petroleum directly, because there's a lot less energy in a bushel of corn </span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt">(measured in calories) <u>than there is in the half-gallon of oil required to produce it. Ecologically, this is a fabulously expensive way to produce food--but &quot;ecologically&quot; is no longer the operative standard. In the factory, time is money, and yield is everything.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">One problem with factorie</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt">s, as opposed to biological systems, <u>is that they tend to pollute.</u> Hungry for fossil fuel as hybrid corn is, farmers still feed it far more than it can possibly eat, wasting most of the fertilizer they buy. And <u>what happens to that synthetic nitrogen the plants don't take up? Some of it evaporates into the air, where it acidifies the rain and contributes to global warming. Some seeps down to the water table, whence it may come out of the tap. The nitrates in water bind to hemoglobin, compromising the blood's ability to carry oxygen to the brain.</u> (I guess I was wrong to suggest we don't sip fossil fuels directly; sometimes we do.) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">It has been less than a century since Fritz Haber's invention, yet already it has changed earth's ecology. More than half of the world's supply of usable nitrogen is now man-made</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt">. (Unless you grew up on organic food, most of the kilo or so of nitrogen in your body was fixed by the Haber-Bosch process.) <u>&quot;We have perturbed the global nitrogen cycle,&quot;</u> Smil wrote, <u>&quot;more than any other, even carbon.&quot; The effects may be harder to predict than the effects of the global warming caused by our disturbance of the carbon cycle, but they are no less momentous.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">The flood of synthetic nitrogen has fertilized not just the farm fields but the forests and oceans, too, to the benefit of some species</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt"> (corn and algae being two of the biggest beneficiaries) <u>and to the detriment of countless others. The ultimate fate of the nitrates spread in Iowa or Indiana is to flow down the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico, where their deadly fertility poisons the marine ecosystem. The nitrogen tide stimulates the wild growth of algae, and the algae smother the fish, creating a</u> &quot;hypoxic,&quot; or <u>dead,</u> <u>zone as big as New Jersey--and still growing. By fertilizing the world, we alter the planet's composition of species and shrink its biodiversity.</u> </span><br />

Part 2 – The Killer of Continents<br />
<br />
There is a special connection between this years topic and Haber. It was the Haber-Bosch process of nitrogen fixation that made it possible for the USDA, under the leadership of Nixon’s secretary of agriculture Earl Butz, to shift its policy from price-support for commodity crops that discouraged overproduction to a policy of overproduction supported by the 1973 Farm Bill subsidies – thus was born industrial agribusiness<br />
<br />
Jodi Soyars Windham 2007 [accessed from lexis 9/1/08; “Putting Your Money Where Your Mouth Is: Perverse Food Subsidies, Social Responsibility &amp; America’s 2007 Farm Bill”; Environs: Environmental Law &amp; Policy Journal Fall 2007]<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">By 1950, machines had finally replaced the farm's horses and mules and,</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt"> <u>with the use of chemical fertilizers, farm production shot up</u> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt">again. 29 While the ability to make fertilizers had been around since 1909, it was not economically feasible to produce them until World War II. 30 During the war, the chemical industry expanded to fill military requirements and this produced byproducts that could be used advantageously in manufacturing chemical fertilizers. 31 The government permitted farmers to use these byproducts during the war to the extent it did not interfere with wartime operations. 32 After the war, as the government converted its wartime chemical factories and supplies into peacetime purposes, the Department of Agriculture began promoting the use of America's stockpiled ammonium nitrate (an ingredient used to make explosives) [*8] as fertilizer for America's farmland. 33</span><span style="font-size: 10pt"> <u>These events ushered in the age of industrial agriculture.</u> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt">34 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">Industrial farming is different from other methods of farming in that it breaks down a rather complex naturally occurring phenomenon based on sun power and biodiversity into a fossil-fueled mechanical process that relies on chemical fertilizer<u>.</u> 35 Chemical fertilizers circumvent the naturally occurring process of &quot;fixing&quot; nitrogen to the soil by combining nitrogen and hydrogen gases under immense heat and pressure in the presence of a catalyst. 36 This process requires fossil fuels to supply the hydrogen and an enormous amount of electricity to supply the heat and pressure. 37 As Vaclav Smil explained it in Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production: </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">Liberated from the old biological constraints, the farm could now be managed on industrial principles, as a factory transforming inputs of raw material - chemical fertilizer - into outputs of [crops].</span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt"> Since the farm no longer needs to generate and conserve its own fertility by maintaining a diversity of species, synthetic fertilizer opens the way to monoculture, allowing the farmer to bring the factory's economies of scale and mechanical efficiency to nature.</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt"> 38 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">In the factory, time is money and chemical fertilizer helped cut out nature's time consuming process of maintaining soil fertility all together</span><span style="font-size: 10pt">. <u>Because fertilizers made traditional crop rotation and biodiversity unnecessary the new factory farm's monoculture crops were soon plagued with pests, insects, and weeds.</u> <u>39 Farmers turned once again to chemicals to solve the problem: poison gases that were produced for the war</u>, such as napalm and Agent Orange, <u>were converted into chemical pesticides.</u> 40 <u>With the help of World War II's chemical</u> [*9] <u>factories and supplies, American farms quickly started to transition from biological farming systems into factory farms.</u> 41 <u>Soon, American farmers were producing more than anyone ever imagined possible. The problem was what to do with all this overproduction.</u> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">Savvy American businessmen and the federal government were quick to capitalize on the overproduction by selling it to foreign markets for a profit.</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt">In the fall of 1972, the Republican Party was instrumental in arranging the sale of thirty million tons of American grain to Russia, which was suffering from a series of disastrous harvests. 42 The deal helped boost crop prices and win pivotal farm votes for Richard Nixon in the 1972 presidential election. 43 As luck would have it, though, the enormous surge in demand coincided with &quot;a spell of bad weather in the farm belt&quot; and grain prices reached an historic high. 44 While the increased farm prices helped Nixon win in 1972, by the spring of 1973 the increased farm prices were starting to hit the supermarket. 45 Grocery prices were increasing dramatically and housewives were protesting. 46 Middle-class Americans had become accustomed to consuming meat and the &quot;price of beef was slipping beyond the reach of the middle-class consumers.&quot; 47 With a consumer revolt on their hand</span><span style="font-size: 10pt">s, <u>the American farm system was re-engineered to drive down prices and encourage farmers to vastly increase their output.</u> 48 <u>The goal was to provide plenty of cheap food for Americans to eat at home while permitting America to capitalize on the food surpluses by selling abroad.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">B. The Dominance of Industrial Agriculture </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">While most other New Deal programs were abolished or scaled back between 1975 and 1985 in a bipartisan wave of deregulation</span><span style="font-size: 10pt">, <u>agricultural subsidies survived as politicians tried to reconcile America's export opportunities with the consumption demands of American consumers.</u> 49 <u>It was clear that with the help of fertilizers America could do both. Under the leadership of Earl Butz, the second secretary of agriculture for Richard Nixon, the U.S. farm policies shifted from a system designed to prop up food prices and stabilize farmers' income to a</u> [*10<u>] system designed to encourage overproduction and drive down the cost of food.</u> 50 </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">The 1973 Farm Bill rolled out a revolutionary system of deficiency payments.</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt"> 51 <u>Instead of keeping Commodity Crops out of a falling market, as the &quot;non-recourse loans&quot; had done</u>, <u>the new deficiency payments were paid directly to the farmers and this encouraged farmers to sell their grain at any price because the government would make up the difference.</u> <u>52 The payment amount farmers received was directly linked to the farmer's yield so the more the farmer produced the more subsidies he received. The new system of deficiency payments gave farmers &quot;little incentive to rotate subsidized crops</u> <u>with grass, alfalfa, or other soil-conserving uses;</u> <u>rather they are strongly encouraged to maintain their &quot;base acreage' of cropland on which their eligibility for future payments is calculated.&quot;</u> 53 </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">Earl Butz believed bigger farms were more productive and efficient so he pushed farmers to consolidate. 54 He would tell farmers &quot;to get big or get out,&quot; &quot;to plant their fields fencerow to fencerow,&quot; and to regard themselves not as farmers but as &quot;agribusinessmen.&quot;</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt"> 55 </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"">This brings us to our second historical figure, the one that has profited most from Haber’s discover: Zea mays. Originally a staple food for native people living in Mexico, it was worshiped and revered. It eventually spread throughout North America. When European colonists arrived it allowed them to survive as wheat crops failed. Now, as industrial monoculture in the hands of agribusiness, it is killing continents, it is tanking economies and it is<span style="color: black"> making us obese. Of the forty-five thousands items you will find in an average super-market, a quarter are made with corn. More nitrogen hungry than any other crop, a concrete manifestation of Haber’s life is vast corn monocultures </span></span><br />

<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">The great turning point in the modern history of corn, which in turn marks a key turning point in the industrialization of our food, can be dated with some precision to the day in 1947 when the huge munitions plant at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, switched over from making explosives to making chemical fertilizer.</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt"> <u>After World War II, the government had found itself with a tremendous surplus of ammonium nitrate, the principal ingredient in the making of explosives.

But agronomists in the Department of Agriculture had a better idea: spread the ammonium nitrate on farmland as fertilizer. <u>The chemical fertilizer industry (along with that of pesticides, which are based on the poison gases developed for war) is the product of the government's effort to convert its war machine to peacetime purposes.</u> As the Indian farmer activist Vandana Shiva says in her speeches, &quot;We're still eating the leftovers of World War II.&quot; </span><br />

<u><span style="font-size: 10pt">F1 hybrid corn is the greediest of plants, consuming more fertilizer than any other crop.

The duality that runs through Haber’s life is the duality of western civilization – our arrogant faith in technological progress and modernity makes us blind to the violence endemic to this civilizing process. The dominant narrative is that of a long march towards peace and prosperity that sees violence and collapse as aberrant – our 1AC presents a historical counter-narrative necessary to cure our blindness and provide a foundation for the urgent critique of modernity -<br />
<br />
Bernard Huppauf 1997 [War, Violence and the Modern Condition Pg. 2-7]<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">The contrast between an under-theorization in relation to violence and the significance of violence for the construction of social reality is particularly noteworthy in a century in which war and various forms of open and concealed violence have affected so many millions of lives and shaped collective memory as never before and in which, it can be argued, an unprecedented outburst of violence, namely the First World War led to the creation of a global collective memory. It is even more surprising to note the continuation of the common faith, originating during the eighteenth century, in modern civil society's incompatibility with violence.</span> <u>It is one of the disturbing experiences of this century that the line dividing war and peace has been blurred beyond recognition and civil society does not lead to the eradication of but continues to co-exist with violence. Yet</u>,<span style="font-size: 8pt"> despite the ever more threatening presence of violence in the worlds of both physical and emotional experiences and their representations<u>,</u></span> <u>there is evidence that Western civilization continues to perceive itself in terms of one of its foundation myths which tells a story concerning the intertwining of a process of rationalization and the abolition of violence, of progressing civility and peace.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">The vision that Western civilization continues to project of itself as one concerned with creating conditions for the emergence of a world free from war and violence is at variance with its own collective memory and continued political and cultural practices.</span> <u>It is the obsequious maintenance of this self image</u><span style="font-size: 8pt">, it can be argued,</span> <u>which has become one of the major obstacles for the development of more effective and rational approaches towards the persistent problem of war and violence under conditions of the modern world.</u> <u>It is an injudicious image of self that can be interpreted as the precondition for the many ill-conceived attempts to fight violence with violence and create peace through increased armament.</u> <u>The USA, at present</u> arguably <u>the most violent and militaristic among the industrialized western societies and obsessed with ever more graphic representations of violence and brutality, is at the same time guided by the belief that its domestic and international policies are making a major contribution to the creation of a future free from wars and, violence. Its collective consciousness is in the firm grip of the image of modern western civilization en route to its ultimate destination and therefore considers violence a legitimate means to protect itself from its adversaries.</u> <u>More guns, more military actions, more police and more prisons are therefore not perceived as contradictions but rather as contributions to achieving the propagated objective of a world of peace and justice.</u> <br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">Representations, in words and images, of violence in the families, at the work place, in the cities or between religious or ethnic groups as well as the violence between states in other parts of the world from Bosnia to Argentina provide striking examples of resistance against an insight into the violent nature of modernity.</span> <u>Dominant practices of representing violence and destruction are characterized by techniques of relegation. It is the other both spatially and temporally where illegitimate violence and senseless destruction can be observed. It is this technique of relegation which makes it possible to perceive one's own world as a sphere where violence and destruction are exceptions to the rule of the otherwise peaceful and rational reality. Banishing violence to a contained sphere separated from one's own is a prerequisite for maintaining the cherished image of modernity engaged in redeeming the pledge of its own origin.</u><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">In this respect<u>,</u></span> <u>the Holocaust is the most challenging of the deranging experiences of the century.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">Until recently, there was little dissent from the dominant approach to the extermination of six million Jews which is couched in a language of historical and social-psychological atavism. The murderous program is regarded as a disastrous deviation from the standards of modernity, a return to humanity's dark past, often summed up in terms such as barbarism or primitivism. This pattern based on the polar opposites of civilization and barbarism was persuasive enough to remain without serious alternative for a long time, penetrating deeply into the semantics of academic as well as public discourse. An increasing dissatisfaction with this approach has for some years now led to challenging its basic assumption and creating a growing body of research demonstrating the extent to which</span> <u>the mass murder was intertwined with and dependent upon the conditions of a modern society, its bureaucracy, industrial-military complex, transportation system, division of labor, the sciences, work attitudes, abstraction, and many other aspects of the modern society. The smooth organization of the Holocaust was based upon the infra-structure of an advanced urban society. The individual perpetrators</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(and often their victims) </span><u>operated efficiently even under the most extreme conditions, never questioning their role. This division of labor and responsibility is characteristic of the operations of modern production and presupposes mental structures</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">of the kind Max Weber identified </span><u>at the center of the process of rationalization.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">Indeed, the icon of modernization and industrialization during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the smoking chimney, has been identified as the symbol of Auschwitz. The concept of production is common to both. The production of goods and the production of corpses were registered by meticulous book-keepers. It was in particular Zygmund Bauman's work which made this changing approach popular. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">In Bauman's view Auschwitz was the logical outcome of a civilization that is not the opposite of but a modern version of barbarism. He argues that the Holocaust has &quot;uncovered another face of the same modern society whose other, more familiar, face we so admire. And that the two faces are perfectly comfortably attached to the same body.&quot; He refers to &quot;Holocaust-style phenomena&quot; as the &quot;legitimate outcomes of ... the civilizing tendency, and its constant potential.&quot; In Bauman's account, the process of civilization has created a sphere of civility only by concealing the simultaneously growing destructiveness and violence underneath its surface. Through increased concentration and intensification of power vested in the state, modern man, is subjected to anonymous techniques of coercion and threatened with violence. The separation of agents of power and violence from ethical discourse, characteristic of the process of rationalization of modern societies, he argues, inevitably leads to a-morality and subsequently to outbursts of cruelty on a scale larger than it was possible in previous and less organized and modernized societies. Under modern conditions, he argues, civilization is continuously creating a mentality and social fabric designed for the perfection of structures ready to be applied towards any goal including massive violence and mass murder. Bauman's position is the reversed image of the optimism displayed in the theories of civilization which, since the eighteenth century Enlightenment invented the pattern of progressing civility, credited Western civilization with the emancipation of mankind and the creation of a world of peace. It appears that the simplicity of the thesis which maintains the basic structure of the argument replacing the optimistic by a pessimistic result has made Bauman's books popular. Skepticism in relation to the process of civilization expressed in terms of political theory by Max Weber or philosophy in Martin Heidegger's investigation into the condition of technology is of a different and more complex structure. In the tradition of Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud and Weber's philosophical writings, Horkheimer and Adorno's seminal study &quot;Dialectics of Enlightenment&quot; (1946) provided the first attempt to deal with the experience of fascism and industrialized mass murder by examining their relationship to modernity and its process of rationalization. It presupposes ambivalence and, instead of reversing the judgment as to the valence of the teleological paradigm, makes an attempt to define the problem in different terms. The presupposed simultaneity of Odysseus and modern man, theses concerning the continued productivity of mythology, the ambiguity of reason, expressed in their term 'instrumental reason', or the violence vested in conceptual language contribute to defining a paradigm for the investigation into the modern condition in which the Holocaust and modernity are inextricably linked without, however, resorting to a language of inevitability or necessity </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">Such insight into the conditions and structure of the Holocaust forms only a thin layer of knowledge which has failed to have a deeper effect on the image which modern civilization constructs of itself. The authors' reluctance for many years to authorize a new edition of their book was indicative of their own ambivalence in relation to their interpretation of modernity. In Germany, the organized and highly efficient destruction of the European Jewry tends to be treated as unique and is thereby, interpreted as an aberration from the path of civilization, involuntarily excluded from the history of modernity and relegated to a sphere of atavism. Public opinion of the USA tends to perceive the Holocaust as a specific national and German problem. Neither mounting evidence nor compelling theoretical considerations have made a significant contribution to changing the common image that perceives this outbreak of murderous destructiveness as one contained in terms of time and space but not related to the construction of the modern condition. As a result, the Holocaust can be remembered in isolation from the construction of self.</span><br />
<u>The relationship between fascism and modernity is crucial to the understanding of modernity.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">In an essay on violence, Adorno once argued that every relapse (Ruckfall) to open and physical violence in the present period is atavistic and deserves the term barbarism. It is precisely this model of modernity - which places our own society at one end and barbarism at the other and sees them as separated by a 'process of civilization' - that needs examination.' </span><u>As long as the concept of Western history as one of progressing civilization is maintained, open and brutal violence will never be perceived as part of our own world. In this construction of self, violence tends to become part of another world</u>, <span style="font-size: 8pt">a world beyond the northern border of Greece, where the barbarians lived, a world beyond the border of our own civilization, </span><u>where all the others live. Violence becomes an intruder from this outer sphere and is present in our world</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">by default, </span><u>as an exception</u>, <span style="font-size: 8pt">a deplorable relic, a foreign body in an otherwise civilized system. The disbelief that such brutalities are still, possible in our world is a hidden part of the semantics and visual codes with which violence in Yugoslavia, Nigeria, Georgia and the far side of our town is commonly referred to. The atrocities of the twentieth century give rise to reactions of disbelief, Walter Benjamin wrote, &quot;but this is not a philosophical&quot; response, he added. </span>&quot;<u>It is not the beginning of new insight, safe the one that the concept of history that gives rise to it, has become untenable.</u>&quot; <span style="font-size: 8pt">Individuals and societies have a tendency to see violence associated not with themselves but with others, distanced by space and time, in pre-modern, primitive or developing societies, societies of the East or the South, people in the poor and uneducated quarters of our cities. But is there a difference between a sniper in a Sarajevo street and the frustrated worker in Detroit who pulls a gun, or between looting an aid-convoy in Mogadishu and drug dealing in affluent quarters of Berlin or New York?</span><br />

The imperative of progress mobilizes both bloody massacres and everyday oppression that are at the same time made invisible by the myth of a rational society – it is our ethical imperative to contest this historical narrative from within the terrain of history and expose the evils of modernity<br />

BERNAUER 1990 (James, Professor of Philosophy at Boston College, <u>Michel Foucault’s Force of Flight</u>, pp22-23)<br />
<br />
This study of Foucault contains many agreements with, as well as explicit and implicit criticism of, all of these interpreters. The purpose in mentioning them at this point is certainly not to do justice to their readings of Foucault. What their different perspectives and interests reveal, however is a common appetite for a practice of thinking that exhibits the ethical dimension of reason.  Foucault’s <u>ethics proposes the wisdom of a dispossession, not only of certain systems of thought and action, but also of a muteness before our age’s indigenous suffering.</u> If archaeology became a provocative image for thought, it was in part because of the feeling that such a vision at least attempted to deal with the subterranean forces that erupted in our time<u>. Our modern era’s claim to knowledge of, and its will to perfect, the human reality have had unexpectedly tragic consequences, consequences that have mocked that claim and will. In their justification of immense technologies for producing a new man, modern philosophical anthropologies seemed to turn against human beings. Whereas the philosopher had once taught, through his own life, how the universal fate of death could be borne, he had come too often in our age to teach the superior wisdom of how to accept the massacre of others. In the name of truth. It is the inexcusable service professional thinkers have rendered to our era’s diminishment, confinement, and, indeed, murder of innocent people</u> that stirs a horror in Foucault that occasionally surfaces in the violence of an image or the shrill tone of a formulation. More usually, however, his sense of outrage is detectable only in that incessant shifting of dusty documents into new orderings that can be heard beyond the silence of his written works. His thought is drawn to the study of language because <u>crusades are always preached. A world organized into great campaigns for the liberation and perfection of human life, while prepared for the destruction of countless thousands in the pursuit of that cause, does not simply appear. Such a world is anticipated in great declarations and manifestos; it convinces itself of the value of its goals by the constant repetition of words become so hallowed that they are the pride of every disciplined mind, so forceful that their mere invocation draws forth the zealous roars of populations and armies.</u> <u>The strategy of</u> Foucault’s <u>resistance to this evil is an ethics for thought that consists of a series of questions whose pursuit manifests the assumption of an ethical responsibility.</u>  <u>The practice of this ethics disputes the solidity of our world and our history</u>, much as a dream or a work of surrealistic literature might. It is thus appropriate that our account of Foucault’s winding journey of thought should begin where it does: in a nightmare.<br />

<u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">Agriculture is the birth of production, complete with its essential features and deformation of life and consciousness. The land itself becomes an instrument of production and the planet’s species its objects.</span></u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> Wild or tame, weeds or crops speak of that duality that cripples the soul of our being, ushering in, relatively quickly, the despotism, war and impoverishment of high civilization over the great length of that earlier oneness with nature. <u>The forced march of civilization, which Adorno recognized in the “assumption of an irrational catastrophe at the beginning of history,” which Freud felt as “something imposed on a resisting majority,” of which Stanley Diamond found only “conscripts, not volunteers,” was dictated by agriculture.</u> And Mircea Eliade was correct to assess its coming as having “provoked upheavals and spiritual breakdowns” whose magnitude the modern mind cannot imagine. </span><br />
<u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">“To level off, to standardize the human landscape, to efface its irregularities and banish its surprises,”</span></u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> these words of E.M. Cioran apply perfectly to <u>the logic of agriculture</u>, the end of life as mainly sensuous activity, <u>the embodiment and generator of separated life</u>. Artificiality and work have steadily increased since its inception and are known as culture: <u>in domesticating animals and plants man necessarily domesticated himself.</u> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">Historical time, </span></u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">like agriculture<u>, is not inherent in social reality but an imposition on it. The dimension of time or history is a function of repression, whose foundation is production or agriculture.</u> Hunter-gatherer life was anti-time in its simultaneous and spontaneous openness; <u>farming life generates a sense of time by its successive-task narrowness, its directed routine. As the non-closure and variety of Paleolithic living gave way to the literal enclosure of agriculture, time assumed power and came to take on the character of an enclosed space. Formalized temporal reference points</u>—ceremonies with fixed dates, the naming of days, etc.—<u>are crucial to the ordering of the world of production; as a schedule of production, the calendar is integral to civilization.</u> Conversely, <u>not only would industrial society be impossible without time schedules, the end of agriculture</u> (basis of all production) <u>would be the end of historical time.</u> </span><br />

It is for this reason that the ecological history of the 1AC is so essential – the contours of social power are defined by the complex interactions between humans and our ecological context. An analysis of history is the necessary foundation for agency. <br />

<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">To date, the most lucid if environmentally deficient discussion of the relationship between human agency and structure is offered by William H. Sewell. Sewell begins with Anthony Giddens's promising notion of the dual nature of structures: that</span><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> <u>human agency and structure</u> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">do not</span><u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> exist </span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">in opposition to each other so much as</span><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> <u>in tandem, with one presupposing the other.</u>7 </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">This theoretical perspective, Sewell points out, has underwritten some of the best work in social history. But he also observes that Giddens's notion of structure remains vague and ambiguous. Sewell posits instead a new view of structures as made up of &quot;schemas&quot; and &quot;resources.&quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> Schemas are </span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">essentially</span><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> <u>the meanings and interpretations through which people see the world. Resources</u>, </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">both human and nonhuman,</span><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> <u>are the media that empower people to make history.</u> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">As he writes: &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">Structures</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">, then</span><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">, <u>are sets of mutually sustaining schemas and resources that empower and constrain social action and that tend to be reproduced by that social action. But their reproduction is never automatic. Structures are at risk,</u> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">at least to some extent</span><u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">, in all of the social encounters they shape—because structures are multiple and intersecting, because schemas are transposable, and because resources are polysemic and accumulate unpredictably.&quot;</span></u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">8  10 </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">Yet Sewell's notion of nonhuman resources—what some would call nature—seems somewhat undertheorized</span><u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">.

Structures are at risk</u></span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">, he explains,</span><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> <u>because of the unpredictability associated with the accumulation of nonhuman</u> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">(and human)</span><u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> resources.

In other words, I am arguing instead for a concept of human agency that credits ecological and biological factors without reducing them to rigid determining elements operating on a one-way causal highway.  11 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> The anthropologist Roy A. Rappaport once observed that</span><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> <u>humankind &quot;survives biologically or not at all.&quot;10 That fact is too little recognized by historians. Such daily and obvious routines as securing enough food and getting rid of bodily waste, essential practices that must occur in ways that do not undermine a culture's ecological base, have received painfully little attention from historians</u>. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">Indeed, one of the questions that might be asked is how the ecological consequences of eating and flushing became so invisible, so enmeshed in the wish to forget.  12 </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> <u>Historians have concerned themselves with race, class, and gender because they offer a means of exploring the history of oppression. Power inequalities unfold along these three lines</u>.11 <u>But they also literally take place, occurring in landscapes with their own peculiar ecological attributes.

By focusing on how different groups within a culture went about transforming nature to feed themselves and the struggle that ensued to shape how that happened, we can create a more usable past, one more relevant to the everyday lives of people today.</span></u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">  13 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> What follows is an attempt to describe briefly the genesis of environmental history, as well as the objections raised to it. The essay will then go on to show, in a concrete way, how</span><span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black"> <u>viewing nature as an active, shaping force in the past can help change our understanding of some conventional topics in American history.</u> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: "Lucida Grande"; color: black">My goal is to leave readers with both a more nuanced view of human agency and an appreciation of the way power operates through and across landscapes. </span><br />

We must learn from Haber’s hubris – it is dangerous to cede responsibility to specialists. Governmental reform is necessary, but it will never happen until we take personal responsibility for creating a political ecology that demands reform. Our gamble is that an affirmative ballot will spark a viral process of cultural change, but even if it doesn’t it is still rewarding to try. It is impossible to predict or plan the outcome of such a non-linear shift in thinking, but we are ethically obliged to act as though we are free to change the world<br />

<u>There are so many stories we can tell ourselves to justify doing nothing, but perhaps the most insidious is that, whatever we do manage to do, it will be too little too late</u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt">Climate change is upon us, and it has arrived well ahead of schedule. Scientists' projections that seemed dire a decade ago turn out to have been unduly optimistic: the warming and the melting is occurring much faster than the models predicted. Now truly terrifying feedback loops threaten to boost the rate of change exponentially, as the shift from white ice to blue water in the Arctic absorbs more sunlight and warming soils everywhere become more biologically active, causing them to release their vast stores of carbon into the air. Have you looked into the eyes of a climate scientist recently? They look really scared. So do you still want to talk about planting gardens? I do. </span><u>Whatever we can do as individuals to change the way we live at this suddenly very late date does seem utterly inadequate</u> to the challenge. <u>It's hard to argue with Michael Specter</u>, in a recent New Yorker piece on carbon footprints, <u>when he says: &quot;Personal choices, no matter how virtuous</u> [N.B.!], <u>cannot do enough. It will also take laws and money</u>.&quot; So it will. <u>Yet it is no less accurate or hardheaded to say that laws and money cannot do enough, either; that it will also take profound changes in the way we live</u>. Why? <u>Because the climate-change crisis is at its very bottom a crisis of lifestyle--of character</u>, even. <u>The Big Problem is nothing more or less than the sum total of countless little everyday choices, most of them made by us</u> (consumer spending represents 70 percent of our economy), <u>and most of the rest of them made in the name of our needs and desires and preferences</u>.<span style="font-size: 8pt"> </span><u>For us to wait for legislation or technology to solve the problem of how we're living our lives suggests we're not really serious about changing--something our politicians cannot fail to notice</u>. <u>They will not move until we do. Indeed, to look to leaders and experts, to laws and money and grand schemes, to save us from our predicament represents precisely the sort of thinking--passive, delegated, dependent for solutions on specialists--that helped get us into this mess in the first place. It's hard to believe that the same sort of thinking could now get us out of it</u>.<span style="font-size: 8pt"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">Thirty years ago, Wendell Berry, the Kentucky farmer and writer, put forward a blunt analysis of precisely this mentality. He argued that the environmental crisis of the 1970s--an era innocent of climate change; what we would give to have back that environmental crisis!--was at its heart a crisis of character and would have to be addressed first at that level: at home, as it were. He was impatient with people who wrote checks to environmental organizations while thoughtlessly squandering fossil fuel in their everyday lives--the 1970s equivalent of people buying carbon offsets to atone for their Tahoes and Durangos. Nothing was likely to change until we healed the &quot;split between what we think and what we do.&quot; For Berry, the &quot;why bother&quot; question came down to a moral imperative: &quot;Once our personal connection to what is wrong becomes clear, then we have to choose: we can go on as before, recognizing our dishonesty and living with it the best we can, or we can begin the effort to change the way we think and live.&quot; For Berry, </span><u>the deep problem standing behind all the other problems of industrial civilization is &quot;specialization</u>,&quot;<span style="font-size: 8pt"> which he regards as the &quot;disease of the modern character.&quot; </span><u>Our society assigns us a tiny number of roles</u>: <span style="font-size: 8pt">we're producers (of one thing) at work, consumers of a great many other things the rest of the time, and then once a year or so we vote as citizens. </span><u>Virtually all of our needs and desires we delegate to specialists of one kind or another--our meals to agribusiness</u>, health to the doctor, <u>education to the teacher</u>, entertainment to the media, <u>care for the environment to the environmentalist, political action to the politician.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">As Adam Smith and many others have pointed out, this division of labor has given us many of the blessings of civilization. Specialization is what allows me to sit at a computer thinking about climate change. Yet </span><u>this</u> same <u>division of labor obscures the lines of connection--and responsibility--linking our everyday acts to their real-world consequences,</u> making it easy for me to overlook the coal-fired power plant that is lighting my screen, or the mountaintop in Kentucky that had to be destroyed to provide the coal to that plant, or the streams running crimson with heavy metals as a result. Of course, <u>what made this sort of specialization possible in the first place was cheap energy</u>. <u>Cheap fossil fuel allows us to pay distant others to process our food for us, to entertain us and to (try to) solve our problems, with the result that there is very little we know how to accomplish for ourselves</u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt">Think for a moment of all the things you suddenly need to do for yourself when the power goes out--up to and including entertaining yourself. Think, too, about how a power failure causes your neighbors--your community--to suddenly loom so much larger in your life. </span><u>Cheap energy allowed us to leapfrog community by making it possible to sell our specialty over great distances as well as summon into our lives the specialties of countless distant others.</u> Here's the point: Cheap energy, which gives us climate change, fosters precisely the mentality that makes dealing with climate change in our own lives seem impossibly difficult. <u>Specialists ourselves, we can no longer imagine anyone but an expert, or anything but a new technology or law, solving our problems</u>.<span style="font-size: 8pt"> Al Gore asks us to change the light bulbs because he probably can't imagine us doing anything much more challenging, like, say, growing some portion of our own food. We can't imagine it, either, which is probably why we prefer to cross our fingers and talk about the promise of ethanol and nuclear power--new liquids and electrons to power the same old cars and houses and lives. </span><u>The &quot;cheap-energy mind</u>,&quot; as Wendell Berry called it, <u>is the mind that asks, &quot;Why bother?&quot; because it is helpless to imagine--much less attempt--a different sort of life</u>, one less divided, less reliant. Since the cheap-energy mind translates everything into money, its proxy, it prefers to put its faith in market-based solutions--carbon taxes and pollution-trading schemes. <u>If we could just get the incentives right, it believes, the economy will properly value everything that matters and nudge our self-interest down the proper channels. The best we can hope for is a greener version of the old invisible hand</u>. Visible hands it has no use for. <u>But while some such grand scheme may well be necessary, it's doubtful that it will be sufficient or that it will be politically sustainable before we've demonstrated to ourselves that change is possible. Merely to give, to spend, even to vote, is not to do, and there is so much that needs to be done</u><span style="font-size: 8pt">--without further delay. In the judgment of James Hansen, the NASA climate scientist who began sounding the alarm on global warming 20 years ago, we have only 10 years left to start cutting--not just slowing--the amount of carbon we're emitting or face a &quot;different planet.&quot; Hansen said this more than two years ago, however; two years have gone by, and nothing of consequence has been done. So: eight years left to go and a great deal left to do. Which brings us back to the &quot;why bother&quot; question and how we might better answer it. The reasons not to bother are many and compelling, at least to the cheap-energy mind. But let me offer a few admittedly tentative reasons that we might put on the other side of the scale: </span><u>If you do bother, you will set an example for other people. If enough other people bother, each one influencing yet another in a chain reaction of behavioral change, markets for all manner of green products and alternative technologies will prosper and expand.</u> (Just look at the market for hybrid cars.) <u>Consciousness will be raised, perhaps even changed: new moral imperatives and new taboos might take root in the culture.</u> Driving an S.U.V. or eating a 24-ounce steak or illuminating your McMansion like an airport runway at night might come to be regarded as outrages to human conscience. <u>Not having things might become cooler than having them. And those who did change the way they live would acquire the moral standing to demand changes in behavior from others--from other people, other corporations, even other countries</u>. <u>All of this could</u>, theoretically, <u>happen</u>. What I'm describing (imagining would probably be more accurate) is a process of <u>viral social change,</u> and change of this kind, <u>which is nonlinear, is never something anyone can plan or predict or count on</u>. Who knows, maybe the virus will reach all the way to Chongqing and infect my Chinese evil twin. Or not. <u>Maybe going green will prove a passing fad and will lose steam after a few years</u>, just as it did in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan took down Jimmy Carter's solar panels from the roof of the White House. <u>Going personally green is a bet, nothing more or less, though it's one we probably all should make, even if the odds of it paying off aren't great. Sometimes you have to act as if acting will make a difference, even when you can't prove that it will. That, after all, was precisely what happened in Communist Czechoslovakia and Poland, when a handful of individuals</u> like Vaclav Havel and Adam Michnik <u>resolved that they would simply conduct their lives &quot;as if&quot; they lived in a free society. That improbable bet created a tiny space of liberty that, in time, expanded to take in, and then help take down, the whole of the Eastern bloc</u>. So what would be a comparable bet that the individual might make in the case of the environmental crisis? Havel himself has suggested that people begin to &quot;conduct themselves as if they were to live on this earth forever and be answerable for its condition one day.&quot; Fair enough, but let me propose a slightly less abstract and daunting wager. <u>The idea is to find one thing to do in your life that doesn't involve spending or voting, that may or may not virally rock the world but is real and particular (as well as symbolic) and that, come what may, will offer its own rewards.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">Maybe you decide to give up meat, an act that would reduce your carbon footprint by as much as a quarter. Or you could try this: determine to observe the Sabbath. For one day a week, abstain completely from economic activity: no shopping, no driving, no electronics. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"">The relevance of history to a constantly changing society, and one in frequent conflict, like that of the twentieth century, in whatever part of the world one looks, has two different aspects.</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman""> <u>Human historical consciousness contains, as we have noted, various historical concepts and attitudes, including concepts of social values, that are in effect potential forces for social change or of opposition to it, or of conflict that involves no real change. The release of these forces may come in the form of rational choices</u>, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"">to support this or that cause, or to vote in a certain way</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman"">. <u>Or they may be released in a less rational form in response to emotional appeals by demagogic leaders</u>. In either case, <u>it is</u> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"">the accumulated memory, or</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman""> <u>historical consciousness, that affects social behavior.</u> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"">The second general aspect of historical relevance is that of the relation of historical consciousness to social policy formation. Social</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman""> <u>policy formation</u> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"">is a more or less rational, or at least conscious process</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman"">. It <u>takes place on any social level, from the family group upward through the community, the nation and international society of various degrees of extent.</u> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"">Within any one of these several social levels</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman""> <u>policy formation and execution or non-execution takes place in action by groups within groups, such as several political parties within a given political society.</u> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times">Part 4 – Framework </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times">Fiat provides an impoverished view of state action – states do not simply will things into existence, they are bureaucratic machines driven by competition human interests. The myopic view of the state as capable of making sovereign decisions can only lead to a misunderstanding of politics </span><br />
CLAUDE 1988 <br />
(Inis, Professor of Government and Foreign Affairs, University of Virginia, States and the Global System, pages 18-20)<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">This view of the state as an institutional monolith is fostered by the notion of sovereignty, which calls up the image of the monarch, presiding over his kingdom. </span><u>Sovereignty emphasizes the singularity of the state, its monopoly of authority, its unity of command and its capacity to speak with one voice. Thus, France wills, Iran demands,</u> China intends, New Zealand promises <u>and the Soviet Union insists. One all too easily conjures up the picture of a single-minded and purposeful state that decides exactly what it wants to achieve, adopts coherent policies intelligently adapted to its objectives, knows what it is doing, does what it intends and always has its act together. This view of the state is reinforced by political scientists’ emphasis upon the concept of policy</u> and upon the thesis that governments derive policy from calculations of national interest. <u>We thus</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">take it for granted that states act internationally in accordance with rationally conceived and consciously constructed schemes of action, and we </span><u>implicitly refuse to consider the possibility that alternatives to policy-directed behaviour may have importance</u><span style="font-size: 8pt">–alternatives such as random, reactive, instinctual, habitual and conformist behaviour. Our rationalistic assumption that states do what they have planned to do tends to inhibit the discovery that states sometimes do what they feel compelled to do, or what they have the opportunity to do, or what they have usually done, or what other states are doing, or whatever the line of least resistance would seem to suggest. </span><br />
<u>Academic preoccupation with the making of policy is accompanied by academic neglect of the execution of policy. We seem to assume that once the state has</u> calculated its interest and <u>contrived a policy</u> to further that interest, <u>the carrying out of policy is the virtually automatic result</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">of the routine functioning of the bureaucratic mechanism of the state. I am inclined to call this the Genesis theory of public administration, taking as my text the passage: ‘And God said, Let there be light: and there was light’. I suspect that, in the realm of government, </span><u>policy execution rarely follows so promptly and inexorably from policy statement</u>. Alternatively, one may dub it the Pooh-Bah/Ko-Ko theory, honouring those denizens of William S. Gilbert’s Japan who took the position that when the Mikado ordered that something e done it was as good as done and might as well be declared to have been done.<br />
<u>In the real world, that which a state decides to do is not as good as done; it may, in fact, never be done</u>. And what states do, they may never have decided to do. <u>Governments are not automatic machines, grinding out decisions and converting decisions into actions. They are agglomerations of human beings, like the rest of us inclined to be fallible, lazy, forgetful, indecisive, resistant to discipline and authority, and likely to fail to get the word or to heed it</u>. As in other large organizations, <u>left and right governmental hands are frequently ignorant of each other’s activities, official spokesmen contradict each other, ministries work at cross purposes, and the creaking machinery of government often gives the impression that no one is really in charge</u>.<span style="font-size: 8pt"> I hope that no one will attribute my jaundiced view of government merely to the fact that I am an American–one, that is, whose personal experience is limited to a governmental system that is notoriously complex, disjointed, erratic, cumbersome and unpredictable. The United States does not, I suspect, have the least effective government or the most bumbling and incompetent bureaucracy in all the world. Here and there, now and then, governments do, of course perform prodigious feats of organization and administration: an extraordinary war effort, a flight to the moon, a successful hostage-rescue operation. More often, states have to make do with governments that are not notably clear about their purposes or coordinated and disciplined in their operations. </span><br />
<u>This means that</u>, <span style="font-size: 8pt">in international relations, </span><u>states are</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">sometimes </span><u>less dangerous, and</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt">sometimes </span><u>less reliable, than one might think. Neither their threats nor their promises are to be taken with absolute seriousness. Above all</u>, it means that <u>we students of international politics must be cautious in attributing purposefulness and responsibility to governments</u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt">To say the that the United States was informed about an event is not to establish that the president acted in the light of that knowledge; he may never have heard about it. To say that a Soviet pilot shot down an airliner is not to prove that the Kremlin has adopted the policy of destroying all intruders into Soviet airspace; one wants to know how and by whom the decision to fire was made. To observe that the representative of Zimbabwe voted in favour of a particular resolution in the United Nations General Assembly is not necessarily to discover the nature of Zimbabwe’s policy on the affected matter; Zimbabwe may have no policy on that matter, and it may be that no one in the national capital has ever heard of the issue. We can hardly dispense with the convenient notion that Pakistan claims, Cuba promises, and Italy insists, and we cannot well abandon the formal position that governments speak for and act on behalf of their states, but </span><u>it is essential that we bear constantly in mind the reality that governments are never fully in charge and never achieve the unity, purposefulness and discipline that theory attributes to them</u>–and that they sometimes claim.<br />

<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman"">Our historical analysis is key to policy making – policy execution is the result of historical consciousness  </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt">The argument of this chapter is basically that <u>policy of all kinds</u> and of all</span><span style="font-size: 14pt"> <u>groups has some historical content. In relation to national foreign policies this historical element is often thought of as the doctrine</u> or <u>doctrines in accordance with which a nation conducts its foreign affairs. Reduced to their elements, these doctrines usually consist in large degree of more or less traditional patterns of reaction to certain recurring problems</u>, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt">of patterns of approach to the solution of problems, such as respect for treaties, and including concepts of international law and their use of diplomatic immunity, of traditions in respect to the circumstances in which force may be applied to solve problems not otherwise resolvable, and of procedures for the peaceful resolution of international grievances. These latter procedures range from the invocation of a defense treaty, such as the Rio de Janeiro Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance or NATO, an appeal to the United Nations Security Council, the agreed referral of a controversy to the World Court, or to an appeal to any of various agreed upon modes of arbitration</span><u><span style="font-size: 14pt">. Value systems are involved in all these &quot;doctrines,&quot; value systems that are a product of national, group, or individual historical experience. </span></u><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">Cynical critics may argue that in use such doctrines of international policy are often merely &quot;cosmetic,&quot; serving to conceal the real play of power, that of negotiations expressing the material interests of the &quot;establishment,&quot; or of its representatives in positions of power. Or, these critics may say, such doctrines are merely illusory, useful only to a weak power in dealing with a stronger one, when the candid, logical, and historically acceptable statement of a case may occasionally win concessions from the generosity of the stronger nation. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt">But this concept of &quot;doctrine&quot; in foreign policy, this issue of &quot;continuity,&quot; is also one of the issues in the theory and</span><span style="font-size: 14pt"> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt">philosophy of history. It is a question that has engaged the attention of serious students for centuries, at least since the days of David Hume (1711-1776). Moreover</span><span style="font-size: 14pt">, <u>the issue involves all the questions raised in respect to the nature and reality of historical knowledge, because the very validity of such &quot;doctrines&quot; rests upon history. This validity question</u>, in turn, <u>involves the validity and truth of the historical consciousness of a nation. It also involves the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of the governing class, or elite, who interpret this history upon the basis of their own historical consciousness.</u> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt">The critics of these &quot;doctrines&quot; and the validity, therefore, raise all the questions that are raised by the critics of the more general concept of the relevance of history. Frankly, the only answer one can give to them is that one believes</span><span style="font-size: 14pt"> <u>that historical consciousness of aims, beliefs, and realities, the consciousness of that part of a group or nation that is guided by its sense of values, historical causes, and aims, provides</u> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt">at least part of</span><span style="font-size: 14pt"> <u>the real basis</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt">, not only for this &quot;doctrine,&quot; but also</span><span style="font-size: 14pt"> <u>for its application to contemporary problems of policy.</u>  </span>
