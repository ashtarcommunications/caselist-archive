 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2NC: Framework with Overview.<br />
OV: Our interpretation is a lens through which you read their evidence, that both the aff and neg should talk atbout CRP. But you should tie it to ag subsidies or being part of resolution. Topicality comes first for limits. Voting Issue for Jurisdiction. Not reasons to win the debate. There is no reason why they can’t advocate USFG on this issue. Debating on policy on our policy is not Mutually exclusive. </span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Tension between Framework and 1NC</span><ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Not true.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">CRP discussion on cottong subsidies. We knock on his offense. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Means no productive discussion. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Lyle 2k3. </span></li></ol></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Affirmative is an IVI to vote for us. Speice and Lyle. 2k3. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Win-Loss is not related to how team did. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Switch Side SOLVES their argument b/c you are allowed to talk about CRP</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Researching what arguments they are going to make: makes all evidence and opposition of briefing and analyzing. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Divorce from Identity: Our interp allows for more roleplaying. Which helps for real world. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Rules come first: Basketball player can’t just question rules in middle of game. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Future wording of resolutions: If we focus on resolution then we can have discussions of the community outside the debate. IT will have a trickle down effect. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Trade off between interps: Louisville ?? No reason why not true. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The form of NDT Ceda debate</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Preclude Roleplaying: forcing people to role play within USFG actor is a good thing. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our interpretation of embracing USFG is within CRP. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mancuso evidence says better placed within policy analysis. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Speed/time contraints means it’s not appropriate for race and pedagogy. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Strategic nature of debate is what make their advocacy impossible. We can only do things outside debate round. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Research tanked because we’d talk about the same thing every year. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This research proves attituteds and opinion are changed. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Switch Side Debate would solve the lack of arg clash from a personal ideology advocacy debate. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Not true that people will only attack policy plank of aff – the neg will be forced to dig deeper. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Debate Collapse</span><ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Not collapsing – our evidence is about alumni funding. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hard to get alumni to fund us when we’re not </span></li></ol></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">C-X of 2NC:<br />
Q: Do any of your evidence assume CRP?<br />
A: No but they do say that the consequences of debate spill over, which affects other social movements such as CRP.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1NR – Case</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Racial contradictory discourse:</span><ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We are not a defense of a status quo debate </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We could cut subsidies, your indictment of the system etcetera. </span></li></ol></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our Vision of the debate is to tie your CRP and tie it to resolution makes it powerful. </span><ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Inhibits effective dialogue. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Significant effect for teams to share ideas – the judge can’t decide.

Bowers. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In order to change the institution we do not need from black perspective we need one from all perspectives. </span></li></ol></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our Barber evidence is used as the warrants as non-falsfiable experience. </span><ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Brightline and Fair is not always racist. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The fact that this evidence talks about Michael Jordan and Yo-YoMa. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If we change what you do and think in debate then it gives us support </span></li></ol></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">White Privelege</span><ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That’s our argument we solve for it. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Shaw evidence – concedes that it changes things we talk about policy. </span></li></ol></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The whole debate community should have a topical plan. Aff/Neg have to discuss the status quo of farming subsidies. Change way we think about economic ideas.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Experience/knowledge can be shared too. – Flip the debate paradigm you defend topical plan. Timeframe and probability not the way you defend it. Which means you are no longer disinterested politicians. </span></li></ol><h3 id="toc16"><a name="x-Missouri State FW-2nr Strategy:"></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><em>2nr Strategy:</em></strong></span></h3>
 <br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Overview, then Case, then Framework.<br />
OV: Our interpretation forces change away from squo. IT requires people to tie CRP to a plan. If it would happen in a donductive fr/w. Under their advocacy, people talk about personal ideology. We solve better – a clear analytic framework. </span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The resolution of 1998. Empirically been passed by debate community. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our McGEe evidence is phenomenal star – time constraints, and that everyone tries to win means that aff have made a strategic decision. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">McGee says that debating about debate in debate is not reductionist. Force us to change the community. </span></li></ol><br />

<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The same you avoid us </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">McGee evidence is not highly privileged. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Tiebreaker is the quality of our evidence. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We Force discussion about CRP but without unpredictability. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Their Shaw is not about debate. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Speice and Lyle asys it wil spill over.

TRQ CP ----- Text:<br />
The United States Federal Government should redistribute current quotas for sugar under the tariff rate quota system based on auctions for shares of the current level of allowable imported sugar. The USFG should use the revenue generated by auctions to compensate those who lose shares under the current quota system. The USFG should privately reassure sugar lobbies and producers that neither elimnation of the tariff rate quota for sugar or expansion of the tariff rate quota for sugar will ever be considered.<br />
