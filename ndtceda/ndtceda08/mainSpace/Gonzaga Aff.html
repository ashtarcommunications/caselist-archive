<br />
The Quirin decision is a loaded gun, as long as it remains on the books the executive can pick it up to deny people’s rights and establish a state of emergency. Inability to challenge the precedent itself is setting up an Orwellian future, only overruling it can check the sovereign.<br />

No greater threat to our constitution and out Bill of Rights….slaves who can only join the victims at the edge of the ditch<br />
<br />
The ‘enemy combatant’ designation is the linchpin of this new government paradign. The authority to designate enemy combatants is quite literally the authority to exclude anyone the state chooses from the field of humanity itself. This creates a class of existential enemies who must be utterly annihilated because the threat they pose is defined by their very being<br />
<br />
Wilke 04 “War v. Justice: Terrorism Cases, Enemy Combatants, and Political Justice in US Courts.” P.29-32<br />
<br />
The third possible dimension of political justice is the constitution….the elements from which the Bush stark portrayal of the existential enemy helps to identify the elements from which the Bush administration’s rhetoric borrowed.<br />
<br />
Last month the military commissions act of 06 became law- the legislation institutionalizes a worldview in which concern for ethical principals are forever subordinated to the imperatives of security. The Act enables limitless executive authority to designate anyone an enemy combatant making the rise of countless new detention centers inevitable. The world of the MCA promises salvation at the hands of the security state- a salvation that comes at the price of endless war waged against alterity.<br />

The context of the war on terrorism devastates their K in relation to contemporary biopolitics mere ethical condemnations of the state are insufficient. Human rights must be directly politicized in opposition to the Bush administration’s war on terror. Anything less merely sustains the apolitical squo impacted by our 1AC Diken, Pease and Zizek<br />
<br />
Diken 2006<br />
<br />
In relation to the biopolitics of terror and security…to avoid ethics becoming a transpolitical solution to a political problem it is necessary to hink politics in an indistinct ambivalent zone between the face as a gesture of revolt and human rights as a political line.<br />

Contention One – Legal Exceptionalism<br />
<br />
In 1942, the U.S. government executed six German citizens who President Roosevelt had designated as ‘enemy combatants’. Only after the executions did the Supreme Court release its decision in Ex Parte Quirin, as the result of executive coercion. Sixty years later, Quirin’s act of judicial fiat has been resurrected from the history books and employed as the justification for the detention of so-called ‘enemy combatants’<br />
Jesselyn A. Radack, J.D., Yale Law School, Founder and Executive Director of the Coalition for Civil Rights and Democratic Liberties, 2005, Review of Law and Social Change, 29 N.Y.U. Rev. L. &amp; Soc. Change 525, p. 531-536<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court has played an active role in allowing the executive to declare anyone an enemy combatant, and deny them legal standing. This establishes a two-tiered legal system, where people can be detained indefinitely and tortured under the auspices of law.<br />
Amy Kaplan - professor of English &amp; in the Humanities @ U. of Pennsylvania, former president of the American Studies Association - 2005 American Quarterly 57.3 831-858 “Where Is Guantánamo?” [nfb]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The ‘enemy combatants’ designation lies at the heart of the security state’s power over life and death. To wage global war on behalf of everyone, those declared to be ‘illegal’ combatants are removed not only from the field of the political, but from the very field of the human.<br />
Bulent Diken, Senior Lecturer in Sociology at Lancaster University, 2006, Irish Journal of Sociology, Vol. 15, No. 1, p. 84-86<br />
Treating suspected terrorists as a threat beyond the law creates never-ending war though an us-them mindset that divides the world into enemies we must destroy at all costs, this war will not end before the total annihilation of the globe.<br />
Gil Anidjar – Ass't Professor, Middle East and Asian Languages &amp; Cultures @ Columbia - 2004<br />
CR: The New Centennial Review 4.3 35-69 “Terror Right” Muse [nfb]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the authority to designate people as ‘enemy combatants’ has pernicious effects on all of us, not just those unfortunate enough to be detained at Guantanamo Bay. The Bush administration’s prosecution of the ‘war on terror’ has held all of us as a captive audience, and the American people’s acquiescence has allowed all politics to be held hostage by the imperatives of “homeland security”.<br />
Donald Pease, Avalon Foundation Chair of the Humanities at Dartmouth College, 2003, boundary 2, Vol. 30, No. 3, p. 14-17<br />
<br />
<br />
This apolitical state of affairs, with its attendant foundation of enemy-creation and catastrophe management, turns life in the ‘war on terror’ into nothing more than waiting for the next catastrophe to happen. Unfortunately, the ultimate catastrophe is this way of living, in permanent fear and in permanent need of the security state’s salvation.<br />
Bulent Diken, Senior Lecturer in Sociology at Lancaster University, 2006, Irish Journal of Sociology, Vol. 15, No. 1, p. 83-84<br />
<br />
<br />
This endless focus on survival above all else removes all value from life<br />
Slavoj Zizek, Professor of Sociology at the Institute for Sociology, Ljubljana University, 2003, The Puppet and the Dwarf: The Perverse Core of Christianity, p. 94-95<br />
<br />
<br />
Ethics begins with a response to the other whose life we deny. Violence only causes retaliation, and guarantees the worst humanity has to offer. Instead, we must refuse to murder the other for our own security – this imperative is the basis for non-violent solutions that impel connection, not destruction.<br />
Spoma Jovanovic (Department of Communication, University of North Carolina) and Roy V. Wood (Human Communication Studies, University of Denver) 2004 Philosophy and Rhetoric 37.4 317-334 “Speaking from the Bedrock of Ethics” [nfb]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court of the United States should overrule Ex Parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942), holding in the next available test case that the enemy combatant combatant status cannot be applied to persons detained by the United States government.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hamdan changed Quirin's precedent, but left a loophole by saying Geneva Conventions apply, but not to enemy combatants because of their status. The plan eliminates the designation and gives access to people detained.<br />
Welsh 2006 (Stephen, Legal analyst and research scholar at Center for Defense Information, July 6, Supreme Court Halts Guantanamo Bay Military Commissions, Applies Geneva Convention to War on Terror, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/program/document.cfm?DocumentID=3579&amp;from_page=../index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/program/document.cfm?DocumentID=3579&amp;from_page=../index.cfm</a>)<br />
<br />
<br />
The government holds detainees beyond recourse of law – sacrificing their rights for our protection makes us complicit in their treatment. Accepting this role invites further abuses of power – we must demand that the government comply with international norms of conduct.<br />
Natsu Taylor Saito, Professor of Law, Georgia State University College of Law, Spring 2005, Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review, 14 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 389, p. 405-408<br />
<br />
<br />
It is the court's responsibility to review executive policies that take people outside the domain of law. The Supreme Court must act to enforce the Geneva Convention, and protect the rights of people being detained.<br />
Diane Marie Amann - Professor of Law, University of California, Davis, School of Law – 2004 42 Colum. J. Transnat'l L. 263 “Guantanamo” [nfb]<br />
<br />
<br />
The legal category of ‘enemy combatants’ is a perfect opportunity to tactically intervene in the political field – the ‘enemy combatant’ designation is a contradiction in the official ideology surrounding the ‘war on terror’. Only directly challenging the authority to designate enemy combatants can come to terms with sovereign violence undertaken under the auspices of the ‘war on terror,’<br />
Melissa Gregg, Research Fellow at the Centre for Critical and Cultural Studies at the University of Queensland, September 2004, online: www.cccs.uq.edu.au/resources/unlawful.doc, accessed August 22, 2006<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The ideological edifice that sustains the Bush administration’s war machine is as fragile as the legal category of ‘enemy combatants’. Challenging the very foundation of the Bush administration’s ability to set enemy combatants outside the law eviscerates the power of America-qua-Homeland Security State. Only our affirmative makes an alternative to the global order of biopolitics possible.<br />

Moreover, the categories of &quot;truth&quot; and . . . and respond with confusion and deference.<br />
<br />
The doctrine of informed consent relies upon the physician as the ultimate authority on what must be done. This doctrine reinforces a system of health that seeks to establish norms, creating control over individual bodies. Gendered language said in context.<br />

Anti-abortion laws produce motherhood: . . . to the single norm of motherhood.<br />

In addition, there is no other proscription with a single greater impact on a woman’s life than an anti-abortion law. Bodies are drafted into the service of the state, and subjected to the will of the medical establishment.<br />

Now, it is quite clear that Roe v. Wade had . . . in this view, correctly decided.<br />
<br />
Regulatory control of sexuality is a critical point of biopolitical control because it allows deployment of micropolitical control over the body.<br />
<br />
Michel Foucault, ’78 (The History of Sexuality v. 1, p.145-147)[JonW]<br />
This is the background that enables us . . . rather than the menace of death.<br />
<br />
Sexuality is an especially dense transfer point for power relations in which agencies of power can gain knowledge and discipline of the body and regulation of populations.<br />
<br />
Barry Cooper, prof of poli sci @ U Calgary, ’81 (Michel Foucault: An Introduction to the Study of His Thought, p. 130-131)[JonW]<br />
Because sexuality is &quot;an especially dense . . . order that things be normal.<br />
<br />
The ultimate impact to both parts of our advantage is that the system of control and regulation that has replaced the power over death has resulted in wholesale slaughter and genocide through control of the body. Gendered language said in context.<br />

Michel Foucault, ’78 (The History of Sexuality v. 1, p. 136-137)[JonW]<br />
Since the classical age the West has . . . large-scale phenomena of population.<br />

Thus, the plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey [505 US 833 (1992)] on the grounds that any government burdens imposed on those seeking abortions are unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
Our next contention is solvency<br />
<br />
By defining Casey in terms of liberty granted under equal protection, the affirmative allows greater ability by individuals to define their own lives and reclaim their bodies.<br />

The shift noted here is in the level of generality . . . right has textual support in the Constitution. 233<br />

A commitment to reproductive freedom is the fundamental rejection of biopolitics.<br />

I CULTURE OF DEATH. Casey unilaterally established a culture of death which declares a right to define reality. This murderous relativism destroys any attempt at objective morality making everything acceptable. Budziszewski, 99 www.firstthings.com'/ftissues/ft9903/articles/butziszewski.html &quot;If you want to know why. .. The End of Democracy?&quot; radical subjectivity mystery of human life What is the meaning of the human. Lower court rulings follow. Greater willingness<br />
Casey's relativism puts America on the road to Auschwitz. 4000 kids are murdered everyday as part of the largest systematic slaughter the world has ever seen, or would have except for the targeted rhetorical strategies used to numb the populace to the murder occurring right under our noses. Brennan 95 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newoxfordreview.org/article.jsp?did=1195-brennan" rel="nofollow">http://www.newoxfordreview.org/article.jsp?did=1195-brennan</a> &quot;not only did O'Connor call abortion. . . victims as disease entities&quot; comparable to Nazi extermination of the Jews. Abortion prospective victims. Holocaust abortion justification. Reconceptualization victim disease<br />
No politics DA. It is not a question of when, abortion is totalitarian violence and must be rejected every time at every instance. Even if our strategy fails we cannot negotiate compromise with human life Budziszewski 99 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.firsthings.com/ftissues/ft9903/articles/busdziszewski.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.firsthings.com/ftissues/ft9903/articles/busdziszewski.html</a> &quot;The charge of absolutism. . . in the here and now&quot; 99<br />
legal personhood is the central question in the face of atrocities. The denial of fetal personhood enables the dehumanization necessary for this totalitarianism. Brennan 95 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newoxfordreview.org/article.jsp?did=1195-brennan" rel="nofollow">http://www.newoxfordreview.org/article.jsp?did=1195-brennan</a> &quot;Killing at the level of a holocaust. . . same manner&quot; stripping away the rights of the individual. Totality of government legally nonpersons. Large scale killing Nazi holocaust,. Abortionists defend themselves<br />
Casey's culture of death culminates in a world without meaning. Reduced to singular &quot;things&quot;, we consume both nature and people in a search for secular truth only to find meaningless relationships with the divine, ourselves, nature, and those around us. All impacts becomes inevitable in a world where all is acceptable. John Paul II 95 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_jp02ev.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_jp02ev.htm</a> &quot;we can find them in an overall assessment of a cultural and moral nature. . . fundamental rights, the right to life. . . &quot;merely 'possessed' or 'rejected'. . . darkest moral blindness&quot;<br />
