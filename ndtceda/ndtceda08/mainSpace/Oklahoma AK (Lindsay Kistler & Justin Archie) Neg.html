 The 1ac makes a fatal attempt at understanding the global predicament and particularly the middle east arrangements.  History has many stories to be told of colonialism, imperialisms, nationalism and, now we contest neoliberal globalization.  The perception that those in the Middle East will have of the affirmative plan must investigated beyond the talking heads of the political journals or media that proclaims “X” country will accept our plan.  Our position is that the affirmative engagement is focused on political and economic engagement, but does not investigate the importance of cultural engagement.  Affirmative policies on the economical and political level are locked up in the ideology of neoliberal globalization that cannot be separated from the state actors by which they endorse.<br />
<br />
Levine writes in 2005:<br />
<br />
<br />
We can compare the revolutionary tactics of the affirmative to the hippie culture, proclaiming that the engagement on a political and economical level allows the affirmative resistance to be coopted because of its inablitiy to escape the modernity matrix.<br />
<br />
Levine continues:<br />
<br />
<br />
The affirmative is approaching middle eastern politics though it was amateur night.  We contend that their lack of in depth discussion on the interrelated forces that cause their impacts to occur proves that they are not ready for a more cultural or critical engagement with the middle east.<br />
<br />
Levine continues:<br />
<br />
<br />
The people here in the United Sates suffer from an Axis of Arrogance.  As long as this ideology maintains its form, we lack the ability to build true solidarity with the people in the middle east.  We need to focus on liberating ourselves from arrogance and attempt to take control of our country which is have devastating effects on the world.<br />
<br />
Levine writes:<br />
<br />
<br />
The alternative for evading this axis of arrogance is not found in continuous economic and political engagement, but it demands an engagement on a different level that the affirmative fails to address.  The alternative of culture jamming allows us to understand the middle east culture and puts individuals in the place of being active producers of culture rather than passive consumers that are cogs in the neo-liberal system.<br />
<br />
Levine in 2005:<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly we offer justification for our culture jamming:<br />
