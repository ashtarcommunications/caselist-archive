 <strong>Affirmative: Biofuels<br />
<br />
Contention One is Food Security<br />
<br />
US biofuel subsidies are the key factor in creating a food security crisis – this is resulting in a protectionist backlash from civil unrest that will multiply the impacts of high food prices</strong><br />
Runge, Minnesota University Applied Economics and Law Distinguished Professor and Senauer, Minnesota University Applied Economics Professor, 5/28/2008 <br />
[C. Ford and Benjamin, &quot;How Ethanol Fuels the Food Crisis,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080528faupdate87376/c-ford-runge-benjamin-senauer/how-ethanol-fuels-the-food-crisis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080528faupdate87376/c-ford-runge-benjamin-senauer/how-ethanol-fuels-the-food-crisis.html</a>]<br />
&quot;The average price of corn has increased… purses of the world's poor.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Scenario 1: Starvation</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>This price spike guarantees famines resulting in starvation and death – even if the plan only slows down this price spike it solves and prevents massive social unrest</strong>  Natsios, Former U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator, 5/14/2008 <br />
[Andrew, &quot;Global Food Crisis,&quot; Lexis, Congressional Testimony]<br />
&quot;The principle areas… starvation and death.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Food insecurity will cause nearly 3 billion people to starve and massively entrench poverty</strong> Runge, University of Minnesota Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy director, and Senauer, applied economics professor, May/June 7  <br />
[C. Ford, U. Minnesota Applied Economics and law professor, and Benjamin, Food Industry Center co-director, &quot;How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor,&quot; Foreign Affairs, l/n]<br />
&quot;The industry's growth… global poverty and food security.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>No risk of a turn – High prices don’t help third world farmers – protectionist backlash checks the benefits of trade and it does nothing for the billions starving</strong> Runge, Minnesota University Applied Economics and Law Distinguished Professor and Senauer, Minnesota University Applied Economics Professor, October 2007<br />
[C. Ford and Benjamin, “Food for Fuel?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070901faresponse86512/tom-daschle-c-ford-runge-benjamin-senauer/food-for-fuel.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070901faresponse86512/tom-daschle-c-ford-runge-benjamin-senauer/food-for-fuel.html</a>]<br />
&quot;But the ethanol boom's… it will be of no help to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Prioritize starvation impacts even if it leads to extinction</strong> LaFollette, South Florida University Ethics Chair, 2003 <br />
[Hugh, &quot;World Hunger,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stpt.usf.edu/hhl/papers/World.Hunger.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.stpt.usf.edu/hhl/papers/World.Hunger.htm</a>]<br />
&quot;We have a strong obligation…. at the expense of the starving.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Scenario 2: International Instability</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>This spike in food prices is sparking international unrest resulting in the worst violations of human dignity and a mass backlash sparking in international instability</strong> Spiegel, German newspaper staff, 4/14/2008 <br />
[&quot;The Fury of the Poor,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,druck-547198,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,druck-547198,00.html</a>]<br />
&quot;Rising food prices have made basic staples… claimed about 100 lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Food crisis causes billions to starve, destroying human dignity, and causing global civilization collapse</strong> Sheeran, UN WFP (World Food Programme) Executive Director, 7/30/2008<br />
[Josette, &quot;Food Prices,&quot; Congressional Testimony,&quot; Lexis]<br />
<br />
<strong>This also makes disad impacts inevitable – international instability from food prices will trigger global conflict, disease spread, and economic, and political collapse</strong>  Winnail, Ph.D., M.P.H, 1996 (Douglas S., “On the Horizon: Famine,” September/October, <br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.kurtsaxon.com/foods004.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kurtsaxon.com/foods004.htm</a>) <br />
&quot;No other  economic indicator… without historical precedent!&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Text: The United States Federal Government should eliminate domestic subsidies for biofuel, eliminate the ethanol mandate, and eliminate the biofuel tariff.</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Contention Two is Solvency</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Biofuels are the key lever – even if other factors are driving food prices, changing biofuel production is the only realistic policy that can change food prices</strong> Martin, NY Times staff writer, 5/15/2008 <br />
[Andrew, &quot;Fuel Choices, Food Crises and Finger-Pointing,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/business/worldbusiness/15food.html?pagewanted=print" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/business/worldbusiness/15food.html?pagewanted=print</a>]<br />
&quot;Even if biofuels are not the primary… pull the lever.'”<br />
<br />
<strong>Ending subsidies will effectively turn this lever – cutting subsidies ends the ethanol craze</strong> Yacobucci, Congressional Research Services (CRS) Science, and Industry Division Energy and Environmental Policy Specialist, March 28, 2008<br />

&quot;Proponents and opponents agree… from 1998 levels.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>US subsidy policy is the core reason for status quo ethanol production and prices</strong> Runge, University of Minnesota Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy director, and Senauer, applied economics professor, May/June 7  <br />
[C. Ford, U. Minnesota Applied Economics and law professor, and Benjamin, Food Industry Center co-director, &quot;How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor,&quot; Foreign Affairs, l/n]<br />
&quot;One root of the problem… repercussions for consumers.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Quick fixes won’t do – a fundamental shift in US biofuel subsidies is key to providing long-term food security – the alternative is escalating unrest and instability in third world nations</strong> Teslik, CFR Assistant Editor, 5/28/2008 <br />
[Lee Hudson, &quot;Where Farm Policy the Food Crisis ,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16347/where_farming_meets_the_food_crisis.html?breadcrumb=%2F" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/16347/where_farming_meets_the_food_crisis.html?breadcrumb=%2F</a>]<br />
&quot;New legislation pending… reforms to agricultural policy.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>US subsidy policy is resulting in a new era of hunger – millions are starving as a result on ethanol production</strong> Istook, Former Oklahoma Congressman, Heritage Foundation Distinguished Fellow, 2/26/2008 <br />

&quot;Across the globe… cheap food is over.'&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Ethanol production can never compete – without subsidies it would collapse</strong> Hassett, AEI Resident Scholar, Economic Policy studies Director, 2/13/2006 <br />
[Kevin, &quot;Ethanol's a Big Scam, and Bush Has Fallen for It,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.23871,filter.all/pub_detail.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.23871,filter.all/pub_detail.asp</a><br />
&quot;The spending makes… wasting all that energy.&quot;<br />

<strong>World Bank Study proves US push for biofuels responsible for 75% jump in food prices—diverts grain from food stocks, takes land out of food production, and encourages speculation</strong> Chakrabortty, ¬¬The Guardian Lead Economics Writer, 7-4-8<br />
(Aditya, “Secret report: biofuel caused food crisis; Internal World Bank study delivers blow to plant energy drive”, The Guardian)<br />
