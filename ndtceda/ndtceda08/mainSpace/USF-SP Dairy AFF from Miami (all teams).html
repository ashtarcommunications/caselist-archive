<u><strong>OBSERVATION ONE: MILK MONEY</strong></u><br />
<br />
First: Antiquated dairy subsidy programs fill school lunch programs with dairy products as a welfare program for dairy suppliers by purchasing surplus commodities.<br />

<em>At a time when ... develop healthier menus.</em><br />
<br />
Second: This “win-win” scenario actually embodies a form of institutional and economic racism because non-white school children are proportionately much more likely to be lactose intolerant. Thus, for 70 percent of black kids in public schools, crippling digestive issues are practically mandated by the US Government though its subsidy program for dairy products.<br />

Che, July 9, &quot;Not Milk: The USDA, Monsanto, and the U.S. Dairy Industry&quot; AlterNet <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.alternet.org/story/13557/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternet.org/story/13557/</a><br />
<em>With the recent passage ... intolerant of or allergic to.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>THE PLAN</strong>: The United States Federal Government should should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies for dairy by eliminating all federal dairy subsidy programs. We reserve the right to clarify intent.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>OBSERVATION TWO: WHITENESS</strong></u><br />
<br />
First: An examination of the racial component behind dairy subsidies wouldn’t be complete without understanding milk as a racialized commodity, a totem of whiteness. The industrialization of the dairy industry through government subsidy goes hand-in-hand with the state-sponsored promotion of milk as an ideal beverage – the influence of whiteness is concealed behind these narratives, and we are obliged to examine the role of our own racial priviledge in the creation of the modern dairy industry.<br />

ASA Paper &quot;White Food: Milk, Race and the Politics of Perfection&quot; Melanie DuPuis (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/3/2/3/p103230_index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/3/2/3/p103230_index.html</a>)<br />
<em>What the story ... attention to food and to rural places.</em><br />
<br />
Second: Racism is the fundemental mechanism of biopower. Since institutional racism is intrinsically an action excercised by the government, we are obliged to center our resistance against racism with demands against the state. We demand that the US government remove its support for the dairy industry in the form of economic subsidies.<br />

<em>In the context of power ... replaces the “old sovereign.”</em><br />
<br />
Third: There is a personal component to our policy advocacy. We know that judges don’t cause nuclear wars, but we understand that because we are entangled in the webs and systemic operations of whiteness, we can open a space for renegotiating our white identity by participating in the continuous project of reinventing ourselves.<br />
<strong>YANCY 2008</strong><br />
George, &quot;Black Bodies, White Gaze: The Continuing significance of race.&quot;<br />
<em>Dismantling whiteness is ... destabilizing their white identity.</em><br />
<br />
Fourth: Our plan text is our advocacy, but nobody in Congress is going to pass our 1AC no matter how persuasive we are. However, we know that language itself is a form of action, and debate rounds are part of the terrain of dissent where we can carve out space for resistance against institutionalized racism and whiteness.<br />
<strong>BLEIKER 2000</strong><br />
Roland Bleiker, &quot;Popular dissent, human agency, and global politics&quot; p 219-220<br />
<em>Language is one of ... discursive forms of transversal dissent.</em><br />
<br />
Finally: We’re not ridiculous enough to think that the struggle against racism can be wrapped up with a debate ballot. However, we caution against any form of indulgence towards racism, no matter how minor. We are ethically obligated to find opportunities to seek out and reject racism at every opportunity – it’s the foundational logic behind conflict, violence, and domination.<br />
<strong>MEMMI 2000</strong><br />
Albert, &quot;Racism&quot; Translated by Steve Martinot.<br />
<em>The struggle against racism ... stakes are irresistable.</em><br />
<br />
<u><strong>OBSERVATION THREE: THE DISPOSITION OF YOUR ARGUMENTS</strong></u><br />
<br />
First: We know debate is a game and that you’re probably under the impression that the only fair way to play the game is to allow you to have links to your disadvantages and case turns. That’s cool and all, but we just want you to understand that we take this “fiat is illusory” stuff pretty seriously and we think that you can advocate against our policy without having to resort to great power wars. We’re not gonna kick you out of the room for reading a politics disad, but we’re definitely going to critique your impacts and internal links.<br />
<br />
Second: Speaking of critiquing your disadvantages, we find that they’re typically logically bankrupt and hilariously end in nuclear war nearly every time. But, it’s not really a joke, because defining risk is inherently an exercise in power and a political act which needs to be scrutinized with a critical lens.<br />

<em>Outsiders to contest debating ... scrutinized with a critical lens.</em><br />
<br />
Finally: Lots of the Negative teams we debate have a lurid fascination with nuclear war impacts. We’re DEFINITELY not cool with that. The discursive promotion of the imaginary grand catastrophe in the standard nuke war impact card subordinates the almost daily nuclear war waged against the Fourth World and Indigenous nations – we don’t agree with those forms of discursive violence.<br />
