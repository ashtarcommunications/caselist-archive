Aff: Micro-Finance<br />
Judge: Randi Hooker<br />
<br />
Plan text: same as above<br />
<br />
Case outline (See cites above):<br />
Ad 1 - Central Asian Stability: Afghanistan is on the brink of collapse, which is bad as the nation is key to C.A. stability and prevention of Taliban spillover. Plan would solve thise and the India-Pakistan conflict in the region. Impact = extinction.<br />
Ad 2 - Soft Power: Econ. assistance is key to soft power which is low now. The plan is key to reversing this trend in the Muslim world which strengthens hegemony in turn solving nuclear war. Impact = Khalilzad's nuke scenario.<br />
Ad 3 - Women's Rights: Afghanistan is horribly patriarchal society, in large part due to the lack of micro-credit finance. This violence against women justifies all types of violence, including nuke war and genocide. Impact = nuke and genocide.<br />
Ad 4 - Terrorisk: We are losing the war on terror, the center of which is Afghanistan. Afghanistan is on the brink and without plan we risk an increase of terrorism with the regneration of Al Quaeda. Impact = extinction.<br />
