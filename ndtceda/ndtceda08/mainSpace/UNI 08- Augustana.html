Contention One – Democide <br />
The newest version of the Farm Bill increases subsidies for CAFOs, allowing such farming operations to expand. <br />

CAFOs represent the consolidation of political, economic and academic interests. <strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Attempts to render the CAFO industry more efficient merely buy into the corporate ideology that colonizes the academy and politics under the pretense of sustainability. Unless deliberate attempts are made to stand up and reclaim the farm from the meat industrial complex, collapse of agriculture is inevitable.</span></strong><br />
Mark <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Winne</span></strong>, Freelance Writer and Consultant, 3/22/<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2k6</span></strong> “Meat-Industrial Complex: How factory farms undercut public health,” In These Times, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/2525/" rel="nofollow">http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/2525/</a><br />
Herein lies the…<u>can hope for</u>.<br />
The expansion of CAFOs shreds the social fabric of target communities by reinforcing class and racial divisions and amplifying the environmental and health consequences of industrial agriculture. This reduction in community cohesion causes a substantial drop in civic participation and cohesion. <br />

Democracy is the ultimate impact – it is the equivalent of nuclear war, it sanctions all forms of violence and is responsible for the vast majority of history’s death and destruction.<br />

<u>Power kills</u>, <u>absolute…</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">of the Dead. </span><br />
Corporate consolidation turns agriculture away from principles such as family, community and land stewardship. Routinizing all functions within the factory is the ethical and social condition that makes farming and life void of happiness. As long as agriculture continues to be driven by the need to capitalize and expedite profits, we will remain stuck in an imbalanced world of control and specialization. <br />

Contention Two – Democracy Now! <br />
The affirmative is an alternative approach to agriculture. Starting with a holistic framework that integrates economic, ecological and social considerations within a balanced approach, not motivated by incentives or subsidies, breaks the routine for agricultural communities and sets the stage for a radical transformation of politics, ethics and economics. <br />
John <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ikerd</span></strong>, Professor Emeritus at University of Missouri – Columbia, <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2k8</span></strong> “New Farm Management,”<span style="color: red;"> </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-New%20Farm%20Management%20(3-08).htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-New%20Farm%20Management%20(3-08).htm</a> <br />
<u>For new farmers…anything very well</u>.<br />
Reducing subsidies creates an equal and shared responsibility for creating a holistic farm economy that challenges the consolidation and mechanization of agriculture.<br />
John <strong>Ikerd</strong>, Professor Emeritus at University of Missouri-Columbia, <strong>2k8</strong> “New Farm Economics,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-New%20Farm%20Economics%20%281-08%29.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-New%20Farm%20Economics%20(1-08).htm</a><br />
<u>Industrial farming doesn’t…</u>way of life.<br />
Rural communities are at a critical turning point. Forcing citizens to sacrifice their well-being for a future defined by CAFOs guarantees the continuation of a lifetime of deprivation. Rejecting CAFOs represents a critical step towards revolution above and beyond corporate industrialism and helps invigorate a new democratic citizenship of ethics, responsibility and creativity. <br />
John <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ikerd</span></strong>, Professor Emeritus, University of Missouri, Columbia, 7/26/<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2k8</span></strong> “Impacts of CAFOs on Rural Communities,” Prepared for presentation at <em><span style="color: black;">Indiana's State-wide CAFO Watch Conference</span></em><span style="color: black;">, Sponsored by the Socially Responsible Agricultural Project (SRA), Hartford City, IN. </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/Indiana%20--%20CAFOs%20%20Communities.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/Indiana%20--%20CAFOs%20%20Communities.htm</a> <br />
<u>Rural communities are…their own destinies</u>.<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt; color: windowtext;">Debate is the key forum to challenge the hegemony of factory farms. The CAFO issue has the potential to tear apart the seams of social cohesion, but only taking a stand and defending a position on the issue in local forums, like this round, can redirect attention towards addressing factory farms and the consolidation, industrialization and exploitation of American agriculture. </span><br />

The affirmative is critical to reinvigorating a spirit of democratic participation. Refusing to sacrifice the future for the sake of profit can serve as the launching point to resist intrusions by industrial agriculture and broader assaults on community and environment.<br />

 Contention One – Anthropocentrism –<br />
The Farm Bill increases subsidies for CAFOs, allowing factory farms to expand.<br />

Factory farms sacrifice the basic dignity of farm animals for short-term economic calculations, denying being’s intrinsic worth and causing the needless suffering of living, breathing creatures.<br />

<u>As farming has</u>…animals and humans.<br />
The systematic exploitation of animals is the foundation for racism, sexism, colonialism, genocide and the Holocaust.<br />
Steven <strong>Best</strong>, Associate Professor of Humanities and Philosophy at University of Texas, El Paso, <strong>2k7</strong> Journal of Critical Animal Studies, Volume V, Issue 2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.criticalanimalstudies.org/JCAS/archives.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.criticalanimalstudies.org/JCAS/archives.htm</a><br />
It is little understood…under its command.<br />
The treatment of animals in factory farms is directly connecting to the broader question of humanity’s relationship with the environment. Industrial style factory farming is a direct assault on the biological support systems provided by nature.<br />
<strong>Sierra Club</strong>, “Clean Water &amp; Factory Farms: Inhumane Treatment of Farm Animals,” <strong>2k8</strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sierraclub.org/factoryfarms/factsheets/inhumane.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.sierraclub.org/factoryfarms/factsheets/inhumane.asp</a><br />
<u>There is a direct…violation of nature</u>.<br />
Unquestioned adherence to a cultural pathology that privileges human-centeredness ensures that every living organism on Earth will be exhausted to the point of extinction. We must recenter our thinking towards a recognition of humanity’s connection to the living, natural world in order to have any hope for challenging the rapidly escalating industrial plunder.<br />
Thomas <strong>Berry</strong>, Director of the Riverdale Center for Religious Research in New York, 19<strong>93</strong> Revision, 16(2), “The Viable Human,” (Reprinted in Environmental Philosophy: From Animal Rights to Radical Ecology (1998), Ed. Zimmerman, p. 184-6)<br />
<u>A deep cultural…what is worthwhile</u>.<br />
This anthropocentric mindset is clearly misguided – only a broader sense of self identification can lead us to realize that humans have always been alive as part of the natural world. This redefinition of life gives us the courage to enter into a politics capable of finding meaning even in the event of catastrophe. Only our deep ecological perspective can avert extinction.<br />

<strong><u>THUS THE PLAN:</u></strong><br />
The United States Congress should eliminate its agricultural support for concentrated animal feeding operations.<br />
Contention Two – Deep Ecology –<br />
The plan is critical to realizing the links between anthropocentric thinking and the coming ecological crisis – examining how animals are constituted as separate from humans unifies the ecological movement towards sustainability. Your ballot can make a difference by refusing to support cruelty towards animals.<br />

<u>While factory farming's…don't eat meat</u>.&quot;<br />
The horrors of animal farming are a warrant for incarceration, suppression and premature death. These practices are justified by the belief in the greater moral worth of human means. We must question our consumer choices – rather than simply call for improvements in animals’ welfare, by adopting a lifestyle and diet that refuses the consumption of CAFO products.<br />

The resultant economic and political environment ensures that CAFOs multiply and expand, eliminating small farms and making agricultural collapse inevitable. Attempts to render the CAFO industry more efficient merely buy into the corporate ideology that colonizes the academy and politics under the pretense of sustainability.<br />

Such exploitation is manifested in the existence of factory farms which are colonizing rural America and the world by framing their actions in the interests of the colonized. Such justifications are ethically inexcusable, and must be confronted to avoid untold violence and destruction.<br />

The political context… in the past.<br />
<br />
Corporate consolidation turns agriculture away from principles such as family, community and land stewardship.

As long as agriculture continues to be driven by the need to capitalize and expedite profits, we will remain stuck in an imbalanced world of control and specialization.<br />

Ask farmers why… becomes agribusiness management.<br />
<br />
Thus, my partner and I affirm the resolution that: The United States Federal Government should eliminate all domestic subsidies for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations.<br />
<br />
We do so not with the intention of debating about the consequences of this action, but rather as a declaration of economic independence. We will defend that the resolution is a good idea, but believe the prior question in this debate is the reasoning used to justify our political positions.<br />
<br />
We read the resolution as a starting point for discussion. We not pretend to know the consequences of our action, but do believe it is necessary to discuss these consequences within the context of this debate.<br />
<br />
The negative can run their disadvantages, counterplans and kritiks, but they must be held responsible for defending the reasons they believe their advocacy is true. Whether defending the status quo, a counterplan or kritik alternative, the negative must win that their advocacy results in better conditions for fostering discussion about the issues confronting the resolution.<br />
<br />
The role of the ballot in this debate is to affirm the best possibilities for fostering discussion and confronting our responsibility in the corporatization of agriculture, namely an examination of our personal relationship with the production of food, the use of the land and the construction of community.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – Resuscitating Thought –<br />
<br />
The affirmative is an alternative approach to agriculture. Staring with a holistic framework that integrates economic, ecological and social considerations within a balanced approach, not motivated by incentives or subsidies, breaks the routine for agricultural communities and sets the stage for a radical transformation of politics, ethics and economics.<br />

For new farmers… anything very well.<br />
<br />
Economic colonialism of rural America is neither necessary nor inevitable – the solution begins by creating an awareness of the colonial processed being undertaken. The ballot can serve as a declaration of economic independence, a recognition that corporate livestock production is not the answer and the beginning of a stand in solidarity necessary to rebuild communities from the inside-out.<br />

After the corporations… ecologically, and culturally.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt; color: windowtext;">Debate is the key forum to challenge the hegemony of factory farms. The CAFO issue has the potential to tear apart the seams of social cohesion, but only taking a stand and defending a position on the issue in local forums, like this round, can redirect attention towards addressing factory farms and the consolidation, industrialization and exploitation of American agriculture. </span><br />

Biodiversity and ecosystem function…business as a result.<br />
<br />
Contention Four – Small Farms –<br />
Subsidies rather than technological innovation drive the consolidation of farming operations, allowing CAFOs to drive small and medium farms out of the market.<br />

The increasing size…meat, </span>milk, and eggs.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">CAFOs are the single biggest factor destroying small farms.<br />

Small family farms…out of existence.<br />
<br />
In fact, factory farms cause the loss of 330 farmers every week. </span><br />

Another hidden cost…</span>future economic growth.<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br />
Large industrialized farms promote monoculture – small farms are key.<br />

If small farms…diverse farming systems.<br />
<br />
Monoculture risks extinction<br />

While many may…<span class="underline0">America and Asia.</span><br />
<br />
Thus the Plan:<br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support by eliminating all of the domestic subsidies for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations.<br />
<br />
Contention Five – Solvency<br />
<br />
Eliminating subsidies would have a ripple effect that reduces CAFO market share while making alternative farming practices cost competitive, reducing environmental and pollution problems caused by factory farms. </span><br />

The report also…</span>critical, Gurian-Sherman said.<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt; color: windowtext;"><br />
Eliminating subsidies would allow smaller, more diverse livestock producers to capture the market share of factory farms by raising production costs for CAFOs. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt; color: windowtext;">Our findings suggest…</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">$4.26/cwt over CAFOs.<br />
