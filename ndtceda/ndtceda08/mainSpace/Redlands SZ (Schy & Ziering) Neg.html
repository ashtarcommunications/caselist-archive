Redlands SZ NEG<br />
The 1NC indicates that Bard’s “love” can also be captured by the negative, that the negative can also affirm love. They also say that love and hate are two sides of the same coin. They read a couple of poems:<br />
<em>In Mad Love and War</em>  by Joy Harjo<br />
“Original Memory”<br />
<em>Emplumada</em>  by Lorna Dee Cervantes<br />
“Poem for the young white man who asked me how I, an intelligent, well-read person could believe in the war between races”<br />
The Neg block indicates that they affirm love as well, but they also affirm the fact that hate is sometimes unavoidably tied to love. The 1NR says that the affirmative’s argument that to affirm love necessitates writing “aff” on the ballot displays their lack of love for the negative, and for the notion of competition and debate – but not at all in the traditional senses of those words.<br />
Poems read in the Neg Block:<br />

When talking about power relations and gender, they are not abstract. Fiat game distances us from this – court room drama reproduces mascality and feminity. Story of medusa – gorgonas head threatening from sea. Raped by _ <u>transformed medusa with 1000 snakes. Female of the rapist go unpunished – male gods transformed from a being . Athena became protected goddess of heroes. See medusa without looking at her, grimace expresses the remember. Monster is the emblem of the gods, medusa = relates destruction of female culture. Persus failed to achieve his goal, killed enemy in her sleep. Medusa lives on. Name for mermaids, ambivalent male view female. The threatening mother and submissive virgin – man becomes hero. Persus encounters virgin, kills the monster and vigin goes to him. Action suddenly aride, adromida (ruler of men). Relate one in the same feminity. Persus must dominate mysterious medusa, prize is virgin – lock women into passive object. No rep or signifier – know and speak for themselves subject of desire. (spivak)<br />

Proper:<br />
No perm – defend what the neg does in the round – don’t advocate anything<br />
Limited in what we claim to s for, can’t suck up advocacy<br />
No text that the perm would include – no alternative – we criticize and that is good<br />
Still haven’t included criticism to remedy harms we talk about<br />
No answer if they can sign on to global projects – neg could never win<br />
No link ans: their yow about women being victims all the time. Goldfarb’s evidence talks about the virgin sacrifice – same metaphor – imagination of feminine other<br />
The court still uses victim identity even if the aff doesn’t<br />
Becard – women was viewed as manipulative<br />
Main problem is exposure – media ready to judge you<br />
Certain space in the court – cult of victim hood – have to be read in a certain way – edle Morrison xx<br />
They argue for law so people can speak for themselves – intro people to previous power – not enough to create new access points<br />
Question how the previous points of power function<br />
Previous point of power is around a locus – impetus for gender violence<br />
VAWA doesn’t force – aff says this is the only way to solve, weisman etc<br />
<ul><li>they think they are not a part of it</li></ul>put fault on people who don’t go for vawa, congress feels like the hero<br />
this masks the role of people debate space, congress etc.<br />
MacKinnon only defend her argument in passive best link<br />
Goldfarb evidence says they will change violence into public ideal assumes this is beneficial. She hasn’t questioned what this public ideal image will be, this is actually a super charge link to the neg evidence.<br />
Neg creates real transformation<br />
Tort law still relies on performing identity of the victim, paternalist identity<br />
Control the state is a fantasy of being able to be the hero without doing anything and still relies on same energy<br />
Weisman paints congress as the savior of women recreates the medusa drama. Congress can feel like the guilt free hero, linked to victimizations argument.<br />
Criticism does more than fantasy of proposing change. CARD TAG. Morrison 06<br />
1nr:<br />
They say exposing is k to solve, who do you expose why are you transparent? Spivak argument, the aff ignores the role that intellectual plays in painting themselves as the hero of these women to win the ballot. Exposure of violence is tainted.<br />
Aff says Action is k for women – naïve to address women without thinking about our discourse – spivak.<br />
Debaters don’t have infinite power – beg for fiat.<br />
Facilitate understanding of patriarchy – prereq<br />
Aff rehashes gender violence, Athena was pissed off at medusa for violating temple.<br />
Paints the state as hero, ignores the violence the state creates<br />
Person can be talked about in exchange for a win, jury decides<br />
Xx – gaitons 97<br />
Go back to colmedge – this argument assumes we are agent less in the crisis. He only talks about goal oriented about debate.<br />
Policy k to social change, the aff cannot solve for this, this still links to rep arguments<br />
Change law cx 1st framework<br />
Spivak don’t answer the people, metaphor has to do with war and oppression. Chances to explain what this means in debate. No impacts to metaphor being misinterpreted.<br />
Extend mackinnon answered in 2nc<br />
Psychoanalysis is not the neg even if it is ref in ev. Merging forces the confrontation of identities, simply the way they are constructed in the law<br />
Back to Schneider, power to stop violence starts with me, assumes they have no ability to change it<br />

<br />
Going for fiat and roleplaying. Not vawa.<br />
You are processes of information, this ishow they make their claims. Fails to look at what we are.<br />
Mask of the norms of debate space, it strucally excludes and locks the passive victim. Gatison speaks wonders on this question.<br />
They maintain gender violence by speaking the victim’s concern.<br />
Feeling like they need the wand to be the hero, nihilism, wait for sword. Can finally change the world when we get X.<br />
Our k offers the most substantial chance at doing this, challenge the identity we construct in our identity. Keel<br />
Morrison writes this is how it affects the law itself, academic elitism in spivak<br />
Rely on winning debate on how they have created adv. This is link turned because it forces us into nihilist practice – spivak evidence.<br />
Three roles:<br />
Transparent speaker – deliver info<br />
Transparent audience – someone who gets to decide gender violence should be rejected<br />
Subaltern – people who are actually subject for violence<br />
No impetus to criticize how subaltern is excluded from the debate.<br />
Perm can’t happen – devolving into argument of they do what we do, but they haven’t.<br />
Weisman is about implementation but not the involvement of victims, the aff will go for this. Spivak more correct on this when talking about debate.<br />
Culmedge assumes this abstract violence – a goal to debate. Don’t actually do anything.<br />
Micro political better on this because of these structures, top down change rooted in same problematic.<br />
Story isn’t critical to argument, aren’t answering this assumes the abstract justice.<br />

2nc: Claims Oklahoma’s pirates bad arguments are unwarranted- they don’t necessarily identify with the certain types of pirates named by the evidence.

<strong>Negative against Morrison:</strong><br />
The courtroom drama reproduces myths of femininity and masculinity that are responsible for gender violence and maintain structural exclusion of the subaltern. We begin with the story of Medusa, as told by Klausman, Menzerin, and Kuhn, in 1997 Women Pirates: The Politics of the Jolly Roger<br />
<u>“Medusa is the Gorgon’s head threatening to emerge from the sea.<br />
…the beautiful woman and her monstrous mother relate one and the same femininity.”<br />
<br />
Perseus is the savior, divinely enabled to right the world’s wrongs. In order to achieve his mastery, he must dominate the mysterious and horrible Medusa. His prize at the end is the virgin princess, a beautiful image of the other, passive and without agency. Gayatri Spivak provides analysis in the context of intellectual discourse. The practice of ‘speaking out’ on behalf of the marginalized and suffering can lock them into the passive role of the feminized object. It simultaneously allows the speaker to play hero, imagining that he or she is saving the other rather than enslaving it.<br />
Spivak, “Can the Subaltern speak?”<br />
“In the Foucault-Deleuze conversation, the issue seems to be that there is… obliteration of the trace of that Other in its precarious Subject-ivity.”<br />
<br />
The myth rehashes itself in the legal setting of the courtroom.<br />
Caroline Picart, “Rhetorically reconfiguring victimhood and agency: the Violence Against Women Act’s Civil Rights Clause”, <em>Rhetoric and Public Affairs</em> 6.1<br />
“Putting aside the inflated rhetoric… the vengeful woman (agent) and the terrified woman (victim).”<br />
<br />
The victim identity is also intensely racialized, making it difficult for women of color to access the legal tools and remedies provided by the Affirmative.<br />
Adele M. Morrison, “Changing the Domestic Violence (Dis)course: Moving from White Victim to Multi-Cultural Survivor”, <em>UC Davis Law Review</em> 39.3<br />
“The first element of domestic violence legal discourse… society imagines that it is she who needs protection.”<br />
<br />
We should win because our investigation of gender dominance is more nuanced and productive than the affirmative’s. our criticism creates understanding and has intrinsic transformative value.<br />
Marti Kheel, “From Heroic to Holistic Ethics: The Ecofeminist Challenge”, in</u> Ecofeminism: Women, Animals, Nature.__ Ed. By Greta Gaard, 1993<br />
<br />
Our story of Medusa has unique value in undermining phallogocentric logic – it shows how images of the feminine can be both hideous and seductive, monstrous and passive. This ambivalence touches upon the Real and demonstrates the cracks in feminine identity.<br />
Laurens de Vos, To See or not to See, <em>The Uncanny</em> Issue 5, January 2003 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.imageandnarrative.be/uncanny/laurensdevos.htm" rel="nofollow">www.imageandnarrative.be/uncanny/laurensdevos.htm</a><br />

<strong>Negative against Quirin:</strong><br />

The Word<br />
The Threatdown<br />
A conversation about debate being an ineffective avenue for political change, including a Spivak card about intellectual discourse and its limitations.<br />
Spivak, “Can the Subaltern speak?”<br />
“In the Foucault-Deleuze conversation, the issue seems to be that there is… obliteration of the trace of that Other in its precarious Subject-ivity.”<br />
<br />

As far as I know, we have not hit Planned Parenthood this year and the last time we hit Milliken was Gonzaga, where we read Zizek cards… that are already up on the wikispaces website.
