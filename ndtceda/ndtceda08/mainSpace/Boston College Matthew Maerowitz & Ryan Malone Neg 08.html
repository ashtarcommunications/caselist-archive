 <br />
<br />
Text: Prior to the adoption of the plan, the United States will initiate a process of binding consultation with the NATO Alliance and will propose that: [plan]<br />
<br />
During consultation, the US will advocate the adoption of this proposal but will allow the NATO allies to propose modifications and alternative solutions. The US will implement the proposal as per the results of consultation. Funding and enforcement will be ensured - we'll clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
The counterplan competes –<br />
<br />
The counterplan is mutually exclusive – the 1AC ensures the immediate and unconditional implementation of the plan - any permutation that solves our net benefit must sever, which is a voting issue for reasons of ground and predictability.<br />
<br />
The counterplan is theoretically legitimate –<br />
<br />
It’s not topical – the counterplan tests the word “resolved” which means “to make a firm decision about,” it also test the word “should” which is “used to imply obligation or duty” – counterplans that test the resolution are key to predictable negative ground.<br />
[American Heritage Dictionary at dictionary.com]<br />
<br />
Consultation counterplans are legitimate – conditioning the plan is the only way to preserve the option of solving the case which checks unpredictable 2ac add-ons and plan clarifications. This risk is compounded by the aff monopoly on pre-round prep and structural advantages in late developing debates.<br />
<br />
The Net Benefit is Terrorism<br />

Genuine consultation with Europe is critical to maintain relations – and Europe wants US to cooperate with Palestine, Syria and Iran<br />
Richard N. Haass, President, Council on Foreign Relations, Taipei Times, June 8, 2004, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2004/07/08/2003178159/print" rel="nofollow">http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2004/07/08/2003178159/print</a><br />
“Cooperation is possible. In 1990, Europeans and Americans” and “or the 26 members of NATO -- cannot be an all-or-nothing proposition, lest they run the risk of becoming nothing.”<br />

 <br />
The affirmatives description of the Other as fundamentally knowable and the presumption that this described subject ought to be reformed to meet Western standards is Orientalist.<br />
Said, Palestinian Activist and Former Professor at Columbia University, 1978<br />
[Edward, Orientalism, p. 3-4]<br />
“Related to this academic tradition, whose fortunes,” and “greater strength of the Occident (British, French or American), comes the large body of texts I call Orientalist.”<br />
<br />
Their stereotypical portrayal of the non-West makes war inevitable and prevents the affirmative from solving.<br />
Marrouchi, professor of postcolonial literature at LSU, 1998<br />
[Mustapha, “Counternarratives, Recoveries, Refusals,” boundary 2, vol. 25, no. 2, p. 205-257]<br />
“At the most basic level, what Said exposes” and “Said's silence would certainly be one.”<br />
<br />
Thus our alternative - Reject the ahistorical depictions of the 1AC.<br />
<br />
Their Orientalist assumptions dehistoricize non-Western politics, centering the European and sidelining the non-West – Only a historicized approach solves the affirmative and overcomes Orientalism.<br />
Marrouchi, professor of postcolonial literature at LSU, 1998<br />
[Mustapha, “Counternarratives, Recoveries, Refusals,” boundary 2, vol. 25, no. 2, p. 205-257]<br />
