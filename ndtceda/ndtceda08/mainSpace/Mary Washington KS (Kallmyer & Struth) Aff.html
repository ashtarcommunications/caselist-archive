<u>AT: Movements</u><br />
The DA theory is wrong – movements don’t pick their strategy but are forced into taking up a case or pushing for a bill.<br />
Brett McDonnell, July 1997, “Comment: Dynamic Statutory Interpretations and Sluggish Social Movements,” 85 Calif. L. Rev. 919<br />
“Also, the model, and much of this Comment, assumes that… they would not have chosen to set in motion themselves.”<br />
No spill over – the jurisprudence is unrelated, a liberal ruling for race won’t cause movements unrelated to segregation to flock to courts.<br />
Turn – litigation mobilizes movements – prompts action, fights rollback and snowballs<br />
Brett McDonnell, July 1997, “Comment: Dynamic Statutory Interpretations and Sluggish Social Movements,” 85 Calif. L. Rev. 919<br />
“However, there are at least three ways in which civil rights… lawyers are crucially involved in both.”<br />
Single policy doesn’t matter – movements are not dumb enough to go to the Courts after multiple conservative appointments, it will take more than one decision to persuade them.<br />
Turn – Court action spills over to prompt reform in other areas.<br />
Neal Devins, 1992, 80 Calif. L. Rev. 1027<br />
“Courts matter. They matter a lot. Sometimes their orders… than one of limited governmental partnership.”<br />
No transition – movements can’t just change their strategy in one day, it requires change in entire infrastructure making the impact inevitable because of the timeframe of the link.<br />
<u>AT: Immigration Reform</u><br />
Iraq overwhelms – inevitable confrontation makes all other political issues moot<br />
Jeff Crouere, 3/27, “US senate, congress, bush showdown on iraq looming,”<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bayoubuzz/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bayoubuzz</a> .com/News/US/Politics/Congress /US_Senate_Congress_Bush _Showdown_On_Iraq_Looming_3245 .asp<br />
Educational reform is key to political capital, popularity and interest group politics<br />
Terry M. Moe, Spring 2003, “Reform Blockers,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/3353116.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.hoover.org/publicati ons/ednext/3353116.htm__</a><br />
“In the wake of Risk, the driving force for change… became the politically smart thing to do.”<br />
TURN – congress black caucus<br />
a. school integration is popular among the CBC<br />
Earl Ofari Hutchinson, 7/16/02, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://finalcall.com/perspectives/political_requiem07-16-2002.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://finalcall.com/perspectiv es/political_requiem07-16-2002 .htm__</a><br />
“Then there’s Bush’s shabby treatment of the Congressional Black Caucus… and he did the only thing that he could do..”<br />
b. CBC is key to the agenda –<br />

“Beyond sweeping Democrats back into power, the Nov. 7 elections… when we bring a more diverse set of experiences to the leadership”<br />
<br />
<u>AT: Amendments</u><br />
Turn – signaling – vigorous judicial enforcement of rights is crucial to investment – only the plan solves.<br />
Farber, public law professor, 02 31 J. Legal Stud. 83, January<br />
“Successful judicial enforcement of the constitution strengthens the signal… it provides a credible signal that the courts will respect the rights of investors.”<br />
The impact is an economic chain reaction – collapsing the dollar and global econ.<br />

Contention One: The Status Quo<br />
<br />
Milliken devastated desegregation by preventing cross-district solutions – the result is nation-wide segregation decimating education<br />
<br />
Mark C. Rahdert, Spring '04<br />
[Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review, &quot;MILLIKEN v. BRADLEY AND THE QUEST FOR RACIAL DIVERSITY IN EDUCATION,&quot; 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 785, l/n]<br />
<br />
Looking back, we can …all over the country.<br />
<br />
Now is key – resegregation is rapidly increasing a new wave of segregation – overturning Milliken is key to solve<br />
<br />
Myron Orfield, Summer '06<br />
[Brookings Institute Nonresident Senior Fellow &amp; Institute on Race and Poverty Director, Law and Inequality, &quot;Choice, Equal Protection, and Metropolitan Integration,&quot; 24 Law &amp; Ineq. J. 269, l/n]<br />
<br />
The increasing school segregation … in metropolitan regions.<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Racism<br />
<br />
Milliken’s affirmation of segregated educational systems is a legal and symbolic device to define minorities as inferior and maintains hierarchies of subjugation<br />
Charles R. Lawrence III, 1998, “The Irony of Desegragation Law 1955-1995:Essays and Documents,” p. 249-50<br />
<br />
The holding in Brown v. … of affirmative disestablishment.<br />
<br />
Racism makes extinction inevitable – it underlies all violence, triggers nuclear conflict, and discounts necessary innovations<br />
Joe Feagin, Texas A&amp;M professor of sociology and liberal arts, 2006, “Systemic Racism, p. 321-2<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION: A RENEWED ETHIC OF &quot;OTHERS PRESERVATION&quot;<br />
The reality of systemic racism … major social oppressions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Three: Education<br />
<br />
<br />
Segregated schools devastate math and science education, teacher turnover, and the workforce<br />
<br />
Gary Orfield and Chungmei Lee, January '05<br />
[Orfield is also a Harvard Professor of Education and Social Policy, &quot; Why Segregation Matters: Poverty and Educational Inequality,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/deseg/Why_Segreg_Matters.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/deseg/Why_Segreg_Matters.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
Aside from challenges … more desegregated settings.38<br />
<br />
<br />
K-12 Education is a crucial pipeline to higher education and the workforce<br />
<br />
Norman R. Augustine et al, National Academies Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century Chair, ‘06<br />
[Augustine is also the retired Lockheed Martin Chairman and CEO, report written by the National Academies (The National Academy of Sciences, The National Academy of Engineering, The Institute of Medicine, and The National Research Council) Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century, “Rising Above The Gathering Storm”]<br />
<br />
Enlarge the pipeline of … in mathematics and science.<br />
<br />
Failure to desegregate will collapse the US economy in three ways:<br />
<br />
First, Domestic Potential<br />
Increasing minority education efforts now is critical to create the necessary domestic talent to sustain US economic growth and national security<br />
Shirley M. Malcom, Daryl E. Chubin and Jolene K. Jesse, October 2004, “Standing Our Ground:A Guidebook for STEM Educators in the Post-Michigan Era”<br />
<br />
The case for diversity in STEM…national security well into the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, cross-cultural competence:<br />
<br />
Diversity in academics is critical to cross-cultural competence and critical thinking which is key to US businesses and economy<br />
<br />
Thomas Gottschalk, et al, 5-30-01<br />

<br />
The ability of American … from multiple perspectives.<br />
<br />
Third, Race-relations:<br />
<br />
Avoiding resegregation is critical to avert a crisis in race-relations that will short-circuit economic success<br />
<br />
Gary Orfield, and Susan Eaton, ‘96<br />
[Harvard Civil Rights Project Director, Dismantling Desegregation; The Quiet Reversal of Brown v. Board of Education, xix]<br />
<br />
Racial and socioeconomic … Latinos, or the poor.<br />
<br />
Now is key to prevent a brink in race relations<br />
Gary Orfield and Chungmei Lee, January '06<br />
[Orfield is also a Harvard Professor of Education and Social Policy, &quot;Racial Transformation and the Changing Nature of Segregation,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/deseg/Racial_Transformation.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/deseg/Racial_Transformation.pdf</a>]<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Economic collapse causes nuclear war and extinction<br />
<br />
Bearden, U.S. Army (Retired), 2000<br />
[T.E., LTC, U.S. Army, “The Unnecessary Energy Crisis: How to Solve It Quickly,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3aaf97f22e23.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3aaf97f22e23.htm</a>, June 24]<br />
<br />
History bears out that …, at least for many decades.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in Milliken v. Bradley 418 U.S. 717 (1974), ruling that federal district courts have remedial authority to impose multidistrict areawide remedies to a single-district segregation problem, ruling segregation violates the 14th amendment.<br />
<br />

Contention One: The Status Quo<br />
<br />
Milliken devastated desegregation by preventing cross-district solutions – the result is nation-wide segregation decimating education<br />
<br />
Mark C. Rahdert, Spring '04<br />
[Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review, &quot;MILLIKEN v. BRADLEY AND THE QUEST FOR RACIAL DIVERSITY IN EDUCATION,&quot; 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 785, l/n]<br />
<br />
Looking back, we can …all over the country.<br />
<br />
Now is key – resegregation is rapidly increasing a new wave of segregation – overturning Milliken is key to solve<br />
<br />
Myron Orfield, Summer '06<br />
[Brookings Institute Nonresident Senior Fellow &amp; Institute on Race and Poverty Director, Law and Inequality, &quot;Choice, Equal Protection, and Metropolitan Integration,&quot; 24 Law &amp; Ineq. J. 269, l/n]<br />
<br />
The increasing school segregation … in metropolitan regions.<br />
<br />
Milliken’s affirmation of segregated educational systems is a legal and symbolic device to define minorities as inferior and maintains hierarchies of subjugation<br />
Charles R. Lawrence III, 1998, “The Irony of Desegragation Law 1955-1995:Essays and Documents,” p. 249-50<br />
<br />
The holding in Brown v. … of affirmative disestablishment.<br />
<br />
<br />
The institutional factor of desegregation that ensures state sponsored unequal distribution of resources and care is the worst and most threatening form of racism<br />
James S. Liebman, Columbia University School of Law Associate Professor of Law, OCTOBER, 1990, “ARTICLE: DESEGREGATING POLITICS: &quot;ALL-OUT&quot; SCHOOL DESEGREGATION EXPLAINED,” 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1463<br />
<br />
Understood this way, … and ubiquitously from below.<br />
<br />
This form of segregation is the pinnacle of militaristic politics – the reinvigoration of an inclusive educational system is key to end social exclusion and suffering<br />
Henry A. Giroux, McMaster University Global TV Network Chair Professorship of English and Cultural Studies Department, 2006, “Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability,” College Literature 33.3 (2006) 171-196<br />
<br />
Biopower in its current … health care to all residents of the United States.<br />

Racism makes extinction inevitable – it underlies all violence, triggers nuclear conflict, and discounts necessary innovations<br />

<br />
The reality of systemic racism … oppression and other major social oppressions.<br />

<br />
amendment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Four: Solvency<br />
<br />
School integration solves racism – school is the key area of community participation, it has ripple effects throughout society, it creates generational shifts, and prevents private school shift<br />
James S. Liebman, Columbia University School of Law Associate Professor of Law, OCTOBER, 1990, “ARTICLE: DESEGREGATING POLITICS: &quot;ALL-OUT&quot; SCHOOL DESEGREGATION EXPLAINED,” 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1463<br />
<br />
Although it happens in schools, … part of the answer in the schools.<br />
<br />
<br />
By taking a generational approach to end racism plan successfully uproots institutional racism, and have transformative effects locally and globally<br />
Joe Feagin, 2006, “Systemic Racism, p. 293-4<br />
<br />
Today, as in the past, … challenging this domination.<br />

<br />
The second consideration is the reality …born out of the same concerns.<br />
<br />
School choice will cause resegregation and destroy education<br />
Cathryn Vaughn, J.D., Boston College Law School, Attorney, Fall, 2003, “NOTE: THE SCHOOL CHOICE PROVISION OF THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT AND ITS CONFLICT WITH DESEGREGATION ORDERS,” 13 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 79<br />
<br />
School Choice Has Not …most likely to perform poorly<br />
<br />
<br />

Desegregated educational settings and well-educated minorities are critical to military readiness<br />
Dennis C. Blair, and Joe R. Reeder,<br />
