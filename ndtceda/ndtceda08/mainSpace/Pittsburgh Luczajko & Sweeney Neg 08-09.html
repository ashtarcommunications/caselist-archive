THE AFFIRMATIVE’S TELEOLOGICAL VIEW OF POLITICS WEARS BLINDERS- ITS IMPERATIVE TOWARD A FUTURE OUTSIDE OF EXTINCTION, WAR, BAD POLITICS REPLICATES THE IMAGE OF A FUTURE THAT IS ROOTED IN AN IMAGINARY PAST, NECESSARILY NARRATING ONTO ITS CONSTITUENTS LIBIDINAL DESIRES OF PRODUCTION.<br />

AND, THE LOGIC OF FUTURITY ALWAYS PRIORITIZES REPRODUCTION IN ITS COERCIVE REDUCTION OF SOCIETAL GOODS TO MILK FROM THE BREASTS OF LIBERTY AND SAFETY. WE HAVE NO POLITICS WITHOUT A FANTASY FUTURE, ONE THAT TRIES TO REDUCE EACH TO THE NEXT, ALL TO THE SAME, ELIMINATING THE EXCESS, THOSE THAT DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THIS REPRODUCTIVE CONDITION OF CITIZENSHIP. THIS EXCESS, EDELMAN EXPLAINS, IS A QUEERNESS THAT BECOMES ABERRANT.<br />

AND, THE SYMBOLIC SEPARATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY FROM HETEROSEXUALITY IS AT ONCE DAMNING AND ARBITRARY- ALREADY MARKED BY DECADENCE, IT IS THE JOB OF MASTERING POLITICAL FORCES TO ERADICATE THAT DECADENCE. NOT ALL SODOMITES SODOMIZED, BUT ALL WERE ERADICATED. THE AFFIRMATIVE’S PROJECT OF ERADICATING QUEERNESS IS THE DETONATOR ON A BOMB AIMED NOT AT THE HOMOSEXUAL BUT OF ALL HUMANITY.<br />

THUS WE OFFER THE FOLLOWING ALTERNATIVE:<br />
<br />
WE OUGHT NOT CHOOSE THE CULT OF THE CHILD- WE OUGHT READ THE AFFIRMATIVE IMPERATIVES IN DRAG, INSISTING UPON THEIR FALSITY AND BURYING THE SUBJECT IN THE TOMB-LIKE HOLLOW OF THE SIGNIFIER.<br />
