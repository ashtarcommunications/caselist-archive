Round 2 – Neg vs Wyo CJ (Palestine)<br />
<br />
Know your enemy K:<br />
<br />
US action in the Middle East is a dirve to secure and neutralize antagonism. This promotion of a better world in the middle east is premised on the exporting of the untied states standard of human that must be violently secured<br />
Yaseen Noorani, 2005, “The Rhetoric of Security,” CR: The New Centennial Review, 5.1<br />
“The U.S. government’s rhetoric…as good as dead.”<br />
<br />
And, war is the ultimate threat to security – the prevention of war becomes the impetus for violence in the name of a liberal-democratic humanity<br />
Xudong Zhang, 2004, Cultural Critique, “Multiplicity or Heterogeneity? The Cultural-Political Paradox in the Age of Globalization.”<br />
One of the more convincing points…logic of the political.<br />
<br />
And, attempts to eliminate war cause the worst forms of annihilation<br />
Louiza Odysseous, “Carl Schmitt and Martin Heidegger on the Line(s) of Cosmopolitanism and the War on Terror,”<br />
This section examines the claim…there is no more resistance.<br />
<br />
Alternative is: Embrace war<br />
<br />
War is a timeless theme of human existence: it is not a ‘scenario’ and it can’t be ‘solved’. The way the 1AC approaches conflict guarantees its continuity and devastates the potential for understanding, to render war coherent it must be embraced<br />
Hillman, Terrible love of war, p. 1-9<br />
“We can never prevent war…leap into myth”<br />
<br />
Case args:<br />
The preservation of nature is hostile to the world – it establishes an empty transcendent that worships all things detined to perish. This drive to avert destruction turns the world into a museum<br />
Marina Benjamin, 98, Living at the End of the World, p. 230-231<br />

Their environmentalism relies on a normalized scientific discourse that enables the management and control of life<br />
Kolson Schlosser, 2003, “Environment and Security Discourse and the Political Construction of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge”<br />
These “essential and…environmental discourses.<br />
<br />
One state will never work<br />
Abufarha 5, “Bi-Nationalism in Palestine-Israel”<br />
Aside from the concerns…economic union.<br />
<br />
Binational state causes civil war<br />
Lappin 4, Dissent, Winter<br />
“In order to accommodate…perpetuating it.<br />
