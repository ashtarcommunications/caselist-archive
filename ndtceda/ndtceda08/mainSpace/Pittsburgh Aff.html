<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO IS BIOTERRORISM<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite new reforms the United States remains unprepared to respond to a bioterrorist attack. Current federalism doctrine prevents the federal government from taking a leadership role.<br />
<br />
Kemper 2005 (Ryan R., attorney at Thompson Coburn LLP, “Responding to Bioterrorism: An Analysis of Titles I and II of The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002,” 83 Wash. U. L. Q. 385, L/N) <em> Pitt- MF<br />
<br />
<br />
Section 101 of the Bioterrorism Response Act… cover multiple jurisdictions<br />
<br />
<br />
And, states cannot effectively respond to a bioterrorist attack acting independently. Federal leadership is a necessity<br />
<br />
Buchsbaum 2002 (Lori L., Director of the Border Health Initiative of Project Concern International and JD Candidate at America University Washington College of Law, “The US Public Health Response to Bioterrorism: Need for a Stronger Legislative Approach, 7 Mich. St. J. Med. &amp; Law 1 , L/N) </em> Pitt- MF<br />
<br />
In this paper I will discuss three… public and private sectors.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But, the Supreme Court’s commerce clause doctrine of categorical federalism places issues of public health EXCLUSIVELY in the states’ hands.<br />
<br />
Parmet 2002 (Wendy E., George J. and Kathleen Waters Matthews Distinguished University Professor of Law at Cornell University, “After September 11: Rethinking Public Health Federalism,” 30 J.L. Med. &amp; Ethics 201, L/N) <em> Pitt- MF<br />
<br />
In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court… cannot support this interpretation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, the Morrison decision is the hallmark of categorical federalism.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Additionally, MORRISON’S VAGUE COMMERCE CLAUSE PRECEDENT UNDERMINES JUDICIAL PREDICTABILITY AND will result in Congress withholding passage of ANTI-TERROR LEGISLATION OUT of fear of court overturn<br />
<br />
Powers 2002 (Scott T., attorney at Hunter, Smith, and Davis LLP, “COMMERCE - A Retreat From Clarity: The Supreme Court Adds a Wrinkle to the &quot;Aggregated Effects&quot; Doctrine of its Commerce Clause Jurisprudence - United States v. Morrison, 519 U.S. 598 (2000)” 75 Temp. L. Rev. 163, L/N) <em> Pitt- MF<br />
<br />
<br />
In Morrison, the Supreme Court set… problems that require a uniform, national solution. n285<br />
<br />
<br />
And, lack of federal leadership exacerbates the effects of a bioterrorist attack.<br />

<br />
THUS, THE PLAN:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
IN THE NEXT RELEVANT TEST CASE, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE THE DECISION IN UNITED STATES V. MORRISON, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE RATIONAL BASIS STANDARD OF REVIEW APPLIES TO COMMERCE CLAUSE INTERPRETATIONS.<br />
<br />
ENFORCEMENT IS GUARANTEED THROUGH NORMAL MEANS. WE WILL CLARIFY INTENT.<br />
<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
<br />
First, reverting back to the rational basis test would directly overrule the Morrison decision<br />

<br />
In an attempt to reconcile the Morrison Court's… without acknowledging its tact.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND, SUPREME COURT ACTION IS KEY- FAILURE OF THE COURT RECOGNIZE GENDERED VIOLENCE AS DISCRIMINATION REINFORCES INEQUALITY<br />
<br />
Johnson 2003 (Jennifer, Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review, “PRIVILEGED JUSTICE UNDER LAW: REINFORCEMENT OF MALE PRIVILEGE BY THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND U.S. v. MORRISON” 43 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399, L/N)<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
ALSO, Supreme Court rulings stir national dialogue about the meaning of the Constitution<br />

<br />
and, vawa’s UNDERSTANDING OF GENDER VIOLENCE AS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE RECONCEIVES THE VIOLENCE AS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM, INCREASES EMPOWERMENT, AND BREAKS WITH THE PUBLIC/PRRIVATE DIVIDE<br />

<br />
The enactment of a federal statute… perpetrators of violence against women.<br />

FINALLY, EVEN IF WE DON’T SOLVE EVERY INSTANCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AFFIRM THE plan’S stance against EXCLUSION from the lAW. Only by embracing the transformative potential of the law can we create a starting point for wider social change<br />

Controversial decisions increase court capital<br />

<br />
Victimization case turn – contextualizing women as victims, people who we grant autonomy back to means case impacts happen.<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
States C/P Hagan 2001 evidence specific to 20 states who have gender violence task forces that have advocates for the “victimized women” and that have set up gendered violence courts.<br />
<br />
Federalism<br />
<br />
Court Politics - EPA v. MA, poor defense of warming going to happen.<br />
<br />
Topicality: overrule means the whole decision.<br />
<br />
Block Strategy:<br />
2NC goes for CP and federalism net benefit. He under covers federalism.<br />
<br />
1NR goes for case and EPA v. MA while dropping topicality, He goes mostly for the victimization turn as a net benefit to the counterplan or turning case independently.<br />
]<br />
<br />
2nr Strategy:<br />
2NR goes for counterplan with net benefit of victimization kritik and federalism. He puts federalism on bottom again, overcovers the counterplan and victimization turn which links to the counterplan.<br />

Here’s the latest version of our aff that we ran at West Point:<br />
<br />
<br />
CONTENTION ONE: VIOLENCE<br />
<br />
FIRST, MORRISON REJECTS VAWA ON THE GROUNDS THAT SECTION 5 OF THE 14TH AMENDMENT ONLY HAS THE POWER TO REMEDY ACTS OF STATE DISCRIMINATION WHILE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A PRIVATE ACT.<br />
<br />

The main criticism of state criminal laws… between injury and recovery.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE: DISCRIMINATION AT HOME<br />
CURRENTLY, THE LEGAL SYSTEM OFFERS LITTLE SUPPORT TO VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE, ALLOWING PERPETRATORS TO GO UNPUNISHED<br />
HAGAN, 2001. [Jennifer R.] “NOTES AND COMMENTS: CAN WE LOSE THE BATTLE AND STILL WIN THE WAR?: THE FIGHT AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AFTER THE DEATH OF TITLE III OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT.” DePaul Law Review. 50 DePaul L. Rev. 919 (Spring). P. lexis <em>WPDU-JR.<br />

<br />
What was the vision… not always easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AND, THE IMPACTS ARE SYSTEMIC: VIOLENCE IS INCREASING IN SCOPE ON A YEARLY BASIS. EVERY YEAR MILLIONS ARE AFFECTED BY ABUSE WHILE MOST RAPISTS AND ABUSERS ARE NEVER BROUGHT TO JUSTICE<br />

<br />
The international attention begs… that demands immediate attention.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO: GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN THE COURT<br />
<br />
WHILE THE SUPREME COURT APPEALS TO SEEMINGLY NEUTRAL LEGAL DOCTRINES, MORRISON CODIFIES DISCRIMINATION<br />
<br />
FIRST, MORRISON’S DECISION THAT DISCRIMINATION WITHIN THE FAMILY IS NOT A FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE CODIFIES INEQUALITY<br />
<br />
Siegel 2002 (Reva B., professor of law at Yale Law School, “She the People: The Nineteenth Amendment, Sex Equality, Federalism, and the Family,” Harvard Law Review115:4, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/vawa/doc24.htm#endB" rel="nofollow">http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/vawa/doc24.htm#endB</a>, accessed 1 Sept 2006)<br />
<br />
Morrison reiterates federalism arguments… a &quot;sex-based classification.&quot;<br />
<br />
SECOND, MORRISON DRAWS A PUBLIC/PRIVATE DIVIDE WHICH MAINTAINS A LEGAL SYSTEM WHERE GENDERED POWER REMAINS WITHOUT LIMIT<br />

<br />
The Morrison majority does not… sense was her rape private?<br />
<br />
AND, REJECTING DICHOTOMOUS THOUGHT REVEALS THE GENDERED ASSUMPTIONS THAT LIMIT THE WAY WE VIEW CONFLICT – ONLY BY BREAKING WITH THESE MODES OF THOUGHT CAN WE HOPE TO SOLVE EMERGING GLOBAL CRISES<br />

<br />
We do not want to suggest… most pressing problems.<br />

I confess, I am hoping to see a global revolution… and possibly the globe itself.<br />
<br />
THUS, THE PLAN:<br />
IN THE NEXT RELEVANT TEST CASE, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE THE DECISION IN UNITED STATES V. MORRISON, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), ON THE GROUNDS THAT CONGRESS HAS THE AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION 5 OF THE 14TH AMENDMENT TO SUSTAIN ENACTMENT OF A FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDY FOR GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE.<br />
ENFORCEMENT IS GUARANTEED THROUGH NORMAL MEANS. WE’LL CLARIFY.<br />
<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
FIRST, A CIVIL REMEDY IS CRITICAL TO CHANGE THE WAY WE RESPOND TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MAKING GENDER VIOLENCE A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE RECONCEIVES THE VIOLENCE AS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM, INCREASES EMPOWERMENT, AND BREAKS WITH THE PUBLIC/PRRIVATE DIVIDE<br />

U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 251<br />
<br />
The enactment of a federal statute… perpetrators of violence against women.<br />
<br />
NEXT, THE SUPREME COURT HAS THE POWER TO INTERPRET STATUTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH TREATY OBLIGATIONS<br />
<br />
Davis 2000 (Martha, VP of NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, “International Human Rights and United States Law: Predictions of a Court Watcher,” 64 Alb. L. Rev. 417, L/N)<em>pitt-mf<br />
<br />
First, I want to focus on United States v. Morrison… meet U.S. obligations under the ICCPR.<br />
<br />
AND, SUPREME COURT ACTION IS KEY- FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE GENDERED VIOLENCE AS DISCRIMINATION REINFORCES INEQUALITY<br />
<br />
Johnson 2003 (Jennifer, Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review, “PRIVILEGED JUSTICE UNDER LAW: REINFORCEMENT OF MALE PRIVILEGE BY THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND U.S. v. MORRISON” 43 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399, L/N)<br />
<br />
Those who seek to keep issues of violence… simply reinforces its power.<br />
<br />
ADDITIONALLY, WITHOUT A JUDICIARY TO DEFINE AND ENFORCE THE 14TH AMENDMENT, GUARANTEES OF LIBERTY ARE WORTHLESS<br />
<br />

<br />
At the beginning of Chief Justice Earl Warren's last term… take away such judicially-created rights.<br />
<br />
FINALLY, EVEN IF WE DON’T SOLVE EVERY INSTANCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AFFIRM THE PLAN’S STANCE AGAINST EXCLUSION FROM THE LAW. ONLY BY EMBRACING THE TRANSFORMATIVE POTENTIAL OF THE LAW CAN WE CREATE A STARTING POINT FOR WIDER SOCIAL CHANGE<br />
<br />
Weissman 2001 (Deborah, Associate Professor of Law and Director of Clinical Programs at UNC Chapel Hill, “Gender-Based Violence as Judicial Anomaly: Between “The Truly National and the Truly Local” 42 B.C. L. Rev. 1081, L/N) <em>Pitt- MF<br />

I am not arguing that the courts… international human rights law.<br />
<br />
<br />
AT: CONGRESS CP<br />
<br />
Counterplan will be overturned- court is hostile to congressional attempts to override it<br />
Zietlow 2000 (Rebecca, prof at Univesrity of Toledo College of Law, “Belonging, Protection and Equality: The Neglected Citizenship Clause and the Limits of Federalism,” 62 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 281, L/N)</em> Pitt- MF<br />
If Congress were to re-enact § 13981… enforceable by Congress.<br />

AT: FEDERALISM<br />

The main criticism of state criminal laws… disparity between injury and recovery.<br />

FURTHERMORE, THE MORRISON DECISION IS UNDERMINING THE PASSAGE OF VAWA II. VAWA II IS CRITICAL TO THE REMAINING PROVISIONS OF VAWA AND TO FUTURE STATE-BASED INITIATIVES TO DEAL WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE<br />

The VAWA II represents heavy artillery… against domestic violence.<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE: GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN THE HOME<br />
SUBPOINT A IS THE SYSTEMATIC DAMAGE<br />
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IS INCREASING IN SCOPE ON A YEARLY BASIS. EVERY YEAR OVER 125,000 WOMEN ARE RAPED, MILLIONS ARE AFFECTED BY ABUSE AND THOUSANDS DIE. MOST RAPISTS AND ABUSERS ARE NEVER BROUGHT TO JUSTICE<br />
SOUTER AND BREYER 2000. [David H., Supreme Court Associate Justice; Stephen G., Supreme Court Associate Justice.] Dissenting opinion in the matter of the “UNITED STATES v. ANTONIO J. MORRISON, ET AL.; AND CHRISTY BRZONKALA v. ANTONIO J. MORRISON, ET AL. 529 U.S. 598.” Together with No. 99-29, Brzonkala v. Morrison et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

IN ADDITION TO THE THOUSANDS OF WOMAN’S LIVES LOST EACH YEAR, THE OCCURRENCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OUTWEIGHS ANY WAR SCENARIO- AT THE ROOT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ARE ATTITUDES AND NORMS THAT MAKE ALL WAR AND VIOLENCE POSSIBLE<br />

In an article entitled… pressure for standing armies to be used.<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO: GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN THE COURT<br />
<br />
WHILE THE SUPREME COURT APPEALS TO SEEMINGLY NEUTRAL LEGAL DOCTRINES, THE DECISION IN US V. MORRISON CODIFIES DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN IN TWO WAYS.<br />
<br />
FIRST:<br />
DRAWING A DIVIDE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE, THE COURT’S CLAIM THAT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IS NOT ECONOMIC IS ROOTED IN THE BELIEF THAT WOMEN ARE NOT COMMERICAL ACTORS IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE<br />
Meyersfeld 2003 (Bonita C., fellow at International Human Rights Clinic at Yale School of Law, “Reconceptualizing Domestic Violence in International Law,” 67 Alb. L. Rev. 371, L/N)<br />
[*420] Perhaps the most telling case is… the private torture of women.<br />
<br />
SECOND, MORRISON CLASSIFIES VAWA AS A FAMILY LAW:<br />
THIS REDUCTION OF A WOMAN’S CIVIL RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE TO MERE “DOMESTIC RELATIONS” USES FEDERALISM AS A GUISE TO AFFIRM THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE DICHOTOMY<br />
Johnson 2003 (Jennifer, Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review, “PRIVILEGED JUSTICE UNDER LAW: REINFORCEMENT OF MALE PRIVILEGE BY THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND U.S. v. MORRISON” 43 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399, L/N)<br />
When VAWA was first proposed… under the guise of federalism.<br />
<br />
IN ADDITION TO REINFORCING THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE DIVIDE, THE MORRISON DECISION ALSO ACTIVELY DRAWS A LINE BETWEEN THE TWO BY DEFINING THE PRIVATE AS A PLACE WHERE REDRESS FOR GENDER VIOLENCE IS UNAVAILABLE. THE COURT’S UNIQUE CREATION OF THIS PUBLIC/PRIVATE DIVIDE SERVES TO MAINTAIN A LEGAL SYSTEM WHERE MALE POWER OVER WOMEN REMAINS LIMITLESS<br />
MacKinnon 2000 (Catherine A., Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at The University of Michigan Law School, “Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison,” Harvard Law Review vol 114 iss 1, EBSCO)<br />
The Morrison majority… sense was her rape private?<br />
<br />
FINALLY, THIS ORDERING OF THE WORLD FROM A GENDER POLARIZED PERPSPECTIVE NOT ONLY GUARANTEES WOMEN’S INEQUALITY BUT ALSO THREATENS OUR COLLECTIVE SURVIVAL<br />
Bem 1993 (Sandra Lipsitz, professor of psychology and women’s studies at Cornell University, The Lenses of Gender, p. 155)<br />
In addition to the humanist… massive numbers but the planet.<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE THREE IS FEMINIST JURISPRUDENCE<br />
<br />
CITING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT IS “TRULY NATIONAL” AND “TRULY LOCAL,” THE MORRISON DECISION RELIES ON AN UNDERSTANDING OF FEDERALISM AS CATEGORICAL<br />
Resnick 2001 (Judith, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism:<br />
Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III no.3 Dec, JSTOR)<br />
“The Constitution requires… boundaries and autonomous spheres.<br />
<br />
AND, INSTANCES OF CATEGORICAL FEDERALISM HAVE HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES, AS THEY CREATE THE PERCEPTION THAT NATIONAL LAWMAKING IS SHELTERED FROM TRANSNATIONAL JURISPRUDENCE<br />
Resnick 2001 (Judith, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism:<br />
Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. 111 no.3 Dec, JSTOR)<br />
The normative critique of categorical federalism… brought home as this Essay was in press).<br />
<br />
ALSO, CATEGORICAL FEDERALISM IS IN PARTICULAR HARMFUL TO FEMINISM- A COMMITMENT TO CATEGORIES MAKES ALTERING GENDER ROLES IMPOSSIBLE<br />
Resnick 2001 (Judith, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism:<br />
Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III no.3 Dec, JSTOR)<br />
My willingness to stray… meaning of female and male.<br />
<br />
IN PARTICULAR, MORRISON STANDS AS A REFUSAL ON THE PART OF THE US TO INCORPORATE FEMINIST JURISPRUDENCE METHODS<br />
Resnick 2001 (Judith, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism:<br />
Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III no.3 Dec, JSTOR)<br />
One cannot therefore dismiss… light of knowledge of gender subordination.<br />
<br />
AND, FEMINIST JURISPRUDENCE IS KEY TO REVEALING THE GENDERED ASSUMPTIONS OF LAW AND POLITICS THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED. THESE GENDERED ASSUMPTIONS LIMIT THE WAY WE DEVISE SOLUTIONS TO GLOBAL CRISES- ONLY BY BREAKING WITH GENDERED WAYS OF THINKING CAN WE HOPE TO SOLVE EMERGING GLOBAL CRISES SUCH AS TERRORISM<br />
Charlesworth and Chinkin 2002 (Hilary, Director of the Centre for International Governance and Justice and Professor of International Law and Human Rights at Australian National University, and Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, “Sex, Gender, and September 11,” The American Journal of International Law vol 96 no 3, July 2002, accessed via JSTOR)<br />
We do not want to suggest… our most pressing problems.<br />
<br />
plan: IN THE NEXT RELEVANT TEST CASE, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE THE DECISION IN UNITED STATES V. MORRISON, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) BY ELIMINATING THE ECONOMIC/NONECONOMIC STANDARD IN COMMERCE CLAUSE JURISPRUDENCE.<br />
ENFORCEMENT IS GUARANTEED. NORMAL MEANS APPLIES. WE WILL CLARIFY, SO IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS PLEASE ASK.<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
FIRST, ELIMINATING THE ECONOMIC/NONECONOMIC DISTINCTION OVERRULES MORRISON WHILE MAINTAINING LOPEZ PRECEDENT<br />
Johnson 2003 (Jennifer, Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review, “PRIVILEGED JUSTICE UNDER LAW: REINFORCEMENT OF MALE PRIVILEGE BY THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND U.S. v. MORRISON” 43 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399, L/N)<br />
From the standpoint of… would be upheld.<br />
NEXT, THE TITLE III CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDY OF VAWA IS KEY TO SOLVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE<br />
Sokler 1999 (Bruce D., attorney at Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, PC, MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AND BRIEF AMICI CURIAE OF NATIONAL NETWORK TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, NATIONAL NETWORK TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FUND, ET AL.

By allowing compensatory… and 22% had no access to a car.<br />
<br />
AND, OVERTURNING MORRISON TO UPHOLD THE TITLE III CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDY BREAKS WITH THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE DIVIDE<br />
Rivera 1996 (Jenny, Assistant Professor of Law at Suffolk University School of Law, “SYMPOSIUM: THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT OF 1994: A PROMISE WAITING TO BE FULFILLED: THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF MULTIPLE CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND FEMINIST MOVEMENTS” 4 J.L. &amp; Pol'y 463, L/N)<br />
The VAWA's recognition and provisions… violence against women.<br />
<br />
ALSO, VAWA’S CIVL RIGHTS REMEDY IS THE KEY THAT UNLOCKS THE DOOR TO REMEDIES FOR WOMEN’S INEQUALITY<br />
Resnick 2001 (Judith, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. 111 no.3 Dec, JSTOR)<br />
Explanation of the refusal to subsume… economic and political activities.<br />
<br />
AND, RECOGNITION OF WOMEN AS COMMERCIAL ACTORS BREAKS WITH THE GENDERED HIERARCHIES OF THE ECONOMY AND IS KEY TO OBTAINING WOMEN’S EQUALITY<br />
Resnick 2001 (Judith, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism:<br />
Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. 111 no.3 Dec, JSTOR)<br />
But framing the problem of violence… power to think for oneself.<br />
<br />
AND, SUPREME COURT ACTION IS KEY TO END GENDER DISCRIMINATION. FAILURE OF THE COURT TO RECOGNIZE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS DISCRIMINATION ONLY REINFORCES WOMEN’S INEQUALITY<br />
Johnson 2003 (Jennifer, Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review, “PRIVILEGED JUSTICE UNDER LAW: REINFORCEMENT OF MALE PRIVILEGE BY THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND U.S. v. MORRISON” 43 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399, L/N)<br />
Those who seek to keep issues… , simply reinforces its power.<br />
<br />
IN ADDITION, THE VAWA CHALLENGES CATEGORICAL FEDERALISM. WITH THE VAWA STATE AND LOCAL EFFORTS WERE SUPPLEMENTED, NOT SUPPLANTED, BY NATIONAL LAW<br />
Resnick 2001 (Judith, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism:<br />
Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III no.3 Dec, JSTOR)<br />
Categories of jurisdiction… justification for patriarchal control.<br />
<br />
FINALLY, VOTE AFF TO TRANSFORM THE LEGAL SYSTEM AWAY FROM PUBLIC OVER PRIVATE AND MALE OVER FEMALE. UPHOLDING VAWA SERVES AS A CONFRONTATION AGAINST THE BARRIERS TO WOMAN’S EQUALITY BUILT INTO THE LEGAL SYSTEM<br />
MacKinnon 2000 (Catherine A., Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at The University of Michigan Law School, “Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison,” Harvard Law Review vol 114 iss 1, EBSCO)<br />

They wear a Bush mask and argue that bringing Quirin to the front of our collective memory is a tactic used by the Bush administration to make us forget other forms of tribunals and executions in U.S. history. They explain the 1AC as a satire and use critical legal rhetoric to challenge hierarchies inherent in the law. Cross-x they say they don’t defend fiat, and overturn Quirin “in a way” by having the court not use judicial review?<br />

OBSERVATION ONE: THE STATE OF EXCEPTION<br />
<br />
In 1942 Nazi “Saboteurs” we’re taken into custody, tried, convicted, and most of them executed, all without entering civilian criminal courts. What came of this was the Supreme Court case Ex Parte Quirin. The Supreme Court rules that the writ of habeas corpus could be suspended by the government. This distinction was based off of the idea of “unlawful enemy combatants” which strips these individuals of all of their rights. This precedent still haunts us and detainee’s at US prisons around the world today<br />
Korpi, 2006 (JD Candidate the College of William and Mary, QUERIES FROM QUIRIN: GUANTANAMO TRIBUNALS AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE, William and Mary Bill of Rights Journal, Apil WPDU-Guy)<br />
<br />
The use of military commissions to try domestic threats has been upheld since the early days of the Revolutionary n58 and Civil n59 Wars. … legislation. n77<br />
<br />
Ex Parte Quirin’s enemy combatant distinction has laid the framework for drastic rights abuses and alterations of those rights all in the name of the war on terror. This form of indefinite detention has many implications, especially for those imprisoned. These threats of indefinite detention lead to those that are detained to plead guilty to false charges<br />
Takei, 2006 (Carl, JD Candidate Boston College Law School, TERRORIZING JUSTICE: AN ARGUMENT THAT PLEA BARGAINS STRUCK UNDER THE THREAT OF &quot;ENEMY COMBATANT&quot; DETENTION VIOLATE THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS, Boston College Law Review, May <em>WPDU-Guy)<br />
Since the Al Qaeda… Fifth Amendment. n24<br />
<br />
Ex Parte Quirin is the legal grounding for the exceptional measures taken in the war on terror, it authorizes the creation of detention camps that occupy a liminal zone that is both inside and outside the law.<br />
McClintock 2004 – (Scott, “The Penal Colony: Inscription of the Subject in Literature and Law, and Detainees as Legal Non-Persons at Camp X-ray” Comparative Literature Studies – Volume 41, Number 1, 2004, pp. 157-158</em> WPDU-Guy)<br />
Besides its security …U.S. criminal defendants.<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STATE OF EXCEPTION: THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION’S USE OF ENEMY COMBATANTS AND INDEFINATE DETENTION CAUSE THE BIOPOLITICAL SPACE CALLED THE STATE OF EXCEPTION- WHERE RULES AND RIGHTS THAT ARE GIVEN BY THE SOVERIGN ARE ALTERED AND REMOVED. THE STATE OF EXCEPTION IS THE INSTANCE OF A PERMANENT STATE OF WAR THAT CONTROLS AND CONTINUES VIOLENCE. WHILE INSIDE THIS STATE OF EXCEPTION BARE-LIFE REACHES A MAXIMUM THRESHOLD<br />
AGAMBEN (Giorgio, prof of phil university of Verona, State of Exception, 2-4<em>WPDU-Guy)<br />
One of the … reaches its maximum indeterminacy.<br />
<br />
THE STATE OF EXCEPTION WILL CONTINUE TO GROW ACROSS THE GLOBE IF IT FAILS TO BE STOPPED AND QUESTIONED. THE GLOBE WILL BE ENVELOPED INTO A GLOBAL CIVIL WAR ONCE THE STATE OF EXCEPTION BECOMES THE RULE. WE MUST CALL INTO QUESTION THE FOUNDATIONS OF POLITICS RATHER THAN SIT IDOLLY BY ALLOWING THE SOVEREIGN TO DICTATE ITS AND OUR POSITION IN RELATION TO THE LAW<br />
AGAMBEN, 99<br />
(Giorgio, Homo Sacer, pg 36-38,</em> WPDU- Guy)<br />
2.4. From this perspective…itself over the entire planet.<br />
WE MUST STOP THE MECHANISMS THAT ARE IN PLACE THAT ALLOW BARE LIFE TO BE CONTROLLED AND INACTED BY THE SOVERIGN IN ORDER TO STOP THE INEVITABLE AND CONTINUEING BLOODSHED THAT IS INHERENT IN BARE LIFE. PLACES LIKE DETENTION CAMPS THAT REMOVE PEOPLE FROM THE LAW, THE STATE OF EXCEPTION, NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN AND THE POTENTIAL OF CREATING BARE LIFE MUST BE STOPPED IF THERE IS ANY HOPE OF ALTERING THESE MECHANISMS. WE MUST TAKE SOME ACTION THAT WILL EVENTUALLY STOP THESE MECHANISMS EVEN IF IT IS A GRADUAL ACTION<br />
Agamben (Giorgio, prof of phil university of Verona, The Open, Pg 36-38<em>WPDU- guy)<br />
The contradiction that … be able to stop them.<br />
<br />
THE ESSENCE OF BIOPOLITICAL CONTROL EXISTS IN THE ABILITY TO DIVIDE PARTS OF POPULATIONS, DENYING RIGHTS TO SOME WHILE SAVING THE REST FROM INTERNAL ENEMIES. THOSE DENIED POLITICAL RIGHTS IN THE STATE OF EXCEPTION ARE TRANSFORMED INTO A PURE BIOPOLITICAL SUBSTANCE LEADING TO THEM BEING FORCED TO LIVE IN THE MOST EXTREME DEPTHS OF DEPREVITY. IN THIS EXISTANCE, DEATH (BIOLOGICALLY) BECOMES MEANINGLESS. THEY ARE ALREADY THE WALKING DEAD.<br />
Agamben, 1999 (giorgio, prof of phil university of Verona, Remants of Auschwitz, 84-87</em> wpdu- guy)<br />
Let us try to further …simple epiphenomenon.<br />
<br />
WE STAND RESOLVED THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE EX PARTE QUIRIN 317 U.S. 1 (1942)<br />
<br />
(We may or may not spec grounds. Depends on the round.)<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION TWO-<br />
Overruling Quirin would drastically alter Bush's ability to create and use fluid power<br />
Tanja Korpi, J.D. candidate at the College of William &amp; Mary, April, 2006, “QUERIES FROM QUIRIN: GUANTANAMO TRIBUNALS AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE,” William &amp; Mary Bill of Rights Journal, p.ln<br />
<br />
This trifold logic…the new millennium.<br />
<br />
Declarations of rights by people are not just used to create and form the nation-State. They outline freedom's and rights of individuals within communities. It is impossible to understand and defend emancipatory struggles without having a concept of rights. We must use this concept of rights to fight to solve for the state's creation of states of exception. The Affirmative advocacy removes the ability of the United States government to decide who is in and who is out of the law by taking up this call. We as a group must take up this call and begin working towards emancpitory struggles for equality through understanding and using notions of rights.<br />
Daly – 2004 (Frances, Australian National U., “The non-citizen and the concept of 'human rights',” Borderlands E-Journal, vol. 3, no. 1)<br />
<br />
22. Let us look … a conception of rights.<br />
<br />
We have a responsibility to the Other, in this case to those who are detained both in the space of the United State and those who are abroad because of the United States government. The affirmative is a chance to take up our own responsibility in the allowance of camps to exist within our political space. We offer reconciliation, an action which admits that through our own passivity we have allowed and thus aided in the creation of spaces of exception. This responsibility can only happen through the realm of politics and a political stance by us as individuals, as us as potential homo sacer's. We need to take up this responsibility if we are to change the current political and legal system. By standing resolved in the face of the Bush administrations abuse of power we take responsibility for allowing these gross atrocities to happen which allows us to take political responsibility in an unassuming way. Our advocacy opens this political space for change.<br />
Schapp – 2004 (Andrew, Univ. of Melbourne, “Assuming Responsibility in the Hope of Reconciliation,” Borderlands E-Journal, vol. 3, no. 1)<br />
<br />
In a society divided …an unassuming way.<br />
The Way to eliminate the state's state of exception is not to realize the potential of the state of exception but to come to terms with the Other about the state of exception.<br />
Reconciliation is a necessary step in reforming this relationship. Reconciliation means assuming responsibility about the past wrongs and the ideologies that allowed the wrongs to happen. These are necessary for forgiveness and connection between us and the other. The only way to make this happen is through a political system that allows for this. Our 1AC Is an instance of this reconciliation, apologizing for not acting and being complacent even in the face of our own demise. Voting affirmative is heeding the call to assume responsibility for the existence of homo sacer in our day and to stand aligned with these same individuals as potential homo sacer's ourselves.<br />
Schapp – 2004 (Andrew, Univ. of Melbourne, “Assuming Responsibility in the Hope of Reconciliation,” Borderlands E-Journal, vol. 3, no. 1)<br />
Following what might…of that order.<br />
Reconciliation is a call for rhetoric and a form of rhetorical activity. Through reconciliation, where one group enters into dialogue with<br />
Doxtader, 2003 (assistant professor of rhetoric in the Department of Communication Arts at the University of Wisconsin – Madison, Reconciliation—A Rhetorical Concept/ion, Quarterly Journal of Speech Vol. 89, No. 4, November 2003, pp. 267–292, ebsco <em>WPDU-Guy)<br />
What can we …sustain a beginning.<br />
<br />
MAKING POLICIES UNDER THE GUISE OF &quot;NECESSITY&quot; HAS BEEN THE MANOR IN WHICH THE SOVERIGN HAS CREATED AND USED THE STATE OF EXCEPTION. WE MUST CEASE THIS CYCLE IF WE ARE EVER GOING TO EXIST WITHOUT THE STATE OF EXCEPTION.<br />
Agamben, 2005 (Girogio, prof of phil university of Verona, state of exception, 24-26</em> wpdu-guy)<br />

<br />
SUBPOINT B IS PATRIARCHY<br />
<br />
GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE ENSURES THE CONTINUATION OF WOMEN’S SUBORDINATION. IN ADDITION TO BLOCKING WOMEN FROM PARTICIPATING EQUALLY IN SOCIETY, GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE NEGATES EXISTING LAWS THAT WORK TOWARDS EQUALITY<br />

<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO IS FEMINIST JURISPRUDENCE<br />
<br />
CITING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT IS “TRULY NATIONAL” AND “TRULY LOCAL,” THE MORRISON DECISION RELIES ON AN UNDERSTANDING OF FEDERALISM AS CATEGORICAL<br />

<br />
THUS WE OFFER THE FOLLOWING PLAN:<br />
<br />
IN THE NEXT RELEVANT TEST CASE, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE THE DECISION IN UNITED STATES V. MORRISON, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) BY ELIMINATING THE ECONOMIC/NONECONOMIC STANDARD IN COMMERCE CLAUSE JURISPRUDENCE.<br />

ENFORCEMENT IS GUARANTEED. NORMAL MEANS APPLIES. WE WILL CLARIFY, SO IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS PLEASE ASK.<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
FIRST, ELIMINATING THE ECONOMIC/NONECONOMIC DISTINCTION OVERRULES MORRISON WHILE MAINTAINING LOPEZ PRECEDENT<br />

<br />
NEXT, THE TITLE III CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDY OF VAWA IS KEY TO SOLVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE<br />
Sokler 1999 (Bruce D., attorney at Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, PC, MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AND BRIEF AMICI CURIAE OF NATIONAL NETWORK TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, NATIONAL NETWORK TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FUND, ET AL.

<br />
AND, OVERTURNING MORRISON TO UPHOLD THE TITLE III CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDY BREAKS WITH THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE DIVIDE<br />
Rivera 1996 (Jenny, Assistant Professor of Law at Suffolk University School of Law, “SYMPOSIUM: THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT OF 1994: A PROMISE WAITING TO BE FULFILLED: THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF MULTIPLE CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND FEMINIST MOVEMENTS” 4 J.L. &amp; Pol'y 463, L/N)<br />
<br />
ALSO, VAWA’S CIVL RIGHTS REMEDY IS THE KEY THAT UNLOCKS THE DOOR TO REMEDIES FOR WOMEN’S INEQUALITY<br />
Resnick 2001 (Judith, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. 111 no.3 Dec, JSTOR)<br />
<br />
AND, RECOGNITION OF WOMEN AS COMMERCIAL ACTORS BREAKS WITH THE GENDERED HIERARCHIES OF THE ECONOMY AND IS KEY TO OBTAINING WOMEN’S EQUALITY<br />

<br />
Plan: In the next relevant test case, the USSC should overrule the decision in US v Morrison, by eliminating the economic/non-economic standard in commerce clause jurisprudence.<br />
<br />
Advantage 1: Gender Discrimination/Patriarchy<br />
Advantage 2: Feminist Jurisprudence<br />
<br />
Add-On: Iraq Modeling<br />
<br />
Contention 1: Violence Against Women Continues<br />
<br />
Given the Supreme Court’s decision in Morrison, Title III of VAWA cannot be resuscitated.<br />
HAGAN 2001 [Jennifer R., “Notes and Comments: Can we lose the battle and still win the war?: The Fight against Domestic Violence after the Death of Title III of the Violence Against Women Act.” DePaul Law Review, Spring, p. l/n]<br />
<br />
And, state are not filling the void – state laws are not enforced due to bias throughout their criminal justice systems.<br />
HAGAN 2001 [Jennifer R., “Notes and Comments: Can we lose the battle and still win the war?: The Fight against Domestic Violence after the Death of Title III of the Violence Against Women Act.” DePaul Law Review, Spring, p. l/n]<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the Morrison decision is undermining the passage of VAWA II. VAWA II is critical to the remaining provision of VAWA and to future state-based initiatives to deal with domestic violence.<br />
HAGAN 2001 [Jennifer R., “Notes and Comments: Can we lose the battle and still win the war?: The Fight against Domestic Violence after the Death of Title III of the Violence Against Women Act.” DePaul Law Review, Spring, p. l/n]<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE: Gender Discrimination in the Home<br />
Subpoint A is the systematic damage<br />
<br />
Violence against women is increasing in scope on a yearly basis. Every year over 125,000 women are raped, millions are affected by abuse and thousands die. Most rapists and abusers are never brought to justice.<br />
SOUTER AND BREYER 2000 [David H., Dissenting opinion in the matter of the “US v Antonio J. Morrison, et al.; and Christy Brzonkala v Antonio J. Morrison, et al. 529 U.S. 598”]<br />
<br />
In addition to the thousands of woman’s lives lost each year, the occurrence of domestic violence outweighs any war scenario – at the root of violence against women are attitudes and norms that make all war and violence possible.<br />
REARDON 1993 [Betty, Director of the Peace Education Program at Columbia University, Women and Peace: Feminist Visions of Global Security, p. 50-51, accessed online via NetLibrary]<br />
<br />
Subpoint B is Patriarchy<br />
<br />
Gender-based violence ensures the continuation of women’s subordination. In addition to blocking women from participating equally in society, gender-based violence negates existing laws that work towards equality.<br />
GOLDFARB 1996 [Sally, “Symposium: The Violence Against Women Act of 1994: A Promise Waiting to Be Fulfilled: The Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act: Legislative History, Policy Implications and Litigation Strategy, A Panel Discussion Sponsored by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, September 14, 1995” 4 J.L. and Pol’y 391, p. l/n]<br />
<br />
Left unchecked, patriarchy leads to nuclear war.<br />
REARDON 1993 [Betty, Director of the Peace Education Program at Columbia University, Women and Peace: Feminist Visions of Global Security, p. 50-51, accessed online via NetLibrary]<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO: FEMINIST JURISPRUDENCE<br />
<br />
Citing a distinction between what is “truly national” and “truly local” the Morrison decision relies on an understanding of federalism as categorical.<br />
RESNICK 2001 [Judith, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III, no. 3, December, JSTOR]<br />
<br />
And, instances of categorical federalism have harmful consequences, as they create the perception that national lawmaking is sheltered from transnational jurisprudence.<br />
RESNICK 2001 [Judith, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III, no. 3, December, JSTOR]<br />
<br />
Also, categorical federalism is in particular harmful to feminism – a commitment to categories makes altering gender roles impossible.<br />
RESNICK 2001 [Judith, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III, no. 3, December, JSTOR]<br />
<br />
In particular, Morrison stands as a refusal on the part of the US to incorporate feminist jurisprudence methods.<br />
RESNICK 2001 [Judith, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III, no. 3, December, JSTOR]<br />
<br />
And, feminist jurisprudence is key to revealing the gendered assumptions of law and politics that we take for granted. These gendered assumptions limit the way we devise solutions to global crises – only by breaking with gendered ways of thinking can we hope to solve emerging global crises such as terrorism.<br />
CHARLESWORTH AND CHINKIN 2002 [Hilary, “Sex, Gender, and September 11,” the American Journal of International Law, volume 96, no 3, July 2002, JSTOR]<br />
<br />
Thus we offer the following plan:<br />
&lt;all in caps&gt;<br />
In the next relevant test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) by eliminating the economic/noneconomic standard in commerce clause jurisprudence.<br />
<br />
Enforcement is guaranteed. Normal means applies. We will clarify, so if you have questions please ask.<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Solvency<br />
First, eliminating the economic/noneconomic distinction overrules Morrison while maintaining Lopez precedent.<br />
Jennifer Johnson, 2003, Santa Clara Law Review, “privileged justice under law”<br />
<br />
Next, the title II civil rights remedy of VAWA is key to solve domestic violence<br />
Bruce D. Sokler, 1999, “Motion for leave to file and brief Amici Curiae of national network to end domestic violence, national network to end domestic violence fund, et al. in support of petitioner” p.online<br />
<br />
And, overturning Morrison to uphold title III civil rights remedy breaks with the public/private divide<br />
Jenny Rivera, 1996, “symposium: the violence against women act of 1994” 4 J.L. &amp; Pol’y 463<br />
<br />
Also, VAWA’s civil rights remedy is the key that unlocks the door to remedies for women’s inequality<br />
RESNICK 2001 [Judith, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III, no. 3, December, JSTOR]<br />
<br />
And, recognition of women as commercial actors breaks with the gendered hierarchies of the economy and is key to obtaining womens equality<br />
RESNICK 2001 [Judith, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III, no. 3, December, JSTOR]<br />
<br />
And, Supreme Court action key to end gender discrimination. Failure of court to recognize violence against women as discrimination only reinforces women’s inequality<br />
Jennifer Johnson, 2003, Santa Clara Law Review, “privileged justice under law”<br />
<br />
In addition, VAWA challenges categorical federalism with the VAWA state and local efforts were supplement, not supplanted by NTNL law<br />
RESNICK 2001 [Judith, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III, no. 3, December, JSTOR]<br />
<br />
Vote aff to transform the legal system away from public over private and male over female. Upholding VAWA serves as a confrontation against the barriers to women’s equality built into the legal system<br />
