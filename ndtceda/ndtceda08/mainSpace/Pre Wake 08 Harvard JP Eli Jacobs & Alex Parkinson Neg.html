<strong>Harvard JP</strong> --- Neg vs Wake CC (cotton) at Northwestern<br />
<strong>DSB Bad DA</strong><br />
1nc:<br />
WTO’s at a crossroads ---f ate of the cotton decision will determine whether member states revert to consensus oriented dsm or whether the current DSB becomes the heart of the organization, risking total collapse in WTO legitimacy and undermining future multilateral negotiations<br />
Michael J. Shumaker, 32 N.C.J. Int’l L. &amp; Com. Reg. 537 [same as 1nc cite for NU’s DA]<br />
Clearly, the DSB’s,….liberalization, however, will.<br />
<br />
Turns case –<br />
1. undermines all future trade negotiations – emphasis on strictly enforcing existing rules makes negotiating new deals impossible and collapses the wto – shift back to GATT style enforcement solves<br />
Greenwald and Fox 7 “THE WTO’S EMPHASIS ON ADJUDICATED DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MAY BE MORE DRAG THAN LIFT”, Winter, 24 Ariz. J. Int’l &amp; Comp. Law 133, lexis<br />
With its emphasis…part of the problem.<br />
<br />
2. Causes escalation of trade disputes: the DSB fosters an adversarial culture that ensrues trade disputes lead to retaliation and escalation rather than compliance<br />
Alter 3 [“Resolving or exacerbating disputes? The WTO’s new dispute resolution system”, International Affairs 79, 4 (2003)<br />
Lawyers have long known….over politically sensitive issues.<br />
<br />
//C. Impact<br />
Judicialized dispute settlement prevents the WTO from dealing with trade crises, makes global economic collapse inevitable<br />
Greenwald and Fox 2007 again<br />
C. The Core Problem Is…ability to avert a crisis.<br />
<br />
Extinction<br />
Bearden 2k<br />
<br />
1NR:<br />
More important issue than enforcement – if new trade deals aren’t forged, the trading system will fail<br />
Bergsten 96 [C. Fred, Competitive Liberalization and Global Free Trade: A Vision for the Early 21st Century, APEC Working Paper No. 96-15, Institute for international economics]<br />
The problem with this….into conflicting blocs.<br />
<br />
The DSU’s emphasis on binding enforcement eliminates the leverage key to negotiating additial trade liberalization<br />
Greenwald and Fox 7 again<br />
Where Existing rules Are….incentive for major change.<br />
<br />
DSU makes conflict escalation more likely – sate file coutnersuits to get bargaining leverage in earlier disputes and negotiations<br />
Eric Reinhardt 2k [“Aggressive Multilateralism: The Determinants of GATT/WTO Dispute Initiation, 1948-1998, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="x-msg://122/" rel="nofollow">http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~erein/</a><br />
I disagree. Disputes are…raised by other states.<br />
<br />
US-EU FSC/Beef/Bananas disputes prove the DSB leads to trade conflict escalation<br />
Wolff 2 [“Major Problems with wTO Dispute Settlement”, Alan Wm. Wolff, global Business Dialogue Inc., 9-26-02]<br />
The problem of misuse….to rectify that error.<br />
<br />
Crisis in the dsb will get governments to resolve differences in other ways<br />
Jonquieres 2 Financial Times March 25, 2002 “Rules to fight by: The US and Europe are looking to the World Trade Organisation to resolve their dispute over steel”<br />
However, the task may….get them to do so.<br />
<br />
Strong dsb directly trades off with strong deliberative organs in the WTO<br />

<strong>Pre-Shirley Disclosure<br />
<br />
Doha DA</strong><br />
1. Doha is dead – it’s time to let it go.<br />
Financial Times 7/30 (“Multilateralism not dead as a Doha”)<br />
Like Wimbledon fortnight but without… regrettably, time to let it go<br />
<br />
Letting Doha die is key to a new culture for the WTO – the plan closes the window by reasserting old models and priorities<br />
Debra P. Steger ‘7 Professor and Director, Emerging Dynamic Global Economies (EDGE) Network, Faculty of Law, University of Ottawa (Journal of International Economic Law 10:3 “The Culture of the WTO: Why it Needs to Change”)<br />
We live in an interdependent, globalized… developing countries seriously.<br />
<br />
Subsidy reductions revive the false hope that negotiations will succeed – prevents the move beyond Doha<br />
Razeen Sally ‘8 is co-Director of the European Centre for International Political Economy (Trade Policy, New Century: The WTO, FTAs and Asia Rising p. 108-109)<br />
A serious Doha Round… WTO on its legs again?<br />
<br />
The Impacts<br />
1. Collapse of Doha in the short term is key to trade.<br />
IHT ‘8 (“The next step for international trade” lexis)<br />
The collapse of the seven-year… greenhouse gases under its rules.<br />
<br />
2. China<br />
a. US-China relations are fine because disputes are settled bilaterally and will be done so after the failure at Geneva. Collapse of bilateral dialogue tanks the relationship.<br />
Inside US-China Trade 8/13 “Paulson Makes Case For Continuing Strategic Dialogue With China” Lexis<br />
According to Paulson, the chief… through enduring differences.&quot;<br />
<br />
b. Resumed Doha talks derail the relationship – the US would start bashing China<br />

<strong>Land Prices DA</strong><br />
<br />
Subsidies are capitalized into land values now – government policy is a key driver of land prices<br />
Offutt ‘3 [Susan, USDA Economic Research Service. Government Policy and Farmland Markets, ed. Charles Moss and Andrew Schmitz, p. xv.]<br />
It is not necessary to be a farmer, or even an… to be of key interest<br />
<br />
Elimination of agricultural subsidies would cause land prices to plummet, resulting in a further credit crisis<br />
Anderlik et al. ‘5 [John Anderlik – CFA Regional Manager, Stephen Kiser – Regional Economist, Jeffrey Walser – Regional Economist, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/regional/ro20053q/na/2005fall_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/regional/ro20053q/na/2005fall_04.html</a>]<br />
In a related development, reductions… percent hike in farmland loans.<br />

The resulting wave of foreclosures and bank failures would tank the agricultural sector<br />
Pitt and Jackson ‘8 [York Dispatch [AP], 4/21]<br />

<br />
<strong>Enclosure K</strong><br />
<br />
The Thesis: the modern site for the expansion of capital is NEOLIBERAL ENCLOSURE.<br />
The new enclosures are different from the violent bloody expropriation of the English countryside. The regime of neoliberal capital works by enclosing the last vestiges of public commons and embedding them within new markets.<br />
A Haroon Akram-Lodhi ‘7 Department of International Development Studies, Trent University (Third World Quarterly Vol. 28, No. 8, 2007, pp 1437 – 1456)<br />
The continuous character of enclosures...underwent neoliberal agrarian restructuring.<br />
<br />
The Link:<br />
The plan’s rollback of subsidies is an act of enclosure – it forces reliance on the market and inserts the market as a mediator between the producer and means of livelihood.<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘4 “’Opposing Fetishism by Reclaiming our Powers’. The Social Forum Movement, Capitalist Markets and the Politics of Alternatives” International Social Science Journal, N. 1882 (December 2004).<br />
There is not the space here to...spontaneously emerging system of freedom (De Angelis, 2002).<br />
<br />
The Impact: the process of enclosure in the North is part of the same process that colonized the South – the expansion of neoliberal enclosure creates global violence and global death zones of humanity – perpetual suffering and violence is inevitable.<br />
Balibar ‘4, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at The University of Paris-X, 2004 [Etienne, also Distinguished Professor of Humanities at University of California at Irvine, We, The People Of Europe?: Reflections On Transnational Citizenship, p. 115-116, 126-129]<br />
With this pretentious title, I want to continue ... citizenship are perceived as a threat for &quot;civilization.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Alternative: produce commons, not enclosures.<br />
The production of commons is a struggle against enclosures – this is struggle is most important in the commodification of land and food.<br />
The direction of the plan in relation to markets is the problem, even if it seems that flawed subsidies are the problem. The alternative is the opposite – its in favor of commons, against enclosures.<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘4 Lecturer, University of East London, Historical Materialism, volume 12:2 (57–87) “Separating the Doing and the Deed”<br />
In the context of contemporary ... various degrees of protection from the market.
