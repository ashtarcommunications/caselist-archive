T- Overrule<br />
-aff only overrules the military tribunals on the grounds that they<br />
cannot be used for terrorist. Must address the application of all<br />
military tribunals<br />
-and quirin was specific to spies not terrorist<br />
-overrule must deprive decision of authority and put new one in its<br />
place they don't offer a new precedence<br />
-interp means new principle must be in place<br />
<br />

Activism DA<br />
-overruling a precedent overturn stare decisis and legit and makes<br />
court illegitimate<br />

<u>Critical Jurisprudence: The Political Philosophy of Justice</u> 10-11<br />
<br />
&quot;Power relations and practices proliferate and&quot;<br />
<br />
The affirmative view that the law is objective enables elites to silence discussion and maintain dominance.<br />
Kairys 1982<br />
David, <em>The Politics of Law</em>, pp. 174-9<br />
<br />
&quot;The separation between law and politics becomes a myth&quot;<br />
<br />
Rights are incapable of creating real life experiences - they merely represent governmental efforts to &quot;allow&quot; people to have experiences, making humans ontologically passive: humans can only interact if the government lets them<br />
Gabel 1984<br />
Peter, Texas Law Review, 62 Tex. L. Rev. 1563<br />
<br />
&quot;to the extent that individuals are represented as 'having' rights&quot;<br />
<br />
Implications - the law is inherently indeterminate. Judges enforce law as they please because they have absolute discretion.<br />
Fellas 1993<br />
John, Boston Law Review, 73 BUL Rev. 715<br />
<br />
&quot;the rejection of the distinction between&quot;<br />
<br />
Obedience and respect for the law causes torture, persecution, and outright opression. It allows the state to do whatever it wants. The rule of law caused terror, enslavement, and internment of million of minorities in this country already.<br />
Henderson 1991<br />
Lynne, Indiana Law Journal, 66 Ind. LJ 379<br />
<br />
&quot;Athoritarians obey and demand obedience to&quot;<br />
<br />
The Alternative - The alternative is to lose faith in the judicial reasoning in the affirmative. Loss of faith in the affirmative solves, the appeal to legal rights simply no longer works. This loss of faith is much like the loss of faith in God.<br />
Kennedy 2002<br />
Duncan Carter &quot;The Critique of Rights in Critical Legal Studies&quot; <u>Left Legalism/Left Critique</u> 192-3<br />
<br />
&quot;To lose your faith in judicial reasoning&quot;<br />
<br />
Framework - The debate should be judged to see who has the most effective political questions.<br />
<br />
Legalistic questions shut off open discussion. Legalistic questions regulate identities and stop radical change.<br />
Brown and Halley 2002<br />
<u>Left Legalism/Left Critique</u> Introduction<br />
<br />
&quot;So saturated by legalism is contemporary&quot;<br />
<br />
Fiant is an illusion. The only way to impact the world is to redirect the site of engagement to performative micro-levels that erode the authoritarianism of the State and desanctify the forms of symbolic authority used to generate the myth of the rule of law.<br />
Gabel 1984<br />

<ol><li>Interpretation: Overruling a decision must express a judgment on the same question of law and it must be directly opposite the original case</li></ol><strong>Black’s Law Dictionary 90</strong><br />
“A decisions is said to be overruled… as precedent”<br />
<ol><li>Violation: Quirin had nothing to do with the procedure in which they could be tried – it merely said they were in lawful custody. To be topical the affirmative must deny the government’s ability to use military tribunals, not to alter their rules.</li></ol><strong>Fisher 06</strong> (<u>Suspected Terrorists and What to do with them</u> pg. 110)<br />
“Were President Roosevelt’s… habeas corpus to a military tribunal.”<br />
<ol><li>Standards:</li></ol>1) Limits – the affirmative opens the floodgates to an infinite number of affirmatives that deal with areas of law that Quirin didn’t address<br />
2) Ground – cases that alter the procedure of commission avoid all of our military tribunal good links because they don’t ban them but merely alter them, ensuring specific link turns subsume our generic links<br />

Abortion CP: A federal amendment would return the right to legislate abortion back to the states and would have no effect upon jurisprudence outside the right to abortion. (Forsythe 2k6)<br />
<br />
Culture of Death:<br />
A) Scientific evidence suggests life begins at conception. Even if incorrect we should err on the side of protecting life (Pope John Paul II 95)<br />
<br />
B) When a state chooses to even democratically to kill one part for the convenience of another, it has degenerated into an absolute tyranny (PJP II 95)<br />

C) The ballot is key (Reagan)
