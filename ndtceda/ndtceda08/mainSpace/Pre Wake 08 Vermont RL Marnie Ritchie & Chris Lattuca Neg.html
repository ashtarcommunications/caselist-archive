Second Semester- Heidegger on the NEG.<br />
JV Nats- update- Ran Queer Theory (Edelman) Round 3 vs Cornell<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The University of Vermont team of Ritchie and Lattuca will be running an argument from the Texas swing onward that we have entitled “open source.” Here’s the thesis to our argument:<br />
<br />
This is a theoretical argument about how debate should take place. All of our evidence in this round is publicly posted on a website, in the form we are reading it, including both the cards and the value added in the form of text.<br />
<br />
This argument in full file form can be found at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://opencaselist.wikispaces.com/file/list" rel="nofollow">http://opencaselist.wikispaces.com/file/list</a>. It’s also linked off our wiki disclosure page.<br />
<br />
Our framework is that debaters should not exercise proprietary control over either cards or the value added by their reorganization into briefs. We advocate an “open source” system in which debate arguments are publically accessible in their entirety online, and are subject to constant revision in the online marketplace of ideas.<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s arguments, however, are not open source. Their briefs are close source. They exercise proprietary control over the value they’ve added to the information that they tilled from the internet and books. The briefs are not publicly accessible for download and they are not subject to constant revision.<br />
<br />
We advocate a Wikipedia-like system. They’re operating in a system similar to Microsoft.<br />
<br />
In short, we encourage all teams to disclose their files. Its time for a change in debate. Read our file. Its posted on this site. You should post your files. We have disclosed our affirmative and the arguments we’ve been running this year.<br />
<br />
To be clear, if your files aren’t posted online in a publicly accessible place before you debate, we think you should lose.<br />
<br />
Here’s our shell:<br />
<br />
A. The framework and violation – all evidence read in a debate must be publically accessible online prior to its use. If your evidence is closed source, you lose.<br />
<br />
B. Only we meet our interpretation – we have disclosed our entire aff files and neg files online. The negative has not.<br />
<br />
C. Reasons to prefer -<br />
<br />
1. Argument Quality – open source debate would increase argument quality -<br />
<br />
a. Rapid improvements – a large number of debaters working on a single argument would increase depth of sources and breadth of argument. Improvements happen rapidly through peer review. Social esteem and fun from researching will be sufficient to drive work.<br />

<br />
It's the best illustration of the limitless benefits to be derived from the open source philosophy. While the PC wasn't developed using the open source model, it is an example of a technology that was opened for any person or company to clone and improve and sell. In its purest form, the open source model allows anyone to participate in a project's development or commercial exploitation. Linux is obviously the most successful example. What started out in my messy Helsinki bedroom has grown to become the largest collaborative project in the history of the world. It began as an ideology shared by software developers who believed that computer source code should be shared freely, with the General Public License - the anticopyright - as the movement's powerful tool. It evolved to become a method for the continuous development of the best technology. And it evolved further to accept widespread market acceptance, as seen in the snowballing adoption of Linux as an operating system for web servers, and in its unexpectedly generous IPOs.<br />
What was inspired by ideology has proved itself as technology and is working in the marketplace. Now open source expanding beyond the technical and business domains. At Harvard University Law School, professors Larry Lessig (who is now at Stanford) and Charles Nesson have brought the open source model to law. They started the Open Law Project, which relies on volunteer lawyers and law students posting opinions and research on the project's Web site to help develop arguments and briefs challenging the United States Copyright Extension Act. The theory is that the strongest arguments will be developed when the largest number of legal minds are working on a project, and as a mountain of information is generated through postings and repostings. The site nicely sums up the trade off from the traditional approach: &quot;What we lose in secrecy, we expect to regain in depth of sources and breadth of argument.&quot; (Put in another context: With a million eyes, all software bugs will vanish.)<br />
It's a wrinkle on how academic research has been conducted for years, but one that makes sense on a number of fronts. Think of how this approach could speed up the development of cures for diseases, for example. Or how, with the best minds on the task, international diplomacy could be strengthened. As the world becomes smaller, as the pace of life and business intensifies, and as the technology and information become available, people realise the tight-fisted approach is becoming increasingly outmoded.<br />
The theory behind open source is simple. In the case of an operating system - is free. Anyone can improve it, change it, exploit it. But those improvements, changes and exploitations have to be made freely available. Think Zen. The project belongs to no one and everyone. When a project is opened up, there is rapid and continual improvement. With teams of contributors working in parallel, the results can happen far more speedily and successfully than if the work were being conducted behind closed doors.<br />
That's what we experienced with Linux. Imagine: Instead of a tiny cloistered development team working in secret, you have a monster on your side. Potentially millions of the brightest minds are contributing to the project, and are supported by a peer-review process that has no, er, peer.<br />
The first time people hear about the open source approach, it sounds ludicrous. That's why it has taken years for the message of its virtues to sink in. Ideology isn't what has sold the open source model. It started gaining attention when it was obvious that open source was the best method of developing and improving the highest quality technology. And now it is winning in the marketplace, an accomplishment has brought open source its greatest acceptance. Companies were able to be created around numerous value-added services, or to use open source as a way of making a technology popular. When the money rolls in, people get convinced.<br />
One of the least understood pieces of the open source puzzle is how so many good programmers would deign to work for absolutely no money. A word about motivation is in order. In a society where survival is more or less assured, money is not the greatest of motivators. It's been well established that folks do their best work when they are driven by a passion. When they are having fun. This is as true for playwrights and sculptors and entrepreneurs as it is for software engineers. The open source model gives people the opportunity to live their passion. To have fun and to work with the world's best programmers, not the few who happen to be employed by their company. Open source developers strive to earn the esteem of their peers. That's got to be highly motivating.<br />
<br />
b. No secrecy – there is no incentive in an open source system to conceal defects in arguments. This produces rapid innovations and improvements. There’s no incentive to hide the fact that an argument is bad and therefore weak arguments just won’t be run – our evidence model is analogous to ego-less programming.<br />

<br />
In The Mythical Man-Month, Fred Brooks observed that programmer time is not fungible; adding developers to a late software project makes it later. As we've seen previously, he argued that the complexity and communication costs of a project rise with the square of the number of developers, while work done only rises linearly. Brooks's Law has been widely regarded as a truism. But we've examined in this essay a number of ways in which the process of open-source development falsifies the assumptions behind it—and, empirically, if Brooks's Law were the whole picture Linux would be impossible.<br />
Gerald Weinberg's classic The Psychology of Computer Programming supplied what, in hindsight, we can see as a vital correction to Brooks. In his discussion of ``egoless programming'', Weinberg observed that in shops where developers are not territorial about their code, and encourage other people to look for bugs and potential improvements in it, improvement happens dramatically faster than elsewhere. (Recently, Kent Beck's `extreme programming' technique of deploying coders in pairs looking over one anothers' shoulders might be seen as an attempt to force this effect.)<br />
Weinberg's choice of terminology has perhaps prevented his analysis from gaining the acceptance it deserved—one has to smile at the thought of describing Internet hackers as ``egoless''. But I think his argument looks more compelling today than ever.<br />
The bazaar method, by harnessing the full power of the ``egoless programming'' effect, strongly mitigates the effect of Brooks's Law. The principle behind Brooks's Law is not repealed, but given a large developer population and cheap communications its effects can be swamped by competing nonlinearities that are not otherwise visible. This resembles the relationship between Newtonian and Einsteinian physics—the older system is still valid at low energies, but if you push mass and velocity high enough you get surprises like nuclear explosions or Linux.<br />
<br />
c. Debate-judge collaboration - exposing not just arguments but discussion on how to improve arguments to judges and other coaches improves debate because it allows reflection that can’t happen in a debate round. Judges could literally reflect on arguments long before they are debated, eliminating judge adaptation uncertainty – open source code and beta testers prove this argument.<br />
<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">Raymond ‘99</span> [Eric S. (Hacker, GNU Contributor, Co-Developer of Fetchmail, Nethack, Emac’s VD and GUD modes); “The Cathedral and the Bazaar”; August 8; <span class="white1"><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://library.n0i.net/advocacy/cathedral/ar01s05.html" rel="nofollow">http://library.n0i.net/advocacy/cathedral/ar01s05.html</a> </span></span><em>nick]<br />
<span class="white1"><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> </span><br />
</span> One key to understanding is to realize exactly why it is that the kind of bug report non–source-aware users normally turn in tends not to be very useful. Non–source-aware users tend to report only surface symptoms; they take their environment for granted, so they (a) omit critical background data, and (b) seldom include a reliable recipe for reproducing the bug.<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">The underlying problem here is a mismatch between the tester's and the developer's mental models of the program</span>; <span class="BoldUnderline">the tester, on the outside looking in, and the developer on the inside looking out</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">In closed-source development they're both stuck in these roles</span>, and tend to talk past each other and find each other deeply frustrating.<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">Open-source development breaks this bind</span>, <span class="BoldUnderline">making it far easier for tester and developer to develop a shared representation grounded</span> in the actual source code <span class="BoldUnderline">and to communicate effectively about it.</span> Practically, there is a huge difference in leverage for the developer between the kind of bug report that just reports externally-visible symptoms and the kind that hooks directly to the developer's source-code–based mental representation of the program.<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">Most bugs,</span> most of the time, <span class="BoldUnderline">are easily nailed given even an incomplete but suggestive characterization of their error conditions at source-code level</span>. When someone among your beta-testers can point out, &quot;there's a boundary problem in line nnn&quot;, or even just &quot;under conditions X, Y, and Z, this variable rolls over&quot;, a quick look at the offending code often suffices to pin down the exact mode of failure and generate a fix.<br />
Thus, <span class="BoldUnderline">source-code awareness by both parties greatly enhances both good communication and the synergy between what a beta-tester reports and what the core developer(s) know</span>. In turn, this means that the core developers' time tends to be well conserved, even with many collaborators.<br />
<br />
d. Cross-pollination - academic citations conclusively demonstrate that publishing online increases readership – the analogy would be that if backfiles were freely accessible online, it would be easier for debaters to build on existing arguments in creating new ones - debate should join the numerous disciplines that have switched to open access.<br />
<br />
von Hippel ‘5 [Eric (Head of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Group in the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology); “Democratizing Information”; p. 88-89; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books.htm</a></em> nick]<br />
<br />
In the case of academic publications, we see evidence that free revealing does increase reuse—a matter of great importance to academics. A citation is an indicator that information contained in an article has been reused: the article has been read by the citing author and found useful enough to draw to readers' attention. Recent empirical studies are finding that articles to which readers have open access—articles available for free download from an author’s website, for example—are cited significantly more often than are equivalent articles that are available only from libraries or from publishers’ fee-based websites. Antelman (2004) finds an increase in citations ranging from 45 percent in philosophy to 91 percent in mathematics. She notes that &quot;scholars in diverse disciplines are adopting open-access practices at a surprisingly high rate and are being rewarded for it, as reflected in [citations].&quot;<br />
<br />
e. Public sphere - the insular, secretive manner in which research is stored prevents the spillover of vital research to public arguments – open source could facility cross-germination with the public sphere.<br />
<br />
Mitchell ’00 [Gordon (Professor of Communications at the University of Pittsburgh); Strategic Deceptions: Rhetoric, Science, and Politics in Missile Defense Advocacy; p. xvi-xvii <em>nick]<br />
<br />
Perhaps the most strange and idiosyncratic aspect of the contemporary intercollegiate debate community is that, by and large, it keeps to itself. Contrary to the populist tradition of debate as the quintessential genre of public discourse, contemporary intercollegiate debate is an insular and specialized academic activity. The research products generated by thousands of debaters nation-wide are generally put toward a singular end: winning tournament competitions. Sometimes this insularity appears absurd to those who stumble across a slice of the debate community for the first time. In the summer of 1990, Madison Laird (then captain of the Loyola University<br />
debate squad) was assigned the task of entertaining Earth Day organizer Bill Keepin during Keepin¹s visit to the Loyola campus in Los Angeles, California. After Keepin delivered a speech on nuclear power to the student body, Laird led him on a campus tour that ended up in the debate squad room, where yards and yards of argument briefs were stowed away in filing drawers. When Keepin asked to see the files containing research on nuclear power, Laird pulled open one file drawer stuffed to the gills with high-quality research. Keepin was stunned, asking incredulously &quot;how long have you folks kept this stuff locked up?!&quot; In a small way, this vignette<br />
illustrates the folly associated with the intercollegiate debate community's insular nature. Indeed, it would not be surprising to find countless other Bill Keepins out there who could make tremendous use of the research and knowledge generated out of intercollegiate policy debate competition. To reach them, debaters need only to realize that they can make vital contributions to public arguments swirling beyond the rarefied confines of debate tournament sites.<br />
<br />
2. Education – open source debate would increase education – two warrants –<br />
<br />
a. Breadth – open source debate would increase the breadth of education – this is really just simple math – while there would be a lot of overlap in research if all files were open source now, every innovation or argument that the majority of the country doesn’t have would expand the research and education base. Without the secrecy element of research – as soon as a new idea is discovered on the topic, the education of the topic would be further expanded.<br />
<br />
b. Depth – in addition to the fact that open source debate means that every debater would have access to a larger set of arguments, open source debate would also mean that each file on every issue would be extremely deep. In simple terms, if you were to put the best ten files on a single issue in a word document, and then deleted all the duplicate evidence, that would be your file. You could expect to have files with nearly every one of the best pieces of evidence out there – this increases the depth and specificity of education.<br />
<br />
3. Fairness - open source evidence is the only structural answer to resource inequalities – other inevitable measures limit production or participation – open source is key to reduce entry barriers – that’s key to overall fairness in debate.<br />
<br />
Antonucci ‘5 [Michael (Debate coach for Georgetown; former coach for Lexington High School); “[eDebate] open source? resp to Morris”; December 8; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndtceda.com/pipermail/edebate/2005-December/064806.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndtceda.com/pipermail/edebate/2005-December/064806.html</a></em> nick]<br />
<br />
a. Open source systems are preferable to the various punishment proposals in circulation. It's better to share the wealth than limit production or participation. Various flavors of argument communism appeal to different people, but banning interesting or useful research(ers) seems like the most destructive solution possible.<br />
Indeed, open systems may be the only structural, rule-based answer to resource inequities. Every other proposal I've seen obviously fails at the level of enforcement. Revenue sharing (illegal), salary caps (unenforceable and possibly illegal) and personnel restrictions (circumvented faster than you can say 'information is fungible') don't work. This would - for better or worse.<br />
b. With the help of a middling competent archivist, an open source system would reduce entry barriers. This is especially true on the novice or JV level. Young teams could plausibly subsist entirely on a diet of scavenged arguments. A novice team might not wish to<br />
do so, but the option can't hurt.<br />
c. An open source system would fundamentally change the evidence economy without targetting anyone or putting anyone out of a job. It seems much smarter (and less bilious) to change the value of a professional card-cutter's work than send the KGB after specific counter-revolutionary teams.<br />
<br />
C. Vote negative. This is a gateway argument about how we should be allowed to debate. Evaluate it through a lens of competing interpretations. If they don’t win that a closed source system is preferable or that their evidence is “open source,” they lose and you should vote negative. We have a few reasons –<br />
<br />
1. The more winning ballots for the open source framework, the more likely debaters are to put their briefs online.<br />
<br />
Sanchez ‘5 [Kevin (debate coach); “[eDebate] open source / creative commons / how long will you folks keep this stuff locked?”; December 12; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndtceda.com/pipermail/edebate/2005-December/064838.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndtceda.com/pipermail/edebate/2005-December/064838.html</a> <em>nick]<br />
<br />
At the NDT, many teams chose to post their first constructive speeches on an accessible website -- that's the internet disclosure which Stefan has worked hard to achieve. Yet some debaters chose not to do so, although they may've likely read the blocks of their opponents prior to the round. (I even recall Stefan and others stopping just short of calling such free-riders 'cheaters'.) This begs the question, how does this community intend to enforce this norm? I'd suggest that the short-term answer is not top-down punishment from tourney directors, but debaters themselves taking ballots away from free-riders, fair and square.<br />
Everyone knows there are dominant players who benefit immensely from the status quo: teams which can afford to hire extra staff, students who can afford to go to pricey institutes, companies which can afford to sue you if you share their evidence. Despite the lip-service paid to the educational mission of debate, until this competitive incentive changes, nothing will magically 'level the playing field'. So how do participants alter competitive incentive? Again, by winning ballots. Blatantly non-topical cases, for example, are liabilities. If/when the 'open source / creative commons' position wins more ballots, it will more likely compel debaters to put their briefs online. Quite simply, the 'solvency mechanism' - at least for the immediate future - is winning the position itself.<br />
<br />
2. Vote negative for norm enforcement – just as they’d lose for not being topical, they should lose for keeping their evidence “closed source.”<br />
<br />
Sanchez ‘5 [Kevin (Debate coach); “[eDebate] What's being talked about is not &quot;open source&quot;”; December 12; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndtceda.com/pipermail/edebate/2005-December/064852.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndtceda.com/pipermail/edebate/2005-December/064852.html</a></em> nick - evidence modified to correct grammar and spelling errors]<br />
<br />
Also I'd remind you that the thrust of this position implies putting norm-enforcement power in the hands of debaters at the round-level. By that I mean, when a team fails to post their first constructive under already existing schemes for internet disclosure, they should also run up against a meta-theory-argument like this one; just as they'd lose to topicality if they are not topical, so they'd lose to whatever this is if they remain 'closed source', especially if they're reaping the benefits of others participation in an open system. The slogan is, gank ballots from free-riders.<br />
<br />
3. Gendered language debates proves this works – voting negative could deter future use of “closed source” evidence<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br />
The challenges to the game of debate mentioned in my essay also directly address this. <span class="Dottedunderline">The</span><span class="BoldUnderline"> critical </span><span class="Dottedunderline">move</span> in debate, <span class="Dottedunderline">where debaters</span> step outside of the traditional “box” to analyze the ethical issues of argumentative perspectives and to <span class="Dottedunderline">analyze the language employed in a debate belies this</span> concern. <span class="BoldUnderline">Almost all</span> American <span class="BoldUnderline">debaters know that making a racist or sexist comment in a debate is one of the easiest ways to lose a ballot, as the</span> opposing team is likely to make that the only issue in the debate, and the <span class="Dottedunderline">judge will make an example of you</span>. There is no time in debate history when falsification and fabrication of evidence has been better monitored or when the behavior of debaters as regards evidence has been better. This may be more due to the ability to check the evidence used by others, but it still is the case. <span class="Dottedunderline">This</span> sort of <span class="BoldUnderline">ethical dimension of argument and presentation</span> <span class="Dottedunderline">has been made an issue in the decision.

<br />
This can be so much more than &quot;post your files here&quot;. A world where evidence production is public and co-operative allows us to develop tools for argument production that would be amazing--click on this block, query the database for a card, paste the card in. Compare 10 different users tweaked versions of an argument, paste together the best parts, submit 5 new cards to the database, combine them into blocks. Read comments from two dozen people on the merits of subtle differences. Post round reports on what answers people made and won on. Write responses, etc. This is the kind of website that I'm interested in building, and Antonucci's argument will be the competitive stick that drives the transition. This is exciting.<br />

Heidegger NEG<br />
<br />
The aff's will to will (i.e. being resolved to do plan action) regards everything as a resource to be manipulated – this is what enables power and domination<br />
Rohkramer '05 (Thomas Rohkramer [teaches modern Germany in the Dept of History @Lancaster U, UK]; &quot;Martin Heidegger, National Socialism, and Environmentalism,&quot; in How Green Were the Nazis? Nature, Environment, and Nation in the Third Reich, edited by Franz-Josef Bruggmeier, Marc Cioc, and Thomas Zeller, pp. 181)<br />
[Heidegger's most comprehensive criticism… …decisive for Heidegger from 1936 onwards]<br />
<br />
DIALOGUE from Heidegger's &quot;Conversation on a Country Path&quot;<br />
Scholar: Non-willing, for one thing… …uncovered something essential<br />
<br />
Agriculture is the ultimate embodiment of the will – it is nothing but an attempt to master and control the earth while objectifying all aspects of nature into usable/calculable resources.<br />
Heidegger '53 (Martin Heidegger [Philosopher/professor] The Question Concerning Technology, publishing 1977 in Basic Writings, pp. 320-1)<br />
And yet, the revealing that holds sway… …turns the wheel that keep a factory running.<br />
<br />
Next, this will to calculate and control reduces all of nature to a stable and always predictable standing reserve. All beings are rendered objects in a steadfast refusal of the revelations of Being, ensuring war and ecocide.<br />
Zimmerman '81 (Michael E. Zimmerman [prof of Philosophy @ Tulane U]; Eclipse of the Self: The Development of Heidegger's Concept of Authenticity, pp. 220-4)<br />
In 1951, Heidegger noted… …the capitalist is a rational miser.&quot;<br />
<br />
The aff's ethics and guilt reassert managerial control – they view the problem having resulted from humanity's failure to manage properly, i.e. that more managerialism will solve the problem. This serves to reinforce human control.<br />
McWhorter '92 (Professor of philosophy and women's studies department of philosophy, University of Richmond. [La Delle, Heidegger and the Earth: Essays in Environmental Ethics, page 8-9])<br />
When we respond to Heidegger's call… …even if what is shattered eventually is ourselves.<br />
<br />

Teacher: Horizon and transcendence… …to our re-presenting are objects<br />

Thus, alternative is releasement to this openness – in which simply being resolved allows for an entirely novel revelation of Being outside of the domain of the will and its strangehold on politics.<br />
Zimmerman '81 (Michael E. Zimmerman [prof of Philosophy at Tulane U]; Eclipse of the Self: The Development of Heidegger's Concept of Authenticity, pp. 245-8)<br />
Under the domination of egoism and self-will… …beyond the personal God of Creation<br />
