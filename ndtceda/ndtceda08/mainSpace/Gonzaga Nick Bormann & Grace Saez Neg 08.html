<strong>( ) ‘Normalized relations’ with the U.S. are a front for the expansion of imperialist globalization into Iran – the Iranian regime is currently in the grips of a struggle between those who advocate rapproachment with the U.S. as a means of integrating Iran into the global imperialist system and those like Ahmedinejad who oppose the market’s expansion into Iran. In this sense, the plan plays directly into the hands of those who demonize Ahmedinejad</strong> <br />
Khashayar <strong>Hooshiyar,</strong> Professor of Political Science at York University, January/February <strong>2006,</strong> Relay, No. 9, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://iranreview.com/Editorials/Iran%20and%20US.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://iranreview.com/Editorials/Iran%20and%20US.pdf</a>, accessed November 11, 2007<br />
The ascendancy of the neo-conservatives ...despite Ahmadi-Nejad’s rhetoric.<br />
<br />
<strong>( ) Normalized relations with Iran are perfectly reflective of the way inclusion today sets the stage for exclusion tomorrow – bringing Iran within the fold of U.S. diplomacy is designed to remove the largest, most recalcitrant impediment to U.S. global dominance. The plan sets up a choice for Iran – capitulate to the U.S., or reject our offer of normalized relations and face renewed U.S. violence.</strong> <br />

If economic issues are ...forces outside Iran.<br />
<br />
<strong>( ) Our method arguments are particularly true both in the context of Iran and of their affirmation of diplomatic engagement. As scholars studying Iran in the West, we have a particular responsibility to be mindful of the consequences of our commitments to particular policy choices – only our alternative’s refusal of the belief in benign U.S. internationalism can create the intellectual conditions necessary to truly change our relationship to Iran as scholars and individuals.</strong><br />

<strong><u>Preventive War Takeout</u></strong><br />
<br />
a) Their plan and their evidence confuse the terms ‘preemptive strikes’ and ‘preventive strikes’ – preemptive strikes are solely in self-defense against an imminent attack and are widely accepted as legitimate in international law. The strikes their plan WANTS to ban are preventive – these are wars like Iraq, which are fought whenever the aggressor wants, in anticipation of a threat that may materialize any time in the future. This means the plan does NOTHING about the ACTUAL way Iran strikes would go down.<br />
Colin S. Gray, Professor of International Politics and Strategic Studies at the University of Reading, England, July 2007, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB789.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB789.pdf</a>, accessed September 27, 2007<br />
Preemption has been… it is prevention.<br />
<br />
b) This is NOT just a semantic distinction – it’s reflected in actual U.S. warfighting doctrine. The DOD dictionary defines preemption and prevention just like our evidence does – which means legally the plan doesn’t oblige the U.S. to take preventive strikes off the table, it only bans the FAR more limited category of preemptive strikes. The plan BANS the MORAL, SELF-DEFENSE type of attack, while EXPLICITLY ALLOWING the PREVENTIVE strikes that ALL their evidence indicts. Regardless of what they INTENDED, this is what their plan would ACTUALLY DO<br />
Steven J. Barela, Professor of Law at the University of Geneva, Winter 2004, Denver Journal of International Law and Policy, 33 Denv. J. Int'l L. &amp; Pol'y 31, p. 32-33<br />
To begin, we will.. investigated historically.<br />
<br />
c) Here’s how you should assess this debate – reject any and all of their evidence that doesn’t make clear its assumptions regarding the definitions of preemption and prevention. Every one of our authors makes this distinction clear and clarifies that when they’re talking about preemptive war, they’re ACTUALLY talking about preemptive war. Only setting the bar super-high for what evidence you consider in debates over preemptive war can rescues discussions of these policy choices from the hopeless lack of clarity people like Kansas have created.<br />
Colin S. Gray, Professor of International Politics and Strategic Studies at the University of Reading, England, July 2007, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB789.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB789.pdf</a>, accessed September 27, 2007<br />

Philip H. Gordon, July-August 2006, Foreign Affairs<br />
“Reading over President George W. Bush’s….pursue other key national interests”<br />
<br />
The plan would be a quick wakeup call to the Bush doctrine—taking regime change off the table would mae the administration perceive that it missed the chance to preempt Iran. The result is a return to preemption elsewhere to ensure that diplomacy is never necessary again,<br />

“With on well-placed strike… mutual annihilation via nuclear weapons”<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Diplomacy K</u></strong><br />
<br />
When the US claimed “you’re with us or the terrorists” it did NOT establish the permanent binary that most people assumed—rather, the project of dividing the globe into states who comply with the US led global order and those who don’t is an active and mobile one US diplomatic engagement with states in the ME is pursued under the rubric of simultaneously cementing our domination of the globe and clearly establishing those who rejct our engagement as targets for legitimate annihilation<br />
David Campbell et all, 2007, Political Geography, VOl. 26, pg 415-416<br />
“As we argue throughout this paper, the distinctive thing about….unites the United States and Europe (Bush, 2005).<br />
<br />
States who face the prospect of US engagement have 2 choices—assimilate to the global liberal order or face annihilation—doesn’t matter that the plan warms relations or provides concessions—bringing them into the fold today paves the way for war against “our” remaining enemies tomm, the impact is perpetual war on a global scale<br />
Aron Pease 2002, Politics and Culture, Issue 3, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://aspen.conncoll.edu/politicsandculture/pag.cfm?key=176" rel="nofollow">http://aspen.conncoll.edu/politicsandculture/pag.cfm?key=176</a><br />
“Joxe works out the spatial logic of historical…the US is primarily a predatory empire”<br />
<br />
Don’t be fooled by the attempt to rject the politics of containtment—the more insidious strategy of global control is the one pursued via diplomatic integration—the plan is a Troyjan horse designed to lock in US supremacy over the globe and to creat a enw Manichean divide between complian states who we “engage” and ht enw global class of outlaws<br />
Campbell, same cite, pg. 414<br />
“The concept of integration….sanctity of borders elsewhere (see Kaplan, 2003:87).<br />
<br />
The liberal-internationalist project of brining our newfound ‘friends’ within the fold of US diplomatic commitments corresponds to the ever-intensifying project of purging the global order of the mirror image of enlightened liberal states—ever value established by liberal internationalism relies on its corresponding opposite non-value that must be eradicationed<br />
