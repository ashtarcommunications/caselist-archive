Aff: Afghan Woman<br />
<br />
Observation one: Inherency and Harms<br />
<br />
Adv one: Women’s Rights<br />
<br />
A. Afghanistan<br />
<br />
Women in afghanistan have not been liberated, they suffer systematic rape, abuse, and sever health problems, the best weapon against this oppression is education<br />
South China Morning Post, 05<br />
”An afghan rights activist... fathers, husbands, and sons.”<br />
<br />
Violence is escalating-now is the key time to act.<br />
Feminist majority foundation, 2007, feminist.org<br />
”five years after... take away their rights.”<br />
<br />
The united states government has an obligation to ensure afghan women are free from all forms of violence and have a right to education- the afghan women empowerment act is key<br />
representative malone, 2006, “empowering afghan women and girls”<br />
”Women’s rights in afghanistan... empowerment act is passed.”<br />
<br />
B. Women of the World<br />
<br />
Afghanistan is only one example of how us universalist rhetoric of human rights promotion ignores women’s right in practice.<br />
Hallock 2005<br />
”president george... eyes of the law.”<br />
<br />
Lack of recognition for the rights of women underpin the roots of international conflict.<br />
Caprioli and Boyer, 2001<br />
“This suggests that... less egalitarian societies.”<br />
<br />
Afghanistan presents a unique opportunity to promote a global culture of women’s rights.<br />
National post, 2006<br />
”For decades dr. sima... helping the afghan people,” she said.<br />
<br />
adv 2: positive peace:<br />
<br />
The rhetoric of liberating the women of afghanistan has been coopted through the logic of masculinist protection to rally suport for militaristic fopo, this only seems to reproduce direct and structural violence against women<br />
Armsrong and Prashed 2005<br />
“war has never been men’s.... u.s. military invasions.<br />
<br />
Current notions of security understand war as an isolated even tdetached from the status quo framework of negative peace, this ontology perpetuates crisis politics that entrench global militarism, only a commitment to positive peace can challenge omnipresent militarism<br />
cuomo 96<br />
“philosophical attention to war has.... inevitability of war and militarism.”<br />
<br />
this reliance on war as the ultimate tool of foreign policy makes human extinction inevitable<br />
istvan meszaros, 2003, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.monthlyreview.org/0603meszaros.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.monthlyreview.org/0603meszaros.htm</a><br />
”the dangers and immense suffering... model of rationality.<br />
<br />
Plan: The united states federal government should constructively engage the government of afghanistan, specifically the ministry of women’s affairs, and offer foreign assistance as per the afghan women empowerment act.<br />
<br />
They don’t read answers to any offcase positions, only reasons why case comes first.
