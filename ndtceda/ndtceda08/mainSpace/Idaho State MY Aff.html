<br />
<br />
Perm – do both – the amendment would deflect any impact on internal court politics of perceived legitimacy.<br />
Perm – do the counterplan<br />
This is legitimate – they’re in a double bind, either<br />
A. Amendments overrule the decision in which case the counterplan is plan plus and the perm is legit or<br />
B. The perm severs out of overrule in which case the counterplan doesn’t solve our overrule good offense.<br />
C. Not timeframe severance – normal means is that it will be overruled at the next available test case – which is what the counterplan would do.<br />
If they solve our offense they link to the net benefit – their link evidence is to the term “overrule” which is what the counterplan does if it invalidates the illegal enemy precedent. Err aff on these questions – marginal net benefits should be treated as no risk to protect the aff from extra-competitive counterplan planks that solve the impact to the solvency deficit.<br />
Overrule is key – extend our Thorup evidence – naming is the first game of politics – so long as the decision is on the books the capacity remains to depoliticize enmity which turns states into killing machines and is the internal link to all of the 1ac offense.<br />
Extend the Hatab evidence – the counterplan forms democracy on the basis on principles – i.e. a specific and binding text – which renders democracy susceptible to the most insiduous forms of tyranny because it excludes those not democratic enough., etc.. Prefer an overrule because it enables a via negative form of democratic politics – formed on the basis of “what we are not” – not what we are. The amendment suppresses those outside of its vision of truth in politics – i.e. they do not tolerate the enemies of enmity. The 1AC is a disad<br />
Strauss, 2001 (114 Harv. L. Rev. 1457, l/n)<br />
Constitutional amendments also serve the distinct function ... of constitutional change.<br />
If the counterplan causes an overrule, it links to minimalism<br />
The counterplan adheres to the logic of the quirin decision – ruling enemies constitutionally lawful produces, dialectically, an unlawful enemy twin. Quirin is the precedent for carving these exceptions into constitutional protections – this means the permutation is key because that precedent must be overruled along with the amendment if it is to not backslide into the exceptional politics that informed the quirin ruling.<br />
Chief Justice Stone, 1942 (Ex Parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://findlaw.com/" rel="nofollow">findlaw.com</a>)<br />
An important incident to the conduct ... in the civil courts.<br />
This is supercharged by the text of the counterplan – vaguely worded amendments issuing norms lay the groundwork for exceptional politics<br />
Strauss, 2001, above.<br />
Finally, for an amendment to matter... Amendments were.<br />
If we win the criticism of the net benefit it’s a reason to vote aff – the counterplan doesn’t solve the aff if its done for liberal humanist reasons.,<br />

<strong>In Ex Parte Quirin the Nazis were expelled both literally from U.S. legal protections and figuratively from our conception of humanity. What is significant about this, however, is not simply that they were expelled but that their expulsion was done under the guise of a universal inclusive humanity, the post World War II world of humanitarian friendship. But friends must have enemies else their bond loses its coherence and our world must have gates else the “we” cannot be uttered. it is not the gates, however, that are dangerous, it is their invisibility. If a war is waged on behalf of “us” we can isolate a “them,” but when it is waged on behalf of everyone it raises a host of question. The Nazis, the communists, the Terrorists are not our enemies, they are not human because everyone has agreed that everyone does not include them. Of course we can say their crimes merit an exception but this thinking is dangerous. So long as humanity is evaluative our inclusivity will have limits and all opposition to the liberal order is exposed to the capacity to “merit that exception.” this danger is without precedent. Resistance to this order cannot merely be fought – it must be consumed without remainder making possible new and unimaginable modes of absolute annihilation.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>OBSERVATION TWO: AGREE TO DISAGREE</strong><br />
<strong>the friend enemy distinction is the necessary foundation for all politics. humanitarian discourse does not eliminate the political, it merely shields and makes more perverse its re-emergence. the plan signals a return to concrete, political enmity. declaring our enemies lawful creates a symmetrical relation of enmity wherein peace can be made and war becomes codified. this renders unecessary the abstract enemy of the war on terrorism that has made war a permanent condition of life and potential enemies of everyone.</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
we must draw bold and symmetrical lines in the sand. declaring our enemies lawful makes power visible and enables an antagonistic nation-state system grounded in reciprocal violence that limits the nature and scope of warfare. enmity and conflict are here to stay. the liberal attempt to eliminate them merely renders exclusions invisible making violence and warfare unilmited and the postmodern hope for ‘new political possibilities’ ushers in new forms of violence as we sit, paralyzed, waiting for godot.<br />

<br />
Observation One: the Mystery of Human Life<br />
<br />
The pro-choice ideology secured by the Casey decision grounds the law in a paradigm of secular rights-talk that eviscerates the very freedom it attempts to uphold by granting unlimited authority to the sovereign to make the decision on life. This promotion of the autonomous self necessitates the creation of the enemy “other” devastating the potential for authentic human community. Any coherent assertion of rights must be anchored in a recognition of God.<br />
Charles E. Rice 2005 3 Ave Maria L. Rev 259 l/n<br />
“For an assertion of rights to be fully coherent…insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned.”<br />
<br />
Justice is an empty signifier—the rights afforded by a secular reading of the Constitution invariably collapse in on themselves. This is why the “right to choose” simultaneously necessitates the “right to kill.” Legal positivism is moral relativism—any content is acceptable enabling endless wars and turning human beings into nothing more than “superior animals.” Only by grounding the law in an immortal destiny can there be a coherent basis for asserting transcendent rights of the person against the state.<br />
Rice 05<br />
“The above examples lead us to ask…Hitler is correct.”<br />
<br />
Freedom isn’t free. The conception of liberty made possible by the reasoning in the Casey decision attributes personhood to the ability to define one’s own moral universe. This serves as the foundation for the designation of the nonhuman—all life is exposed to the capacity to be deemed “insufficient.”<br />
Jay Alan Sekulow and John Tuskey 40 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 945.<br />
“Second, Casey grounded the abortion right in an extreme…to draw the line objectively between persons and nonpersons.”<br />
<br />
The notion of the atomized individual made explicit in Casey enforces a state soteriology cherein salvation is only to be found in a social body of enemies. This religion of liberalism is inevitably totalitarian.<br />
Richard John Neuhaus 1996 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL572.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL572.cfm</a><br />
“This is most explicitly spelled out in the 1992 decision…the national creed established by the Constitution.”<br />

Grounding the abortion debate in a legal paradigm of rights creates a social body bound by nothing more than a mutual fear of death. Our bodies are not private, they are shared. The notion of inalienable rights reduces the sacredness of the body to a piece of property.<br />
Stanley Hauewas 1991 “abortion, Theologically Understood” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lifewatch.org/abortion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifewatch.org/abortion.html</a><br />
“Christians in America are temted to think of issues like abortion…the abortion issue our issue.”<br />

Life is a gift—not a supreme political value. The debate about when life begins obscures our obligation to bear witness to the kingdom of heaven. Our hospitality to children cannot be conditional—to welcome the others is to see the face of God.<br />
Hauerwas 1991<br />
“When many people start talking about abortions…everything else that we do and believe.”<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule the Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), decision that at the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, or the universe and of the mystery of human life.<br />
<br />
the function of the law is primarily pedagogical. the supreme court did not make abortions “legal” it made them socially acceptable without regret for the unborn. the plan is key – we must unteach this institution of hedonism.<br />

<br />
“For Glendon, the expressive…. …. by persons holding a plurality of views.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the reasoning in the casey decision should be overruled. the mystery passage obliterates any criterion for wrongess – making it impossible to oppose national socialism which paradoxically cripples the liberalism it attempts to uphold. the plan clears the space for A new politicalS grounded in a more complete conception of the human.<br />
Scaperlanda, 2K5. (Michael A., Gene and Elaine Edwards Family Chair in Law and Associate Dean for Research, University of Oklahoma College of Law. 55 Cath. U.L. Rev. 5 p.L/N)<br />
<br />
“What are these anthropological assumptions?..... thick conception of the human person.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
finally, Demarcations are inevitable – every position has an enemy – but the defining feature of a law rooted in God is that all enemies fall under the same category of being. Only in a paradigm of liberal humanism can the conditions for the subhuman arise<br />

And, our participation in Christ overcomes the aporias of will, power and difference. The only way to create a sovereignty no longer reliant on bloodshed is for political institutions and all of God’s children to be guided by the light of Christ. The self-giving exchange of the plan with China is necessary to reconcile all of us, despite nationhood, gender class, race and so on, in the harmony of the good. We must embrace the covenant even in the face of death.<br />

This is impact turned by the 1ac: the law in its current form is not something that should be preserved – the prevailing notions of legal positivism make any human behavior an acceptable content to the law. This renders law meaningless – all life can be excluded from the juridical order. Only the plan can infuse meaning into the law.<br />

We outweigh – a law rooted in God infuses the world with meaning.<br />
We are the only possibility of overcoming the nihilism and plagues the judicial order – (Rice) – if the law is not rooted in a recognition of God, any content is acceptable. This makes opposition to atrocities impossible because they can be written off as “One’s own conception of existence.” Only the 1ac establishes a criterion for wrongness – (Scaperlanda) – this means we are a pre-requisite for evaluating any of their impact claims.<br />
And, we are the precondition for an authentic human community.<br />

Observation One: the Mystery of Human Life<br />
The pro-choice ideology secured by the Casey decision grounds the law in a paradigm of secular rights-talk that eviscerates the very freedom it attempts to uphold by granting unlimited authority to the sovereign to make the decision on life. This promotion of the autonomous self necessitates the creation of the enemy “other” devastating the potential for authentic human community. Any coherent assertion of rights must be anchored in a recognition of God.<br />
Charles E. Rice 2005 3 Ave Maria L. Rev 259 l/n<br />
“For an assertion of rights to be fully coherent…insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned.” Justice is an empty signifier—the rights afforded by a secular reading of the Constitution invariably collapse in on themselves. This is why the “right to choose” simultaneously necessitates the “right to kill.” Legal positivism is moral relativism—any content is acceptable enabling endless wars and turning human beings into nothing more than “superior animals.” Only by grounding the law in an immortal destiny can there be a coherent basis for asserting transcendent rights of the person against the state.<br />
Rice 05<br />
“The above examples lead us to ask…Hitler is correct.” Freedom isn’t free. The conception of liberty made possible by the reasoning in the Casey decision attributes personhood to the ability to define one’s own moral universe. This serves as the foundation for the designation of the nonhuman—all life is exposed to the capacity to be deemed “insufficient.”=<br />
Jay Alan Sekulow and John Tuskey 40 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 945.<br />
“Second, Casey grounded the abortion right in an extreme…to draw the line objectively between persons and nonpersons.” The notion of the atomized individual made explicit in Casey enforces a state soteriology wherein salvation is only to be found in a social body of enemies. This religion of liberalism is inevitably totalitarian.<br />
Richard John Neuhaus 1996 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL572.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL572.cfm</a><br />
“This is most explicitly spelled out in the 1992 decision…the national creed established by the Constitution.” Grounding the abortion debate in a legal paradigm of rights creates a social body bound by nothing more than a mutual fear of death. Our bodies are not private, they are shared. The notion of inalienable rights reduces the sacredness of the body to a piece of property.<br />
Stanley Hauewas 1991 “abortion, Theologically Understood” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lifewatch.org/abortion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifewatch.org/abortion.html</a><br />

Observation two: the stories we tell the function of the law is primarily pedagogical. the supreme court did not make abortions “legal” it made them socially acceptable without regret for the unborn. the plan is key – we must unteach this institution of hedonism.<br />

A/T util:<br />
1. No link-ev is a criticism of Kantian deontology which the 1AC indicts as aesthetic humanism. Deontology is the defense of abortion in the status quo. This is our Rice evidence-we signal a radical break from those notions of autonomy “util good” doesn’t assume our framework for morality-it assumes a false choice between categorical imperatives and hedonism which our faith in God transcends<br />
2. Their framework is incoherent-begs the question “what is a human”. That’s our Neuhas evidence-all life is exposed to the capacity to be excluded from their utilitarian calculus which renders its saving potential pointless<br />
3. This is impact turned by our Rice evidence: reduces humans to superior animals<br />
4. we solve the terminal impact: utilitarianism places its orienting principle as the “common good” this is only coherent if we can figure a vision of the content to the good (rice and scaperlanda)<br />
<br />
Topicality:<br />
Counter interpretation: a topical affirmative should overrule the decision by rejecting the ratio decidendi<br />

Hickey ’98 (Justice Scalia, however, overvalued the weight of…ratio decidendi)<br />
<br />
<br />
Prefer this interpretation:<br />
A) Best for Casey-it’s a bidirectional decision-either no Casey aff meets their interp or a thousand do. We overrule the basis of the ruling-this gives the best ground-it was the bottom line in Casey<br />
