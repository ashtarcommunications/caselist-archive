<br />
The USA ……Could there be a clearer case for action?<br />
<br />
BUT – reaching an agreement on cotton would revive the talks:<br />
<br />
FIRST: spillover.<br />
<br />
it’s the most important impasse and would lay the groundwork for resolving all of the agricultural disputes.<br />
<br />
Pan et al 2007 (Suwen, Research Scientist, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, Cotton Economics Research Institute, Texas Tech University, “Cotton in a Free Trade World”, Economic Inquiry Vol. 45 Iss. 1, January, ProQuest)<br />
<br />
Cotton has been at the center of much of ……Egypt at 14 cents, Mexico at 8 cents, and 6 cents in Turkey.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SECOND – trade leadership.<br />
<br />
Cotton is the leading drain on US trade credibility. It must be resolved before the US can reasonably lead the Doha negotiations.<br />
<br />
Hall 08 (Joshua, Scott Beaulier, Profs at Beloit College Dept of Economics, Madeline Helling, Beloit College, Wisconsin, USA, and, “HIGH COTTON: WHY THE USA SHOULD NOT PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO COTTON FARMERS,” Economic Affairs, Volume 28, Issue 2, Pages 65-66)<br />
<br />
More important than saving Americans a few dollars …… potential losses to a well-entrenched minority of cotton producers.<br />
<br />
What’s more – US trade leadership in the WTO is necessary to keep the world on a multilateral track. Absent US credibility within multilateral negotiations, bilateral and regional trade agreements are inevitable and will take down the whole system.<br />
<br />
Even if preferential agreements are inevitable – as long as the US can support the multilateral regime, they aren’t problematic.<br />
<br />
Tarullo, 07 (Daniel, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, “The Case for Reviving the Doha Trade Round,” Center for American Progress, January, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/01/pdf/doha.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/01/pdf/doha.pdf</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">)<br />
<br />
Moreover, the legacies of unilateralism in U.S. foreign ……bilateral and multilateral arrangements.<br />
<br />
Striking a deal on cotton would enable the US to regain its trade leadership. The world is waiting.<br />

<br />
A US concession on cotton enable developing countries to make concessions on tariffs and NAMA. The plan ushers in new agreements in the Doha round.<br />

<br />
The good news is that the ……damage from not renewing fast track will fall on the U.S. alone.<br />

<br />
The SECOND INTERNAL LINK to global trade is COMPLIANCE.<br />

First – the upland cotton case renders the US out of compliance with WTO obligations<br />

Key findings include the following: (1) ……evaluated strictly in terms of the Peace Clause violation.<br />

The cotton case was clear and indisputable – it represents a key test of the WTOs ability to have its decisions enforced.<br />

The international development group ……The U.S. should see this ruling as an opportunity for reform.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">What’s more – compliance with WTO rulings is necessary not just to the credibility of the DSB, but to the WTO as a whole.<br />

<br />
Contention 2 is Trade<br />
<br />
FIRST – The WTO is on the brink of collapse. The continual breakdown of Doha negotiations and lack of judicial legitimacy threaten the relevance of the WTO.<br />
Blustein, 8-21 (Paul, Journalist in Residence, Global Economy and Development at The Brookings Institution, “Doha Trade Talks Collapse: What’s Next for Global Trade?,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0820_trade_blustein.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0820_trade_blustein.aspx</a>)<br />
<br />
The serious ramifications ……system’s health.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are two internal links to global trade:<br />
<br />
First – the Doha Negotiations<br />
<br />
If the Doha round fails, the WTO as an institution won’t be far behind. Absent the stability provided by the WTO, protectionist trade wars will break out, threatening the viability of the global economy.<br />
Ikenson, 06 (Daniel, Trade Policy Analyst at Cato, “The WTO After Hong Kong - Where Do We Go From Here,” February 14 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freetrade.org/node/710" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetrade.org/node/710</a>)<br />
<br />
Failure would produce an ……failure is not a viable option.<br />
<br />
BUT – despite the temporary setback at Geneva, there is still hope for the Doha. A renewed commitment from the US can finish the round before the end of the year.<br />
<br />
The Economist, 7-19 (“Defrosting Doha,” lexis)<br />
<br />
The chief reason for urgency ……have been put into deep freeze.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What’s more – the Geneva talks collapsed not because of SSM negotiations, but because the US refused to budge of cotton subsidies. The US engineered the collapse because it refused to let the cotton issue come to the table.<br />
<br />
Sharma, 08 (Devinder, food and trade policy analyst, “What Caused WTO Collapse? It Was Cotton Subsidies, Stupid?” Zmag, August 5, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.countercurrents.org/sharma050808.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.countercurrents.org/sharma050808.htm</a>)<br />
International media …… easily go on a Mediterranean cruise holiday.<br />
<br />
<br />
If left unresolved, the most recent cotton dispute at Geneva will end the Doha round forever.<br />

<br />
The collapse of the Mini-……nations attending the event.<br />
<br />
What’s more – the cotton dispute is representative for the WTO as a whole. Unless it gets resolved, the entire WTO system will lose authority.<br />
<br />
Pfeifer, Alpert, and Kripke, 04 (Kimberly, Gawain, and Emily, policy analysts for Oxfam and Senior Policy Advisor on international trade issues with Oxfam America and policy analyst for Oxfam America, “Finding the Moral Fiber”, Oxfam Briefing Paper 69, October, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/briefing_papers/cotton_brief101804/cotton_brief101804.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/briefing_papers/cotton_brief101804/cotton_brief101804.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The USA ……Could there be a clearer case for action?<br />
<br />
BUT – reaching an agreement on cotton would revive the talks:<br />
<br />
FIRST: spillover.<br />
<br />
it’s the most important impasse and would lay the groundwork for resolving all of the agricultural disputes.<br />
<br />
Pan et al 2007 (Suwen, Research Scientist, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, Cotton Economics Research Institute, Texas Tech University, “Cotton in a Free Trade World”, Economic Inquiry Vol. 45 Iss. 1, January, ProQuest)<br />
<br />
Cotton has been at the center of much of ……Egypt at 14 cents, Mexico at 8 cents, and 6 cents in Turkey.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SECOND – trade leadership.<br />
<br />
Cotton is the leading drain on US trade credibility. It must be resolved before the US can reasonably lead the Doha negotiations.<br />
<br />
Hall 08 (Joshua, Scott Beaulier, Profs at Beloit College Dept of Economics, Madeline Helling, Beloit College, Wisconsin, USA, and, “HIGH COTTON: WHY THE USA SHOULD NOT PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO COTTON FARMERS,” Economic Affairs, Volume 28, Issue 2, Pages 65-66)<br />
<br />
More important than saving Americans a few dollars …… potential losses to a well-entrenched minority of cotton producers.<br />
<br />
What’s more – US trade leadership in the WTO is necessary to keep the world on a multilateral track. Absent US credibility within multilateral negotiations, bilateral and regional trade agreements are inevitable and will take down the whole system.<br />
<br />
Even if preferential agreements are inevitable – as long as the US can support the multilateral regime, they aren’t problematic.<br />
<br />
Tarullo, 07 (Daniel, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, “The Case for Reviving the Doha Trade Round,” Center for American Progress, January, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/01/pdf/doha.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/01/pdf/doha.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Moreover, the legacies of unilateralism in U.S. foreign ……bilateral and multilateral arrangements.<br />
<br />
Striking a deal on cotton would enable the US to regain its trade leadership. The world is waiting.<br />
James, 06 (Sallie, trade policy analyst at CATO, “Agriculture and the Doha round,” July 14, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freetrade.org/node/249" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetrade.org/node/249</a>)<br />
<br />
If the recently tabled &quot;Draft Possible …… as a nation committed to free markets and opportunity for all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THIRD – enabling concessions.<br />
<br />
A US concession on cotton enable developing countries to make concessions on tariffs and NAMA. The plan ushers in new agreements in the Doha round.<br />
<br />
Bhagwati, 07 (Jagdish, Senior Fellow for International Economics, “Why the Trade Talks Collapsed,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/13730/why_the_trade_talks_collapsed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/13730/why_the_trade_talks_collapsed.html</a>)<br />
<br />
The good news is that the ……damage from not renewing fast track will fall on the U.S. alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
What’s more – a move of unilateral liberalization by the US would revive and fix the flawed WTO negotiating framework. It would propel negotiations forward.<br />

<br />
Second-generation reforms ……competition-enhancing domestic reforms.<br />
<br />
<br />
The SECOND INTERNAL LINK to global trade is COMPLIANCE.<br />
<br />
<br />
First – the upland cotton case renders the US out of compliance with WTO obligations<br />
Randy Schnepf, Specialist in Agricultural Policy Resources, Science and Industry Division, 2005 (July 11, &quot;Background on the U.S.-Brazil WTO Cotton Subsidy Dispute&quot;, CRS Report for Congress, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/57876.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/57876.pdf</a>)<br />
Key findings include the following: (1) ……evaluated strictly in terms of the Peace Clause violation.<br />
<br />
<br />
The cotton case was clear and indisputable – it represents a key test of the WTOs ability to have its decisions enforced.<br />
<br />

<br />
The international development group ……The U.S. should see this ruling as an opportunity for reform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Failure to comply with the cotton case threatens the judicial legitimacy of the WTO as a whole.<br />
<br />

<br />
Beyond its impact on the agricultural negotiations……agreement in the Doha Round.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What’s more – compliance with WTO rulings is necessary not just to the credibility of the DSB, but to the WTO as a whole.<br />
<br />
The US specifically must be seen as a compliant member or else the system will break down.<br />

<br />
Failure to comply with WTO ……maintenance of a strong World Trade Organization.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And – A strong DSU is critical to sustaining norms of international trade while reviving negotiations<br />

<br />
The United States likes to ……some recommendations for improvement.<br />
<br />
Compliance with judicial decisions are also necessary for negotiations to work – Doha can’t succeed unless the US starts complying with the DSB.<br />

And – the ensuing economic collapse causes nuke war<br />

Further - collapse of the WTO causes global thermonuclear war<br />

Failure would produce an ……failure is not a viable option.<br />
<br />
BUT – despite the temporary setback at Geneva, there is still hope for the Doha. A renewed commitment from the US can finish the round before the end of the year.<br />
<br />
The Economist, 7-19 (“Defrosting Doha,” lexis)<br />
<br />
The chief reason for urgency ……have been put into deep freeze.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What’s more – the Geneva talks collapsed not because of SSM negotiations, but because the US refused to budge of cotton subsidies. The US engineered the collapse because it refused to let the cotton issue come to the table.<br />
<br />
Sharma, 08 (Devinder, food and trade policy analyst, “What Caused WTO Collapse? It Was Cotton Subsidies, Stupid?” Zmag, August 5, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.countercurrents.org/sharma050808.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.countercurrents.org/sharma050808.htm</a>)<br />
International media …… easily go on a Mediterranean cruise holiday.<br />
<br />
<br />
If left unresolved, the most recent cotton dispute at Geneva will end the Doha round forever.<br />

<br />
The collapse of the Mini-……nations attending the event.<br />
<br />
What’s more – the cotton dispute is representative for the WTO as a whole. Unless it gets resolved, the entire WTO system will lose authority.<br />
<br />
Pfeifer, Alpert, and Kripke, 04 (Kimberly, Gawain, and Emily, policy analysts for Oxfam and Senior Policy Advisor on international trade issues with Oxfam America and policy analyst for Oxfam America, “Finding the Moral Fiber”, Oxfam Briefing Paper 69, October, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/briefing_papers/cotton_brief101804/cotton_brief101804.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/briefing_papers/cotton_brief101804/cotton_brief101804.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The USA ……Could there be a clearer case for action?<br />
<br />
BUT – reaching an agreement on cotton would revive the talks:<br />
<br />
FIRST: spillover.<br />
<br />
it’s the most important impasse and would lay the groundwork for resolving all of the agricultural disputes.<br />
<br />
Pan et al 2007 (Suwen, Research Scientist, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, Cotton Economics Research Institute, Texas Tech University, “Cotton in a Free Trade World”, Economic Inquiry Vol. 45 Iss. 1, January, ProQuest)<br />
<br />
Cotton has been at the center of much of ……Egypt at 14 cents, Mexico at 8 cents, and 6 cents in Turkey.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SECOND – trade leadership.<br />
<br />
Cotton is the leading drain on US trade credibility. It must be resolved before the US can reasonably lead the Doha negotiations.<br />
<br />
Hall 08 (Joshua, Scott Beaulier, Profs at Beloit College Dept of Economics, Madeline Helling, Beloit College, Wisconsin, USA, and, “HIGH COTTON: WHY THE USA SHOULD NOT PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO COTTON FARMERS,” Economic Affairs, Volume 28, Issue 2, Pages 65-66)<br />
<br />
More important than saving Americans a few dollars …… potential losses to a well-entrenched minority of cotton producers.<br />
<br />
What’s more – US trade leadership in the WTO is necessary to keep the world on a multilateral track. Absent US credibility within multilateral negotiations, bilateral and regional trade agreements are inevitable and will take down the whole system.<br />
<br />
Even if preferential agreements are inevitable – as long as the US can support the multilateral regime, they aren’t problematic.<br />
<br />
Tarullo, 07 (Daniel, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, “The Case for Reviving the Doha Trade Round,” Center for American Progress, January, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/01/pdf/doha.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/01/pdf/doha.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Moreover, the legacies of unilateralism in U.S. foreign ……bilateral and multilateral arrangements.<br />
<br />
Striking a deal on cotton would enable the US to regain its trade leadership. The world is waiting.<br />
James, 06 (Sallie, trade policy analyst at CATO, “Agriculture and the Doha round,” July 14, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freetrade.org/node/249" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetrade.org/node/249</a>)<br />
<br />
If the recently tabled &quot;Draft Possible …… as a nation committed to free markets and opportunity for all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THIRD – enabling concessions.<br />
<br />
A US concession on cotton enable developing countries to make concessions on tariffs and NAMA. The plan ushers in new agreements in the Doha round.<br />
<br />
Bhagwati, 07 (Jagdish, Senior Fellow for International Economics, “Why the Trade Talks Collapsed,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/13730/why_the_trade_talks_collapsed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/13730/why_the_trade_talks_collapsed.html</a>)<br />
<br />
The good news is that the ……damage from not renewing fast track will fall on the U.S. alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
What’s more – a move of unilateral liberalization by the US would revive and fix the flawed WTO negotiating framework. It would propel negotiations forward.<br />

Second-generation reforms ……competition-enhancing domestic reforms.<br />
<br />
<br />
The SECOND INTERNAL LINK to global trade is COMPLIANCE.<br />
<br />
<br />
First – the upland cotton case renders the US out of compliance with WTO obligations<br />
Randy Schnepf, Specialist in Agricultural Policy Resources, Science and Industry Division, 2005 (July 11, &quot;Background on the U.S.-Brazil WTO Cotton Subsidy Dispute&quot;, CRS Report for Congress, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/57876.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/57876.pdf</a>)<br />
Key findings include the following: (1) ……evaluated strictly in terms of the Peace Clause violation.<br />
<br />
<br />
The cotton case was clear and indisputable – it represents a key test of the WTOs ability to have its decisions enforced.<br />
<br />
Mekay, 05 (Emad, writer for the Inter Press Service (IPS), “Brazil Triumphs Over U.S. in WTO Subsidies Dispute,” Common Dreams, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0304-01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0304-01.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
The international development group ……The U.S. should see this ruling as an opportunity for reform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Failure to comply with the cotton case threatens the judicial legitimacy of the WTO as a whole.<br />
<br />
BENICCHIO, 05 (Romain, economist and a political adviser on trade for Oxfam International, based<br />
in Geneva, Switzerland. “The WTO ruling on the Brazil-US cotton dispute: Implications for African countries and agriculture Negotiations,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ictsd.net/downloads/2008/04/cotton_book_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ictsd.net/downloads/2008/04/cotton_book_en.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Beyond its impact on the agricultural negotiations……agreement in the Doha Round.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What’s more – compliance with WTO rulings is necessary not just to the credibility of the DSB, but to the WTO as a whole.<br />
<br />
The US specifically must be seen as a compliant member or else the system will break down.<br />

<br />
Failure to comply with WTO ……maintenance of a strong World Trade Organization.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And – A strong DSU is critical to sustaining norms of international trade while reviving negotiations<br />

<br />
The United States likes to ……some recommendations for improvement.<br />
<br />
Compliance with judicial decisions are also necessary for negotiations to work – Doha can’t succeed unless the US starts complying with the DSB.<br />

Farm policy participants ……to achieve all these ends.<br />
<br />
Next are the impacts to Free Trade.<br />
<br />
First - Failure to save the WTO guarantees the world splits into US and China trade blocs<br />

The United States should also renew its ……the more the global system retains its coherence.<br />
<br />
US-China trade disputes guarantees global economic depression and large scale conflict that escalates<br />

China is another matter. No sane figure ……deployed US forces on China’s borders have virtually no deterrent effect.<br />
<br />
And – the ensuing economic collapse causes nuke war<br />

<br />
<br />
As the collapse of the Western economies nears, ……destroy civilization as we know it, and perhaps most of the biosphere, at least for many decades.<br />
<br />
Further - collapse of the WTO causes global thermonuclear war<br />
Copley News Service, December 1, 1999<br />
For decades, many children in …… world trade. They should be celebrating it.<br />
<br />
And – multiple studies prove that free trade reduces the likelihood of conflict<br />
