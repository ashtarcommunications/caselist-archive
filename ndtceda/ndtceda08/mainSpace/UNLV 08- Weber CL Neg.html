 Globalization K<br />
<br />
Eliminating  subsidies is a fundamentally neo-liberal position. It is premised on the idea that enough globalization will inevitably help everyone. This ignores the fundamentally damaging undercurrents of the market which spurred subsidies in the first place.<br />

      “So what should…with neoliberal markets.”<br />
<br />
Even the 1ac’s framing of agricultural is inextricably rooted the belief in a natural rational market. Discussing food in terms of subsidies and commodities reduce farming to an industrial process with inputs and outputs, downplaying moral and human questions about food in the name of technical intricacies of policy.<br />

      “One needs to… life and peace”<br />
<br />
Triumph of neoliberalism causes commodification of life which makes all impacts thinkable and inevitable.<br />

<br />
      “Given today’s race…Europe or China”<br />
<br />
Globalization is a nihilism of self-extermination, the ultimate goal of capital is to create more capital through the commodification of the world. This commodification only serves to create non-reproducible objects that guarantees extinction.<br />

      “One Thing remains… ‘Global West End.’”<br />
<br />
The alt. is to align ourselves with democratic nationalism. This will allow effective resistance to globalization by localizing resistance to the multinationals that have taken over all agency.<br />

<br />
      “Democratic nationalism is… the other way.”<br />
<br />
The alt. is a support mechanism for agricultural peasant movements worldwide. Subsidies are a rallying cry for anti-globalization movements, the plan would undercut these movements while breathing new life into globalization. Only the alt. can muster an effective resistance to globalization while solving the muster an effective resistance to globalization while solving the problems of industrial agriculture.<br />

<br />
      “Fortunately, there are…inevitably negates life.”<br />
<br />
1st T violation<br />
<br />
Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies for biofuels, concentrated animal feeding operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar, and/or wheat.<br />
<br />
Violation: Plan does not eliminate nearly all of dairy subsidies.<br />
<br />
Voting Issues: This eliminates our PIC ground because we can’t run spec counterplans. Voter for competitive equity.<br />
<br />
2nd T violation<br />
<br />
Substantially reduce<br />
<br />
A) Substantially reduce is a 60% cut in the context of farm subsidies.<br />
<br />
      Bullington 2005 L/N<br />
<br />
And Agricultural support has 3 components: border measures, export subsidies and direct subsidies to farmers<br />
<br />
      World Bank trade Note 2003 “the wto creating a trading system for development “<br />
<br />
B) Plan has to reduce agricultural support, not subsidies, by 60% Substantially reduce modifies agricultural support in the resolution. Eliminating subsidies in 1 area will not substantially reduce agricultural support. Plan is only a slight modification in 1 area of agricultural support not a substantial reduction.<br />
<br />
Voting Issues<br />
<br />
1) the subject of the resolution is agricultural support not subsidies. Doing something in addition to eliminating subsidies is key to negative ground . there is very little evidence in support of keeping any of the listed subsidies in order to garner offense we need a change in other agricultural support structures .<br />
<br />
2) our interpretation allows affirmative flexibility while preserving ouor ctp and alt ground. The 3 pillars test checks back their predictability.
