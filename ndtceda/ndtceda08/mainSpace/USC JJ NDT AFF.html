Plan Text<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should substantially increase its assistance for Afghanistan’s prison if Afghanistan agrees to verifiably abide by international standards of humane treatment and judicial review.<br />
<br />
1ac w/ cites<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Prison Failure<br />
<br />
Afghanistan’s prison system is physically collapsing due to lack of international support for reconstruction<br />
Amnesty International, 7/8/03, “Afghanistan: Crumbling prison system desperately in need of repair” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amnesty/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amnesty</a> .org/en/library/info/ASA11/017/2003<br />
“Across Afghanistan, prisons are in poor condition, has no resources with which to create new facilities.”<br />
This failing infrastructure will ultimately collapse the Karzai government<br />
Scenario one: Taliban Recuritment<br />
<br />
Breeding grounds: poor infrastructure in Afghani prisons creates a militant breeding ground committed to overthrow the government<br />
Afghan Mania, 8/5/06 “Afghan’s notorious Pul-i-Charki – a pilot for prison reform,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afghanmania.com/en/new/0,news,4882,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.afghanmania.com/en/new/0,news,4882,00.html</a><br />
“Gen. Amirpoor says the prison authorities lack adequate equipment… International Development and Provincial Reconstruction Teams.”<br />
<br />
Escapes: as the conditions of afghani prisons continue to collapse, these radicalized prisons will escape<br />
The Times (United Kingdom) 2/23/08 “Wanted for empty prison: some convicted Afghan drug barons” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3420199.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3420199.ece</a><br />
“Lat year the CJTF processed 331 cases, convicting 278 people… the higher the risk of a security breach,” said one official involved in the new wing.”<br />
<br />
It’s empirically proven, the highest level Al Qaeda leaders have previously escaped from Afghani prisons<br />
Agence France Presse, 11/02/05, “Three senior Al-Qaeda leaders escaped Bagram prison: Pentagon official,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spacewar.com/2005/051102213051.jzqg43rf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacewar.com/2005/051102213051.jzqg43rf.html</a><br />
“Three senior al-Qaeda leaders escaped from a… speaking only on condition of anonymity.”<br />
<br />
Corruption: without resources, prison guards literally receive no pay, and the result in massive bribery and inept detention of high level suspects<br />
Amnesty international, 7/8/03, “Afghanistan: Crumbling prison system desperately in need of repair” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA11/017/2003" rel="nofollow">http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA11/017/2003</a><br />
“All law enforcement officials must be remunerated… extortion will continue to occur at all levels.”<br />
Scenario Two: Decentralization<br />
<br />
The lack of resources afghani prison system results in decentralized, non-uniform prison systems which are incapable of detaining insurgents<br />
Amnesty international, 7/8/03, “Afghanistan: Crumbling prison system desperately in need of repair” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA11/017/2003" rel="nofollow">http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA11/017/2003</a><br />
“The central government has little power outside… to provide shelter, hygiene and sustenance.”<br />
<br />
Coup results in nuclear takeover – Pakistan’s weapons are currently being maintained<br />
Ellison, 2007, “Pakistani Nuclear Arsenal” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=2966" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=2966</a><br />
“Pakistan is generally believed to store nuclear delivery… regime that created the Nuclear Command Authority.”<br />
<br />
This spillover to government legitimacy. Afghani rural populations are forced into local fund raising efforts to maintain their prison system, which strengthens regionalism and decreases the appeal of the Karzai government.<br />
Amnesty international, 7/8/03, “Afghanistan: Crumbling prison system desperately in need of repair” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA11/017/2003" rel="nofollow">http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA11/017/2003</a><br />
<br />
The Taliban use this regionalism as a critical way to sway support of locals away from the government<br />
Jones, 1/31/2007, “Afghanistan’s Local Insurgency” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rand.org/commentary/013107IHT.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rand.org/commentary/013107IHT.html</a><br />
“The rising violence and the near certainty of Taliban… and are preparing sustained operations.”<br />
<br />
The taliban’s success will be determined by local support<br />
Jones et. Al 2006 RAND, Pg. 91-92 “Securing Tyrants or Fostering Reform?”<br />
“The civilian support network, or auxiliary… and Jalaluddin Haqqani for the Taliban”<br />
<br />
Specifically, expansion of Taliban power splinters both Afghanistan and Pakistan resulting in an autonomous pashtun region causing an Islamic coup and war with India.<br />
Morgan 3/4/2007, “Better another Taliban Afghanistan, than a Taliban NUCLEAR Pakistan!?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.electricarticles.com/display.aspx?id=639" rel="nofollow">http://www.electricarticles.com/display.aspx?id=639</a><br />
“Although disliked and despised in many quarters… in a new Cold War with China and Russia pitted against the US.”<br />
<br />
The timeframe is immediate – Pakistan is on the brink<br />
Stanley Kurtz, 11/5/07 “Al-Qaedastan: Grim Possibilities for Pakistan” Assyrian International News Agency, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aina.org/news/20071105105023.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aina.org/news/20071105105023.htm</a><br />
“Even if Musharraf’s declaration of an emergency… bomb or two – within Osama’s reach.”<br />
<br />
Pakistan is the quickest scenario for global escalatory nuclear war<br />
Rosenbaum 11/29/2007 “Talkin’ World War III The return of the repressed” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.slate.ocm/id/2178792/pagenum/3/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.ocm/id/2178792/pagenum/3/</a><br />
“I don’t want to be alarmist (actually I do… nuclear control room is not an utterly unforeseeable nightmare.”<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Bagram<br />
<br />
The US will continue to push for enemy combatant label in afghani prisons as a precondition for transfer of detainees into afghani control<br />
Geoffrey Corn, 1/9/06 “The Afghanistan Detainee Transfer Challenge” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://lawofnations.blogspot.com/2006/01/afghanistan-detainee-transfer.html" rel="nofollow">http://lawofnations.blogspot.com/2006/01/afghanistan-detainee-transfer.html</a><br />
“Recent news reports indicate that the U.S. in pressing… and what procedures will it utilize?”<br />
<br />
Afghanistan refuses to accept this framework, and as a result, US funding for an expanded afghan prison system sits on hold<br />
New York Times, 1/7/08 “Foiling U.S. Plan, Prison Expands in Afghanistan” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.ocm/2008/01/07/world/asia/07bagram.html?pagewanted=print" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.ocm/2008/01/07/world/asia/07bagram.html?pagewanted=print</a><br />
“Bush administration officials have at times… Afghanistan would hold the detainees.”<br />
<br />
Afghanistan would say yes to the plan and the United States would shut down Bagram prison: the key hold up on afghani transfers is US assistance on the enemy combatant label being upheld by the Afghanis<br />
New York Times, 1/7/08 “Foiling U.S. Plan, Prison Expands in Afghanistan” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.ocm/2008/01/07/world/asia/07bagram.html?pagewanted=print" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.ocm/2008/01/07/world/asia/07bagram.html?pagewanted=print</a><br />
“The rising number of detainees at Bagram… trained recruits, Pentagon officials said.”<br />
<br />
The plan is necessary to shore up international support for the war on terrorism and support for international human rights law<br />
Van Hollen, “Missed Opportunities in Afghanistan and Beyond” 5/2/06 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://vanhollen.house.gov/HoR/MD08/Newsroom/Press+Release+by+Date/2006/03-02-06+Van+Hollen+Statement.htm" rel="nofollow">http://vanhollen.house.gov/HoR/MD08/Newsroom/Press+Release+by+Date/2006/03-02-06+Van+Hollen+Statement.htm</a><br />
““Moreover, the United States must end… we can and should do better – much better.””<br />
<br />
Because Bagram is institutionally failing, the United States will inevitably be forced to transfer prisoners back to Guantanamo, massively inflating anti-American sentiment<br />
New York Times 2/26/06, “A Growing Afghan Prison Rivals Bleak Guantanamo” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/international/26bagram.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/international/26bagram.html</a><br />
“Until now, military officials at both… would stoke international criticism.”<br />
<br />
This destroys the war on terrorism – strong US international appeal convinces moderates away from extremism and is necessary for international intelligence cooperation<br />
Nye 2004 “Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics” Carnegie Council<br />
“We will not prevail in this struggle… wage this struggle against terrorism.”<br />
<br />
European intelligence sharing is necessary to prevent an attack on the United States<br />
National Prospect April 2003, “Why We Need Europe” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewPrint&amp;articleId=6764" rel="nofollow">http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewPrint&amp;articleId=6764</a><br />
“But the most striking and by far… time of unprecedented national peril.”<br />
<br />
The Impact is nuclear war<br />
Kirkus Reviews 1999 LN<br />
“Terrorism is nothing new. Fanatical… This is simply unacceptable doggerel.”<br />
<br />
As a result, the United States plans to close bagram military base as a detention center have been halted<br />
