New Cards: <br />
Human dignity a priori outweighs – it’s a fate worse than death and is the root cause and justification for all modern evils<br />
David Berube, Associate Director for Nanoscience and Technology Studies at USCarolina, 93, (www.cla.sc.edu/ENGL/faculty/berube/prolong.htm)<br />
Assuming we were able to...evil's most powerful weapon<br />
<br />
Ethanol subsides are an inefficient burden on the taxpayer<br />
Hymel, Heritage Ecnomic Policy Studies Research Institute, 10/16/2002 <br />
[Erin, &quot;Ethanol Producers Get a Handout from Consumers,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/EnergyandEnvironment/bg1603.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/Research/EnergyandEnvironment/bg1603.cfm</a>]<br />
The ethanol mandate amounts...increases at the pump<br />
<br />
Government coercion destroys human dignity and cannot be justified <br />
Tibor Machan, Professor of philosophy, Auburn University, 1995<br />
(PRIVATE RIGHTS AND PUBLIC ILLUSIONS, 1995, p. 68-9.)<br />
All governmental action... some worthy goal<br />
<br />
Reject subsidies as an improper role of government - it is necessary to evaluate the moral questions of our argument prior to consequences<br />
Peter Schwartz, Ayn Rand Institute Chairman &amp; The Intellectual Activist Founder, 1989<br />
[“On Moral Sanctions,” The Intellectual Activist, v. V, No. 1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_sanctions" rel="nofollow">http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_sanctions</a>]<br />
Moral judgement and not...and can offer no value <br />

 Contention 1 is Food Security:<br />
<br />
US biofuel subsidies are the key factor in creating a food security crisis – this is resulting in a protectionist backlash from civil unrest that will multiply the impacts of high food prices<br />
Runge and Senauer, 5/28/2008<br />
[C. Ford and Benjamin, &quot;How Ethanol Fuels the Food Crisis,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080528faupdate87376/c-ford-runge-benjamin-senauer/how-ethanol-fuels-the-food-crisis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080528faupdate87376/c-ford-runge-benjamin-senauer/how-ethanol-fuels-the-food-crisis.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Scenario 1: Starvation<br />
<br />
Food insecurity will cause nearly 3 billion people to starve and massively entrench poverty<br />
Runge and Senauer, May/June 2007<br />
[C. Ford, U. Minnesota Applied Economics and law professor, and Benjamin, Food Industry Center co-director, &quot;How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor,&quot; Foreign Affairs, l/n]<br />
<br />
This price spike guarantees famines resulting in starvation and death – even if the plan only slows down this price spike it solves and prevents massive social unrest<br />
Natsios, 5/14/2008<br />
[Andrew, &quot;Global Food Crisis,&quot; Lexis, Congressional Testimony]<br />
<br />
No risk of a turn – High prices don’t help third world farmers – protectionist backlash checks the benefits of trade and it does nothing for the billions starving<br />
Runge and Senauer, October 2007<br />
[C. Ford and Benjamin, “Food for Fuel?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070901faresponse86512/tom-daschle-c-ford-runge-benjamin-senauer/food-for-fuel.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070901faresponse86512/tom-daschle-c-ford-runge-benjamin-senauer/food-for-fuel.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Prioritize starvation impacts even if it leads to extinction<br />
LaFollette, 2003<br />
[Hugh, &quot;World Hunger,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stpt.usf.edu/hhl/papers/World.Hunger.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.stpt.usf.edu/hhl/papers/World.Hunger.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
Scenario 2: International Instability<br />
This spike in food prices is sparking international unrest resulting in the worst violations of human dignity and a mass backlash sparking in international instability<br />
Spiegel, 4/14/2008<br />
[&quot;The Fury of the Poor,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,druck-547198,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,druck-547198,00.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Food crisis causes billions to starve, destroying human dignity, and causing global civilization collapse<br />
Sheeran, UN WFP (World Food Programme) Executive Director, 7/30/2008<br />
[Josette, &quot;Food Prices,&quot; Congressional Testimony,&quot; Lexis]<br />
<br />
This also makes disad impacts inevitable – international instability from food prices will trigger global conflict, disease spread, and economic, and political collapse<br />
Winnail, 1996<br />
[Douglas S., “On the Horizon: Famine,” September/October, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.kurtsaxon.com/foods004.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kurtsaxon.com/foods004.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
Text: The United States Federal Government should eliminate domestic subsidies for biofuel, eliminate the ethanol mandate, and eliminate the biofuel tariff.<br />
<br />
Contention Two is Solvency:<br />
<br />
World Bank Study proves US push for biofuels responsible for 75% jump in food prices- diverts grain from food stocks, takes land out of food production, and encourages speculation<br />
Chakrabortty, The Guardian Lead Economics Writer, 7-4-8<br />
(Aditya,&quot; Secret report: biofuel caused food crisis; Internal World Bank study delivers blow to plant energy drive,&quot; The Guardian)<br />
[<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy</a>]<br />
<br />
Biofuels are the key lever – even if other factors are driving food prices, changing biofuel production is the only realistic policy that can change food prices<br />
Martin, 5/15/2008<br />
[Andrew, &quot;Fuel Choices, Food Crises and Finger-Pointing,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/business/worldbusiness/15food.html?pagewanted=print" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/business/worldbusiness/15food.html?pagewanted=print</a>]<br />
<br />
Ending subsidies will effectively turn this lever – cutting subsidies ends the ethanol craze<br />
Yacobucci, 3/28/2008<br />
[Brent D., Fuel , Ethanol: Background and Public Policy Issues, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RL33290.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RL33290.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
US subsidy policy is the core reason for status quo ethanol production and prices<br />
Runge, University of Minnesota Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy Director, and Senauer, Applied Economics Professor, May/June 7<br />
[C.Ford, U. Minnesota Applied Economics and law professor, and Bejamin, Food Industry Center co-director, &quot;How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor,&quot; Foreign Affairs, 1/n]<br />
<br />
Quick Fixes won't do- a fundamental shift in US biofuel subsidies is key to providing long-term food security- the alternative is escalating unrest and instability in third world nations<br />
Testlik, CFR Assistant Editor, 5/28/2008<br />
