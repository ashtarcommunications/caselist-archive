SUPREME COURT PIK<br />

First, the affirmative must justify their discursive framing in this round before their specific strategy can be evaluated. Our strategic frames analysis is necessary to deconstruct dominant societal structures and to generate effective social and political solutions<br />

<br />
Second, using the name “Supreme Court” sets the court up as the final word which trumps all other views—it is supremacist language<br />

Metaphors are bad—read a plethora of cards<br />

<strong>Turn-misdirection—metaphors misdirect attention from the root cause of problems—we get caught up in the metaphor.<br />

Framework**<br />
<br />
Debate is best conceived of in terms of a competing dialogue- the creation of a “counter-word” to accompany the “word” is necessary to create genuine understanding:<br />
<br />
Bahktin, Russian philosopher and novelist, quoted in 1990 (Ed. Biz/ell and Herzberg, <em>The Rhetorical Tradition,</em> pg. 944)<br />
“we have already had occasion.....verbal intercourse endows a word with the light of meaning.”<br />
<br />
Fairness/generic framework theory args<br />
<br />
Fairness norms are critical to fostering an effective dialogic—abandoning them undermines pluaralism and diversity.<br />
<br />
Star Muir, prof. of speech communication @ George Mason Univ., 1993. (Philosophy and rhetoric, vol. 26; pg. 290-291).<br />
<br />
Dialogic role playing is key to tolerance and empathy<br />
<br />
Same Muir article<br />
“The first response to the charge of relativism....effort to gain such insight.”<br />
<br />
Oppositional discourses stop otherization and genocide: turns the case<br />

Douglas Ehninger, prof. of speech and comm.. at U. of Iowa, 1970 (Speech Monographs, vol. 37; 110)<br />

Arguing only from personal conviction leads to hedonism and the silencing of marginalized points of view—a switch side model is best to promote positive values.<br />

Hicks and Greens, 2000 ( Argument at Century’s End: Reflecting on the Past and Envisioning the Future, ed. By Hollihan, 2000; 303-304)<br />
“Day’s rejection of the administrative....self-interest and authoritative tradition.”<br />
<br />
The requirement that both sides of the topic be debated is the best way to create real world social change throughout a person’s life—we challenge the approach they take to the activity itself.<br />
<br />
From the same Muir Article<br />
“A second objection to debate.....into success on the job.”<br />
<br />

Consciousness is only raised through dialogic interaction—they don't solve for consciousness raising<br />

“a judicial decision.. as precedent.”<br />
<br />
b. the holding defines the court’s determinations of matters of law: same source:<br />
“holding… of the court’s judgment in the case.”<br />

<br />
“held… segregation violations.”<br />
<br />
