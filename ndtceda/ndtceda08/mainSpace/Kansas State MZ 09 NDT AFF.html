Sallie James “Milking the customers the high cost of U.S. dairy policies.” 11-9-6<br />
“WTO commitments to reduce export subsidies as well as domestic support…and significant market distortions.”<br />
All dairy subsidies should be abolished – this solves trade, the economy, and us dairy producers. Eliminating all subsiides sends a strong signal to our trade partners, and solves for food security<br />
James<br />
“Even in the absence of a successful outcome from the doha…from sources abroad.”<br />
Us dairy producers are increasingly reliant on exports – without export demand there would be a financial crisis and collapse of the dairy industry. The us must remove export subsidies in order to ensure us dairy farmers access to the world market which is key to the future of the us dairy industry<br />

“Moves by the European Union…protectionism around the world.”<br />
Sending a signal to stop dairy subsidies now is critical to stop a tit for tat trade war ending in global depression<br />
Andrew james 1-26-9 “dairy subsidies threaten repeat of 1930s”<br />

Us failure to reduce subsidies stop s a us-eu negotiation to reduce subsidies across the board<br />

“War, needless to say…becomes prohibitively expensive.”<br />
China advantage<br />
Us dairy at a crossroads – growth in dairy consumption in china represents new exports opportunities – however, government intervention into the dairy sector distorts market signals and discourages producers, stalling global dairy competitiveness and foreclosing access to new markets – sector liberalization now is critical<br />
David Balyney “U.S. Dairy at a global crossroads.”<br />
“Most dairy sectors worldwide, including the U.S. sector, have been…prices accompanying trade liberalization.”<br />
Now is key – the recent tainted milk scanadal will spike milk prices<br />
