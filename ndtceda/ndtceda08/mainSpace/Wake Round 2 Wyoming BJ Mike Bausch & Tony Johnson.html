 CONTENTION ONE: THE SYSTEM IS DIEING WITHOUT THE PLAN THE TRANSITION LEADS TO EXTINCTION <br />
<br />
FIRST, A TRANSITION FROM CAPITALISM IS INEVITABLE AS THE SYSTEM WILL SOON BE IN IT’S DEATH-THROES—THERE’S NOTHING LEFT TO EXPLOIT, STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS COMING, PARASITIC CAPITAL IS RAMPANT AND IDEOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS ARE COLLAPSING<br />
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 1995<br />
[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, wyo] <br />
<br />
AND, WE SHOULD PRAY THE TRANSITION DOES COME, CURRENT GROWTH IS ENVIRONMENTALLY UNSUSTAINABLE: WARMING, ENERGY, WATER, FISH, BIODIVERSITY LOSS, GENERAL OVERSHOOT, CAPITAL HAS EXCEEDED ITS LIMIT FOR REGENERATION<br />
John Bellamy Foster, University of Oregon, “Organizing the Ecological Revolution,” THE MONTHLY REVIEW v. 57 n. 5, October 2005. Available from the World Wide Web at: <strong>www.monthlyreview.org/1005jbf.htm</strong>, accessed 4/12/06.<br />
<br />
AND, DIVORCING OURSELVES FROM THE VIOLENT STRUCTURES OF CAPITALISM MAY CAUSE VIOLENCE, BUT IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT LONG TERM EXTINCTION, THE SOONER THE BETTER.<br />

<br />
AND, CLAIMS OF CAPITALISM’S HISTORICAL INEVITABLITY ARE LIES—APOLOGISTS FOR CAPITALISM DISTORT AN IDEALIZED MODEL FOR AN ETERNAL SYSTEM, DAMNING US ALL TO EXTINCTION.<br />

And, We are on the brink of collapse—unemployment, housing, credit crisis. <br />

Contention 2: A Historical Examination of Agrarian Capital: <br />
<br />
First, American capitalism was born out of the agricultural tradition. In spite of its early free market ambitions, however, cap today has been re-articulated into an ideology of contradictions and transgression necessary to maintain its dominance, guaranteeing labor exploitation, starvation, and environmental destruction.<br />
Wood, 1998 <br />
Co-editor of the Monthly Review) Ellen Meiskins. The Agrarian Origins of Capitalism. Monthly Review, Vol. 50, July-August 1998<br />
<br />
Capitalisms hold on American Agriculture began in the early 1700’s with regional agrarian development and marketing which left folks with the choice between the trade system or poverty—farmers were neglected to their position at the bottom of hierarchical division of labor. <br />
Martin Bruegel, the Institute National de la Recherche Agronomique, Laboratoire de Recherche sur la Consommation, The Social Relations of Farming in the Early American Republic : A Microhistorical Approach.” Journal of Early Republic, 2006 MUSEwyoT.<br />
<br />
And, Modern Capitalism is no different-Agricultural Subsidies only go to the rich such as: Scottie Pippen, the Rockefeller family, even Kenneth Lay-The inequitable distribution of wealth is pushing laborers to the bottom wrung into poverty<br />
Andrew CASSEL, 5-6-2002 &quot;Why US Farm Subsidies Are Bad for the World&quot;, <br />
<br />
<br />
THUS TONY AND I BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH THE TOPIC IS TO ADVOCATE A MATERIALIST INQUIRY INTO THE RESOLUTION BY STANDING IN SOLIDARITY WITH LABOR AGAINST THE STRUCTURAL FORCES OF CAPITAL.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CONTENTION THREE: THE IMPACT<br />
<br />
<br />
Subpoint A. The Umbrella<br />
The Determinism of Capital is responsible for the instrumentalization of all life-it is this logic that mobilizes and allows for all the da impacts in the first place<br />

Capitalism Dooms us to eco-doom and extinction<br />

<br />
Subpoint B Arms Race and Space Mil<br />
American Capitalism dirving the militarization of space, risking accidental nuclear war.<br />
Independent Media Center 2003<br />
<br />
And accidental launch kills billions<br />
PR Newswire 98<br />
<br />
Subpoint C Democracy<br />
Capitalism Precludes Democracy-must be eliminated to realize real progressive politics<br />
Kovel 2002<br />
<br />
and Progressive Democracy is k2 solve extinction of the planet<br />
Martin 99<br />
<br />
Subpoint D is Genocide<br />
Capitalism Moetarizes and commodifies existence-it is the logic of genocide<br />
Kovel 2002<br />
<br />
and Genocide is the ultimate crime-it eats away at civilization and erodes institutions risking global conflict<br />
Campbell 2001<br />
<br />
Subpoint E Poverty<br />
Capitalism and Poverty are intrinsic: the distribution of wealth justifies a class without food or safe water systems living off of 2 dollars a day<br />
Magdoff, and Magdoff 2005<br />

Poverty makes Global Nuclear War Inevitable<br />

Contention 4 Time to get Dirty<br />
First Agriculture Monopolizes the means of production-our aff uncovers the historical and structural implications of capital on the farmer-as a way of disabling the system of its power<br />
Bruegel 2006<br />
<br />
<br />
And, historically intellectuals specifically students have made monumental changes in political and social structures within government-we can unite and initiate working class movements from this space <br />
Hobshawn 2007<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Uniting with Labor is Key-Embracinga historical mission to overthrow capitalism is the only way to organize powerful clusters to overthrow the machine<br />
Avakian 99<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The rise of capitalism is intrincially connected to the Agrarian transformation that incorporated soil into capital-a commodity to be used and abused any analysis that doesn't include the material connection between nature and capital fails to solve the collapse<br />
Moore and Clark 2004<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Procedural Limitations on Knowledge Production are an attempt to induce sovereign discipline, shutting off critical inquiry our offense precedes this argument<br />
