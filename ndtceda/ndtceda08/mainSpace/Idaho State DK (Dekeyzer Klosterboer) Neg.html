<strong><u>1NC</u></strong><br />
The 1NC is a performative act in which there is a psychiatrist and patient are in a counseling session. The patient is trying to discuss a dream in which his body was divided into two parts, a red part and a blue part (Symbolic of Red States and Blue States). The psychiatrist argues that we can’t start start with the beginning. We must focus on the end..The psychiatrist begins to ask the patient about how he feels, but never really attempts to address the issues at had (This is a critical part of their argument. They advocate that we revel in the atrocity of abortion; rather than provide a proscriptive model, such as a policy, to address the issues) The psychiatrists then goes on to make an argument that the superiority of one over another is embedded in faith –based ethics.<br />
The 1NC also critiques the necessity of scientific determinations as the basis of political and ethical calculations. They analogize the 1AC to the constructs of human as robots, or Terminators. When the notion that science can serve as the basis of determinations (i.e. the 1AC’s claim that science proves that life begins at conception) individuals become cyborgs and lose a sense of individuality and essence.<br />
After continuing what appears to be a tautological dialogue between the patient and the psychiatrists, she then claims that the problem is his penis. He denies the fact that his penis is the issues, but then refers to his dream. He speaks of how in his dream he looked down at his penis and it was black and divided into nine parts that controlled his body (Supreme Court = 9 parts that control the Blue and Red States). In order to resolve the issue, the psychiatrists say that they have to become puppets and haunted by the loss of life. She then proceeds to pull of her sock and give it to the patient. He puts it on his hand and speaks of how the 1AC is the problem.<br />
<strong><u>Block</u></strong><br />
The negative block presents a clearer advocacy. First, he clarifies the alternative, which is to vote negative for no reason. This act will allow for one to revel in the abject nature of abortions and break free form the reliance of politics to resolve psychological issues such as abortion. The plan is the penis and it must be severed to restore the body. Debate is a constant confrontation with the abject that must be rejected. We must learn to cope with the abject, rather than simply try to rid the abject.<br />
Key Arguments<br />
1) Construction of Harms Scenario<br />
2) Abortion is a psychological issue that the affirmative misrepresents<br />
3) Trying to resolve the abject leads to the formation of the other<br />

The legal system and its representations are bad. We must “play” and reject the “skin of the dog.” We should not look at people as legal bodies that cannot recognize differences, rather we should let things appear as they are. Talk about a dream that we had. It was a scene of a physchiatrist’s office and they discuss what his dream means. They then defend that the “play” style of debate is best. Must view the world as children with no biases. Reference agamben and Shapiro<br />
