Case Args:<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
Scopic Projection<br />
A. Scopic projection turns the affirmative into a micro-panopticon:<br />
1.They see what they see in Detroit and then relate those images to create a visual map of Detroit and segregation.<br />
<br />
2. Their descriptions of what they have seen are spectatorship in this debate even if they are not spectactors when residing in Detroit. They are not in Detroit right now – in fact they are in a plush hotel room at quite a comfortable distance from the images they paint.<br />
<br />
3. They are SCOPIC – they have a SCOPIC STARTING POINT. They use Milliken to scope the district issue in Detroit and draw a map of how the lines separating the districts have generated a portrait of frustration, destruction, and poverty.<br />
<br />
B. The heart of Darkness beats, but they cannot hear it; rather, they walk through the heat of darkness and try to visualize its arteries.<br />
<br />
Kimberly Devlin 2006 (MFS Modern Fiction Studies 52.1 (2006) 19-41<br />
<br />
2. Regardless of their arguments about the Other – they visualize this relationship like marlow does in Heart of Darkness<br />
<br />
[ibid]<br />
<br />
3.Visual methods turns the case – enhances marginalization. This is not a victumization argument, but an argument that descriptions of appearance cannot effectuate predictable change through the law<br />
Hibbitts 1994 16 Cardozo L. Rev. 229<br />
<br />
Alt: Aural Priority<br />
<br />
Economy of Literacy:<br />
<br />
The affirmative operates within institutions which promote literacy as a marker of identity formation. This economy of literacy has become a racialized identity – one which literacy is considered to be white property. This whiteness now pervades every aspect of our society and directs the way in which law operates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Prendergast 2003[Catherine, Literacy and Racial Justice: The Politics of Learning after Brown.]<br />
<br />
Link: The affirmative conflates integration and equality in a dangerous way that ultimately bolsters the ideology of white surpremacy. Equating integration with equality centralizes the economy of literacy in whiteness since the underlying premise of desegregation is the assumption that proximates contact with white bodies is a prerequisite to quality education fro children of color.<br />
<br />
Bell 2001 [Derrick, What Brown v. Board of Education Should have Said.]<br />
<br />
Impactthe affirmative’s well intentioned efforts to percolate the white space of the economy of literacy ultimately fails. Not only does radical justice come to a halt because of perbasive nature of whiteness but the case is actually turned because one a literacy environment becomes percolated it devalues in worth.<br />

THE AFFIRMATIVE PRESENTS A NARRATIVE IN WHICH THE ABUSES OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MARK AN EXCEPTIONAL EVENT, A REIGN OF LAWLESS VIOLENCE BY AN UNCHECKED EXECUTIVE – THEIR DIAGNOSIS… RESTORE HABEAS CORPUS SO THAT ALL WILL BE WELL AGAIN IN LAW’S KINDDOM. THIS NARRATIVE IGNORES HOW THE SO-CALLED ABUSES ARE NOT VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW – THEY ARE PART OF ITS NORMAL WORKINGS. THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND THE BROAD POWERS IT ALLOWS ARE PART OF THE NORMAL FUNCTIONING OF THE LAW NOT A MARK OF ITS ABSENCE. THIS FATAL NAIVETE WHITEWASHES THE ROLE OF LAW<br />

Gender Adv:<br />
Defense against extinction – threatening disease is paradoxically the practice of defending life, ie. The biological existence of the species, from life itself – ie the uncontrollable life of the virus. Our argument is not a denial of the danger of disease – rather, our argument is about the way that the discourse of disease is formed and utilized in contemporary politics. US policy has merged the discourse of bioterrorism and disease, creating a militarized war on disease, no matter its origin. This is a particular ontological understanding of war and threats to life itself that is inseparable from biopolitics.<br />
Eugene Thacker, Assistant Professor in the School of Literature, Communication, and Culture at the Georgia Institute of Technology, 2005, Culture Machine, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://culturemachine.tees.ac.uk/Articles/thacker.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://culturemachine.tees.ac .uk/Articles/thacker.htm__</a>, accessed.<br />
No one will deny the real threats….of the ‘fable of the belly.’<br />
Biopolitics turns you DA – biopolitical solutions to desease are self-fulfilling prophecies that engender their own legitimacy precisely by furthering the conditions of disease that they claim necessitate them. Biopolitics makes disease inevitable.<br />
Eugene Thacker, Assistant Professor in the School of Literature, Communication, and Culture at the Georgia Institute of Technology, 2005, Culture Machine, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://culturemachine.tees.ac.uk/Articles/thacker.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://culturemachine.tees.ac .uk/Articles/thacker.htm__</a>, accessed.<br />

In contrast to other areas…current environmental legislation.<br />
Labeling China as a threat is the discursive practice that engages in the violent representations of Otherness. It dichotomizes the West and China as self and other and serves to increase US hegemonic dominance.<br />
Pan, Faculty of Arts in the Dept of Political Science and International Relations at the Australia National U, 2004. [Chengxin, Alternatives 29 (2004), “The ‘China Threat’ in American Self-Imagination: the Discursive Construction of Other as Power Politics, p. 310]<br />
Iin the following sections…U.S. self-imagination.<br />
Link – Security<br />
The emphasis on security reinforces American self-imagination and automatically allows China to be constructed as a threat.<br />

The (neo)realist emphasis on survival…an uncertainty, and hence, a threat.<br />
The power to secure life from the ever-present apocalypse mobilizes the conditions necessary for a “total” war against alterity.<br />

The United States Supreme Court should rule that &lt;insert case here&gt; lacks precedential value because it only applies narrowly to the facts of the case. We reserve the right to clarify intent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The counterplan solves the case - distinguishing a case to its facts has the same precedential effects as overruling. The difference is solely in perception.<br />

a. while the aff will frame our distinction as trivial - it really is these littlest of details which determine our everyday language - the definite article &quot;the&quot; before united states supreme court perpetuates geopower in that it fixes identity to a cartographic inscription of the state<br />

b. geopower is at the heart of the imperial nation-state - iraq is simply an imaginary cartographic inscription - an arbitrary area of land set aside for conquest - in the same regard all genocides, war, and other forms of violence are the inevitable result of this violent cartography.<br />

A. Uniqueness: Roberts is setting the tone for narrow opinions and avoiding controversial issues - a perception of genuine adherence to minimalism is critical to prevent a swing into constitutional conservativism.<br />

1. Overruling after a change in membership would devastates Roberts' ability to hold the line on minimalism. A newly politicized court will split into blocs and ignore stare decisis.<br />
