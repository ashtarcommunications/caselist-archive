Pedagogy<br />
A. Oppression is not just carried out through the sword, but also in our methods of knowing and interaction with world<br />
<br />
1. The affirmative is a pedagogy of the oppressor. There are several important characteristics of the plan that doom it to failure. The plan is the banking method; its top down - fighting for the people, not with the people. And the pan was not produced in dialogue. Freire, 1970 (Pedagogy of the Oppressed)<br />
<br />
2. The affirmative's investigation of the oppressed renders them as object. This mechanized approach prescribes predetermined solutions. The impact is a deadly objectification resulting in the death of life. Freire, 1970 (Pedagogy of the Oppressed)<br />
<br />
3. Reformist society is a larger project of conquest, manipulation, and economic hegemony - it always re-inscribes its power in an attempt to establish anti-dialogical approaches. Revolution must occur outside of this spectrum. Freire, 1970 (Pedagogy of the Oppressed)<br />
<br />
4. The aff employs the myth of oppressor generosity but this approach keeps the oppressed passive and enables their conquest. Freire, 1970 (Pedagogy of the Oppressed)<br />
<br />
B. Our alternative: Negative the affirmative politics in favor of a pedagogy of the oppressed which places a priority on dialgoue and education<br />
<br />
1. Conversion to the cause of liberation must begin with a complete rebirth and displacement of old ways - failure to do so results in fatalism. Freire, 1970 (Pedagogy of the Oppressed)<br />
<br />
2. The kritik will solve the case. Dialogue with farmers does not negate helping them. Its the aff's method that results in social control because the help they bring does not prioritize dialogue and reciprocity. Denis Goulet, 1997 (Introduction to Paulo Freire's Education for Critical Consciousness, p. vii
