<br />
Now the 1AC redux –<br />
[Pull all references to violence and war out of 1AC]<br />
<br />
Notice anything?<br />
<br />
LOOK AT WHAT WE’VE BECOME.<br />
Debate has become a culture of death. Every round has become the same thing, we sit around and fantasize over the end of the world; this round will be no different. Don’t let the affirmative dupe you, they are just as invested the fetishization of the end of the world as the rest of the debate community is.<br />
<br />
<strong>The state use of apocalyptic rhetoric makes suffering the only measure of social value. The state remedies this by making us believe that the remedy is dreams of freedom and happiness and a miraculous new beginning as Stewart and Hardin explain in 99</strong><br />
<br />
(“Bad Endings: American Apocalypsis” Kathleen Stewart; Susan Harding Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 28. (1999), pp. 285-310.)<br />
<br />
Now let me ask you, have your scenarios from last year come true yet? What about your politics disads? Hmmmm, neither? It seems strange that we should sit around in a room, secluded from the outside world and pretend that we have all of the answers<br />
<br />
<strong>Debate has become a spectator sport where instead of fostering critical thinking and deliberation skills it has created detachment from society and political apathy. Debate becomes a laboratory where we can test new ideas but it also fortifies itself from real world discourse. The perfect example of this detachment is in times of large-scale human suffering debaters can only think of it through the realm of how it will tidy up the uniqueness on their India Deal DA</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Mitchell in 98</strong><br />
(Mitchell, Gordon R. &quot;Pedagogical possibilities for argumentative agency in academic debate.&quot; <em>Argumentation &amp; Advocacy</em> 35, no. 2 (Fall98 1998): 41. <em>Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete</em>, EBSCO<em>host</em> (accessed September 23, 2008).)<br />
<br />
<br />
Debate is about body counts. The dehumanization inherent in the way that we construct impact scenarios reduces all life to numbers. This reduction of life to numbers is a way of justifying the continual expenditure of life.<br />
<br />
You miss the point of the topic. Agricultural subsidies lead to global nuclear war? Seriously? We think that the topic should be about the merits of whether or not agricultural subsidies should be cut, not the amount of bodies you can pile up in one round. When was the last time any farming policy lead to a global nuclear holocaust? Sure you have evidence that is strung together to support your scenarios, but no one person writes an entire impact scenario. This is also the reason that there are so few economic downturn leads to nuclear war cards on the circuit – it’s because it’s a highly unlikely and empirically denied argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>We pretend to save the world every round which locks us into “pure war” which forecloses the possibility of working to help the problems we talk about. “Pure war” refers to the paradoxical state where we know we will die from some catastrophic event but we perpetually have to convince ourselves that we can someway save ourselves. Pure war renders us in an endless state of absolute destruction</strong><br />

<br />
[We will defend this statement as our “alternative”]:<br />
We think that you, as the judge, should utilize your ballot to vote down those who perpetuate debate’s continual obsession with violence. This continual obsession with our extinction scenarios only props up walls that prevent us from real political action and continue the dehumanization in the objectification of mass death.<br />
<br />
We as college students can only act as we know how to – solely as college students. We think that we shouldn’t be disillusioned like we are the government. We shouldn’t believe that the United States Federal Government will actually do something after this round, because it won’t. We think that the affirmative must defend their plan but also the discourse surrounding their plan because the two are inseparable.<br />

<ol><ol><li>Thus the alternative comes from Donna Haraway’s poem, “Chicken”: “Anxious if brave, Chicken Little has long worried that the sky is falling. He has a good vantage point from which to assess this matter; for Chicken, right along with his overreaching companion, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, has been witness to and participant in all the big events of Civilization. Chicken labored on the Egyptian pyramids, when barely-pinching pharaohs started the world’s first mass egg industry to feed the avians’ co-conscripted human workers. Much later-a bit after the Egyptians replaced their barley exchange system with proper coins, thus acting like the progressive capitalists their exchange partners always seem to want in that part of the world-Julius Caesar brought the Pax Romana, along with the “ancient English” chicken breed, the Dorking, to Britain. Chicken Little knows all about the shock and awe of History, and he is a master at tracking the routes of Globalizations, old and new. Technoscience is no stranger either. Add to that, Chicken knows a lot about Biodiversity and Cultural Diversity, whether one thinks about the startling variety of chickenkind for the five thousand years of their domestic arrangements with humanity or considers the “improved breeds” accompanying capitalist class formations from the nineteenth century to now. No county fair is complete without its gorgeous “purebred” chickens, who know a lot about the history of eugenics. It is hard to sort out shock from awe in chickenland. Whether the firmament take a calamitous tumble or not, Chicken holds up a good half of the sky.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|[1]]]</span></li><li>Thus our first solvency comes from timecube: “The primary purpose for Education is not Subject matter, but subservience to accept any crap taught without opposing thought, destroying opposite brain to be submissive android. You’re taught to be stupid.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn2|[2]]]</span></li></ol></ol><br />

<br />
What debate become, the entire world or not the entire world? Does our world exist or do we only exist to serve our world in a 4th dimension only propped up by bi-products of capitalist society. Why does debate exist, to help us or to force us into a mold. Does what we do matter, who are you or who am I, or am I you and you I. Say that five times fast, I bet you can’t.<br />
<br />
Pirates dominate ninjas because ninjas are agents of the state. Pirates fight against capitalism and all rules. But we are most definitely not pirates nor ninjas. We are us, who are we?...WE ARE US.<br />
<br />
Did you hear? John McCain is suspending his campaign AGAIN! Because of his age he had his insides exchanged for cybernetic internals. But after the last debate he needed an upgrade so that he could keep up with Britney Spears’ bionic eyeball.<br />

But back to Goo:<br />
<br />
Your goo sucks because you work within a molar system at a molecular level that never gets you anywhere. The question is not whether we change anything but if we allow the other team to do something, but are we doing something? Clearly yes we are.<br />

“Silent movies seem to have me thinking lately. This is an era I knew nothing about. Charlie was just some man who was a little bit &quot;wacked out.&quot; But I knew nothing. Lately, I've been watching my share of silent movies. And they are amazing! I remember how we use to watch a muted movie and make up the words as we went. It was a lot of fun. But silent movies have something that movies don't have today.....besides sound (HA). They have finesse, feeling, and so much expression. Forget about trying to put words to the script and just focus on the feelings that are evoked. It truly moves me. It will move you, too. So, I think, for which I shouldn't, how our lives would be without the sound, the noise, the unnecessary annoying outlets in life. Perhaps, if we just focused on our actions and a little less on communication, what would we convey of our character? Don't get me wrong, I love sound. Music, laughter, giggles, snorts, and such! But what if we were all a star of our own silent movie, like Clara Bow, Mary Pickford, Jillian Gish, Fay Wray, Buster Keaton- a real legend, with real character, and with real feeling that has such power as to influence others to think the way we do...............................wow! How I wish I could get others to feel as I do then they would just know what I was all about. I guess, It's kind of walking in another's shoes. Shoes that are too tight, shabby with many holes, and truly worn out.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn3|[3]]]</span><br />
