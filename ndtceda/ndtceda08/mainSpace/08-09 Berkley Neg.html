TARIFF SWAP CP: <br />
<br />
The United States federal Government should eliminate the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit for conventional biofuel. The United States Federal Government should offer to eliminate the Ethanol Import Tariff is Brazil agrees to make concessions over Tariffs on Manufactured goods. The United States Federal Government should no longer require compliance with mandates that can be met with conventional biofuel.<br />
<br />
The Counterplan solves the case and garners concessions from Brazil on tariffs over manufactured goods. This is key to locking in US access to the Brazilian market.<br />
