<strong>Borderlands Aff</strong><br />
WE BEGIN WITH EARLE IN 2007-<br />
Earle in 2007<br />
[Duncan Earle, Prof. School of International Studies @ American University “Poems for “the Active Voice: Narrative Applied and Activist Anthropology” December 2007 accessed www.anthrosource.net]<br />
<br />
THE UNITED STATES USE OF MONOCULTURES HAS CREATED A BORDERLAND- THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALIENATED BY THE DUMPING POLICY HAVE HAD THEIR IDENTITY AND CULTURE SHAPED BY THE GENETICALLY MODIFIED GRAIN POURED OVER THEIR LAND- MILLIONS ARE PUSHED OFF THEIR LAND BY THE UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES THE UNITED STATES REFUSES TO SURRENDER, THEIR TRADE DISTORTING CORN SUBSIDIES. THEY ARE LEFT WITHOUT ANYWHERE OR ANYTHING TO TURN TO, LOST BETWEEN TWO CONFLICTING WAYS OF VIEWING THE WORLD- YELLOW CORN AND MAIZ, THE WHITE MAN’S CROP AND THEIR OWN. THIS IS THE FALSE CHOICE PUSHED UPON THEM BY A STATIC UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR IDENTITY.<br />
Ross in ‘7<br />
[John, “The Plot Against Mexican Corn,” Feb, 14, 2007,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/ross02142007.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.counterpunch.org/ross02142007.html</a>]<br />
“The &quot;diableros&quot; (hand truck hostlers) from Lagunilla market clustered around… NGOs that GMO corn was a threat to the nation's 57”<br />
<br />
THUS, ERUM AND I BELIEVE: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE ITS AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT BY ELIMINATING ALL CORN SUBSIDIES<br />
<br />
THE BORDERLAND BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO HAS SHAPED THE CULTURE AND IDENTITY OF ITS INHABITANTS- THEY ARE SEEN AS UNNATURAL AND SUBHUMAN, REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE, CLASS OR ETHNICITY- THEIR IDENTITIES ARE GRAFTED ONTO THEIR BODIES BY THE SPACE THEY OCCUPY AND THE PEOPLE WHO GIVE SHAPE TO THE DOMINANT NARRATIVE.<br />
Anzaldúa in ‘99<br />
[Gloria Anzaldúa, Professor @ University of Texas, San Fransisco State University and UCSC “Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza,” 1999, pg. 25-26]<br />

[“To Live in the Borderland”- Poem]<br />
Anzaldúa in ‘99<br />
[Gloria Anzaldúa, Professor @ University of Texas, San Fransisco State University and UCSC “Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza,” 1999, pg. 25-26]<br />
“To live in the borderland means…To survive the Borderland you must live sin fronteras be a crossroads”<br />
<br />
WE MUST SEE THE WORLD AS AN INFINITE SERIES OF MEETINGS OF DIFFERENT CONTINGENCIES THAT COULD EASILY BE REARRANGED OR ALTERED- NOTHING ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIPS IS NATURALLY DERIVED; IT IS ALL PRODUCED BY OUR SITUATION. ONCE WE UNDERSTAND THIS WE CAN THEN KNOW HOW TO CHANGE THE SITUATION. WITHOUT THIS PARADIGM SHIFT WE ARE CAUGHT IN A CONSTANT CYCLE OF REACTION WITHOUT ACTION- SELF-DECIEVING NIHILISM.<br />
Anzaldúa in ‘99<br />
[Gloria Anzaldúa, Professor @ University of Texas, San Fransisco State University and UCSC “Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza,” 1999, pg. 100-101]<br />
<br />
THE STARTING POINT TO BREAK DOWN THE DUALITY THAT HOLDS US CAPTIVE TO OUR CLOSED UNDERSTANDNGS OF IDENTITY IS TO REFLECT ON THE LESSON THAT THE MESTIZA CONCIOUSNESS TEACHES US. ALL PARTS OF IDENTITY ARE IMPORTANT, NOT JUST SOME, AND ALL PARTS OF IDENTITY ARE VALUABLE, THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY. WE CANNOT SELECT THE PARTS TO KEEP AND THE PARTS TO DESTROY- THOSE CHOICES INEVITABLY LEAD TO MORE MONOCULTURES, SUCH AS THOSE PROPOGATED BY OUR POLICY OF SUBSIDIZING CORN. THAT ELIMINATES DIFFERENCE AND PULLS US INTO A REACTIONARY POLITICS- THIS IS THE SAME LOGIC THAT JUSTIFIES WARS AND VIOLENCE ON A BROADER SCALE.<br />
Anzaldúa in ‘99<br />
[Gloria Anzaldúa, Professor @ University of Texas, San Fransisco State University and UCSC “Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza,” 1999, pg. 101-102]<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO PART OF IDENTITY PRIOR TO QUESTIONING- OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORLD GIVES SHAPE TO WHO WE ARE AND THUS HOW WE COME UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AROUND US. WE MUST RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO CONSTANTLY QUESTION AND REUNDERSTAND OUR IDENTITY. THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE SHOULD SEE THE DEBATE- A WAY TO QUESTION OUR CORN SUBSIDIES’ IMPACT ON OUR IDENITY AND THE IDENTITY OF THOSE FORGOTTEN BY THE FARM POLICY. ONLY THEN CAN BE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE WAY THAT OUR CURRENT POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT CAME TO BE- ONLY THEN CAN WE TRULY ACT.<br />
Anzaldúa in ‘99<br />
