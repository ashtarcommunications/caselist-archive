<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Despite a token decrease in ethanol subsidies in the latest farm bill- the US remains dedicated to biofuels </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Plan:</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support for biofuels by eliminating federal subsidies for first generation biofuels, and lifting import tariffs on biofuels. </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Advantage One: Food Prices </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Biofuel subsidies are responsible for up to 65 percent of the rise in food prices due to competition over land and other resources as well as the actual consumption of food both of which drive up prices </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“It is a gross-oversimplification… poverty and hunger.”</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Advantage Two- Brazil </span></strong><br />

CAFO's aff<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Contention 1: Cows as Commodities</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Since medieval times cows have been associated with money, and as a commodity, the word fee comes from the word for cattle</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Since medieval soldiers… to pay them.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Industrialization led to the belief that humans could take any animal and reshape it whichever way it wanted to, at this point the cattle stopped being valuable as animals but rather as commodities, the ancient view of a whole animal worked just fine</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“To the question… got that way.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Within one year after birth beef cows are packed into an industrial feedlot that can house up to one hundred thousand animals and pack the animals in concrete pens<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>and inhumane living conditions until they are killed</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“In 2002, about… plant and killed.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Plan:</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies for factory farming</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Contention 2: Oppression and Solvency</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Cattle industry in its current form is on the verge of collapse however has continued to be propped up because Americans have been willing to oblige and allow the oppressions of the cattle industry to occur</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Rimas and Fraser in 2008 (Andrew Rimas [Journalist, managing editor of the Improper Bostonian Magazine, associate editor for Boston Magazine] and Evan D.G. Fraser [Dr at the University of Leeds]. &quot;Beef: The Untold Story of How Milk, Meat, and Muscle Shaped the World&quot;. William Morrow publishers. New York. 2008)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Like Bradford in… universe is static.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We must be able to free our minds to looking at other possibilities for the cattle otherwise all oppressions are already realized and every life is imperiled. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Here, the full… threatens all men.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Eliminating the subsidies provided by the federal government would force cattle to exist on smaller farms eating grass similar to conditions before industrialization this would solve a lot of the current problems the beef industry is creating including water shortages, diseases, and environmental collapse, unless we do something now cows will permanently be viewed as commodities and subject to continuous suffering</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“There's no sense… much of either.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Contention 3: Ethics</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Referring to Factory Farms as CAFO’s serves to distract from the fact that factory farms commodify and abuse animals. Calling them Factory Farms is the best way to bring the atrocities to attention.</span><br />
