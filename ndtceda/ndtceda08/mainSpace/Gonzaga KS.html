<br />
CONTENTION ONE: FISHING HURTS<br />
<br />
THE CRISIS OF THE OCEANS FINDS ITS ROOT IN THE MONOLOGICAL VIEW OF HUMANS AND NATURE. FISH HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO A PASSIVE FIELD FOR HUMAN ENDEAVOUR, A MALLEABLE COMMODITY THAT HAS NO AGENCY OR AUTONOMY OF ITS OWN; THEY ARE SOLELY ITEMS TO BE TRADED WITHIN THE RATIONAL CONFINES OF THE FISHING ECONOMY.<br />
<br />
THIS ATTEMPTS TO APPLY RATIONAL ECONOMIC THEORY TO THE OCEAN HAS PUSHED THE WORLD'S MOST TRADED FOODSTUFF TO THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION<br />
<br />
PLUMWOOD, 02 (Val, &quot;Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason,&quot; p25-26)<br />
<br />
THE PROJECTION OF ECONOMIC RATIONALITY ONTO MARINE RESOURCES FINDS ITS ROOT IN GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO THE FISHING INDUSTRY. IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAXIMIZE PROFIT, THE UNITED STATES HAS FLOODED FISHING FLEETS WITH PAYMENTS IN ORDER TO EXTRACT AS MANY AS POSSIBLE<br />
<br />
BURNETT, 07 (H. Sterling, PhD, National Center of Policy Analysis, &quot; Ocean Fisheries: Common Heritage or Tragic Commons?&quot; Brief Analysis No. 581, February 27, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba/ba581/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba/ ba581/</a>)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF CONDEMNING 17 BILLION FISH ANNUALLY TO THE MOST PAINFUL DEATH IMAGINABLE. AWASH IN GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES, THE FISHING INDUSTRY IS FREE TO IMPALE, CRUSH, SUFFOCATE, AND GUT FULLY CONSCIOUS FISH AS THEY PLEASE<br />
<br />
PETA, 08 (&quot;Fishing 101,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fishinghurts.com/fishing101.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishinghurts.com/ fishing101.asp</a>)<br />
<br />
TWO THINGS COULD HAPPEN TO THE MILLIONS OF FISH THAT ARE RIPPED OUT OF THE OCEAN BY GOVERNMENT-BACKED BOTTOM TRAWLERS—EITHER SLOWLY BE RIPPED TO SHREDS WHILE DRAGGED ACROSS THE OCEAN FLOOR OR IMPLODE FROM INTERNAL PRESSURE AS THEY ARE PULLED TO THE SURFACE<br />
<br />

<br />
INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS THE PLIGHT OF FISH IS BASED ON AN EXTERNALIZED DESIRE TO OVERCOME OUR OWN WEAKNESS. RATIONAL CALCULATIONS THAT PRIORITIZE ABSTRACT UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE ENVIRONMENT OVER REAL INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS OPERATE UNDER AN IMPLICIT FRAMEWORK OF VIOLENCE WHERE SOME; I.E. HUMANS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS<br />
<br />
DAVIS, 95 (Karen, Thinking like a Chicken: Farm Animals and The Feminine Connection, Animals and Women: Feminist Theoretical Explorations, pg 201-203)<br />
<br />
IN EVALUATING IMPACTS, WE MUST DISENGAGE FROM PATRIARCHAL DISCOURSES THAT SEES ETHICAL ACTION AS A HEROIC CHOICE MADE AT THE MOMENT OF CRISIS – SEPARATING OURSELVES FROM THE STORIES OF PATRIARCHY ALLOW NEW STORIES BASED ON HOLISTIC ETHIC TO EMERGE THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE CONDITIONS THAT MAKE CRISIS EMERGE IN THE FIRST PLACE.<br />
<br />
KHEEL, 93 (Marti, &quot;From Heroic to Holistic Ethics: The Ecofeminist Challenge,&quot; Ecofeminism: Women, Animals, Nature, p243-271)<br />
<br />
THIS FRAMEWORK OF PATRIARCHY ENDS IN EXTINCTION<br />
<br />
WARREN AND CADY, 94 (Karen and Duane, Feminism and Peace: Seeing Connections, Hypatia, Vol. 9, No. 2, Spring, p4-20)<br />
<br />
THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE RATIONALIST CREATES A HEGEMONIC MASTER PERSPECTIVE THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE CONNECTIONS THAT SUSTAIN LIFE—GUARANTEES EXTINCTION<br />
<br />
PLUMWOOD, 02 (Val, Australian Research Council Fellow at University of Sydney, &quot;Environmental Culture: The ecological cris of reason, Routledge, p98-100)<br />
<br />
THUS, THE PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ELIMINATE ITS DOMESTIC SUBSIDIES FOR FISHERIES.<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: HOLISTIC ETHICS<br />
<br />
SUBSIDIES MUST BE ELIMINATED SO WE CAN KNOW THE WHOLE STORY OF OUR COMPLICITY IN THE FISHING INDUSTRY – HOLISTIC ETHIC REQUIRES NOT RATIONALLY EVALUATING ABSTRACT VALUES, BUT RATHER EVALUATING THE SITUATION AND CONTEXT THAT GENERATE MOMENTS OF ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING IN THE FIRST PLACE.<br />
<br />
KHEEL, 93 (Marti, &quot;From Heroic to Holistic Ethics: The Ecofeminist Challenge,&quot; Ecofeminism: Women, Animals, Nature, p243-271)<br />
<br />
ANY VIEW OF FISH THAT CONSTRUCTS THEM AS INSTRUMENTAL COMMODITIES IS UNJUST AND MUST BE REJECTED. HOWEVER, REJECTING ALL FORMS OF COMMODIFIED RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOOD REMOVES HUMANS FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF RESPECTFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH NON HUMANS BY ELEVATING HUMANS ABOVE THE FOOD CHAIN. INSTEAD WE NEED A RESPECTFUL AND ETHICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR FOOD.<br />
<br />
PLUMWOOD, 02 (Val, Australian Research Council Fellow at University of Sydney, &quot;Environmental Culture: The ecological cris of reason, Routledge, p155-159)<br />
AT: Management<br />
<br />
THE COUNTERPLAN'S DESIRE FOR MANAGEMENT ENLISTS REASON AS THE NEW HERO TO FIGHT ON NATURE'S BEHALF—THIS ATTEMPT TO FORM AN IRON-CLAD RATIONAL APPROACH TO THE OCEAN REPLICATES THE INSTRUMENTAL MENTALITY<br />
