 <strong>United States</strong> <strong>hostility toward Syria is hampering Syria-Israel negotiations.</strong><br />
Rabinovich 2007 [Itamar, Journalist for Haaretz, 8/1, “Don’t push Assad into a corner”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/888950.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/888950.html</a>]<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Thus the plan:</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>The United States Federal Government should substantially increase its constructive engagement with Syria by offering a security guarantee to abandon its policy of regime change in Syria and to encourage Syrian-Israeli peace talks to return the Golan Heights.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Contention Two Is Advantages; Advantage One is Golan Heights</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>1. The Syrian government has dramatically increased preparations for war against Israel over the Golan Heights and has “proof” that Israel is moving towards war.</u></strong><br />
Klein, 07 [Aaron, July 8, “Syria Threatens Israel on Golan HeightsVows 'Resistance' Unless It Withdraws”; Special to the New York Sun; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nysun.com/article/58009" rel="nofollow">http://www.nysun.com/article/58009</a>]<br />
<br />
<strong><u>2. War between Syria and Israel will spiral large conflict involving new Syrian missile technology that would dramatically increase casualties.</u></strong><br />
<a name="_Toc174227294"></a> [Aaron, July 8, “Syria Threatens Israel on Golan HeightsVows 'Resistance' Unless It Withdraws”; Special to the New York Sun; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nysun.com/article/58009" rel="nofollow">http://www.nysun.com/article/58009</a>]<br />
<br />
<strong>3. The next war with Israel will escalate into nuclear war.</strong><br />
Steinbach 2002 [John, Hiroshima/Nagasaki Peace Committee, March, “Israel Weapons of Mass Destruction: A Threat to Peace”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.global/" rel="nofollow">http://www.global</a> research.ca/articles/STE203A.html]<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Fortunately, talks over the Golan Heights resolve all other security issues with Syria.</strong><br />
<a name="_Toc174227240"></a> [Murhaf, Professor at the Center for Strategic Studies at National Defense University and Former Defense Intelligence Officer to the Middle East, “When We Meet with Syria, What Should We say?

<br />
<strong><u>Advantage Two is Iranian Hegemony</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>1. Syria plays a key role in ensuring Iranian hegemony through mutual sponsoring of Hezbollah and Hamas.</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong>2. US hostility toward Syria increases Iranian hegemony and threats – only a change in Syrian policy can avert a regional disaster.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>3. Iranian hegemony both protects its nuclear program</strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u>4. Israel is willing to surrender the Golan Heights because the region is no longer essential to Israeli strategic defense.</u></strong><br />
<a name="_Toc174227299"></a> [July 27, “The Complexities Surrounding Syria-Israel Negotiations''; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=668&amp;language_id=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=668&amp;language_id=1</a>]<br />

<br />
