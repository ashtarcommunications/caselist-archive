In this column, I briefly review… and old-fashioned protectionism.<br />

How serious are the implications… <br />
that we have to address.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>DSB DA</strong><br />
<br />
A. DSB legitimacy is high- this drives concession based trade at the expense of successful consensus based trade. Non compliance is key to end legitimacy and the switch away from general council negotiations.<br />

Clearly, the DSB's adoption… Multilateral trade liberalization, however, will.<br />

B. This Turns the aff<br />
1. DSB doesn’t resolve disputes and only causes escalating trade conflicts<br />

Statistics undeniably show… beef hormones cases.22<br />
<br />
2. Losing trade disputes causes a switch to Preferential trade agreements- flips your multilateral trade arguments<br />

<strong>CIL CP</strong> <br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that World Trade Organization agreements and decisions of its dispute settlement panels are self-executing and the United States should comply with the World Trade Organization ruling on United States cotton support<br />
<br />
Counterplan ends the non self-executing policy applied by the Courts to WTO decisions<br />
