<strong>Round 1: GSU</strong> <br />
<strong>UNLV CJ AFF</strong> – Tim Jeffries and Travis Cochran – NOTE: the 1ac is not in order<br />
V NU CX<br />
Judge: Sean Luechtefeld, Wake Forest<br />
<br />
Thus we stand resolved that the United states federal government should substantially increase its constructive engagement with the government of afghanistan by substantially increasing financial assistance to the afghanistan ministry of education to establish youth football programs in the schools, so long as they abide by the “soccer for all” policy.<br />
<br />
Funding and enforcement through normal means-speeches and cross x will clarify intent<br />
<br />
We must question the reasoning behind America’s withdrawl from international soccer. We have lived in solation from the worlds most popular sport for centuries. This is a direct manifestation of American Exceptionalism.<br />
Markovitz 2001<br />

”the question, of course.. the most dominant european sport, soccer.”<br />
<br />
Today we are standing at the crossroads-we ar moving forward down the trail of globalization-the choice is ours whether or not our final destination is oppression or liberation-it is not a question of how do we stop it-it is a question of how we shape it<br />

<br />
”nayan chanda doesn’t want you... who really shape globalization.:”<br />
<br />
Right now america’s choice seems to be the latter – we have taken on isolationst identity that separates us from the global community-our national attitude towards soccer demonstrates our poisonous sense of american exceptionalism.<br />
markovitz 2001<br />
”soccer failed to gain... its general ethos.”<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, american isn’t the only nationa having issues with soccer-the afghan education system has failed to fully integrate sports into the schools.”<br />

”afghanistan’s infrastructure is still in... society and government as adults.”<br />

football is globalized, allowing a nexus of cultrual complexity to flow across scapes<br />
giulianotti 99<br />
football: a sociology of the global game, p.23-34<br />
”the modern nexus of football...sporting facilitator.”<br />
<br />
finally, soccer is the greatest thing possible for the global community-it promotes values that are essential to the successful development of individuals and nationa,s in addition to being an effective tool to build peace and fight agasint racism<br />

”soccer and life,” Americas, English Edition, Vol.59, Jan-Fed 2007<br />
“i think that soccer, like... que viva el futbol!”<br />
<br />
<br />
embracing soccer allows us to examine the impact of globalization of the world-it allowsus to imagine a world consumed in conflict, which conversely allows for alternatives to war.<br />

Arendt writes that-any political capacity<br />
<br />
Thus University of Nevada at Las Vegas offers the following plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should constructively engage the government of Afghanistan by substantially increasing foreign assistance through the following means:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government will end the forced eradication campaign and give the Afghanistan government seeds and teach them irrigation techniques to help grow wheat. In addition, the United States Federal Government will offer wheat subsidies to guarantee the cost of wheat above market value for the next ten years; in return for the transition away from illicit opium economy.<br />
