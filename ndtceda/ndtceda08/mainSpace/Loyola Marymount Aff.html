No one escapes past or judgment- was there- saw it all- needed unity through faith- refuse to acquese in the name of some transcendent being the topic is more and less than what you thought- need to try our own judgment- unconditionally condiditioned- transcending the unified means seeing the unseen offers us the opportunity<br />
<br />
Derrida<br />
Follow the rule of law- nothing existed previous before the law- confirm and destroy the law- reality is mediated- uncomplete and unknowable- reality is always incomplete<br />
<br />
Nietzche<br />
All of humanity is forgotten- still nothing<br />
<br />
Trying to define what the topic is<br />
<br />
Nietzche<br />
<br />
Problem with equating issues to reality- almost always wrong and arbitrary- this is true merely because people believe in it- assert transcendental authority’s interpretation on the topic- need more sensuous and meaningful debate- highly arbitrary nature- obligatory for all- express all forms for knowledge<br />
<br />
List<br />
<br />
Totalized reasoning- mass of discourse- form of domination<br />
<br />
Foucault<br />
<br />
Subverts imposition of any interpretation- appropriation of vocabulary is necessarily bad- seek to crash through<br />
<br />
Klein<br />
Hegemonic perspective is what the resolution is- world is gone and now has to be carried- outside of historically contextual fluid perspective- illustrates fluid opportunity- provoke and insult us<br />
<br />
Need to change the past<br />
<br />
Our interpretation challenges the knowledge the resolution offers- critical of any prespective that includes diverse<br />
<br />
Jane ???<br />
Wall of house played- did not want to miss the sound of name- around the intervention of new values- what does it matter if town become more<br />
<br />
Samuel<br />
Literary discourse- different types of language- institutions hold individuals differently and forms antagonistic injury<br />
<br />
Feld<br />
Words and movements merge to the point where nothing can resist them<br />
<br />
Bleiker<br />
Encompass social contexts gradual transformation has no end- no emanciparoty means to meet- need to overcome dark force of perception<br />
<br />
Take issue with re-problemazation<br />
<br />
Dylan/Reid 00<br />
Turns epistomelogical problems into becoming a policy- go into their very forming- constantly respond to circumstances- more or less control<br />
<br />
Constantly find themselves in a cycle of poicymakers- problematizes life<br />
<br />
Take issue with talking things out of agency<br />
<br />
Antonio 95<br />
Paralyzing over-concern; close genuine attachment- taken things to a point of exhaustion<br />
<br />
Lastly,<br />
<br />
Open up new perspectives<br />

Their framework doesn't answer the affirmative- give a definition of a word- cant be resolved- could change a definition itself- destroys an internal link- have an eqpistomelogical question- their advocacy is a procedural not substantive question. If we become policy makers we’re bad ones- this internal link turns education- has a communicative understanding- case arguments could be dealt with in cx. Doesn't have human agency we advocate- impact turn their form of education- we have a better precedent argument. Bleiker piece of ev. Is the trump card- what is being said in terms of the role playing paradigm is important- stable advocacy in terms of resolution<br />
<br />
Another counter-interp- defend entirety of resolution<br />

CP<br />
Permutation- cannot know human agency in it’s entirety we shouldn't take away the responsibility of a situation- such is precise to our freedom and ethical framework- it’s all what we make on our situation. 1AC experience cant be captured or re-read. Uniquely allow for the possibility of the resolution. Collinates the resolution-<br />
<br />
(Card)<br />
Situation by capturing- that's what the point of being is all about<br />
<br />
Relies on notion of needing to compare 2 concepts- impact is destroys possibilities- uniquely beneficial as a result<br />
<br />
Exploding distinctions they discuss influence nature of debate<br />

Understanding of suffering becomes a fetish<br />
Rossberg 92<br />
<br />
Fragmentation occurs<br />
<br />
Integration within personal experience- war on political legitimacy<br />
Harms politics of identity<br />
<br />
Impact- destroys life’s value<br />
Rent 95<br />
Extra blame- harms culprit- increasing global consciousness intensifying this harms- specific geneology leads to depoliticalization of civil society- trivializing differences<br />

Group consequentialism<br />
1AC is an indict of this- need to have an alternative interpretation of this<br />
<br />
This sort of snip bit type of debate is bad<br />
<br />
When you encounter suffering do something about it- do not contrive situations does not help peoplke who are actually suffering- how we destroy memory<br />
<br />
We cannot nec. Say we don't know anything in particular- how do they treat knowledge debate even as a science? Skepticism doesn't allow us not to engage in any sort of change<br />
<br />
Epistomology is a new status tightening<br />
<br />
Barjound in 02<br />
Greater tendency of a subject value- human beings ability to effect each other- need a coherent system<br />
<br />
Arguments regarding how suffering is something that we can encounter- scientific understanding is something we disagree with- distinct universal truths vs. individual ones.<br />

“…for better or worse, unconditionally-conditioned, firmly aroused, inspired and tantalized WE AFFIRM THE RESOLUTION BECAUSE IT IS JUDGEMENT DAY …Indeed, the notion of AFFIRMING THE RESOLUTION BECAUSE IT IS JUDGMENT DAY offers us the opportunity to embody the Supreme Court as we project and rearticulate the past, judge the Judge and radicalize our collective commitment to… Reality is mediated, incomplete, and unknowable. … our affirmation attempts to forego uni-dimensional ways of thinking in order to prevent the jaded logic rooted in managing our reality.”<br />
