Second, even if U.S. power continues to increase and this argument therefore appears to be less appealing, the United States can gain from stronger reliance on international law because the law can help legitimize its current exercise of power.<br />

First, a stronger use of international law could help stabilize the current predominant position of the United States. If the United States now concludes treaties with other states that reflect its superior negotiating power<br />

<br />
This has been recognized in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks against the United States in September 2001, and the U.S. president not only sought to build an international ad hoc coalition but also taken steps to bolster the international legal regime against terrorism, in particular by transmitting conventions against terrorism to the Senate in order to proceed with ratification<br />

Ecosystem destruction leads to extinction<br />
<br />
Diner 1994. [David. Major-JAG Corps US Army. Military Law Review]<br />
<br />
No species has ever dominated its fellow species as man has. In most cases, people have assumed the God-like power of life and death -- extinction or survival -- over the plants and animals of the world. For most of history, mankind pursued this domination with a single-minded determination to master the world, tame the wilderness, and exploit nature for the maximum benefit of the human race.<br />

Independently, The most important factor in determining proliferation is whether the U.S. is perceived as willing to unilaterally use force to prevent further proliferation<br />

Collapse of Free Trade = Nuclear War<br />
<br />
Spicer '96 (Michael, Member of British Parliament, The Challenge From the East and the Rebirth of the West pg 121)<br />
The choice facing the West today is much the same as that which faced the Soviet bloc after World War II: between meeting head-on the challenge of world trade with the adjustments and the benefits that it will bring, or of attempting to shut out markets that are growing and where a dynamic new pace is being set for innovative production. The problem about the second approach is not simply that it won't hold: satellite technology alone will ensure that consumers will begin to demand those goods that the East is able to provide most cheaply. More fundamentally, it will guarantee the emergence of a fragmented world in which natural fears will be fanned and inflamed. A world divided into rigid trade blocs will be a deeply troubled and unstable place in which suspicion and ultimately envy will possibly erupt into a major war<br />
