Miliken v. Bradley was based on the idea that the state is not obligated to provide remedies for racial discriminatory acts that don’t violate the Constitution<br />
<br />
<strong>U.S. Supreme Court, Milliken v. Bradley Decision Lawyer’s Edition</strong><br />
“On certiorari…racial segregation.”<br />
<br />
Framework:<br />
1) Our Affirmative is a criticism of discourse exercised in the Milliken decision that re-entrenches state power, upholds the idea of the law and the constitution as supreme standards of justice, all in order to maintain the paradigm of the dominant socio-economic, and political class.<br />
<br />
2) Milliken decision reaffirms the idea of the law as a unique standard of justice refusing to analyze the source of its authority. Law’s authority is nowhere outside its linguistic boundaries; its power is derived from our blind, non-critical acceptance of it.<br />
<br />
3) The affirmative advocacy is deconstruction of the dominant legal, political, and socio-economic paradigm that must precede any form of action.<br />
<br />
4) We must acknowledge the hierarchical social system before we can achieve equality and justice<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Reynolds 94</strong> (“Deconstructing State Action: The Politics of State Action,” Ohio Northern University Law Review, 20 Ohio N.U.L. Rev. 847)<br />
“We continue to live…and justice.”<br />
<br />
Contention 1: Constitution Methodology<br />
<br />
The construction of the Constitution as a supreme standard of justice was one of the assumptions in the Milliken decision. This belief in justice as contained in some eternal principles that can be discovered rationally and then applied for centuries without an end is simply a myth of the Enlightenment period. The problem with this approach is that those in power can wash their hands of the injustices that are not prohibited explicitly by the Constitution. The Constitution references many important values, but viewing it as an <em>exhaustive</em> set of principles is flawed and can lead to absurd distinctions such as the one in Milliken between constitutional and “unconstitutional radically discriminatory acts.” They should just be seen as wrong, period. To assume that there is no justice outside that principle is to make injustice permissible in a new situation. We should change the fundamental laws to fight racism, not allow racism in order to be able to keep society’s fundamental laws.<br />
<br />
Faith in this constitutional mythology makes us ignore the realities of our social issues.<br />
<strong>Reynolds 94</strong> (“Deconstructing State Action: The Politics of State Action,” Ohio Northern University Law Review, 20 Ohio N.U.L. Rev. 847)<br />
“Faith in our constitutional…historical pursuits.”<br />
<br />
Constitutional Mythology made us blind to the fact that the Supreme Court used the formalist ideology of the Constitution to protect discrimination and oppression in Milliken v. Bradley<br />
<strong>Reynolds 94</strong> (“Deconstructing State Action: The Politics of State Action,” Ohio Northern University Law Review, 20 Ohio N.U.L. Rev. 847)<br />
“In our society… social institutions.”<br />
<br />
Racial discrimination is the ultimate form of dehumanization – non-whites are treated as inferior , and these races experience a total loss of liberty.<br />
<strong>Feagin 2K</strong> (<em>Racist America – Roots, Current Realities, and Future Reparations</em>, Routledge New York and London)<br />
“The alienation of… spatial manifestations.”<br />
<br />
The illusion that the Constitution is the will of the people establishes a false consciousness. It is with this false consciousness that we pass and accept policies.<br />
<strong>Gabel _</strong> (84; 36 Stan. L. Rev. 1; “Roll Over Beethoven”)<br />
“It’s pretended… it’s not true.<br />
<br />
We must reject this false consciousness and recognize that the government has the obligation to address blatant inequalities no matter whether the means to do so are in the Constitution or not.<br />
<strong>Reynolds 94</strong> (“Deconstructing State Action: The Politics of State Action,” Ohio Northern University Law Review, 20 Ohio N.U.L. Rev. 847)<br />
“The nineteenth century… rectify these inequalities.”<br />
<br />
Contention 2: The state<br />
<br />
1) Seeing “The State” as an entity is a trap and an excuse for discrimination.<br />
<strong>Reynolds 94</strong> (“Deconstructing State Action: The Politics of State Action,” Ohio Northern University Law Review, 20 Ohio N.U.L. Rev. 847)<br />
“The line between… federal powers.”<br />
<br />
2) The District Court that reviewed Milliken before the case reached the Supreme Court noticed precisely this point and I quote:<br />
“While it would be unfair… <em>Ibid</em>.”<br />
<br />
This is due to the flawed conception of the state as an entity. In reality, the bureaucratic apparatus is a collection of actors between which the responsibility is divided, subdivided and sub-sub-divided until no one is responsible for the holistic outcome anymore. The different decision-makers can therefore hide under the umbrella of the notion of “the state” and escape individual responsibility.<br />
<br />
Also,<br />
Subpoint 2(b) in the Milliken Holding highlights the state’s bias towards maintaining the status quo and avoiding administrative inconveniences and I quote:<br />
“(2) thus the remedy… and administration.”<br />
<br />
The idea that changes to the system would cause serious disruptions in the activity of the state begs the question of whether changes would be beneficial for society. A smooth-functioning and well-oiled state machine is meaningless if the society at large struggles with huge problems. The state should not exist for the sake and well-functioning of the state, but for the collective good. Justice White criticizes this state bias in his dissent opinion:<br />
“The core of my disagreement… to the State.”<br />
<br />
Contention 3: Deconstruction<br />
<br />
Discourse shapes self, community and the ethical relationships between the two<br />
<strong>Sherwin 88</strong> (Michigan Law Review, December, 87 Mich. L. Rev. 543, A MATTER OF VOICE AND PLOT: BELIEF AND SUSPICION IN LEGAL STORYTELLING, l/n)<br />
“White calls this type… shall establish.”<br />
<br />
We need to deconstruct the law in order to evaluate it in its pure form – as language with strategic value in the context of culture.<br />
<strong>Sherwin 88</strong> (Michigan Law Review, December, 87 Mich. L. Rev. 543, A MATTER OF VOICE AND PLOT: BELIEF AND SUSPICION IN LEGAL STORYTELLING, l/n)<br />
“In this text… evaluated as such.”<br />
<br />
Deconstruction of inherited legal doctrines and practices is key to preventing these doctrines from being implemented in the future<br />
<strong>Sherwin 88</strong> (Michigan Law Review, December, 87 Mich. L. Rev. 543, A MATTER OF VOICE AND PLOT: BELIEF AND SUSPICION IN LEGAL STORYTELLING, l/n)<br />
“For those who would have us break… of disenchantment.”<br />
<br />
Deconstruction is the first step towards true egalitarian change<br />
<strong>Reynolds 94</strong> (“Deconstructing State Action: The Politics of State Action,” Ohio Northern University Law Review, 20 Ohio N.U.L. Rev. 847)<br />
“Critical legal studies… of the workplace.”<br />
<br />
We must resist the tyranny of legal formalism to avoid becoming accessories to our own dehumanization and protectors of oppression<br />
<strong>Reynolds 94</strong> (“Deconstructing State Action: The Politics of State Action,” Ohio Northern University Law Review, 20 Ohio N.U.L. Rev. 847)<br />
“The point here is that… hasten its demise.”<br />

The law has nullified womens selfhood through its masculinizing of the self- after coveture was rescinded, reproductive law has become the site of this denial of agency<br />
Feminist perspectives on the self, june 28, 1999, www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/feminism-self/<br />
Feminist critiques, we have seen- gesture of self-renunciation.<br />
<br />
This denial of selfhood is pivotal to agency- making the masculine the norm creates the feminine as the other, devoid of personhood, identity, and the law renders women as mere bodies<br />
Meyers, feminist perspectives on the self, same as above<br />
<br />
This exclusion sacrifices women by appealing to a universal equality- its vision of equality and neutrality requires the exclusion of materialisty and difference from considerations in the political realm, forcing political bodies to succumb to the universal, absolutist vision of politics<br />
Caldwell 02, Transforming Sacrifice: Irigaray and the politics of sexual difference<br />
How does Irigaray see the logic of sacrifice working- the material, such as women.<br />
<br />
This ideal of equality requires a subject, man, to be positied as natural, and defined in comparison to other subjects by disavowing materiality. The equal subject requires the existence of lesser subjects to justify itself. The freedom of democracy is nothing more than the mastery of thinking that excludes differences in the name of an autonomous self<br />
Caldwell 02<br />
The formation of the ideal- and autonomy of the self.<br />
<br />
The attempt to view identity through entrenched formations causes violence against both the self and the other<br />
Connoly 02, Identity/Difference, expanded edition, p177<br />
Without a particular set of entrenched- tendency in them too.<br />
<br />
Plan- the US SC should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeast Pennsylvania V Casey by ruling that women’s right to choose an abortion is based on a woman’s right to selfhood.<br />
<br />
Working through the law is critical to broaden the recognition of difference in the law- the plan places women within the symbolic order which is essential to forming coalitions<br />
Caldwell 02<br />
Irigaray’s effort to transform a sacrificial- order must repress difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
Random Caldwell card<br />
Do such strategies risk fixing- being oppressed because of it.<br />
<br />
The affirmative is a radical break with temporality- we should view the plan as opening a new space/time that does not rely on predetermined conditions- this is essential to a politics of becoming<br />
Ziarek 98 Diacritics 28.1 60-75, Toward a Radical Female Imaginary: Temporality and Embodiment in Irigaray’s Ethics<br />
Irigaray’s analysis of Descartes’s wonder- remain the spaces of freedom.<br />
<br />
Our theory opens the path to recognizing the relationship between all forms of oppression, while some may essentialize oppression to a feminine/ masculine dichotomy, we need not<br />
Caldwell 02<br />
If a feminine universal can preserve an openness- that of a necessary exclusion.<br />
<br />
A fluid politics only ascribes identity to a universal, while recognizing that our attachment to that universal is incomplete and singular in nature. This prevents any single subject from narcissistically claiming it represents the whole, or ideal, subject.<br />
Caldwell 02<br />
Aside from fearing that Irigaray’s concrete political- universal and are shaped by it.
