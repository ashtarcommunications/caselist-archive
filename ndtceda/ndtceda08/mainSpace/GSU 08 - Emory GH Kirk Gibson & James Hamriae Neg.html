<u><strong>Lift the Tariff CP</strong></u><br />
Text: The United States executive should lift all import tariffs on ethanol.<br />
<br />
Bush can do the counterplan unilaterally and it will immediately decrease food prices<br />
American Meat Institute 2008 [AMI, Other Groups, Urge President To Immediately Suspend Import Tariff on Ethanol”, 6/2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.meatami.com/ht/display/ArticleDetails/i/39583" rel="nofollow">http://www.meatami.com/ht/display/ArticleDetails/i/39583</a>]<br />
The American Meat Institute, joined by more ... food as fuel,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
The CP solves - the import tariff has a larger effect on U.S. ethanol markets than other biofuel subsidies<br />
PR Newswire 2008 [“Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Supports EPA Decision But Urges U.S. Congress to Do Its Part on Ethanol Import Tariff”, 8/7, lexis]<br />
The 2008 U.S. Farm Bill reduced subsidies ... down the road could be quite high.&quot;<br />
<br />
The counterplan is comparatively better than the plan and the permutation – cutting corn ethanol immediately guts the infrastructure investments necessary for cellulosic ethanol. Lifting the import tariff solves but doesn’t immediately hurt corn. The plan will immediately increase oil prices – increasing food prices and destroying U.S. foreign policy<br />
Lugar 2008 – U.S. Senator (Richard, CQ Congressional Testimony, “Global Food Crisis”, 5/14, lexis)<br />
While we should understand the impact ... disease eradication, and nutrition.<br />
<br />
Cutting subsidies and removing the tariff will lower overall ethanol production – this will increase the retail price of ethanol and undermine investments in the infrastructure for E85 ethanol<br />
Kruse et al, 07 - Global Insight (John, “Economic Impacts of Not Extending Biofuel Subsidies”, AgBioForum, Volume 10, Number 2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.agbioforum.org/v10n2/v10n2a04-kruse.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.agbioforum.org/v10n2/v10n2a04-kruse.htm</a>)<br />

E85 is the vital internal link to ending oil dependence<br />
Hendricks et al, 07 - Senior Fellow with the Center for American Progress where he works on issues of climate change and energy independence (Bracken, Apollo’s Fire, p. 56)<br />
When these steps are implemented together ... improve our carbon footprint.<br />
<br />
Lifting the import tariff and modifying the tax credit to be based on the energy content per gallon of biofuel will cause a shift away from corn to advanced biofuels – this is key to reducing warming and providing energy security<br />

Karsner, 08 – Department of Energy (“RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN U.S. RENEWABLE FUELS POLICY AND FOOD PRICES”, Federal News Service, Senate Hearing, 6/12, lexis)<br />
SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK): Thank you, Mr. Chairman ... would see capital drive to a trickle.<br />
<br />
Cellulosic ethanol is vital to reducing oil dependence – preventing Middle East conflict<br />
Lugar and Woolsey, 99 – Chair of the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee AND Director of Central Intelligence from 1993 to 1995 (Richard and James, Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb, “The New Petroleum”, proquest)<br />

<u><strong>Endangered Species Act CP</strong></u><br />
Text: The United States federal government, specifically the executive, should change the Endangered Species Act requiring the use of Turtle Excluder Devices and other by-catch mitigation efforts. It should supplement the Magnuson-Stevens Act changing the status of fish populations, creating a system of capped individual transferable quotas. It should base Total Allowable Catch at fifty percent of current catch by fishers. It should change the Incidental Take Statement of the Endangered Species Act to eliminate fishery authorization for all fish species and ban cultivation in Open Ocean Aquaculture. It should allocate new funding to ensure sustainable additions of necessary enforcement in order not to overburden institutions. The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration should impose a permanent ban on bottom trawling in all United States Waters. <br />

Text: The government of the People's Republic of China should eliminate tariff-rate quotas on imported cotton and should refrain from implementing safety and environmental standards and value-added taxes application in a manner that creates price advantages for Chinese cotton growers. The Government of The People's Republic of China should substantially liberalize its restrictions on services and agricultural trade, take a leadership role in the World Trade Organization by encouraging developing nations to liberalize services and agricultural restrictions and substantially appreciate the renminbi against the dollar.<br />
