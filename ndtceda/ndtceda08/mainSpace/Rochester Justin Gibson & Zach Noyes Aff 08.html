Thus the Plan : The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the Palestinian Authority. This increase in constructive engagement will include aiding the Hamas lead Palestinian Authority and an increase in foreign assistance by repealing the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006.<br />
<br />
Observation 1 : Inherency<br />
<br />
1. US congress has passed legislation that cuts off assistance to the Hamas – led Palestinian Authority. This legislation declared the Palestinian Authority a “terrorist sanctuary” – <br />
Robinson, 2006<br />
[ Robinson Report : VOA NEWS : May 23 : “House approves Palestinian Sanctions Bill Opposed by Bush” “by a 361 to 37…and Palestinian officials”<br />
<br />
2. Next, this legislation was signed into law by Bush on Dec. 21, 2006<br />
<br />

<br />
obs 2 : harms<br />
<br />
1. Repealing the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism legislation is important – labeling of Hamas as a terrorist sanctuary spills over. It creates a belief among people that Hamas is a group of evil that needs to be crushed. This label is the justification for militarism and torture at home and abroad<br />

<br />
The refusal to recognize the Palestinian Authority with Hamas as its leader and trade embargos on the PA are perfect examples of American good intentions gone wrong. We fight a war on terror while imposing terror on others. We promote democracy while destroying it. The subtext is that America is the supreme arbiter of what makes a democracy legitimate or a group terrorist regardless of the nature of its opposition. The impact to this policy of colonialism is the systematic murder of Palestine. <br />

These labels are used as a justification for neoliberal, imperialist wars. They represent the basis for United States Genocidal expansion<br />

The terminal impact to this ideology is extinction. The belief that we need to save humanity through imperialism, neoliberalism, militarism, and genocide will eventually lead to the destruction of humanity<br />

Next, engagement with democratically elected Hamas government is the best hope for peace in the region. Conflict is inevitable in a world in which Hamas is isolated by the United States <br />

<br />
<br />
These Policies Emphasize the Paradoxical Assumptions of Democracy—Palestine is Free Only Insofar as They Choose Who and What We Wish Them to Choose—This Assumes a Static Narrative of American Lead Progress, That If “They Were Smart, They Would Think Like Us”<br />

<br />
<br />
Under this Definition of Democracy, Hamas Has Not Only Refused America’s Gift, But the Gift of God and the World—As Such, America and Israel are Entitled to Promote “True Freedom”<br />

This logic is the basis for violence – Something emergent in the other that we cannot control or understand justifies its extermination. <br />

Obs 3 : solvency<br />
6. The repeal of the terrorist labels of the state opens up ciritical space for effective policy solutions through constructive engagement<br />

<br />
3. constructive engagement is impossible without repeal of the Palestine Anti Terrorism Act. The labeling of Hamas as a terrorist organization prevents engagement<br />

The plan alters how the war on terror is fought by allowing it to recognize local political struggle. It is necessary to ensure long term stability in palestine.<br />

The Middle East is in a Deadlock Precisely Because of the Obviousness of Solutions—Our Investment in Preserving the Ambiguity of the Status Quo Means Pragmatic Politics Will Inevitably Fail—Empirically, in Israel and Palestine, the Only Possibility to Alter the Situation is the True Act of Recognizing and Relating to the Former Enemy/Terrorist.<br />
