Language is a bad focus for debate. Making the debate about language requires us to have stability in our speech acts. We are no longer able to take back words that are hurtful or ineffective. This stability collapses into a juridical model where our words can be attached to a stable subject. Prosecuting us for our speech destroys activism and turns their counterplan.<br />
