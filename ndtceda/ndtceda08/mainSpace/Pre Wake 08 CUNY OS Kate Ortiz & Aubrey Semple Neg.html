The K of Skittles<br />
<br />
Counter-Inherency: In our classrooms, the media, even this activity itself are all raised on the notion that if the federal govt can change its policies, we can see dramatic change. Whenever people put the blame on the government, we assume that it is an entity of itself, having full capailities of doing something. The 1AC takes part of that fantasy, we'll isolate a couple of reasons:<br />
<br />
First is our autonomy, the affirmative is a metaphor for the spectacle of waiting for our saving grace to come forth through the form of a course of action by the gov't. Our very being is detached from that agency because we have succumb to our fear of being powerless, unable to neither speak nor act for ourselves. We can only hope that issue such as structural racism can be remedied through the tools of the gov't<br />
<br />
Freire, 70<br />
<br />
Second - is our reaction. Methodologies of problem-solution have become the reaction to the problem, influenced by that event. We also recognize that this also happens in the debate community as well. It assume the position that the plan can take us toward the right direction for change or prevent. However, this in fact becimes counter productive in the overall spectrum when we dive deeper into this fantasy when we demand for the govt work for us because we have forgotten on a major thing: we are the government. People throughout this nation have the capability to empower and mobilize to help to change the conditions in this nation. This re-creates the oppression that we are constantly working to breakdown.<br />
<br />
Kappeler, 95<br />
<br />
Problems of genocide, racism, and the economy only resurface when we fail to recognize that it is actual people causing these issues to occur rather than an invisible entity we can hope to take down. No matter the force of its opposition, the connection of transformation with an appeal to our institutions, mediates our relationships in such a manner that ethical transformation outside this frame of mediation becomes impossible.<br />
<br />
Hershock, 99<br />
<br />
Alt - Instead of engaging in the project of the 1ac, we must engage in a methodology where the focal point is based on our personal agency, enabiling us to transform our praxis of historical, cultural, and lingustic concepts to transform society.<br />
