<strong>Wyoming's 1AC vs. Towson DD</strong><br />
Transition from cap inevitable<br />
now key time to change<br />
cap will run us out of resources<br />
transition away from cap key to stop extinction<br />
“cap is inevitable” is a lie Mazarus ‘95<br />
On the brink of collapse …credit crisis<br />
Historical examination:<br />
Ag led to cap<br />
Cap is older than Ag<br />
Subsides creates cap for ag<br />
Best way to approach the topic is to make materialist assessments and stand in solidarity with everyone<br />
Cap =’s nuke war<br />
Accidental nuke war =’s extinction<br />
Cap stops democracy<br />
Cap commodifies existence<br />
Cap crushes value to life<br />
Cap causes poverty intrinsically<br />
Cap makes nuke war inevitable<br />
Our aff can deconstruct Cap<br />
Intellectuals can open space for anti-cap<br />
Labor precedes Race: Cap creates class and race<br />
Our aff is key to solve Bio-oppression<br />
Intellectuals can bring down the machine<br />
Ag crisis can solve cap<br />
Only the aff can overcome the system by examining the Ag bizness system that underpins it<br />
Cap is intrinsically connected to agrarian crisis<br />
<br />
<strong>Cross-x of 1AC</strong><br />
So the team with the most historical understanding of oppression should win?<br />
Wyoming, pretty much, and ours is good. Best method to attack oppression is key<br />
So the aff is the best method?<br />
Historical materialism is the best way.<br />
Your labor mvmts args are based on ID and history?<br />
Yes<br />
So what labor mvmts focused on race and gender?<br />
Um…<br />
Asked again?<br />
Not sure…our ev describes some…I think<br />
Aff talks about the aff again.<br />
Again question, what about labor mvmts fighting gender &amp; race?<br />
Rambling…aff good.<br />
How does the aff, or previous mvmts help fight gender &amp; racial oppression?<br />
We’ll criticize particularism, and embrace mvmts generally, and the study of those movements.<br />

<strong>1NC (these are quick notes, not an official Towson disclosure)</strong><br />
Prayer to heavenly father to fetishize the material<br />
Forgive me to indulge white supremacy<br />
I pray for our people to grow up out of oppression<br />
I pray for those black babies who hate themselves<br />
I pray for whites to stop hating Black jesus<br />
I pray for thousands of black people historically oppressed and ignored<br />
This is why Du Bois moved away from Cap K.<br />
Amen<br />
<br />
Our prayers against oppressions of all kinds is good<br />

<br />
Rev. Wright on Black liberation theology<br />
<br />
Our approach is a five part approach to theology to combat white supremacy<br />
<br />
This is used to dominate those who are not white<br />
<br />
The aff links<br />
a.) debate links…personal agency, not involved in personal advocacy (disconnected narratives)<br />
b.) no discussion of lived experience<br />
c.) content doesn’t address centrality of white supremacy<br />
d.) secular vs. sacred<br />
<br />
we should understand the 1st century crucifixion as a lynching<br />
Asante…I believe from here:<br />

race/class/gender are connected with each other<br />
Ross ‘07<br />
<br />
Knowledge of oppression is about recognizing human activity through faith<br />
<br />
God is a liberator<br />
The free man or woman is those who rebel against an oppressive understanding of jesus<br />
In cross-x, it is explained that the aff’s elevation of a class-first approach is also a link<br />
Black liberation theology solves this
