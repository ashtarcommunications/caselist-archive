Hyper-reality is a flawed concept<br />
Anthony King 1997, A Criique of Baudirllard’s hyperreality: towards a sociology of postmodernism, UK Philosophy Social criticism 24<br />
The notion of hyperreality…supersede the Cartesian paradigm.<br />
Preventing violence is apriori<br />
Arnold Davidson 89, Critical Inquiry, Winter, 15:2<br />
I understand Levinas’ work…that questioning must stop.<br />
State won’t go away <br />
Robert Dahl, Democracy and its Critics, p 46-7<br />
A moment ago I…society without a state.<br />
Maintenance of moral duty to help people is key to preserving spontaneity in life which affirms its value<br />
Maclagan 54, Philosophical Quarterly, Vol 4 No 15, April 1954<br />
Up to this point…..in the principle itself.<br />
Universal liberalism isn’t root cause of violence against Iran --- it’s the nation’s ability to label Iran as an enemy that causes total war<br />
William Scheureman, “International Law as Historical Myth”, Constellations Vol. 11 No. 4, 2004<br />
Second, Schmitt’s odd periodization….help explain this silence.<br />
Language is the first consideration – focus on Baudrillard to explain history results in epistemological void<br />
Anthony King 98 [above]<br />
Heidegger’s linguistic orientation is important….idea of epistemological voids.<br />
Case is a pre-requisite to solvency for the alt --- the linguistic turn we advocate through discussion of discourse about Iran foregrounds interpretive frameworks can help to solve flaws in Baudrillard’s outmoded Cartesian frameworks creating a mechanism to interpret hyperreality as a part of wider social changes<br />
King 98 [above]<br />
This philosophical discussion of the….wider critical process.<br />
Just because something is a social construction doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist at all --- rejecting this results in endless violence and oppression<br />
Catharine Mackinnon, “Points against postmodernism”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://lawreview.kentlaw.edu/articles" rel="nofollow">__http://lawreview.kentlaw.edu /articles__</a><br />
It is my view that it….when you need them.<br />
WE must instill in the current system to enforce the struggle against bad forms of capitalism – the alt will fail because globalization is instilled in the minds of the population and capitalist discourse will continue in the struggle<br />
Moouffe, Laclau and Zournazi 2k [“Hope, Passion and the New world order, September, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/contretemps/2may2001/zournazi.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://www.usyd.edu.au/contrete mps/2may2001/zournazi.pdf__</a>]<br />

<br />
2AC was all about using activist structures to create better structures and the 1NC is shortsighted and dogmatic. The 1AC frees the oppressed better, need to resituate activism within a political structure. Lots of focus on why the 1NC is not competitive with changing the good/bad structures that the 1AC outlines.<br />
<br />
Rhetorical criticism must come first. The 1AC is required- there is an ethical obligation to solving problems in Iran.<br />
<br />
Perm do both: not exclusive with their advocacy. We criticize a forced binary between good and evil. Their framework args are a non-starter: they can’t achieve the problem. Our framework is about examining particular rhetorical strategies.<br />
<br />
White supremacy cannot explain all oppression, it fails to look at other issues.<br />
