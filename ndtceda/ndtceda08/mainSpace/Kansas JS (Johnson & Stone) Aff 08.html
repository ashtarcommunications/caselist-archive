<h2 id="toc38"><a name="Kansas JS-Kansas JS: Iran Attack (Early GSU)"></a>Kansas JS: Iran Attack (Early GSU)</h2>
 <br />
<u>Adv. 1: The Attack</u><br />
- US will attack Iran now<br />
Kent ’07. “but while Democrats… currently on the books.”<br />
<br />
- Iran will retaliate against a US attack: the impact is all out war<br />
Chossudovsky ’06. “Tehran has confirmed…Central Asian region.”<br />
<br />
- This brings in great powers.<br />
Madsen ’04. “The White House leak…for the entire world.”<br />
<br />
- Extinction<br />
Chossvdovsky ’06. “The world is at…World War III scenario.”<br />
<br />
- The Middle East is the most likely scenario for escalation<br />
Kam ‘07<br />
<br />
- An attack has no shot at success – not enough intel<br />
Clawson ‘04<br />
<br />
- It is impossible to prevent retaliation – even if attacks are successful they will breed hatred that makes future retaliation inevitable<br />
Posen ‘06<br />
<br />
<u>Plan</u><br />
The United States Federal Government should ban pre-emptive military strikes on Iran. We can clarify.<br />
<br />
<u>Solvency</u><br />
- Only the US can solve – Iran wants to develop weapons solely because of the possibility of a US attack<br />
Bennins ‘06<br />
<br />
- The US is key – only US-Iran relations will shape future Middle East stability<br />
Hagel ‘07<br />
<br />
<u>Aff Framework</u><br />
- Neg gets competing policy option or status quo – the Aff gets to leverage the 1AC as offense.<br />
- Best because:<br />
o Ground<br />
o Predictable limits<br />
o Aff choice<br />
- Voting Issue<br />
o Role playing is necessary for any moral or consequential evaluation of governmental policy<br />
Rawls ‘99<br />
<br />
o Our framework is key to education<br />
Muir ‘93<br />
<br />
o Rejection of clash makes debate an echo chamber. This impoverishes their project even if it is right.<br />
