 Chapter 1: the Warehouse of Strangers<br />
<u>_Lebanon is no longer a safe-haven for Palestinian and Iraqi refugees<br />
BBC monitoring International Reports, March 20 2007, Lebanesse paper says christian iraqi refugees live in Misery, lexis<br />
Lebanon is a haven....the parts of the world</u><br />
The ethics of the Status quo are rooted in an ethical rejection of the stranger's dignity- there are two ways of understanding ethics and culture: the sacred and the holy- the Status Quo is locked into the idea of the sacred, that we cannot welcome the stranger because they may be a terrorist- a holy ethics differs from this through hospitality toward the stranger<br />
Darrell Fasching, Narrative Theology After Aushwitz: From Alienation to Ethics, p.81-83, 1992<br />
A sacred society...abuse that transcendent dignity<br />
<u>The US rejects the idea of welcoming these displaced people because of a fear of terrorism-the government refuses to provide asylum because of a profound fear of the other, manifested in security concerns- this is part of a tradition that has followed from september 11th where we view any outsider as a potential terrorist and attempt to solidify the borders of our nation to make it less inviting to strangers<br />
Philip Peters, Jun 4th 2004, America Should help refugees instead of 'warehousing'</u> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.refugees.org/data/warehousing/docs/phil_peters.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.refugees.org/data/warehousi ng/docs/phil_peters.pdf</a><br />
Although our argument is about religion and the middle east, the ethical and theological aspects of our argument are played-out in debate as well<br />
The sacred community of debate protects certain norms and practices from the profane influence of alternative styles and practices. We are expected to talk fast, not drop argument and use technical terminology. Arguments become less educational and more functional. EFFICIENCY BECOMES OUR EDUCATION. We are not forced to grapple with issues pertinent to our lives because our techno-rationalist approach to the world out there makes it all knowable and controllable with our fast-paced flow-science. This techno-beaurocratic style of debating culminates in the exclusion of people form the debate community. People from under-priviledged communities are left on the outside looking in. Debate is a sacred community with sacralized norms and practices that cannot be violated. Instead of accepting this as the way debate really is, we should strive to realize debate's transformative and inclusive potential.<br />

Chapter 2: Our Advocacy<br />
<strong>The story of refugees from lebanon presents us with a fundamentally ethical decisions to make: should we welcome the stranger? Our stance in the status quo is deliberately opposed to an ethic of hospitality; it is rooted in suspicion and realism. In order to break with the status-quo we must be willing to take the risk of grappling with <em>what ought to be</em> instead <em>what is.</em></strong><br />
<strong>Thus we advocated that the USFG should constructively engage Lebanon by providing the security guarantee of asylum for refugees.</strong><br />
<strong>We will defend this advocacy as a metaphor for welcoming the strager through and ethic of the holy. We defend this metaphorically because we our agrument is just as much about the nature of debate as it is about international politics.</strong><br />
<u>In order to embrace the holy, one must abandon attachement to techincal forms of efficiency in our institutional context of debate- the drive for efficiencty blurs the distinction between is and ought: what is possible becomes more important than what is ethical- against this, we should embrace hope as the possiblity for radical transformation- their framework arguments make a holy ethic impossible hyper-efficient technical style  vote aff to re-vitalized our own ethical freedom and help debate as a communtiy realize its creativ e potential thought continuous tr</u>
