Contention I: The Concentration of Animality, 2009<br />
<br />
As concentrated animal feeding operations face increasing public scrutiny, agribusiness is using a time-tested strategy for disposing of America’s toxic waste: dumping them on the land of Native Americans<br />
<br />
Woodard, Indian Country Today correspondent, 2008 [Stephanie, “Fighting potential health horrors,” September 15, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/28413784.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/28413784.html</a>]<br />
Photo by Stephanie Woodard -- Native nations .. Drapeau reported. ''We're in the center of Turtle Island. This could be the beginning of an indigenous United Nations.'' “<br />
<br />
<br />
But these protests have not been met with by an acceptance of Indian rights and halt to construction, but by brutal shows of force<br />
<br />
Basile, Animal Welfare Institute, Summer 2008 [Tracy, “Of One Mind,” AWI Quarterly, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.awionline.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.awionline.org/</a> pubs/Quarterly/08-57-03/08_57_3p1820.htm]<br />
“What happened next is shocking. The following day, as protesters started gathering along the road again, 50 highway patrol officers, each in separate state’s response. Additionally, it was reported that the electrical contract for the building of Long View Farm had coincidentally been awarded to the county sheriff’s son. “<br />
<br />
Thus the plan, 2009: the United States federal government should end its subsidization of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations.<br />
<br />
For policymakers, this solution seems simpl: the statement ‘no more support for factory farms’ promises to wash away the violence of the status quo by FIAT. However, it is precisely this understanding of politics that causes the systematic erasure of the violence of History. Grappling with the crisis requires a deeper exploration of subsidization than made possible in traditional policy circles.<br />
Contention II: The Subsidy of History, 1854<br />
<br />
“He therefore has only one hope...will have vanished the red man of America.”<br />
[James Dunwoody Brownson DeBow, head of the U.S. Census from 1853-1857 and editor of DeBow’s Review, 1854, “Art. VII.-The Indian Tribes of the United States,” Debow’s Review, June 1854, XVII.1, ProQuest American Periodical Series, p. 68]<br />
<br />
James Dunwoody Brownson DeBow, Head of the U.S. Census from 1853-1857, illustrates how the history of American sovereignty is embedded in its agricultural techniques. Governmentality is inseparable from its methods of tilling the earth, of cultivating itself and its ‘objects’, of producing spatial and temporal fields of manageable bodies to be harvested and destroyed<br />
<br />
Higgins, Sociologist located at Monash University, 2005 [Vaughan, ““8 Governing agriculture through the managerial capacities of farmers: The role of calculation,” Agricultural Governance: Globalization and the new politics of regulation, Eds. Higgins &amp; Lawrence, p. 119-121]<br />
A governmentality perspective on the governing of agriculture<br />
An analytics of governmentality provides a strong conceptual basis for exploring the productive nature of modern agricultural governing. The governmentality literature is based on the assumption that... . If these centres remain durable, they ensure that certain calculations and practices are valorized over others 'by means of a passage through the centre' (Rose and Miller 1992: 189).2<br />
<br />
Governmentality requires us to understand the historical genealogy of governance practices, to look back at history instead of looking forward to the solutions. What produces a subsidy is a certain history, a valorization of a discursive legacy handed down from the past. History is a subsidy of certain practices, the arrangement of texts such that a law can be written, codes can change, money can be distributed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The concentration of factory farms onto Native lands is bound up with a politics of humanity at the very core of modern American governmentality. The sovereign establishes its object of governance by producing a population, Human, in opposition to a dangerous, incomprehensible Animal. The subsidization of CAFOs begins NOT WITH A FARM BILL, but a constant organization of discourse which transformed the ‘wilderness of the savages’ into concentrated, manageable zones of animality<br />
<br />
Hendry, Department of Communication and Journalism, University of New Mexico, 2003 [Judith, “Mining the Sacred Mountain: The Clash Between the Western Dualistic Framework and Native American Religions,” Multicultural Perspectives 5.1, Informaworld, 6-8]<br />
“Ecofeminist author, Val Plumwood (1993), discusses what she terms ..world is often sacrificed to the quantifiable public good of a waste incinerator, logging road, or uranium mine.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention III: Feeding Operations, 1843 to 1943<br />
<br />
The concentration of animality did not begin with factory farming. Biopolitical governance is a power which both organizes and nurtures life-as-a-whole while also imagining its potential elimination—the isolation of Native Americans in order to tame the dangerous animality of the frontier is at the American origin of modern governmentality. v<br />
<br />
As James A. Garfield, who, in 1872, was not yet the 20th President of the United States, writes:<br />
[Garfield, James A., Congressman from Ohio, and 20th President of the United States, The Independent. October 31st, 1872, page 1, column 1, ProQuest American Periodical Series]<br />
“Savage and civilized life ..., there may yet be saved a remnant of this perishing race.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, as DeBow understood so well, this is not simply a tragedy—this violence serves a purpose, feeding the genocidal ideology of manifest destiny:<br />
<br />
“After all, we believe that legislation, of any kind, will do .. . The order of nature must have its course.<br />
<br />
<br />
[James Dunwoody Brownson DeBow, head of the U.S. Census from 1853-1857 and editor of DeBow’s Review, 1854, “Art. III.—The Indians of the United States—Their Past, Their Present, Their Future,” Debow’s Review, February 1854, XVI.2, ProQuest American Periodical Series, p. 143]<br />
<br />
This sovereign production of a population always operates via a grammar of history that distinguishes and valorizes it—this logic of species-being drives biopolitics to recuperate itself via the death of other beings<br />
<br />
Dillon &amp; Lobo-Guerrero, 2009, professor of politics and IR @ Lancaster, IR/Politics Lecturer @ Keele University [Michael and Luis, “The Biopolitical Imaginary of Species-being,” Theory, Culture &amp; Society, Vol. 26(1): 1–23]<br />
One has to be classifiable to exist in species terms. One now has to be classifiable as informational code to be admitted to the category of contemporary biological species. One has to be in circulation as value to exist as economic species. In contesting these intimately related processes, these authors clarify how the political imaginary of species-being demarcates ... also in the case of the hermaphrodite Herculine Barbin (Foucault, 1980).<br />
<br />
<br />
And, the production of populations is the production of animality, a sovereign division of the human into a society that must be defended and an exotic, alien race that can be excluded and put to death by a genocidal biological politics<br />
<br />
Athanasiou, anthropologist @ University of Thessaly, Dept. of Hist, Archaeology, Social Anth, 2003<br />
[Athena, “Technologies of Humanness, Aporias of Biopolitics, and the Cut Body of Humanity,” differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies, 14:1]<br />
In Heidegger's questioning (understood as a will to essence),.. animate and inanimate matter, the saved and the lost, the edible and the discarded, killing and purifying, and killing and eating.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the plan, 1872: that the United States federal government should end its subsidization of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention IV: The Angel of History<br />
<br />
The simultaneous affirmation of these statements—one from 2009, one from 1872—produces a resonance between two historical registers, one which ruptures the stratified organization of history that produces the discourses and practices that make biopolitical subsidization of concentration and animality possible.<br />
<br />
Progressive history looks relies on a linear narrative of history that selectively organizes the past in order to justify the future. Instead of looking forward, you should adopt the position of the Angel of History who looks backwards and understands the present as the culmination of a series of continuous catastrophes.<br />
<br />
Our affirmation functions as a constellation of minor histories that directly challenges the Sovereign logic of animality, interrupting the smooth flow of by affirming our immanent production of a space-time of freedom over and against the deadening spatio-temporal organization of the Sovereignty of the Species.<br />
