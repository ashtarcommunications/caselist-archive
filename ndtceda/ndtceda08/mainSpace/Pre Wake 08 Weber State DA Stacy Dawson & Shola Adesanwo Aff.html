<span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><strong>current political discussions about agriculture take place in a world framed and defined by human power. Agricultural products, naturally occurring parts of creation, are converted into another cog in the machine of human manufacture where raw materials are converted into processed goods by humans for the consumption of humans.</strong></span></span><br />

<span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><strong>And, this definition of the world in terms of human manufacture and control is rooted in a theological problem. Categories like politics, nature and the economy have been carved out of the unity of God’s creation to stand as naturalized objects by secularism. This power over the entire world as objects we control hijacks the Christian truth of a covenantal and peaceful relationship between God, humans and nature, transforming human dominion into the right to exert power over nature in whatever way we choose.</strong></span></span><br />

<span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><strong>And, the subsidization of CAFOs is emblematic of the results of human freedom from God’s covenant. Farms are transformed into sunless hells filled with miserable, violent and traumatized animals awaiting a mechanical death. Subsidies are crucial. Providing the underlying possibility for the new “Science” of raising livestock.</strong></span></span><br />

<strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">This usurpation of God's sovereignty over history and creation does not result in a utopia of unshackled human freedom, but an absolute loss of freedom. The ultimacy and goodness of God is replaced by the tyranny and inevitability of death. The fear of death becomes a worship of death, the constant calculation of action and ideas that tries to avoid the unavoidable fact that all of us must die. We become the living dead, stripped of any identity or meaning, constantly dehumanized and pursued by fate beyond our control, members of a new religion of death that justifies every tyranny and injustice<br />

<strong>And, the time to break the spell of idolatry is now. God's reign is happening as we speak, in our acts and words that draw us closer to Him, the only thing that stops us is our cosignment to death. The threat of nuclear annihilation, environmental destruction, patriarchy, and war are all realities we cannot escape when we idolize death. In order to reject this, we must bear witness in Christ and have trust that the world can be transformed, resistance to death is the only way to live humanly in an inhuman world.</strong><br />

<span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><strong>And, this approach of Christian witness and hope in God’s providence is the only way to navigate the inevitability of human violence towards each other and creation. The current responses either justify violence because of it’s inevitability or feed into the false theology of human control and manufacture by believing that we can solve violence through a change in ideology or a comprehensive policy approach.</strong></span></span><br />

<span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><strong>Last, Only liturgy can rupture the false universalism of the liberal project and replace it with a vision of all humanity’s universal journey towards our ultimate home in God. This allows local spaces and cultures to be seen as continuous with orthodox faith without violently destroying them. Liturgical enactment allows us to transform life into a pilgrimage where each moment is sacred. For us, each tournament destination becomes the Holy Land of our enactment and each round is a bead on the rosary. Every time we enact Christ’s hope and demand we change the world.</strong></span></span><br />
