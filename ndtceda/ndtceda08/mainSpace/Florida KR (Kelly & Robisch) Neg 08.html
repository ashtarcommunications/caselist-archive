=Consult NATO<br />

<strong>Text: The United States Federal Government should propose that it should…</strong>. (insert plan) <br />
<strong>to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for binding consultation. The United States Federal Government should support its proposal during consultation. The United States Federal Government should abide by the results of this consultation. We’ll clarify</strong>. <br />
<strong>The counterplan is theoretically legitimate</strong> –  <br />
<br />
<strong>It’s not topical – the counterplan tests the word “resolved” which means “to make a firm decision about,” it also test the word “should” which is “used to imply obligation or duty” – counterplans that test the resolution are key to predictable negative ground.</strong> <br />
[American Heritage Dictionary at dictionary.com] <br />
<strong>Consultation counterplans are legitimate – conditioning the plan is the only way to preserve the option of solving the case which checks unpredictable 2ac add-ons and plan clarifications. This risk is compounded by the aff monopoly on pre-round prep and structural advantages in late developing debates</strong>. <br />
<strong>The net benefit is NATO Cohesion</strong> –  <br />
