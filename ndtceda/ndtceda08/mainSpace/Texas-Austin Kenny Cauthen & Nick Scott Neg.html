The Affirmative’s belief in the fantasy of security allows the us to remain hopeful in the peaceful resolution of war through their security guarantee. The problem with strategies such as the affirmative is it promises its subjects the ability to reunite with their lost enjoyment while never actually delivering on the goods. The result is the insulation of the ruling security ideology<br />
McGowan, 2007, (Todd, Prof of English @ Univ of Vermont, <u>The Real Gaze: Film Theory After Lacan</u>, p. 131-136)<br />
“Through its deployment of fantasy, the cinema of integration offers the spectator hope in the face of the…loss of the trauma of the gaze is at once the loss of the possibility of freedom.”<br />
<br />
The Guarantee provided by the affirmative is merely another example of the fantasy of security provided by the Big Other, this sustained belief creates a vicious cycle in which subjects begin to cede more and more of their freedoms in the name of security until ultimately it culminates in the creation of a fascist state<br />
McGowan, 2007, (Todd, Prof of English @ Univ of Vermont, <u>The Real Gaze: Film Theory After Lacan</u>, p. 110-112)<br />
“<em>Roma, cittd aperta</em> constitutes the spectator in a position of desire relative to the…process results in what I call the “cinema of integration.” ”<br />
The Affirmative is a healthy dose of ideology instead of coming to terms with the irrational nature of the international relations they only attempt to secure the international arena making sure nothing ever really changes. Unfortunately their hope sustained in security guarantees is misplaced as ideology only operates by never fulfilling its promise of security the result is only the creation of more threats to be secured by the West<br />
Daly, 2004, (Glyn, Risking the Impossible)<br />
“Zizek has been concerned crucially to demonstrate the way in which ideology serves to support…cynical assertion of the way things actually are.”<br />
The Threat of catastrophe utilized by the Affirmative in order to justify passage of the plan is not a break from Status Quo Bush Doctrine, But instead is the sustaining force behind today’s biopolitics. Life lived under this constant threat of annihilation is a life lived in a permanent state of emergency. Life deprived of the substance that makes it worth living.<br />
Zizek 2003, (Slavoj, Prof of Sociology @ Inst. For Sociology Ljjbljana Univ, <u>The Puppet and the Dwarf</u>, 94-99)<br />
“Insofar as “death” and “life” designate for Saint Paul two existential…the submission of Life to some higher Goal is.”<br />
<br />
<br />
In a world where every single action seems to only reinforce the dominany security ideology, What is our alternative you ask? We will commit to the Burden of rejoinder and defend the status quo. We ask you to come to terms with a world absent the World affirmative and accept their impacts as inevitable in their ideological universe. Only the refusal to participate in the forced choice provided by ideology explodes it at its weakest searching for new political action outside the confines of ideology.<br />
McGowan, 2007, (Todd, Prof of English @ Univ of Vermont, <u>The Real Gaze: Film Theory After Lacan</u>, p. 175-178)<br />
“THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN the theorist and the cinema as such becomes…enjoying at the expense of one’s symbolic identity.”<br />

The aff participates in a fantasy of harmony wherein underdeveloped Middle East is brought up to speed with the Western self. This fantasy encounters perpetual resistance in the form of new obstacles for the US to solve. What results is an endless relationship of domination and dependence where in The Middle East is presented as symbolically deficient and subordinate to the west.<br />

<br />
The affirmative is hardly a story about the Middle East. Instead, their fetishization of the Middle East and attempt to mold it in our image is a story about the Western self. This strange economy of desire results in homogenizing development policies, i.e. the plan, and demands violent outburst against threatening others to sustain itself.<br />

the affirmative depicts a world of capitalist enjoyment that has spiraled out of control—in an attempt to regain and redistribute enjoyment the affirmative &lt;insert specific link&gt;. this situates &lt;insert aff&gt; as the priviledged object of desire that signifies a past of true enjoyment. in the world of the affirmative we become constantly paranoid that somewhere there is an other consuming more than their fair share and stealing our rightful enjoyment. as a result the other becomes the focus of our desire and feelings of lack and dissatisfaction<br />

(Todd, Assoc. Prof of English @ Univ. of Vermont, The End of Dissatisfaction? Jacques Lacan and the Emerging Society of Enjoyment)<br />
<br />
this dream of achieving total peace and harmony necessitates the construction of a scapegoat to be violently eliminated. the frustrating inability of the affirmative to resolve and master the continual agonism at heart of society manifests itself in the creation of a scapegoat to be violently eliminated. this negation of human being is responsible for mass extermination and continual purging of the population in the name of the community<br />
STAVRAKAKIS 99, School of Politics University of Nottingham, (Yannis, Lacan and The Political p. 99-101)<br />
Our age is clearly… area (seminar of 18 June 1958).<br />
<br />
far from producing any type of subjective change the act performed by the aff is purely cynical insulating the hold of capitalist ideology leaving the subject perfectly docile and obedient.<br />

If the turn from prohibition… lead to freedom.<br />
<br />
instead of limiting our ethical action to the confines of ideology we have an apriori ethical obligation to confront the horrors of global capital. somethings may be worse than death, but we’ll never know since capitalism makes its victims anonymous.<br />
daly 2003<br />
(Glyn, Senior Lecturer in Politics in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at University College, Northampton “Risking The Impossible”)<br />
The notion of impossibility… exhorts us to risk the impossible.<br />
<br />
In the face of this violent drive to secure the fantasy of total enjoyment and social harmony we should give up. this radical act enables us to recognize the fractured and partial nature of enjoyment and thus break the hold of the symbolic law over us.<br />

(Todd, Assoc. Prof of English @ Univ. of Vermont, The End of Dissatisfaction? Jacques Lacan and the Emerging Society of Enjoyment)<br />
<br />
ONLY BY REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE WITHIN THE IDEOLOGICAL COORDINATES OF THE STATUS QUO CAN WE ACHIEVE AN AUTHENTIC POLITICAL ACT. THIS IMPOSSIBLE GESTURE EXPLODES THE DOMINANT IDEOLOGY AT ITS MOST VULNERABLE POINT, THAT OF OPTING FOR POLITICAL ACTION OUTSIDE THE MEANING THAT IDEOLOGY CAN PROVIDE.<br />
