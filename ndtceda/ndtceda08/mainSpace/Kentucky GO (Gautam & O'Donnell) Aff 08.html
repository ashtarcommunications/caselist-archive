2. Counter-interpretation: United States federal government is the national government of the United States<br />

<br />
&lt;federal, adj. Of or relating to a system of associated governments with a vertical division of governments into national and regional components having different responsibilities; esp., of or relating to the national government of the United States.&gt;<br />
<br />
3. More predictive—the resolution uses ‘United States federal government’ in the resolution—if we win our interpretation—ASPEC goes away<br />
<br />
4. cross-ex checks—they can ask us is cross-x we’ll give them answer—don’t listen to their lies—it’s a 10 second question<br />
<br />
5. our standards:<br />
a. limits—neg moots aff ground—on foreign policy the entire federal government has to act—specification is pointless<br />
b. ground—there is no ground loss—all neg links are based off the country we increase engagement with and whether or not plan increases foreign assistance, security guarantee, or both<br />
<br />
6. Turn: the alternative is over-specification allowing the affirmative to be able to get out of disad links—puts them in a double bind<br />
a. our above argument is true—there is no ground loss and thus no internal link to their impacts OR<br />
b. their interpretation tanks vital negative ground forcing debates to become about generics destroying topic specific education<br />
<br />
7. Reasonability: as long as we’re reasonably topical don’t vote us down. We’ll define this to mean if we win our defensive arguments—it will be enough to reject ASPEC<br />
<br />
8. Topicality not a voter<br />
a. in round abuse: if we don’t abuse them in round reject this argument<br />
b. potential abuse: don’t punish us for something we didn’t do<br />
