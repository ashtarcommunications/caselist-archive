“Blakck women find…exploitation and repress.”<br />
<br />
Direct face-to-face interaction is the only way to understand exploitation reject the idea that we can traslate theory into action<br />
Rajan 90, 47-49<br />
It ought to be…as an integral aspect.<br />

Freire 1970, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, p. 13<br />
Dialogue with the…power of oppression<br />
<br />
It is necessary to establish a framework of “problem-posing” education is response to the resolution in which the education is not merely prescribed and dictated onto the oppressed. Problem-posing education poses the resolution as a question to the oppressed where THEY create their own strategies for empowerment and liberation. This form of framework create their own humanization. Only a problem-posing education can establish a consciousness of empanicaption from the worst structural conditions<br />
Freire, chapter 2<br />

The 1nc begins with a skit of ‘Waiting for Godot’ – the two debaters try to decide whether they should wait around for Godot to come, or whether they should act on their own. This later becomes an analogy for the way in which the affirmative waits on predictions/external agents for the basis of their decision-making.<br />
Next, they use the example of Susan Sontag’s visit to Sarajevo and her participation in the play performance of ‘Waiting for Godot’. Like in the play, the audience was waiting for some external actor (like NATO or the UN) to come and save the people from the wars that are occuring.<br />
Debate should be about which methodology is best for the liberation of oppressed. This involves a rejection of debate technae and the assumption of objectivity. Their alternative is to constructively disengage. They explain the alternative is a rejection of objectivity and embraces the ability for individual subjectivity.<br />
They make arguments about why subjectivity and objectivity trade off and why this is the root cause of violence.<br />
They also read specific links to Michigan’s aff.<br />

The alt begins to be described as a rejection of filters of ideology when we engage others. This is an ethic of proximity and it rejects giving identity to institutions or role-playing.<br />
