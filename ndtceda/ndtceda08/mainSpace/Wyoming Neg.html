Wyoming CL Marx v. Critical Mish-Mash: 1NC<br />
<br />
Obs One: Foucault Flunks History<br />
<br />
1) The aff is a fundamental misreading of political and the reproduction of social relations. There is no such thing as the “biopolitical state’ that seeks to manage and control population for the sake of power. The state and capital move hand in glow—one cannot exist without the other. Only a total distance from the modern state can allow for the destruction of capital. Otherwise what is pushed out the door only comes back through the window<br />
<br />
Istavan Meszaros, prof Emeritus @ Univ of Sussex, 1995<br />
Beyond Capital: Towards a theory of Transition pg 65<br />
<br />
<br />
The modern state… ‘withering away’ of the state<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Furthermore, the absence of structural historicism is no mere oversight, nor is it enough to simply mention economics in a few of your cards—the reliance of identity-based politics is not an accidental instance of liberalism such politics particularizes the oppressions of capitalism to the point that the universal system is naturalized. Attaining white, male bourgeoisie privilege becomes the bench-mark of political success, re-entrenching the very foundation of the system<br />
<br />
Wendy Brown, Professor &amp;Genius, “Wounded Attachments”, Political Theory, 1993, pg 392-394<br />
<br />
This détente between…politicized marking<br />
<br />
<br />
3) The reduction of class to a neutral level among a long list of other oppressions such as race and gender destroys the emancipatory potential of class to teach across all lines of identity and forger political action. Class must be recognized as qualitatively ore important—otherwise the system is able to satisfy demands on grounds of formal equality. Destroying attempts to overcome capitalist oppression<br />

<br />
<br />
OBS 2: Moving on up?<br />
<br />
1) From the perspective of structural kritik, there can be no such thing as ‘making things better’—their model of politics, no matter how subversive or conservative, all fundamentally exaggerate the importance of the formal institution of politics and power ignoring the ways such a system creates knowledge—only a Marxist shift to the kritik the structure and create mass social consciousness will overcome this failure of politics<br />

<br />
to think about…has to be built<br />

2) The determinism of capital is responsible for the instumentalization of all life—it is this logic that mobilizes and allows for the 1AC’s scenarios in the first place<br />

<br />
For capitalism… is all to obvious<br />
<br />
3) There is no such thing as an ethical action that stands outside of politics—your ethical demand to come prior to the structural negation of capital is the large violation of ethics<br />
<br />
Istavan Meszaros, Prof of Emeritus @ Univ Sussex, 1995, Beyond capital: towards a Theory of Transition pg 409-410<br />
<br />
Poltical and morality.. of the recent pass<br />
<br />
4) Resistance to capital must be a total negation of the system from outside of government—while some inside political gains are possible, they are trumped by the ability of the system to use reforms to restabilize capital and marginalize labor as a social alternative<br />
<br />
Meszaros pg 738<br />
<br />
Thus the role of labour’s… power of capital<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5) So much for your perm—capitalism is an inertial system—any vestige left remaining by the perm will inevitably spin back up. Like a many-headed hydra, it will regenerate with ever attempt that attacks the instruments as opposed to the system itself<br />

<br />
Observation One: The Truth<br />
<br />
FIRST, THE AFFIRMATIVE FUNDAMENTALLY CONFUSES THE NATURE OF IDENTITY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF GENDER. A HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF IDENTITY FORMATION REVEALS MUCH—THE MANIFOLD IDENITY CATEGORIES THAT HAVE PUSHED CLASS ANALYSIS TO THE MARGIN ARE A STRATEGIC TOOL USED TO ERASE LINES OF POLITICAL COMMONALITY AMONG LABOR AND SHORE UP CAPITALISM<br />
<br />

[Rosemary, Profit and Pleasure: Sexual Identities in Late Capitalism, Routledge <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
The signs of an intensified class war are everywhere… … and institutional sites to address a host of concerns.<br />
<br />
SECOND, THEIR RELIANCE ON GENDER AS THE SITE OF POLITICAL CONTESTATION IS NOT AN ACCIDENTAL INSTANCE OF IGNORING CLASS. THE DEMAND ARISES OUT OF THE CRISIS OF LIBERALISM—SUCH POLITICS PARTICULARIZES THE OPPRESSIONS OF CAPITALISM TO THE POINT THAT THE UNIVERSAL SYSTEM IS NATURALIZED. ATTAINING WHITE, MALE BOURGEOISSE PRIVILEGE BECOMES THE BENCH-MARK OF POLITICAL SUCCESS, RE-ENTRENCHING THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE SYSTEM<br />

[Wendy, “Wounded Attachments”, Political Theory, Aug. p. 392-394</em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
Although this détente between universal and … …explicitly politicized marking.<br />
<br />
THIRD, THIS PARTICULARIZATION OF IDENTITY ALSO LOCALIZES KNOWLEDGE. THIS ERASES ANY SYSTEM THEORY THAT ALLOWS US TO SEE HOW SO MANY DIFFERENT CONTEXTUALIZED OPPRESSIONS ARE SUBORDINATED TO THE SAME FRAMEWORK—WE MUST ABANDON THIS METHOD OF KNOWLEDGE IN FAVOR OF A DIALECTICAL LENS THAT RENDERS CAPITALISM VISIBLE<br />
<br />
HENNESSY (Prof @ SUNY Albany) 2000<br />
[Rosemary, Profit and Pleasure: Sexual Identities in Late Capitalism, Routledge <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
While capitalism has always relied on … …they are shaped by and help support.<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION TWO: You Can’t Handle the Truth!<br />
<br />
FIRST, LEGAL ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE GENDER BIAS ARE ONLY A GUISE TO WIDEN THE CIRCLE OF PRODUCTION TO INCLUDE WOMEN, DOUBLING THEIR HARDSHIP. ONLY A CONCRETE FOCUS ON SUBSTANTITIVE, MATERIAL EQUALITY AMONG ALL PEOPLE WILL ALLOW FOR ANY PROGRESS AT ALL<strong>*<br />

<br />

Another vitally important dimension of … …material bases of substantive equality.<br />

SECOND, THE DETERMINISM OF CAPITAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INSTRUMENTALIZATION OF ALL LIFE—IT IS THIS LOGIC THAT MOBILIZES AND ALLOWS FOR THE OPPRESSIONS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE 1AC<br />

OBSERVATION THREE: The Third Observation<br />
<br />
Vote Negative to validate and adopt the method of structural/historical criticism that is the 1NC.<br />
<br />
FIRST, THIS IS NOT THE ALTERNATIVE, BUT IN TRUTH THE ONLY OPTION—A RADICAL SOCIALIST REIMAGINATION OF POLITICS IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS OF CAPITAL—INSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL ACTION IS THE ROAD TO NOWHERE AS CAPITALIST INERTIA WILL DESTROY ANY RADICAL COMPONENT<br />

[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, <em>wyo]<br />
<br />
p. 451<br />
Given the existing social division … …becomes feasible at all.<br />
<br />
SECOND, RESISTANCE TO CAPITAL MUST BE A TOTAL NEGATION OF THE SYSTEM FROM OUT-SIDE OF GOVERNMENT—WHILE SOME INSIDE POLITICAL GAINS ARE POSSIBLE, THEY ARE TRUMPED BY THE ABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO USE REFORMS TO RESTABILIZE CAPITAL AND MARGINALIZE LABOR AS A SOCIAL ALTERNATIVE<br />

<br />
FOURTH, SO MUCH FOR YOUR PERMUTATION—CAPITALISM IS AN INERTIAL SYSTEM—ANY VESITAGE LEFT REMAINING BY THE PERMUTATION WILL INEVITABLY SPIN BACK UP. LIKE A MANY-HEADED HYDRA, IT WILL REGENERATE WITH EVERY ATTEMPT THAT ATTACKS THE INSTRUMENTS AS OPPOSSED TO THE SYSTEM ITSELF<strong>*<br />

WYO JS Neg v. Milliken<br />
<br />
INC Marx v. Milliken Race Affs<br />
<br />
Observation One: The Theory of Race<br />
<br />
FIRST, RACE AND CLASS ARE DIALECTICALLY CONJOINED IN THE REPRODUCTION OF CAPITALIST RELATIONS—CAPITALISM RACIALIZES SUBJECTS TO ENTRENCH COMPETITION AND DESTROY UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS AS WELL AS SUSTAINS WHITE RACISM AS A METHOD OF PAPERING OVER CONTRADICTIONS. ALL OF THIS IS USED TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM OF CAPITAL ACCUMULATION<br />
<br />
SAN JUAN (Fulbright Lecturer @ Univ. of Leuven, Belgium) 2003<br />
[E., “Marxism and the Race/Class Problematic: A Re-Articulation”, p. online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://clogic.eserver.org/2003/sanjuan.html" rel="nofollow">http://clogic.eserver.org/2003/sanjuan.html</a> <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
It seems obvious that racism cannot be dissolved by instances of status mobility when sociohistorical circumstances change gradually or are transformed by … …changing structures and retooled practices of domination and subordination.<br />
<br />
SECOND, THE REDUCTION OF CLASS TO A NEUTRAL LEVEL AMONG A LONG LIST OF OTHER OPPRESSIONS SUCH AS RACISM DESTROYS THE EMANCIPATORY POTENTIAL OF CLASS TO REACH ACROSS ALL LINES OF INDENTITY AND FORGE POLITICAL ACTION. CLASS MUST BE RECOGNIZED AS QUALITATIVELY MORE IMPORTANT—OTHERWISE THE SYSTEM IS ABLE TO SATISFY DEMANDS ON GROUNDS OF FORMAL EQUALITY, DESTROYING ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME CAPITALIST OPPRESSION*<br />
<br />
GIMENEZ (Prof. Sociology at UC Boulder) 2001<br />
[Martha, “Marxism and Class; Gender and Race”, Race, Gender and Class, Vol. 8, p. online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.colorado.edu/Sociology/gimenez/work/cgr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.colorado.edu/Sociology/gimenez/work/cgr.html</a></em> wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
There are many competing theories of race, gender, class, American society, political economy, power,… … interactions grounded in &quot;intersectionality&quot; is class power.<br />
<br />
THIRD, THE ABSENCE OF STRUCTURAL HISTORICISM IS NO MERE OVERSIGHT, NOR IS IT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY MENTION ECONOMICS IN A FEW OF YOUR CARDS—THE RELIANCE OF INDENTY-BASED POLITICS IS NOT AN ACCIDENTAL INSTANCE OF IGNORING CLASS. THE DEMAND ARISES OUT OF THE CRISIS OF LIBERALISM—SUCH POLITICS PARTICULARIZES THE OPPRESSIONS OF CAPITALISM TO THE POINT THAT THE UNIVERSAL SYSTEM IS NATURALIZED. ATTAINING WHITE, MALE BOURGEOISSE PRIVILEGE BECOMES THE BENCH-MARK OF POLITICAL SUCCESS, RE-ENTRENCHING THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE SYSTEM<br />
<br />
BROWN (Professor &amp; Genius) 1993<br />
[Wendy, “Wounded Attachments”, Political Theory, Aug. p. 392-394<em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
Although this détente between universal and particular within liberalism… … bound to the explicitly politicized marking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Implications<br />
<br />
IDENTIFICATION THROUGH RACE ALLOWS THE CO-OPTATION OF GOALS BY THE MINORITY ELITE—THEY WILL SACRIFICE EMANCIPATION TO PROTECT THEIR PRIVILEGE, FEEDING THEIR OWN PEOPLE INTO THE GENOCIDAL SYSTEM OF CAPITAL.<br />

<br />
THE DETERMINISM OF CAPITAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INSTRUMENTALIZATION OF ALL LIFE—IT IS THIS LOGIC THAT MOBILIZES AND ALLOWS FOR THE 1AC’S SCENARIOS IN THE FIRST PLACE<br />
<br />
DYER-WITHERFORD (professor of Library and Info. Sciences at the U of Western Ontario) 1999<br />
[Nick. Cyber Marx: Cycles and Circuits of Struggle in High Technology Capitalism.]<br />

OBSERVATION THREE: Our Politics<br />
<br />
Vote Negative to validate and adopt the method of structural/historical criticism that is the 1NC.<br />
<br />
THIS IS NOT THE ALTERNATIVE, BUT IN TRUTH THE ONLY OPTION—A RADICAL SOCIALIST REIMAGINATION OF POLITICS IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS OF CAPITAL—INSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL ACTION IS THE ROAD TO NOWHERE AS CAPITALIST INERTIA WILL DESTROY ANY RADICAL COMPONENT<br />
<br />
<strong>MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 1995<br />
[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition,</strong> </em>wyo]<br />
<br />
p. 451<br />
Given the existing social division of labour, this questioning in the … …of socialist economic aims first becomes feasible at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
SECOND, RESISTANCE TO CAPITAL MUST BE A TOTAL NEGATION OF THE SYSTEM FROM OUT-SIDE OF GOVERNMENT—WHILE SOME INSIDE POLITICAL GAINS ARE POSSIBLE, THEY ARE TRUMPED BY THE ABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO USE REFORMS TO RESTABILIZE CAPITAL AND MARGINALIZE LABOR AS A SOCIAL ALTERNATIVE<br />
<br />
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 1995<br />
[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition,<em> wyo]<br />
<br />
p. 738<br />
Thus the role of labour’s extra-parliamentary movement is twofold…. …— is a vital precondition for countering the massive extra-parliamentary power of capital.<br />
<br />
THIRD, METHODOLOGY IS THE FOREMOST POINT OF DEPARTURE TO ANY POLITICAL QUERY. YOU SHOULD EVALUATE EPISTEMOLOGY FIRST BECAUSE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT PROBLEMS DETERMINES HOW YOU RESPOND TO THEM AND THE CONSEQUENCES THEY ENGENDER<br />

<br />
FOURTH, THE OPPRESSION AND VIOLENCE OF CAPITAL WILL SUSTAIN THEMSELVES UNTIL WE ALL IDENTIFY WITH THE UNIVERSAL OF CLASS AND RISE UP AS ONE<br />
<br />
AVAKIAN (Chairman of Revolutionary Communist Party) 1999<br />
[Bob, “We Have a New Millenium—What we Need is a New World”, Revolutionary Worker #1036, Dec. 26, p. online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://rwor.org/a/v21/1030-039/1036/millenium.htm" rel="nofollow">http://rwor.org/a/v21/1030-039/1036/millenium.htm</a><em> wyo-tjc]<br />

<br />
2NC A2 Perm<br />
<br />
THE PERMUTATION IS WORSE THAN THE PLAN BECAUSE IT MORE STRONGLY VALIDATES THE ABILITY OF CAPITALISM TO FIX IT’S OWN PROBLEMS—COMPROMISING OUR RADICAL POLITICS THROUGH ANY ARTICULATION OF A SPECIFIC SHORT-TERM DEMANDS COMPLETELY SHORT-CIRCUITS THE ALTERNATIVE<br />
<br />
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 1995<br />
[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, </em>wyo]<br />
<br />
p. 930<br />
THE difficulty is that the ‘moment’ of radical politics is strictly … …dictated by the established socioeconomic structure in crisis.<br />
<br />
SINGLE ISSUE RESISTANCE IS EASILY CO-OPTED AND MARGINALIZED—LABOR IS THE ONLY ISSUE THAT CANNOT BE INTEGRATED AND DESTROYED BY CAPITAL—THIS UNIVERSAL IS KEY TO UPROOT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM<br />

<br />
Wyoming PS<br />
Judge: Scott Harris<br />
<br />
<br />
Judge Comments: 1AR coverage issues. Still win if there was a solvency deficit on the counter plan. No substantive debating in the 1AR that congress can check the courts. Challenged and fought for years at the lower level. There is no reason for them to resolve these racism issues making racism inevitable. CP sucks up enough of the case that it’s a try or die for the negative. No argument that the CP can’t solve the other type or racism. More of the Doctrines that create it than any symbolic reason. Going for the perm more may have worked.<br />
