ETHICS<br />
Root cause arguments are too generic<br />
Catastrophic impacts outweigh self-righteous absolute Morality<br />

At worst, counterplan means you can use utilitarianism<br />
Cross apply cross-ex – they admit that all human life is valuable.<br />
Policy impact potential mandates evaluating consequences<br />
Nye, 86 (Nuclear Ethics, p 33-4)<br />
While the cosmopolitan approach has the virtue ... in human history.<br />
Abortion is not performed by the state, we have to engage in calculation.<br />
Lack of 100% certainty doesn’t make things not real world<br />
Goodin, 1990 (The Utilitarian Response)<br />
My larger argument turns on the proposition ... grained for that.<br />

Begin by noting that the right to be free ... of a legal right.<br />
Anti-abortion laws are the foundation of discrimination against women<br />

Agamben K<br />
Rights more deeply inscribe the value of life into the state order. The protection of life so easily slides into control of life because of the biopolitical grounding of power. Unmasking this relationship is the only way to prevent a backsliding of democracy to totalitarianism and from biopolitics to the politics of death.<br />
Agamben, 95 (Homo Sacer: Soverign Power and Bare Life, p. 120-123)<br />
Karl Lowith was the first to define...<br />
Once the state has taken on the burden of protecting life, it cannot function without it, so the state of exception becomes permanent<br />
Agamben, 95, 174-176<br />
In this light, the birth of the ... of the planet.<br />
Alternative text: Reject the affirmative plan on the grounds that it expands biopolitics.<br />
<hr />
Biopolitics is not inevitable and that each act of rejection opens up space for whatever being. This is existence for its own sake, not assigned value by rights, some ethical appeal for the Other, or any other attribute that gives it external value. The Permutation is impossible because this conception of Being is the opposite of expanding rights based protections.<br />
Caldwell, Theory and Event, 7:2, 2004<br />
Bio-sovereignty results from a particular ... whatever life, appears.<br />
Rights are applied at the whim of sovereign power. Governments claim to be applying the law while contradicting the law with impunity. The state of exception is not a temporary condition that can be corrected with rights.<br />
Agamben, 2005, The State of Exception, 86-87<br />
The aim of this investigation ... global civil war.<br />
Finally, there are three reasons why Agamben is preferable to “realism” in the abstract and more accurate description of world events. Liberal reforms are complciit with the powers that they claim to fight in the world we actually inhabit.<br />
a) Agamben is better able to explain modern horrors<br />
b) Rights are failing now<br />
c) Rights are less and less useful as you move to margins<br />
Norris, 2005 (Politics, Metaphysics, and Death: Essays on Girogio Agamben’s Homo Sacer, 12-15)<br />
Now, the mere existence of camps ... a bipolitical body<br />
Counterplan – 10th amendment<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey on 10th amendment grounds, holding that there is no constitutionally protected right to an abortion and that abortion policymaking will be left to the state. The Supreme Courts of the 50 states and relevant judicial actors in the territories should rule on the grounds of state and territorial constitutions that unborn children have a constitutionally protected right to life.<br />
<br />
Federalism<br />
Devolution of abortion to the states reinvigorates federalism and solves the case<br />
Forsythe and Presser, 2006 (10 Tex. Rev. Law &amp; Pol. 301, Spring)<br />
In order to return policy-making... authority to do so.<br />
Abortion is a critical issue for federalism<br />
Wardle 1999 (The quandary of pro-life free speech, 62 alb. l. rev. 853)<br />
The Roe decision “constitutionalized” ... self-restraint in Roe.<br />
The counterplan reinvigorates state constitutionalism, which is key to federalism modeling worldwide<br />
Kincaid, 1995 (summer, John, Rutgers Law Journal)<br />
Given that it is increasingly necessary to think ... into reactionary authoritarianism.<br />
Federalism stops global wars<br />
Ornstein, 1992 (The American Enterprise, v3 n1)<br />
No word in political theory ... new focus on federalism.<br />
India models U.S. federalism<br />
Smith,<br />

<br />
India’s stable now, but now is the key to to avoid ethnic conflict<br />

Ethnic conflict causes nuclear war.<br />

<strong>McWhorter K – 1NC</strong><br />
The search for solutions is the source of the problem. Each of our efforts at control brings about new crises and new solutions and still new crises in an escalating cycle of serial policy failure. Their claim to finally have it right, to finally have the balance of policy prescriptions is just the latest grasp at control through calculative thought that is the root of the problem. What needs to be re-thought is the search for solutions itself. Doing nothing in the face of crisis gives us a way to break free.<br />
LaDelle McWhorter, Heidegger and the Earth, 1992, p. vii-viii<br />
Thinking today must concern AND new possibilities<br />
Claiming to present an objective picture of the world that is ready for management – i.e. the simple picture of a world ready for democracy, ready to be manipulated, closes off questions of being.<br />
Spanos, Heidegger and Criticism: Reviving the Cultural Politics of Destruction, 1993, p. 31-33<br />
Similarly, and by extension AND of (temporal) being<br />
Democracy promotion is just another component of the eclipse of Being lock ourselves into absolute war against difference. Rejection of the underlying forces motivating this lock step of military and industry is a pre-requisite to contemplating Being.<br />
Andrew Mitchell, Heidegger and Terrorism, Research in Phenomenology. Pittsburgh: 2005, Vol. 35, p. 181, Proquest<br />
If we wished to name AND than in today’s America<br />
Reduction of Being to standing reserve is the root cause of war and terrorism. When we think in terms of threats to the population, we all become replaceable in the calculus of decision makers, and war can go on forever. As with the war on terror, the line between war and peace, or civilian and soldier, are blurred. The whole world has become a battlefield.<br />
Mitchell, above, p. 181<br />
With everything available as standing-reserve AND beings have become uncommon<br />
The fantasy of control obliterates other types of knowledge – it is impossible to do both. Morever, the calculative approach reduces all Being to meaningless standing reserve.<br />
McWhorter, above, p. vii-viii<br />
In order to approach AND under human control<br />
Our critique of the idea that we can survive environmental destruction through proper management. By saving one part of an ecosystem, they create a myth that we can survive despite our domination of another. The race to find solutions excludes reflection on the ‘mystery of Being’ that makes all life meaningful.<br />
McWhorter, above, p. vii-viii<br />
Today, on all sides of ecological debate AND revealing and concealing<br />
The affirmative’s demand that we act as managers of the environment and therefore avert ecological catastrophe locks us into a fantasy of control. This ignores that control is never possible and forgets that the thoughtless deployment of technology is what brought us to the brink of ecological catastrophe in the first place.<br />
McWhorter, above, p. vii-viii<br />
Paradox is the titillating other AND rather than destroy, the earth<br />
ALTERNATIVE: Do nothing<br />
Alt solves – refusing to act, even in the face of annihilation, will release us from the trap of managerial thinking that brought us to the brink of catastrophe in the first place<br />
McWhorter, above, p. vii-viii<br />
The inauthentic way to approach death is to fear it and try to control it – allowing us to ignore its inevitable nature. The authentic mode is dread – where we use the possibility of death as a means of contemplating our finit existence. Instead of looking to control the world, we think of our place within it. One of the best ways to access Being is to think of the opposite – non-existence.<br />
Michael Gelven, A Commentary on Heidegger’s Being and Time, 1989, p. 150<br />
We must now turn AND from the face of death<br />
AT Framework<br />
Framework is self-serving apologia for debate &amp; the world – they structurally constrain what is acceptable AND create conditions for a dead culture that can only serve to dominate those who it does not include. Vote neg to disrupt this deeply authoritarian conservative fantasy.<br />
Isobel Armstrong, The Radical Aesthetic, 2000, p. 9-10<br />
Communality looks attractive AND ungenerous formalism<br />
Confining discourse to policy debates constructs a regime of truth that makes the constructed nature of their harms and solvency – this undermines their entire explanation of the world.<br />
Steve Smith, Review of International Studies, Cambridge journals online, 1997<br />
By focusing on the policy debate AND matter of common sense<br />
<br />
<strong>K 2NC</strong><br />
AT “People are suffering”<br />
Reps of suffering – justify colonialist sense of imperial responsibility, commodify the experience and deploy it for our own strategic ends rather than truly for the other, and images of suffering desensitize and overwhelm us – resulting in less political action.<br />
Arthur &amp; Joan Klienman, Daedalus, Winter 1996<br />
But what of the horrors experienced AND exhaustion of empathy, and political despair<br />
“No alt” = link – ignores constructed nature of sovereignty and assumes its natural – this forecloses possibility of resistance<br />
Karena Shaw, 9 Transnational Law &amp; Contemporary Problems 569, 1999<br />
The dangers of assuming sovereignty AND natural rather than political<br />
Assumption that realism is inevitable naturalizes violence and is responsible for its worst acts<br />
Campbell, National Deconstruction, 1998, p. 183<br />
At the same time AND we resist such violence<br />
Acceptance of existing liberal order is the only utopian project – vote neg<br />
Zizek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, 2000, p. 321-326<br />
