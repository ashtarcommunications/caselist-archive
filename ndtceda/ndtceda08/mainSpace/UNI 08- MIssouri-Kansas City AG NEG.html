<br />
The desire for mastery and control the affirmative replicates only creates ressentiment for our current existence. Such hatred and search for a new life makes life laughable and makes extinction desirable. <br />
Nietzsche, 86 – German Philosopher – 1886(Friedrich, “Beyond Good and Evil”, Page 342) <br />
[225. Whether it be hedonism, pessimism… <u>elevations of humanity hitherto?]</u> <br />
<br />
Take the risk of exposing yourself to violent impacts and abandon the desire for control. Refuse to engage the 1AC as way of embracing the unknowable aspects of life. This risks danger but your mortality is a certainty. The alternative is the only way to bring meaning to life by living life eventfully through a rolling of the dice. <br />
Deleuze. 83 – French Philosopher – 1983(Gilles, “Nietzsche and Philosophy”, Page 25-27) <br />
<u>[The game has two moments which… of the fatally obtained number.]</u> <br />

Courts CP<br />
Text: in a relevant test case, the US supreme Court will rule that the federal domestic subsidies for CAFO’s are not constitutional<br />

Paradise Professor of Natural Resources Law, Stanford Law School, and Visiting Fellow, Hoover institutions, Stanford University<br />
[Nevertheless, the growing focus over the last two decades on reducing federal spending…..challengin similar subsidy programs]<br />
<br />
Courts can solve animal cruelty laws<br />
Lovvorn in 2k6(Jonathan, Vice President of Animal Protection Litigation for the Humane Soceity of the United States, A Professor of animal at Lewis &amp; Clark Law School, <u>Animal law,</u> “animal alw in action: the law, public perception, and the limits of animal rights theory as a basis for legal reform”, LN)<br />
