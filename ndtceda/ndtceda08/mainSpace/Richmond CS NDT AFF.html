No link – we still use DU, you assume things like poverty<br />

reasons to preven intepretation<br />
<br />
history proves<br />
<br />
precision- our intepretation is the only one that distinguishes between conditional and constructive engagement<br />
<br />
baker, 2000 [Pauline, Honey and Vinegar: incentives, sanctions, and foreign policy]<br />
<br />
ground- neg still get appeasement da, condition cp, and still gets qpq args sometimes because our interp doesn’t exclude qpq<br />
<br />
limits- there is a limit to the number of things the US can give to each topic coutry that is in the literature theier intepre allows l of our affirmatives and multiples of them by any minute condition that is in the literature<br />
<br />
Disads to their interpretation<br />
<br />
Aff Ground- their interp allows unconditional cp and change the quo cp<br />
<br />
Bidirectionality- they allow the affirmative to concede say no arguments- this guts all ink ground to diads and solvency arguments, crushes neg ground. This allows hardliners affirmatives based on the target country saying no- explodes the research burden<br />
<br />
Precision- other words in the resolution are mooted out by their interp.<br />

Round # 2<br />
vs Team: Kansas BJ<br />
Judge: Arnett Miller Watson<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan Text The United State federal government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan by offering them a security guarantee not to use depleted uranim munitions against Afghanistan and by offering them a substantial increase in assistance that includes all necessary resources and funding to enforce US army regulation 700-48, including conducting a systematic risk assessment of the areas exposed to depleted uranium and the decontamination and clean-up of areas affected by depleted uranium<br />
<br />
1ac w/ cites<br />
Contention 1 – You don’t have to be a QPQ<br />
1. There was an explicit unconditional carrot approach to South Africa (Toler, 1982, “Constructive Engagement Reactionary Pragmatism At Its Best Issue: A Journal of Africanist Opinion Vol. ¾)<br />
2. this is the opposite of threatening pressure if the host country fails to meet the quo (irving 4)<br />
Contention 2 – Engagement Now<br />
1) Poppy Aid<br />
2)15 billion with 12 more on the way (Walker 7)<br />
3) International Engagement in Afghanistan (UN Security Council, March 12, 2008, “Afghanistan’s political transition faces serious challenges – UN Report”<br />
4) Cheney talks with Karzai (JPost, 3/20)<br />
5) More troops (ForeignPolicy.com, 3/18)<br />
6) $100 million a day (AFP, 3/26)<br />
7) Increasing AID (Media Newswire, 3/21)<br />
Contention 3 – Inherency<br />
1) 3000 tons of depleted uranium was droped on Afghanistan in the first 12 months of combat and the recent air strikes dropped another 250 tons (World Prout Assembly, 7/7/06, “Doing the Wrong Thing in Afghanistan – Depleted Uranium: the Definitive Moral Paradox”)<br />
2) And, the US continues to ignore Army Regulation 700-448 which would require decontamination and clean up of depleted uranium (Rokke, 7/24/06, “Depleted Uranium Situation Worsens Requiring Immediate Action By President Bush”)<br />
Advantage 1 – Cancer<br />
1) Initials estimates suggest that a staggering 12 million individuals will have cancer within the next 10 years because of depleted uranium bombing campaign (World Prout Assembly, 7/7/06, “Doing the Wrong Thing in Afghanistan – Depleted Uranium: the Definitive Moral Paradox”)<br />
2) The US’ willingness to resign the Afghani to this fate is the greatest atrocity ((World Prout Assembly, 7/7/06, “Doing the Wrong Thing in Afghanistan – Depleted Uranium: the Definitive Moral Paradox”)<br />
3) We should embrace a precautionary principle (Bertell, 99)<br />
4) The precautionary principle is the best framework which to evaluate impacts (Jordan, 98)<br />
5) The PP stands for democratic justice – refusal to give primacy to this commitment provides a pitful response to the most fundamental question of our time (Low and Gleeson, 98)<br />
Advantage 2 – Nuclear Taboo<br />
The use of depleted uranium munitions in Afghanistan slips nuclear war under our noses (Moret 4)<br />
Depleted uranium munitions are a clear violation of the nuclear threshold (The Sunday Herald, 03)<br />
Depleted uranium munitions are a crime against humanity and allow the US to drop the bomb without a word of outcry (Weitzel, 7)<br />
The US should implement a clean up program for depleted uranium and ban future use ( Rokke, 1)<br />
The US has a responsibility to clean up and decontaminate areas affected by its use of depleted uranium (The Guardian, 2003)<br />
Finally, systematic risk assessments of the effects of depleted uranium for those exposed to depleted uranium need to be enacted (Williams, 2)<br />
Foreign assistance can be an effective forum for political contestation and Afghan intervention spills over (Faulkner, 2)<br />
