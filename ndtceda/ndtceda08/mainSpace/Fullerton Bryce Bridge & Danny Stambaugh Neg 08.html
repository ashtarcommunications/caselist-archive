 <strong>Feast/Security K</strong> – argued the plan engages in “the Feast”; a focus on fear and security that causes us to ignore ongoing atrocities. The impact is Callahan ’74. They parody the “the Feast”, by engaging in “the Carnival”: ie, laugh at life, fear, etc. They read a spoof politics d/a that talks about Bush’s election in 2004.<br />

There can be no doubt…world authority can do this.<br />
<br />
Framework<br />
Our framework is hypothesis testing. The plan is a hypothesis that must be tested with multiple altaernatives. It doesn’t matter if the alternatives are compatible or not. This is key to finding the truth and is especially necessary in an adversarial contest. Debaters are not advocates or we’d talk slower. We are more like political scientists. Hypothesis testing is the method of political science. Professor timothy shortell, no date, accessed September 8, 2007. Professory of political science at UCLA. Shortell.org<br />
<br />
The social sciences, such as sociology…we call this process specification.
