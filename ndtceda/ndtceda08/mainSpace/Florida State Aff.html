<br />
Observation One: Inherency<br />
<br />
First, the Hamdan decision was all bark but no bite?US detention policy remains unchanged at Guantanamo.<br />
WILSON, Associate in a Washington, D.C. law firm, and one of the habeas counsel representing Guantanamo Bay detainees, 2006<br />
[Elizabeth A., ?ARTICLE: THE WAR ON TERRORISM AND &quot;THE WATER'S EDGE&quot;: SOVEREIGNTY, &quot;TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION,&quot; AND THE REACH OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION IN THE GUANTANAMO DETAINEE LITIGATION,? University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law, p. l/n]<br />
<br />
And, Quirin is the foundation of Supreme Court judicial deference.<br />
TURLEY 2002 (Jonathan, Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at The George Washington University Law School, Tribunals and Tribulations: The Antithetical Elements of Military Governance in a Madisonian Democracy, GWU Law Review 2002, Lexis)<br />
<br />
And, Quirin is key to creating the modern military judicial system.<br />
O?CONNOR 2000 (John F., Associate for Steptoe &amp; Johnson, LLP, The Origins and Application of the Military Deference Doctrine, University of Georgia Law Review, Fall 2000, Lexis)<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Harms<br />
<br />
The Court allows the military to operate independently, allowing to function under the ?separate but equal? doctrine.<br />
TURLEY 2002 (Jonathan, Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at The George Washington University Law School, Tribunals and Tribulations: The Antithetical Elements of Military Governance in a Madisonian Democracy, GWU Law Review 2002, Lexis)<br />
<br />
And, the rules of military tribunals are designed to deny judicial review in order to secure convictions.<br />
TURLEY 2002 (Jonathan, Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at The George Washington University Law School, Tribunals and Tribulations: The Antithetical Elements of Military Governance in a Madisonian Democracy, GWU Law Review 2002, Lexis)<br />
<br />
Thus, we offer the following plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin [317 U.S. 1 (1942)] on the grounds that military judicial jurisdiction over non-disciplinary matters violates due process.<br />
<br />
We reserve the right to clarify intent.<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Separation of Powers<br />
<br />
Military tribunals are the greatest manifestation of the doctrine of a separate military society and poses the greatest threat to Separation of Powers.<br />
TURLEY 2002 (Jonathan, Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at The George Washington University Law School, Tribunals and Tribulations: The Antithetical Elements of Military Governance in a Madisonian Democracy, GWU Law Review 2002, Lexis)<br />
<br />
And, a lack of checks on the executive leads to tyranny and nuclear war.<br />
REDISH and CISAR 1991 (Martin and Elizabeth, Duke Law Journal, December 1991, 1991 Duke L.J. 449)<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Civil Military Relations<br />
<br />
First, separate military and civil societies undermines legitimacy and expands the civil-military gap.<br />
TURLEY 2002 (Jonathan, Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at The George Washington University Law School, Tribunals and Tribulations: The Antithetical Elements of Military Governance in a Madisonian Democracy, GWU Law Review 2002, Lexis)<br />
<br />
And, the CMR split risks destroying civilian control.<br />
DUNLAP 1994 (Charles, Wake Forest University Law Review Summer 1994, Welcome to the Junta: The Erosion of Civilian Control of the US Military)<br />
<br />
And, civilian control is necessary for the preservation of democracy.<br />
KOHN 1997 (Richard, Professor of History at the University of North Carolina, June 1997, John M. Olin Institute for Strategic Studies at Harvard, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://data.fas.harvard.edu/cfia/olin/pubs/no1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://data.fas.harvard.edu/cfia/olin/pubs/no1.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
Advantage Three: The Feres Doctrine<br />
<br />
First, the Feres Doctrine is a product of military deference that promulgates racism in non-combat areas of the military.<br />
TURLEY 2002 (Jonathan, Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at The George Washington University Law School, Tribunals and Tribulations: The Antithetical Elements of Military Governance in a Madisonian Democracy, GWU Law Review 2002, Lexis)<br />
<br />
And, the Feres Doctrine justifies Nazism which legitimizes Nazi crimes against humanity.<br />
SENTINAL 1996 (The Sentinal, March 11, 1996)<br />
<br />
Advantage Four: Korematsu<br />
<br />
First, the existence of the Internment Laws provides the Executive with a tool used for the justification of any action, despite that actions Constitutionality.<br />
WATANABE 2004 (Nathan, JD Candidate at the University of Southern California School of Law, Internment, Civil Liberties, and a Nation in Crisis, Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal)<br />
<br />
And, Korematsu is genocide in America in the 21st Century. Racism fuels government power to establish concentration camps and destroy the next group it labels as ?the enemy.?<br />
SHIVANI 2002 (Anis, August 13-19, CounterPunch, What?s Next?Concentration Camps?)<br />
<br />
Observation Three: Solvency<br />
<br />
Limiting military jurisdiction to disciplinary matters solves best.<br />
