Red state support is key to McCain victory<br />

Key to US-India Relations- Obama<br />

<br />
Key to avoid India-Pakistan war that escalates to extinction<br />

<br />
Subsidy system is key to the entire GMO industry Allen 04 (Will, “the war on bugs”, jan) “billions of dollars in corporate welfare” “a serious and fatal blow”<br />
<br />
Biofuels are key- demand is key to convincing the pubic that GM crops are safe Marrero 08 (Carmelo Ruiz, “biotech bets on Agrofuels”) “biotechnology companies have become some of the main movers”<br />
<br />
Public support of GMOs is key to the survival of the industry Helgren et al 00 (Karin, “genetically modified foods: consumer views and regulations around the world”) “the security of knowing that Biotech is safe”<br />

<strong>Irigaray</strong><br />
The affirmatives attempt to deconstruction the logocentric practices that undergrid the enframing of the world in the age of the world picture formulates a relationship to language and Being that is fundamentally masculine by denying the mother-son connection. The aff act as independent makers of the world but this effaces that self-creation is impossible. This means that they have a poor relationship to being – only the alternative can activate always already present connections of sexual difference as a starting point for tearing down the ontotheological tradition<br />
Faulkner, professor of philosophy university of Alberta, 2K1<br />
(Joanne, Amnesia at the Beginning of Time: Irigaray’s reading of Heidegger in The<br />
Forgetting of Air Contertemps 2 may )<br />
According to Irigaray, the unrepresentable and irrecoverable debt to the mother...must be thought through.<br />
<br />
The impact to the continuation of the phallocentric western culture is the consumption of the feminine producing the subjugation of women and replicating the cornerstone of western identity construction<br />
Franks, doctoral candidate oxford university, 2K3<br />
(Mary Anne, Obscene Undersides: Women and Evil between the Taliban and the United States Hypatia 18.1)<br />
<br />
Though Baudrillard can hardly be called a feminist, his... which in many ways women also do not exist.<br />
<br />
Vote negative to reject the politics of aff and in order to inhabit the silence of the 1ac- our alternative begins with sexual difference as the point of departure from the dominate culture- this is crucial to avoiding the erasure of feminine subjectivity of the aff and the squo – our alternative solves 100% of the aff because ending the exploitation of women is crucial to recasting the social order<br />
Franks, doctoral candidate oxford university, 2K3<br />
(Mary Anne, Obscene Undersides: Women and Evil between the Taliban and the United States Hypatia 18.1)<br />
