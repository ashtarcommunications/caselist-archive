We just accept the dynamic status quo in which alternatives to capitalism are emerging. They can't perm because they try to put capitalism back together again, a reaction which reflects fear of a system beyond capitalism. It is this fear of “what might happen” reflected in their 1AC advantages that keep us enslaved to global capital and it militaristic machine of death.</span><br />
