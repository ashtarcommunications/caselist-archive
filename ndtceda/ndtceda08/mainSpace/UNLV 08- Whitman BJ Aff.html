 Construction Work 1AC – 1/8 Genealogy<br />
I used to read policy arguments until Butler and Derrida blew my mind open better than LSD ever did.  Now I think that the way that debate functions for most people fosters a violent and privileged worldview.  I think that our sense of community is exclusive and based on violent ways of approaching knowledge.  This affirmative is an attempt to investigate the topic in a way that accesses a critical pedagogy.  Negative strategies that endorse Enlightenment-style epistemologies will be critiqued for doing so.<br />
<br />
First is some history.<br />
<br />
Farm subsidies were first given in the 1930s as an aid to poor farmers, but there is now a vast subsidy apparatus that supports corporations at the expense of people.  Specifically, subsidies have been used as a tool to of neo-liberal trade to benefit corporations and keep Jamaica from raising its own food, forcing many into starvation<br />
Philadelphia Inquirer, 5-6-2002, “Why U.S. Farm Subsidies Are Bad for the World,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0506-09.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0506-09.htm</a><br />
&quot;Last year, I wrote about a documentary called Life and Debt that examined how globalization had affected ordinary people's lives in &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;countries to reduce their own agricultural subsidies.&quot;<br />

Construction Work 1AC – 2/8 Brown Neolib Internal<br />
Neoliberalism demands that all activity be conceptualized in terms of economic rationality.  This discourse of rationality is the way in which individual agency is disabled and humans are reduced to calculi of utility.<br />
Wendy Brown, Professor of political theory at the University of Berkley, 2004, “Neoliberalism and the Collapse of Liberal Democracy”, John Hopkins Press, Muse<br />
&quot;While Lemke, following Foucault, is careful to mark some of the differences between Ordo-liberal thought and its successor and &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;&quot;homeland security.&quot; &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Construction Work 1AC – 3/8 Brown Neolib Impact<br />
The hollowness of the liberalism’s promises is the reason for this violence.  Neo-liberalism is authoritarian imperialism.  It requires and facilitates endless war and the Orwellian deployment of democratic rhetoric at the same time democratic values are suspended.<br />
Wendy Brown, Professor of political theory at the University of Berkley, 2004, “Neoliberalism and the Collapse of Liberal Democracy”, John Hopkins Press, Muse<br />
&quot;An assault on liberal democratic values and institutions has been plenty evident in particular recent &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;for policy making. &quot;<br />
<br />
Construction Work 1AC – 4/8 Smith<br />
The impossibility of rationalist discourse illustrates that non-normative social science is illusory.  Our reality is shaped by the discourse we use to discuss it, and we can only understand knowledge in terms of language.  This means that our discourse occurs in the context of US global preponderance and on terms that are beneficial for dominant global political forces.  This performance is violent and does violence to us as subjects.<br />

Construction Work 1AC – 5/8 Plan A<br />
Plan:<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should eliminate nearly all domestic subsidies for biofuels, concentrated animal feeding operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and wheat, at least eliminating nearly all subsidies to corporate agribusiness.<br />
<br />
<br />
Construction Work 1AC – 6/8 Brown Freedom<br />
Freedom is a practice.  Large powers do not fill the space of political possibility.  They are assembled and sustained by small-scale practices of democracy.  We must wrestle with antidemocratic forces where we live, because that is where they do damage to us.  This does not vanquish all evil, but allows us all to cultivate a beautiful and vibrant democratic pedagogy<br />
Wendy Brown, Professor of political theory at the University of Berkley, 2007, “Neoliberalism Democracy and Bad Dreams”, John Hopkins Press, Muse<br />
&quot;Wolin has no cure for what he diagnoses as the profoundly anti-democratic forces of the modern state and political economy, forces &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;repressed. There is no solace in Wolin's work, and little for democrats either.  &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Construction Work 1AC – 8/8 Foucault<br />
Solutions are tied to the way one has framed a problem. Our problematisation allows for solutions to emerge.  Only a thorough analysis of how knowledge production and power production are linked can free us from violent constructs<br />
Michel Foucault is a friggin’ super genius, Foucault Live, page 421, 1989<br />
&quot;MF: For a long time I have been trying to see if it would be possible to describe the history of thought as distinct from both the history &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;problematisaton and the specific work of thought.&quot;
