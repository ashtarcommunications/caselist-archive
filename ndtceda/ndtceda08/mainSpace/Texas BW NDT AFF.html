They can PIC out of discourse or impact turn for example<br />
3. Their politics = death drive (referred to 1ac evidence)<br />
4. Our aff = only topical aff, alternate interpretations explode limits<br />
Most topical on the topic<br />
5. Mixing burdens – this is a solvency question<br />
6. Dictionary definitions are bad (biopolitical)<br />
7. Dillon is an impact turn to framework<br />
Limits are securitizing the debate world.<br />
Internal link turns the role playing arguments..<br />
Impact to policy education.<br />
10. Perm the interps now, it solves.<br />
11. We solve – still fiat state action.<br />
12. Don’t vote on potential abuse.<br />
13. Individual acts = basis of decision.</span><br />

 <span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">1. Referred to the Oliver card – case outweighs<br />
2. This links to security-bad arguments.<br />
3. Probability flips aff – biopolitics bad – murphin (card)<br />
4. Ethics is the tie-breaker. Utilitarianism is bio-political Ethics = tiebraker. Util = biopolitics<br />
5. This is a constructed scenario (knowledge production)<br />
6. Fox card is about viruses not bacteria.</span><br />

 <span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">Current bio-politics are bad.<br />
We’ve had nuclear weapons forever, their impacts are empirically denied.<br />
We don’t allow redeployment. We fiat out of bare life.<br />
No link to human/animal arguments. We don’t let the state redefine nature.<br />
Don’t preclude all distinctions, leave the choice to the individual.<br />
Can’t divide without state deploying animality.<br />
Their cards are about animal rights, we don’t grant those.<br />
Individual research would continue on animal testing just not from the state.<br />
Ethics are personal not state level.</span><br />
<h2 id="toc16"><a name="Emory MS – neg vs. texas bw aff-A2 Consequences matter"></a><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>A2 Consequences matter</strong></span></h2>
 <span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">1. Always have extinction threats – asteroids for example. That’s a bad way to think.<br />
2. Can’t evaluate it property – Dillon 99 ev.<br />
3. Always uncertainty in their mode of politics/thinking.<br />
4. Imaginations will always be skewed – Dillon 99 ev.<br />
5. State of emergency inevitable (extinction), the aff solves that (referred to 6 or 7 2ac cards).<br />
6. Studies prove scenarios are bad so prefer our general violence analysis (only card the 2ac read)<br />
Tetlock 2005, Expert Political Judgement, p. 190-4<br />

 <h2 id="toc18"><a name="Emory MS – neg vs. texas bw aff-Framework"></a><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Framework</strong></span></h2>
 <span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">We can concede resolved and USFG definitions. CAFO is defined as entire US system. Subsidy is defined as support (card). That cuts back into their interpretation.<br />
Dictionary interpretations are bad because it is bio-politically based. That’s a reason not to evaluate their interpretation.<br />
We solve all of their offense.<br />
Should not be about fairness but about grammar.<br />
Topicality is inevitable, neg always shifts the goal posts.<br />
Education outweigh fairness. It’s the final goal.<br />
Fairness is arbitrary.<br />
They get links to everything.<br />
Our framework is just util-bad, not something crazy.<br />
No impact to topicality.<br />
Fairness loss inevitable – speech time.<br />
Biopolitics is still an impact turn.<br />
Judges are not responsible for community norms.<br />
Plan text in a vacuum should be how the judge evaluates the round.<br />
Individual decisions should determine the ballot.<br />
No link to over limiting arguments. They can still read other crop/commodity affirmatives.<br />
We don’t preclude discussion of agriculture, if anything, we lead to it.<br />
There is still research and literature for our aff.<br />
There are still rules, duh.</span><br />
<h2 id="toc19"><a name="Emory MS – neg vs. texas bw aff-Impact turns"></a><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Impact turns</strong></span></h2>
 <span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">Solve the ethical level, most ethical action.<br />
Move away from bad form of bio-politics.<br />
They don’t ask the right question, animality is a concern on how it is deployed.<br />
Cloning doesn’t matter. Animality is something that is not specific to the biological animal/human but about the deployment of policies/actions. We would solve it because it removes the motivation for it.<br />
Take it back on the individual level which solves the turns.<br />
The passage of the plan means no impact to eugenics.</span><br />
<h2 id="toc20"><a name="Emory MS – neg vs. texas bw aff-DA"></a><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>DA</strong></span></h2>
 <span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">Does not turn the case it’s not reverse causal.<br />
The aff is a better inroad to universal health care.<br />
Status quo biopolitics relies on these scenarios to justify its existence.<br />
Biopolitics is corrupted by external threats, prefer ethical actions.</span><br />
<h2 id="toc21"><a name="Emory MS – neg vs. texas bw aff-Impact calculus"></a><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Impact calculus</strong></span></h2>
 <span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">Not solving for all bio-power.<br />
Uncertainty is inevitable now.<br />
Predictions are fine but not securitizing ones.</span><br />
<h2 id="toc22"><a name="Emory MS – neg vs. texas bw aff-2AR"></a><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>2AR</strong></span></h2>
 <span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">In round abuse is the key. We didn’t no-link politics and their case stuff was all offense so they could have gone for it. Our “no links” were actually just ethics arguments.<br />
The permutation means we use the USFG so they have no offense.<br />
Permutation grants their definition of the USFG. The state subsidizes populations (bio-political control).<br />
We have the only definition of subsidy so err aff.<br />
We fiat the plan instrumentally through the permutation.</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">It solves their education arguments by solving Animality (smith evidence)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">Solves role playing arguments, even though they didn’t make any.</span></li></ol><span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">Murphin says we are all part of a CAFO.<br />
Dictionary definitions are bad because they are bio-political and unpredictable. This links to any attempt to define animality.<br />
Dillon 99 evidence says that limiting Animality is bad because it allows it.<br />
No reason that talking about CAFOs, specifically, is necessary and we allow other crops.<br />
Their form of policy debate does not guarantee topic education.<br />
Fairness does not outweigh. People don’t quit they change their strategies. Empirically denied for that reason.<br />
They have more than enough ground and the permutation is that the plan goes through the state.<br />
They can PIC out of parts of the aff or impact turn.<br />
Topic is a negative action and that gives them plenty of ground anyway.<br />
Not every commodity should be interpreted this way just CAFOs.<br />
Our arguments are grounded in literature and research.<br />
Predictability is not key to fairness. Success of previous policy teams prove.<br />
Fairness loss inevitable because of resource predictability.<br />
We still allow rules and our rules are better because they are more fun.<br />
Cannot research everything but our interpretation allows good research.<br />
Exclusion is inevitable in debate and they are trying to exclude the aff.<br />
Predictability is their initial impact.</span>
