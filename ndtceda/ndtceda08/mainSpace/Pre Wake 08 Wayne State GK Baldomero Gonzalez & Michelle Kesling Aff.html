Observation 1: Fueling Obesity<br />
<br />
Corn Subsidies cause obesity by limiting out the production of healthier foods<br />
Albany Times Union 2008 [&quot;Farm bill will aid wealthy farmers, boost obesity&quot;, June 4th 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=693318" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=693318</a>]<br />
&quot;How does Congress...bill is unconscionable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Advantage 1: Obesity<br />
Subsidizing corn leads to the production of High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCP) which spreads obesity<br />
Fields 04 [Scott, science writer for environmental hygienists, governmental regulators, and scientists in sundry environmentally related disciplines, &quot;The Fat of the Land: Do Agriculture Subsidies Foster Poor Health&quot; <em>Environmental Health Perspective</em> 112(14) October 2004]<br />
&quot;Ever since the Great...less nutritious foods.&quot;<br />
<br />
Corn Syrup is the key cause of obesity- it overwhelms all other alternative causalities<br />
Severson 04 [Kim, Chronicle staffwriter, &quot;Sugar coated: We're drowning in high fructose corn syrup. Do the risks go beyond our waistline?&quot; San Fransisco Chronicle, 2-18-04, www.sfgate.comcgibin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2004/02/18/FDGS24VKMH1.DTL]<br />
&quot;Critser writes that despite...market and increased profits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheap high sugar exports from the U.S. are causing obesity world wide- this pandemic will kill millions and ensure global poverty<br />
The Toronto Star 08 [&quot;Obesity becoming world crisis&quot;, 2-4-08, In It's already being called the next deadly global pandemic]<br />
&quot;Projected to be a bigger...will be in jeopardy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Obesity is slashing our life expectancy and the trend is only getting worse- the impact is equivalent to major war or pandemic and outweighs all other causes of death<br />
Lalasz 08 [Robert, senior editor at Population Reference Bureau, &quot;Will Childhood Obesity Decrease U.S. Life Expectancy?&quot; www.prb.org/Articles/2005/WillRisingChildhoodObesityDecreaseUSLifeExpectancy.aspx?p=1]<br />
&quot;A new study contends...&quot;technology&quot;, says Olshansky.&quot;<br />
<br />
The epidemic of obesity decreases the potential pool of recruits, retention of military personal and increases health care spending<br />
Almond et al. 08 [Nathaniel, Kahwati, Leila; Kinsinger, Linda; Porterfield, Deborah, &quot;The Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity Among U.S. Military Veterans&quot;, July 15, 2008, www.redorbit.com/news/health/1478028/the_prevalence_of_overweight_and_obesity_among_us_military_veterans/]<br />
&quot;Increases in the prevalence...$61 billion annually.14&quot;<br />
<br />
The impact is enough to jack readiness<br />
San Francisco Chronicle 03 [&quot;Obesity is 'a threat' to U.S. Security: Surgeon general urges cultural shift&quot;, January 7, 2003, www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/01/07MN166871.DTL]<br />
&quot;An overweight America is killing...among adults and children.&quot;<br />
<br />
All alternatives to recruiting have failed<br />
Carter and Glastris 05 [Phillip and Paul, Phillup Carter is an attorney and former army captain who writes on national security and Paul Glastris is the editor in chief of <em>The Washington Monthly</em>, &quot;The Case for the Draft&quot;, <em>Washington Monthly</em>, March 2005, www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0503.carter.html<br />
&quot;A fourth option, and...enough soldiers in the door.&quot;<br />
<br />
Low troop levels will crush our deterrent capability, devastating US hard power and sparking global conflict<br />
Perry and Flournoy 06 [William, professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University, was U.S. secretary of defense from 1994 to 1997, Michele, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, was principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and threat reduction, National defense, May]<br />
&quot;If retention rates decline...our ability to deter aggression.&quot;<br />
<br />
US hard power collapse ensures extinction<br />
Ferguson 04 [Niall, Prof of History at NYU, Foreign Policy, July/August]<br />
&quot;Certainly, one can imagine...not-so-new- world disorder&quot;<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Environment<br />
Corn Subsidies have forced farmers to compete worldwide- this has lead to a global spread of corn monocultures<br />
Oxfam 03 [&quot;Briefing Paper: Dumping Without Borders&quot;, August 2003, www.oxfam.org/enf/pdfs/pp030827_corn_dumping.pdf]<br />
&quot;The pressure on producers...contaminates the farmer's food.&quot;<br />
<br />
Corn monocultures make the destruction of biodiversity and soil inevitable- corn uses more pesticides and herbicides then any other crop<br />
Pollan 05 [Michael, professor of Journalism- UC Berkeley, King Corn, the following key note address- Following the Food Chain: The High Cost of Cheap Food- was given at the 2005 25th anniversary Ecofarm Conference in Asilomar, California, 8-15-05, Rodale Institute, www.newfarm.org/features/2005/0805/pollan/index.shtml<br />
&quot;However, I would argue...herbicides then any other crop.&quot;<br />
<br />
And soil erosion will lead to extinction<br />
Discover 08 [&quot;Unsustainable soil use can cause civilizations to collapse&quot; Jan 11, 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jan/unsustainable-soil-use-can-cause-civilizations-to-collapse/?searchterm=soil%20erosion" rel="nofollow">http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jan/unsustainable-soil-use-can-cause-civilizations-to-collapse/?searchterm=soil%20erosion</a>]<br />
&quot;Earth is running out...goes blowing in the wind.&quot;<br />
<br />
And a collapse of biodiversity will lead to extinction<br />
Diner 94 [Major David N., Judge Advocate General's Corps, &quot;The Army and the Endangered Species Act: Who's Endangered Now? 143Mil. L. Rev. 161, Winter 94]<br />
&quot;Biologically diverse ecosystems...closer to the abyss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Advantage 3: Canada<br />
Corn subsidies will trigger a Trade War with Canada crushing relations<br />
Murad 07 [Ali, Professor in Business, &quot;U.S. Canada go to Trade War!&quot; www.amaziness.com/article_detail.cfm/195404?articleid=195404&amp;title=Trade%2Cus%2CCanada%2Cfarm%2Cbill%2Cwto]<br />
&quot;The United States and...the World Trade Organization.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good relations are key to maintain NORAD<br />
Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat 04 [&quot;Canada's Performance 2004&quot; www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/report/govrev/04/cp-rc2-eng.asp]<br />
&quot;Canada's prosperity and...Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).&quot;<br />
<br />
NORAD is key to early warning<br />
Regehr 06 [Ernie, Sr. Policy Advisor at Project Ploughshares, &quot;NORAD Renewal: From joint defense to shared continental surveillance, February 2006, www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/Briefings/brf062.pdf]<br />
&quot;In addition, over the...realistic and compelling option.&quot;<br />
<br />
The impact is Accidental Nuclear Armageddon which would result in extinction<br />
Times June 27, 2008 [Postcard from Cheyenne Mountain, Still Training for the End of the World, Eben Harrell Friday, Jun 27, 2008 www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1818559,00.html]<br />
&quot;On May 13, in...carries a heavy burden.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thus we offer the following plan:<br />
The United States Federal Government will remove nearly all subsidies for corn. Funding and enforcement through normal means. We'll clarify.<br />
<br />
Contention 2: Solvency<br />
Subsidies overwhelm all positive programs- consumption habits will never change until subsidies are repealed<br />
Pollan 07 [Michael, Knight Professor of Science and Environmental Journalism at UC Berkeley, acclaimed writer and journalist, New York Times, November 4, www.michaelpollan.com/article.php?id=89]<br />
&quot;It's an old story...at least not with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheap corn does not help consumers- only create bigger portion and add value which undermines benefits and causes obesity- only cutting subsidies solve.<br />
Pollan 03 [Michael, Knight Professor of Science and Environmental Journalism at UC Berkeley, acclaimed writer and journalist, New York Times, October 12, www.michaelpollan.com/article.php?id=52]<br />
&quot;Cheap corn, the dubious...guaranteed to keep coming&quot;
