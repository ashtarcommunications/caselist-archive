But these immediate... as we know it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EQIP payments are the single largest direct subsidy to CAFOs as distinct corporations.<br />
<br />
Gurion-Sherman 08 [Doug, Senior Scientist in the Union of Concerned Scientists Food and Environment Program, &quot;CAFOs Uncovered&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
In addition to ... subsidies to CAFOs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h1 id="toc1"><a name="Pre-tournament"></a>Pre-tournament</h1>
<br />
<br />
 Contention 1: The Status Quo<br />
<br />
The Environmental Quality Incentives Program [EQIP] is the only domestic subsidy given to CAFOs.   CAFOs use EQIP to construct lagoons, which store the millions of tons of feces produced by animals, with grave consequences for our health and the environment.<br />
<br />
Martin 08 [Andrew, NY Times, “In The Farm Bill, A Creature From The Black Lagoon?” 1/13, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/business/13feed.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/business/13feed.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin</a>]<br />
<br />
IT may not surprise… …“Factory Farm Incentive Program”? <br />
<br />
Contention 2: The Implications<br />
<br />
Lagoons wreck havoc in three ways:<br />
<br />
FIRST - each lagoon leaks 4 million gallons of feces into groundwater every year.<br />
<br />
Williams 06 [Heather, Associate Professor of Politics at Pomona, “Fighting Corporate Swine” Politics &amp; Society 34(3), September]<br />
<br />
Most often, companies claimed… … fifteen-year lifespan of a facility.29 <br />
SECOND – 40 times every year lagoons fail because of heavy rains and hurricanes.  Every failure releases  25 million gallons of feces and urine into the water supply.<br />
<br />
Goodwin &amp; Hallstrom 04 [Barry, Professor of Economics at NC State and Daniel, Assistant Professor of Agriculture and  Resource Economics at NC State, “Modeling catastrophic weather events and the risks of animal waste spills in the coastal plain of north Carolina” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/20241/1/sp04ga10.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/20241/1/sp04ga10.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
One of the most serious… … to prevent lagoon failures.1 <br />
<br />
<br />
And, the weather is getting worse – severe weather is increasing in frequency and intensity meaning more failures are inevitable.<br />
<br />
Williams 05 [Amber, Writer for The Hilltop, “Scientists say hurricanes, global warming relate” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2005/10/03/NationWorld/Scientists.Say.Hurricanes.Global.Warming.Relate-1006777.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2005/10/03/NationWorld/Scientists.Say.Hurricanes.Global.Warming.Relate-1006777.shtml</a>]<br />
<br />
Scientists have concluded that… … rainfall because of global warming.&quot; <br />
<br />
THIRD – the most common pollution vector is intentional application to cropland.<br />
<br />
Gurion-Sherman 08 [Doug, Senior Scientist in the Union of Concerned Scientists Food and Environment Program, “CAFOs Uncovered” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
Although catastrophic failures of manure … … nitrogen-may pass under them (Karr et al. 2001). <br />
This has two impacts.<br />
<br />
First is Dead Zones:<br />
<br />
Water pollution from CAFOs is creating dead zones in the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.<br />
<br />
Gurion-Sherman 08 [Doug, Senior Scientist in the Union of Concerned Scientists Food and Environment Program, “CAFOs Uncovered” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
As indicated above… … underestimate that contribution (Weldon and Hornbuckle 2006). <br />
<br />
Dead zones result in species extinction by triggering sex changes in fish.<br />
<br />
American Chemical Society 06 [the world’s largest scientific society, it is a nonprofit organization chartered by the U.S. Congress and a global leader in providing access to chemistry-related research through its multiple databases, peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences. “Ocean 'dead zones' trigger sex changes in fish, posing extinction threat” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/acs-oz032906.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/acs-oz032906.php</a>]<br />
<br />
Oxygen depletion in the world’s… … difficult for marine life to survive.  <br />
Species extinction leads to extinction of all life on the planet.<br />
<br />
Wapner, Department of Int’l Politics and Foreign Policy at American University, 1994<br />
<br />
[Paul.  Politics and Life Sciences.  August, Pg. 177] <br />
<br />
Massive extinction of species is dangerous … our collective future as the stakes. <br />
<br />
We must take action now to reduce CAFO water pollution or these ecosystems will be destroyed by dead zones.<br />
<br />
Science Daily 08 [“Record-setting Dead Zones Predicted For Gulf Of Mexico, Chesapeake Bay” 7/16, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080714160000.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080714160000.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
Record-setting &quot;dead zones&quot; in… … flowing into these water basins. <br />
Second is Antibiotic Resistant Disease:<br />
<br />
Lagoons and sprayfields contaminate drinking water with antibiotic resistant bacteria and viruses.<br />
<br />
Marks 01 [Robbin, National Resources Defense Council, “Cesspools of shame how factory farm lagoons and sprayfields threaten environmental and public health” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/cesspools/cessinx.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/cesspools/cessinx.asp</a>]<br />
<br />
As the number of CAFOs… points to avoid any potential exposure. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, antibiotics used in CAFOs pollute drinking water, increasing antibiotic resistance in humans and developing antibiotic resistant diseases.<br />
<br />
Marks 01 [Robbin, National Resources Defense Council, “Cesspools of shame how factory farm lagoons and sprayfields threaten environmental and public health” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/cesspools/cessinx.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/cesspools/cessinx.asp</a>]<br />
<br />
Antibiotic resistance poses a major… .. boat, swim, or drink water. <br />
<br />
And, antibiotic resistance will thrust us back to dystopian time before the invention of antibiotics where disease was the greatest threat to our survival.<br />
<br />
Sterling 95 [Bruce, (science journalist) in Bitter Resistance]<br />
<br />
For us, the children of the miracle… …that population problem for us. <br />
<br />
Contention 3: Solvency<br />
<br />
FIRST - EQIP raises the spectre of orphan lagoons - making spills and leaks 1,000 times more likely.<br />
<br />
Klinge 03 [Jeff, Land stewardship project federal farm policy committee member, “Commentary: do the math-proposed eqip rule change a factory farm handout” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.landstewardshipproject.org/opinions/03/opin_030214.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.landstewardshipproject.org/opinions/03/opin_030214.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Under the proposed rule changes…  … changes could multiply that risk by a thousand. <br />
SECOND - EQIP makes CAFO manure application economically viable.<br />
<br />
Gurion-Sherman 08 [Doug, Senior Scientist in the Union of Concerned Scientists Food and Environment Program, “CAFOs Uncovered” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered-executive-summary.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered-executive-summary.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
Another farm bill program… … economically feasible without subsidization. <br />
<br />
<br />
EQIP for CAFOs prevent funds from reaching pasture-based alternative methods.<br />
<br />
Gurion-Sherman 08 [Doug, Senior Scientist in the Union of Concerned Scientists Food and Environment Program, “CAFOs Uncovered” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
The new EQIP regulation … applications therefore remain unfunded. <br />
CAFOs suck up EQIP funds, meaning farmers who want to switch to sustainable methods, can’t get the funding.<br />
<br />
Sustainable Agriculture Coalition 07 [Group letter signed by representatives from groups including the Humane Society, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Sierra Club, “GROUPS URGE CONGRESS TO RESTRICT FARM BILL FUNDS FOR CAFOS” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.msawg.org/pdf/Press_Release_EQIPCAFOLetter_9May2007.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.msawg.org/pdf/Press_Release_EQIPCAFOLetter_9May2007.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
In addition, in some…  … the program is turned down. <br />
<br />
Alternative methods protect water quality, don’t require lagoons, and don’t produce the pollutants that cause dead zones.<br />
<br />
Gurion-Sherman 08 [Doug, Senior Scientist in the Union of Concerned Scientists Food and Environment Program, “CAFOs Uncovered” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
First, alternatives are often  by relocating livestock near crops. <br />
<br />
<br />
Alternative methods are key to preserving livestock diversity – reducing the need for costly feed and antibiotics, and it prevents disease outbreaks.<br />
