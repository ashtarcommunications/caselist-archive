<em><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">I begin with our first main point: </span></em><span class="Heading1Char"><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><strong></u>A Justification to Consider an Ethical System of Policy Debate.<u></strong> </span></em></span><br />
<em><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">Former political scientist and University President, W. Robert Parks wrote in a 1955 article entitled the “Goals of Democracy” that there is only ONE ultimate objective for a democracy. He notes that,  </span></em><br />
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">Democracy also has certain high-level principles which may be changeless. <strong><em></u>The American political process involves many mechanical devices<u></em></strong> for implementing these principles which, through traditional association, <strong></u><em>we may come to consider as democracy itself. But such mechanical apparatuses as a federal system, a two-house legislature, a separation of powers scheme are all simply means chosen from among several alternatives for achieving democratic ends. As means, they have no inherent sanctity and must always be subjected to the pragmatic test of utility.</em><u></strong> </span><br />
<strong><em></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">If alternative</span><u></em></strong><strong><em><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"> </u>mechanical apparatuses can be shown to offer more promise for achieving democratic goals<u></span></em></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"> and subgoals, <strong><em></u>it is<u></em></strong> not only permissible but <strong><em></u>mandatory, under the democratic theory, that the alternative devices be adopted in order that the end of democracy-the well-being of the individual-be better served.<u></em></strong> </span><br />
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"> </span><br />
<em><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">The first affirmative speech is the beginning of a policy debate and that is what we must subject to the pragmatic test of utility. The goal of a policy debate in a democratic society should be to create, implement, and evaluate effective decision making for a multicultural democracy. We have concerns about how a democratic society like America and the debate community protect the well-being of minority interests against broader majority concerns. </span></em><br />
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"> </span><br />
<em><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"></u>_ and I believe we must examine three areas that directly impact the policy making process: how we create policies, how we implement policies, and how we evaluate policies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Only by examining how the policy debate addresses these areas can America understand how to make better policies for all of its constituents. </span></em><br />
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"> </span><br />
<em><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">While we certainly have very specific thoughts about how to create, implement, and evaluate the best policy option, we find the affirmative case to be housed in an unregulated laboratory system that makes it impossible to engage our concerns ethically. When we asked the affirmative in cross-examination, whether or not their representation of a broader constituency group included the National Black Farmers Association’s interest in the subsidy system, they said “no”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>However, when asked why were they excluded, they said they said <u>_.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We find this process to be problematic in representing the interests of this constituent. </span></em><br />

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"> </span><br />
<em><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">The creation of effective policy requires the establishment of an ethical relationship between the constituent who claims they have been harmed, the advocate who speaks on behalf of said constituent, and the policy maker who evaluates evidence and testimony for the purpose of creating policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The constituent’s sole responsibility is to speak out about the injustices that have been done to them with supporting evidence for their position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Our responsibility as advocates begins with an acknowledgement that we, not they, have the opportunity to speak to you today, and we must use our agency by advocating policy interests that they have created for themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The policy maker should interrogate the privilege of testimony and evidence to create the best policy option for those with lesser privileged status.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> </span></em><br />

<em><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">The affirmative decision to exclude the NBFA as part of their constituency group is unethical with regards to policy implementation.
