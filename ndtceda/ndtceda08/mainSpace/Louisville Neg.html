On the negative we will make a topical argument - the same ones that were read in our debates at Miami and West Georgia (since I have new partner we might read some others, but we aren't sure yet so I don't really have any info about them) and we also read our MPOWER stuff. Depending on how the debate goes down we will make arguments about the opponents tactics during the round (You judged a debate of Brian and I where we talked about the effect/strategy of topicality, for example). In both the affirmative and negative debates we look at not only the effects of topical arguments but the choices made by teams in the round.<br />

<br />
Spirit in Example – Overview with Three Chapters<br />
<br />
Stylicaltiy overview<br />
We feel that debate should be evaluatedupon the three elements o fpersuasive speaking noted by Aristotle some 2,300 years ago. Pathos, logos, and ethos, are a ll important standards in the methods of persuasion. ethos is the way the speaker conveys personal strength and their character. Logos is the coherent logical and well reasoned argument and pathos is the feeling that a speaker voked in his or her audience. All are need ed in order to create a balance o veidnece with emotion and credibility as stated by the persuasive model. This comes from Gary Orren, a professor fo public politcy at the kennedy school of Harvard university he asserd this in the year 2000 (orren 2000)<br />
<br />
This sis the reason that we pushed so strongly for the round to be based on persuasion….we believe that therei s a difference between argumention and persuasion:<br />
Miriam Webster defin ition of argumentation. Persuasion is defined by wikipedia as.<br />
<br />
If you look at them you notice that they have certain logos centric debate<br />
<br />
<br />
Judge you may stillb e curious as to why this astyle of arugment must come before ny topic issue presented in this round. There are three reasons for this:<br />
1) Just as in contemporary styles of debate topicality is a paramount issue and comes before anything else, we say that stylicality is even more important<br />
2) Contemperorary interollectiate debate don’t allow for<br />
a. Black leaders to emerge<br />
b. Multicultural education to take place<br />
3) Logos centric methods are bad because they negatively effect policy making decisiosn on a larger scale.<br />
<br />
I will now go onto their case problems using pathos, ethos, and logos<br />
<br />
We said Demand outweighs style<br />
<br />
<br />
ED PANETTA says:<br />
<br />
AFTER THE 1NC AND UNTIL THE LAST 15 SECONDS OFHTE 2NR THERE WAS NOTHING BUT ENGAGE IN LOGOS BASED ARGUMENTS<br />
<br />
THE 2NC DIDN’T DEPLOY ONLY REFERENCED ETHOS AND PATHOS<br />
<br />
IF YOU WILWL METHODOLOGOCIALLY DEPLOY IT IT SHOULDN’T GO FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE LAST 20 SECONDS TO SEE NOTHING BUT LINE BY LINE<br />
<br />
NEG DOESN’T DEPLOY TECHNIQUES NECESSARY TO OCCUR IN MOST SPACES<br />
<br />
NEG IS MAKIGN A UNIVERSALIST CLAIM ABOUT THE THREE-OCCURS IN RHETORICAL SITUATION- AFF SAYS WE’RE AN ANOMOLY- THE WAY WE APPROACH DISCOURSE IS EFFECTIVE IN GNEERATIGN A VOCABULARY<br />
<br />
TALK ABOUT WHY RHETORICALLY THERES A FORCED CHOICE – DEPLOY STRATEGICALLY WHATS TAKEN PLACE- FOR EX THE DSCRSE OF THE NEGS MODEL CHASTISES ME FROM USING AN EXAMPLE- A SENSE OF NEGATIVITY- THE APPROACH WE USE CRETAES A VOCABULARY OF OPTIMISM- BC CAN TALK AB ANYTHING W/O OPTIMISM<br />
<br />
THEY TAKE A TRADITIONALLY TRAGIC APPROACH<br />
<br />
WE TAKE AN UPLIFTING AND OPEN APPROACH<br />
<br />
TALK TO THE RHETORIC PPL- LOGOS ETHOS AND PATHOS ARE DELIBERATIVE METHODS USED DIFFERENTLY<br />
<br />
EG- FUNERAL ORATION- YOU DON’T DELIBERATIVELY ASSESS FAILINGS WHEN THEYRE DEAD<br />
<br />
AGGRESSIVLEY DEFEND LOGOS<br />
<br />
DEBATE IS LOGOCENTRIC BC IT BECOMES PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE<br />
<br />
FOR A JUDGE LOOKING AT LOGOS ETHOS AND PATHOS<br />
<br />
BOSTON EX WAS POWERFUL TO PANETTA- BUT WE DIDN’T KNOW THAT- WE CANT ACCESS THAT BC WE CANT KNOW- LOGOCENTRIC KEY TO CREATE BALANCE AND SYMMATREY<br />
<br />
SHOULD I WIN BC HE HAS TIES TO 1975 TO BOSTON? THAT THEY DON’T HAVE ACCESS TO- THE REASON WE STAY LOGOCENTRIC IS TO HAVE A SHARED SET OF DISCRUSIVE APPEALS IN A SIMILAR BALANCE<br />
<br />
DO MAD ABOUT HOW THEIR MODEL IS UNIVERSALISTIC AND WHY DELIBERATIVE IS GOOD<br />
<br />
T/S JURISDICTION MAY BE TRUMPED BY L/E/P BUT L/E/P IS TRUMPED BY DEMAND<br />
<br />
WHY IS THE DEMAND CATEGORY – A PUBLIC SPHERE/PUBLIC SPACE WHERE PPL CAN QUEST INTERR THE STATE AND GOVT AS AN IDEAL DIALECTICAL CITE OF DISCRSE TO ENGAGE IN DEMANDS NAD INQUIRIES ON THE STATE<br />
<br />
(THEY CAN SAY ITS SECONDARY AND WITHIN DEBATE)<br />
<br />
-PANETTA DOESN’T REALLY BELIEVE THE DEMAND CLAIMS<br />
<br />
1. TRUMPED BY DEMAND<br />
2. THEY DIDN’T EXHIBIT L/E/P AS BALANCED<br />
<br />
DO MORE TALKING AB HOW SHOULDN’T BE FORCED TO DISCLOSE PRIVATE IDENTITY IN PUBLIC SPACE- IT PRIVELEGES ANONYMITY- AND I SHOULD ELECT WHEN TO SHED THAT CLOTH<br />
<br />
AND UNDER THAT MODEL THEY HAVE TO DISCLOSE<br />
<br />
SAYING THAT THEY ARE ALL BALANCED IS THE REASON WE’RE IN THIS SYSTEM- ARISTOTLES METHOD IS GENDERED 2300 YRS- GENDERS PPL<br />
<br />
RHETORIC V. PHILOSOPHY<br />
RHETORIC IS SITUATIONAL L/E/P ARE CATEGORIES IN THE MIND OF THE AUDIENCE<br />
<br />
NEED TO KNOW THE AUDIENCE—THEY DON’T KNOW THE AUDIENCE- TURNS THEIR EXCLUSION/COMMUNICATION ARGS<br />
<br />
FORMULA IS THE ANTITHESIS OF THE RHETORIC – ALL OF THE AVAILABLE MEANS OF PERSUASION IN ANY INSTANCE- PRIVELEGES SITUATION<br />
<br />
--NEXT TIME JUST DO THE MODEL<br />
<br />
2AR- BE MORE DEFENSIVE – CONDITION 1- HERES WHY WE WIN- DEMAND AND VOCAB TRUMPS L/E/P 2. E/I THEY WIN WE STILL WIN- THEY DON’T DEPLOY IT, WE DO IT BETTER<br />
<br />
1AR- WHEN THEYRE TALKING AB L/E/P<br />
<br />
ORGANIZATION. ADAPT 1AR SO IF THEY WIN THE MODEL YOU WIN.<br />

Debate as a game is a bankrupt system in which it evolves into a game of who can evoke he most fear in the eyes of the judge (ie. Biggest impacts). There are no components of the current debate system that can produce effective social and institutional change. Instead we must adopt an Aristotelian system of ethos, pathos, and logos to evaluate who has done the best argumentative job by appealing to the emotions, intellect, and style of the listeners.<br />
This conception of policy debate would:<br />
1) Appeal to all parts of the brain<br />
2) Prevent the “Art of Exclusion” that is the current conception of policy debate<br />
3) Allows for the exportation of debate to the masses<br />
4) Train debaters in the communication skills that have proven to be a necessity<br />
5) Win discussions with success in life<br />
<br />
Pathos<br />
• We must learn more than what the topic mandates. The problem with current evaluation methods of debate is that we are not taught from a multicultural perspective. We need to learn about black culture and white culture.<br />
• Plays KRS-1 clip, in which he speaks of the necessity of learning about black culture.<br />
<br />
Lagos<br />
• We must reject racism “brick by brick” (Barndt)<br />
• Poverty gap with blacks and whites is the product of social exclusion (Read Stats)<br />
<br />
Ethos<br />
• Personal Narrative of 1NC<br />
• Urban Debate League<br />
• Single Mother<br />

Offered them the test. Proposed a new framework in which to debate.

The block responded to the traditional framework by indicating this is the mindset that allows for exclusion. They talked about their personal experience in debate, on debate referenced his classes he took to get rid of his speech impediment. The 1NR rapped about how the debate community forces minorities to act white. This was followed by the discussion of their multi-ethnic advantage.<br />

NOTE: This strategy is also used in the 2AC<br />
<br />
It is not possible for each team to build a strong case for both style and topic. Nor is it beneficial for either team to present weak versions of both.<br />
<br />
The framework used to evaluate a debate must be agreed upon because the way debate is evaluated shaps the speeches of a debate. Our disagreement about style therefore precludes a topical discussion. This has an important affect on the way a win or loss is subsequently decided – accordingly, whoever wins the style debate must win this debate since topical debate is no longer an option<br />
<br />
During cross-ex our opposition explained how they believed debate should be evaluated. In addition, in debate you must defend what you say. The affirmative/negative made choices about what it deemed to be important and our opponents must defend those choices.<br />
<br />
We fundamentally disagree with them over evaluative procedures and can only resolve this issue through debate. Accordingly, each side must offer an expansion of their evaluative procedures and the benefits, if any, of those methods.<br />
<br />
Chapter 1: Stylicality<br />
<br />
Debate is a game and before a game can begin the players must agree on the rules. For example, before you start a game of monopoly you have to decide if money will go in free parking or not. Procedural issues must be resolved before a game can begin. For this reason our opponents must defend their choices and in turn we will defend ours.<br />
<br />
We begin our defense by presenting our standards and the advantage that we draw from them.<br />
<br />
Harvard professor of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government Dr. Gary Orren in 2000:<br />
“For real insight… balancing act.”<br />
<br />
Pathos:<br />
<br />
Award winning author and professor at the University of Wisconsin Dr. Stephen E. Lucas argues:<br />
<br />
<u>If you want listeners to do something as a result of your speech, you need to appeal to their hearts as well as to their heads.</u><br />
<br />
To effectively use a pathos a debater must attempt to purposefully invoke an emotion in the listener and then be able to identify and defend that they used those emotions. Finally those emotions must be appropriate to the topic.<br />
<br />
Ethos:<br />
<br />
Establish own!!!<br />
<br />
Lucas, again in 2004:<br />
<u>The more favorably listeners view a speaker’s competence and character, the more likely they are to accept what a speaker says.</u><br />
<br />
Logos:<br />
<br />
Logos itself is grounded in evidence and reasoning.<br />
<br />
Lucas, again, argues<br />
<br />
<u>If you hope to be persuasive you must support your views with evidence. Reasoning is simply the process of drawing a conclusion based on evidence.</u><br />
<br />
We hold that strength of evidence is evaluated by judging the context of the evidence and its specificity to the argument being made as well as the qualifications of the authors used to produce that evidence.<br />
<br />
Being able to use persuasion, and therefore ethos, pathos, and logos together is key to affecting society.<br />
<br />
Again, evidenced by Gary Orren in 2000:<br />
“Who, you ask…than many.”<br />
<br />
Alan Cirlin professor and past-director of forensics at St. Mary’s University in 1997 contends that we are not:<br />
<br />
“Academic debate… that activity.”<br />
<br />
How then, if we currently are not, train debaters in all three areas of persuasion?<br />
<br />
Cirlin answers:<br />
<br />
“Feedback has been… are most successful.”<br />
<br />
In 1986 Cirlin offers a blueprint for this kind of change:<br />
<br />
“If we want to see… with debaters.”<br />

Case Args:<br />
A. Affirmative is logocentric, we are not passionate, we do not provide ethos for the round.<br />
<br />
B. Counter Story is the exclusion of black women in gendered violence law.<br />
<br />
Chapter 1. Ethos, speaker explains why he cared to talk a<br />
Chapter 2. Pathos: speaker explains why he is passionate<br />
Chapter 3. Logos: speaker explains their story was logical<br />
<br />
C. We violate their framework of the tenants.<br />
<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
Umm… it’s Louisville. Hey, they concede that the three requirements are interrelated and that logos is necessarily fed by ones ethos. But in cross examination they also concede that they feel that the three tenants need to be rigid and separated.<br />
<br />
Block Strategy:<br />
Affirmative has no ethos. WE’re logocentric, and our framework is vague because it’s a metanarrative. Our mistake was we didn't clearly spell out why we fulfill ethos tenant.<br />
<br />
2nr Strategy:<br />
<br />
Their 2NR strategy is straight forward, but I Found our judge’s decision to be helpful, so I will summarize what he told me here.<br />
<br />
Tips –<br />
<br />
1. When they demand ethos, do not justify by explaining the credibility of your authors, this feeds their logocentrism link. INSTEAD EXPLAIN WHY YOU CHOSE YOUR AFFIRMATIVE, WHO YOU ARE AND WHY YOU ARE INTERESTED AND THE DIFFERENT BIASES YOU HAVE. At that point, you force Louisville to advocate their “competing” story which was not competitive at all.<br />
<br />
2 POLICY DEBATERS, SEE THE ROUND AS LOUISVILLE RUNNING A TOPICALITY ARGUMENT “MUST BE LOGOS, ETHOS, AND PATHOS” AND A COUNTERPLAN, “WE DO ETHOS.” Therefore, you should respond by saying we meet, explain why you are ethos and then permute the counterplan with, “our counterplan is not competitive - we don't need to reject logos in order to have ethos.”<br />
<br />
3.THE AFFIRMATIVE FRAMEWORK OF META NARRATIVE DOES NOT COME TO GRIP WITH LOUISVILLE’S NET BENEFITS OF OPENING UP ACTIVITY TO PUBLIC AUDIENCES -<br />
A WAY TO BEAT THIS ARGUMENT IS TO: When the 2n c-x’s the 1AC with the following question, “do you fulfill tenants of ethos, logos, and pathos?” DENY KNOWING SUCH TERMINOLOGY. ACT CONFUSED. IN THE 2AC, USE SIMPLER TERMINOLOGY – IF THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE DEBATE MORE ACCESIBLE TO PUBLIC, THEN THEY HAVE TO USE SIMPLER COMMON PERSON ARGUMENTS.<br />

Judge Comments:<br />
Within a Legal context logcentrism is more important. Baldwin evidence pretty good about logocentrism is pretty important. Aff sets up a priority to the role of the ballot because it has social change. Hitler argument on the aff wasn’t very good, it’s a question of the person not really their method. Have to prove a likelihood to that example. Good answer on the MLK example, but need a similar example to go along with your Hitler argument. Attempt to charaterize too much that their isn’t any logic in their framework, where is their arg is that it shouldn’t be a priority of logic but it is still there.<br />

Transcript of the 1NC<br />
<br />
Our Story is told in an overview in this speech and three chapters in the 2nd negative.<br />
Overview: Policy Implementation<br />
Multiculturalism<br />
Preparation Movement (P.I.M.P.)<br />
<br />
The University of Louisville Malcolm X Debate Program is please to announce its intentions to solicit partnerships to join the policy implementation multiculturalism proposal (P.I.M.P.). The Purpose of PIMP is to create a set of norms and procedures in NDT/CEDA debate that focuses not solely on finding the Best Policy Option, but to also train debaters in effective policy implementation to diverse populations using effective communication. Two arguments demonstrate the need for the debate community to consider joining our movement.<br />
<br />
First, we identify the harms of the inability of contemporary NDT/CEDA debate to make policy debate effective in a pluralistic society. Professor Cynthia Valdivia-Sutherland of Butte Community College presented this argument at the National Communication Association Convention in 1998:<br />

So you want to increase diversity within your forensics program? And you are seeking what you hope will be relatively simple solutions to a seemingly difficult problem: How to bring about increased diversity within an academic program that traditionally has been ethnically and culturally homogenized (Loge 1990).<br />
The good news is you aren't alone in your quest for increased forensic diversity. The bad news is nothing worthwhile is ever easy.<br />
Consider this: In 1991, Preston developed a forensics philosophy appropriate to urban commuter colleges, arguing that for these educational institutions an ideal forensics program &quot;combines doing the greatest good for the greatest number with cultural diversity, and effective and ethically sound forensics pedagogy&quot; (p.12). Although for the most part Preston's philosophy was not innovative, his call to incorporate an emphasis on cultural diversity within a forensics program was.<br />
Preston's call arose out of a desire to more fully develop a forensics program that could meet the needs of a rapidly changing academic population, one that was becoming increasingly diverse. For many of us, this same call has sounded within our own programs as we witness the rise of our culturally and ethnically diverse faculty and student populations. And rising they are.<br />
According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, in 1994 approximately 30 percent of all community college students were classified non-white; additionally, approximately 25 percent of all students attending four-year universities and colleges at that time were classified non-white (National Center for Educational Statistics, 1996). Additionally, not only has academia been impacted by a marked increase in ethnic diversity, there has also been an upsurge of re-entry students, a population that will only keep rising with the advent of the 1997 Welfare Reform Act sending numbers of individuals back to school.<br />
Considering the weight of this information, adopting Preston's philosophy appears critical to the future success of forensics programs, not just within urban commuter colleges, but everywhere. Consequently, many of us are seeking the ways and means by which we can diversify our forensics programs.<br />
However, while we may agree that adoption of a philosophy of multiculturalism within forensics is ethically sound -- thus, answering for ourselves the question &quot;why?,&quot; -- the question still remains: How are we to accomplish this? This answer lies in an understanding for, and adoption of, a philosophy of pluralism, &quot;a process by which both minority and majority culture members adopt some norms of the other group&quot; (Cox, 1991, p.35).<br />
To help us develop a better understanding of both the question and the answer, we will examine the traditional monocultural, Westernized approach to forensic competitions in comparison to multicultural speaking styles; and then, we will explore the implications of implementing intercultural communication within forensics competitions. The Westernized Perspective of Forensics<br />
Currently, the polyethnic and polycultural student population is comprised of various groups (i.e. Blacks, Native Americans, Latin Americans, Asian Americans, reentry, etc.) with unique, subjective and characteristic ways of behaving, thinking, and communicating. This is significant in view of Albert and Triandis' (1985) argument that because cultural elements are functional &quot;individuals who have appropriate patterns and personalities for a particular environment will fare well and will receive positive outcomes in that environment,&quot; but when &quot;individuals from one culture are forced to adopt a very different cultural pattern...they are likely to experience high levels of stress, a reduction in positive outcomes, lower self-esteem, anomie, and general demoralization&quot; (p. 391).<br />
In light of Albert and Triandis' argument, a possible explanation for a lack of cultural diversity within forensics' organizations to date is that forensics competition fosters a climate of assimilation, one in which &quot;minority culture members adopt the norms and values of the dominant group,&quot; rather than a climate of pluralism (Cox, 1991, p.35). The importance of the assimilative versus pluralistic environment is crystallized when we recognize that forensics activities uphold an &quot;argumentative perspective in examining problems and communicating with people&quot; (Bartanen, 1995, p. 2). An argumentative perspective is one that involves the use of reasons in support of acts, beliefs, attitudes and values.<br />
Essentially a westernized perspective founded on the philosophies of classic rhetoricians such as Aristotle, Protagoris, and Quintilian, and modern rhetoricians such as Stephen Toulmin, Chaim Perelman, and Richard Weaver, the argumentative perspective promotes &quot;rationality in the pursuit of knowledge,&quot; (Kim, 1985, in Samovar and Porter, 1991, p. 404). In contrast, an Eastern perspective &quot;places an emphasis on perceiving and knowing things and events holistically and synthetically, rather than analytically&quot; (p. 403). The significance of these differences is marked, with Eastern thought comprised of vague, sometimes imprecise statements utilizing circular reasoning, while Western thought is comprised of logical and analytical categorizations, utilizing linear reasoning.<br />
In forensic competitions, then, where events are prescribed, speakers are expected to conform to critic-as-audience expectations asserting the Western argumentative perspective; such expectations and assertions equate to utilization of standardized events and conformity constraints. Consequently, in prepared platform speaking events such as persuasive or informative speaking, as well as limited preparation events like impromptu and extemporaneous speaking, critics expect to and do hear speeches conforming to Western rhetorical conventions: an introduction with a thesis and preview; a body made up of three to five points, well supported by evidence; and a conclusion that reviews and sums up what has been presented. In addition to this basic format, critics will also be evaluating clarity and precision of language, careful enunciation and correct pronunciation of vocabulary, and nonverbal behaviors like direct eye contact, appropriate facial expressions, and vocalics. In events like debate, critics will evaluate speakers on the analytical expertise with which they approach the topic, the amount and credibility of their evidence, and their rhetorical strategies in attempting to defeat opponents. Finally, critics evaluating oral interpretive events not only assess the ability of speakers to develop characterizations and emotive levels, but also to create introductions functioning as arguments supported by the literature presented.<br />
Prescribed in such a manner, forensic competitions function monoculturally, effectively offering the dominant Westernized perspective. Yet forensic programs exist in environments that are not monocultural. Consequently, the polycultural environment within which forensics thrives contains a multiplicity of communicative styles -- styles that have been for the most part ignored, marginalized, and silenced in the world of competitive speech and debate. As Barlund (1975) notes, communicative styles may be defined as: By communicative style is meant the topics people prefer to discuss, their favorite forms of interaction -- ritual, repartee, argument, selfdisclosure -- and the depth of involvement they demand of each other. It includes the extent to which communicants rely upon the same channels -- vocal, verbal, physical -- for conveying information, and the extent to which they are tuned to the same level of meaning, that is, to the factual or emotional content of messages (p. 12). To better understand the significance of Barlundís definition, a consideration of culturally different communicative style is warranted.<br />

However, Louisville contends that the rich historical legacy of policy debate can look to the past to offer a solution for the future: a persuasion-centered model of debate. Former Director of Debate, Professor Charles Murrish of UMKC argues in 1964<br />

<br />
Until the debate community institutionalizes a more inclusive set of evaluation standards that allow for effective communication in a multicultural society, the University of Louisville debate team will utilize the topic debate as an assessment measure for who can best achieve the advantage of increasing multiculturalism in our debate education. Our goal is to determine the effectiveness of standards for evaluation advocated by our opponents for their topic argument by examining the impact of their argument strategies towards our movement.<br />
<br />
We recognize that you have not arrived here by choice. The opposition was chosen to be here by computer. The judge was likely chosen by the opposition through the use of mutual preference judging. You both came prepared to have a competitive and education experience about this year’s topic. But as noted in our Valdavia-Sutherland evidence from our first speech, the current training in debate forces cultural assimilation and prevents our ability to learn different cultural perspectives in the ways we communicate about the topic. So we have temporarily interrupted your desire to compete in finding the best policy option to force this community to address the just as important discussion about how we can create more effective policy implementation education through a more multicultural debate community.<br />
<br />
One aspect of the education for debaters in this debate is the operation of a social movement for the right to an effective education. To celebrate the one year anniversary of the death of Rosa Parks, we dissect the Montgomery Bus Boycott to understand how movements function. We believe the protest boycotters had to interact with four major groups or relationships. The most overtly hostile group to the boycotters was the segregationists who believed that separate and unequal was not only allowable, but justified by their perceived superiority of whites over Blacks. A second group that interacted with the boycotters were the accomodationists who offered occasional indirect support for the boycott but usually with questionable motives unrelated to the major issue. For example, Wikipedia suggests that many white women picked up their Black house staff during the bus boycott, but it was uncertain whether these actions actually intended to support the boycott, or merely in the self-interest of having their employees at work and on time. Free riders were a third group in the movement. Some African Americans continued to ride the buses during the boycott, but were quick to enjoy the benefits of riding in the front of the bus after successful legal changes. Finally, there is the community activist, who consistently advocates change and supports the boycott by participating in it.<br />
<br />
As activists with a specific mission to create social change, we choose to build strategic coalitions with our opponents in an effort to mobilize support for our cause. We identify the MEM movement’s relationship with our debate opponents based on two factors: our interactions in this debate through your first speech advocacy strategies and cross-examination answers about those strategies. We then position our DEBATE opponents as one of the following:<br />
Segregationists; accomodationists; free riders; and community activists. Segregationists believe that currently existing monocultural debate practices are better than other possible methods of debate and that people who advocate different styles or methods of evaluation should go elsewhere. Accomodationists believe in strategic adaptation based on their opposition, justifying their choice as being in the best educational interest of their opponents, although there is clear self-interest resulting from their actions; Free riders consistently engage in alternative debate methods and styles of debate without consistently and overtly challenging those methods. They benefit from the sacrifices and risks made by others to change the evaluation procedures necessary to create space for the different perspectives they engage in. Finally, the true community activists constantly fight for changes in the evaluation process by making sacrifices in their approach to policy debate, which make them a true and equal coalition partner in our movement.<br />
We will debate not the individual arguments of the opponent, but rather the larger argument strategies deployed by the opponents and how those strategies interact with out movement and what responsibility and our opponents are taking with regards to the harms of the monocultural debate community.<br />

<br />
Neg way ahead on exclusion debate<br />
How does framework operate with other things?<br />
- stuttering, accents, etc. – what’s the remedy?<br />
- judge is the audience for the debate round, adaptation through speed good<br />
- slow down<br />
- debate does include ethos and pathos – persuasive ethos decides most rounds, we always have 2-1 decisions and stuff because of non-factual things<br />
- ethos resolves competing claims – “gop/dems win now” – about how debaters persuasively argue<br />
- pathos – people change their voice and shit in the last couple of speeches<br />
- debate solves their impacts through speaker points<br />
- set up logo-centrism better in 2ac –<br />
1. debate solves<br />
a. ethos<br />
b. pathos<br />
2. logocentrism solves<br />
<br />
JUDGE COMMENTS<br />
You know what arguments they are going to make. Read the 1AC slowly. If they tell you that they cant understand you then your 2AC better be really slow. Even at a slow pace you will still have more evidence and arguments than Louisville will. Make arguments about your own experiences and how they relate to theirs.
