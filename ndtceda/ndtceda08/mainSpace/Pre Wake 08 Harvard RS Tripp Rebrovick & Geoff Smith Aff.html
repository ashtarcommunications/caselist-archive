Dartmouth RR Round # 2 - Aff vs. Cal BP<br />
The United States federal government should eliminate its promotion and procurement of products from concentrated animal feeding operations in and for schools.<br />
<br />
Advantage One: “What’s for lunch?”<br />
<br />
In 1946, the federal government created the National School Lunch Program with two conflicting goals:<br />
1. To remedy chronic malnutrition among children.<br />
2. To dispose of massive agricultural surpluses left over from the war.<br />
<br />
At the time, these two policies fit well together: farmers could dump their fatty meat and dairy products, and children could eat themselves into healthy weights.<br />
<br />
Times have changed, however – today over-nutrition, not malnutrition, is the problem. Children eat more fat than ever.<br />
<br />
But the NSLP has not changed either its mission or its guidelines. It still serves the same high-fat, cholesterol loaded food that it did in 1946. Here’s some facts: [Yeoman 3 [Barry, Mother Jones, Jan/Feb]]<br />
<br />
Every weekday at lunch… and pepperoni calzones<br />
<br />
As a result, childhood obesity is becoming a pandemic – school lunches are the key intersection<br />
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, the American …. the full meal (Becker and Burros, 2003).<br />
<br />
What’s more, the school lunch program creates lifelong health problems:<br />
<br />
First – what children eat in school determines what they eat at home. It allows for successful industry propaganda and marketing.<br />

Amy Dillard ‘8, Law Professor University of Baltimore, 2008, Sloppy Joe, Slop, Sloppy Joe: How USDA Commodities Dumping Ruined the National School Lunch Program, University of Baltimore Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2008-05, [<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://papers.ssrn.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1133157" rel="nofollow">http://papers.ssrn.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1133157</a>], p. 12<br />
<br />
The greatest benefit … usually the least healthy.<br />
<br />
Second – diet learned at school shapes lifelong eating patterns<br />

Congress supported the … had been telling us for years.<br />
<br />
Even if there are alternate causalities to obesity, school diets are the key foundation. They are where kids get a surplus of calories which enables obesity in the first place.<br />

<br />
Advantage Two: The Ideologies of Eating<br />
Food is not only social, but it is symbolic. Eating actively creates and structures social form through the course of interaction and symbolic meaning attribution. Food is the most fundamental form of socialization, since it represents everyday activity. What we eat determines who we are.<br />
<br />
George Gumerman ’97 Department of Anthropology, Northern Arizona University (Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory, VoL 4, No. 2, “Food and Complex Societies”<br />
<br />
Food is intrinsically social…of the inner workings of complex societies.<br />
<br />
Eating is especially socializing when it comes to children – meals, in terms of what counts as food and what counts and social action, enable children to acquire social knowledge and language. As the most recurrent form of social participation, eating is the key site for the creation of culture.<br />
<br />
Elinor Ochs, Anthropology, UCLA, and Merav Shohet ‘6 Psycho-Medical and Linguistic Anthropology, UCLA (“The Cultural Structuring of Mealtime Socialization” NEW DIRECTIONS FOR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT, no. 111, Spring 2006<br />
<br />
Anthropologists … and planning at the meal.<br />
<br />
Specifically, schools are the most important site of childhood socialization – they are the single social institution with the most access to children<br />
<br />
Karen E. Peterson ‘7 &amp; Mary Kay Fox, Professor Public Health Nutrition Harvard School of Public Health and Senior Researcher at Mathematica Policy Research, 2007, Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics, Spring, 35 J.L. Med. &amp; Ethics 113, p. 113-4<br />
<br />
Schools are a logical … to base recommendations.<br />
<br />
<br />
As such, the current school lunch program is problematic in two respects:<br />
<br />
First – the culture of meat<br />
<br />
Eating of meat, more than any other food, is a political act. When children are socialized into the culture of meat, they are socialized, most of all, into a culture of domination. Meat symbolizes control dominion of all parts of the world and structures culture according to subservience. The result is that he entire American society is socialized into ignorance of suffering – the effects are large and are manifest in systems of institutional violence.<br />
<br />
Michael Allen Fox ’99 Philosophy, Queen’s University Deep Vegetarianism 28-33<br />
<br />
Anthropologist Nick Fiddes, … a need for the change.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, these forms of domination permeate all of society – contingent apocalypse lays forever on the horizon as long as we are socialized into meat. Ecological destruction becomes inescapable.<br />
<br />
Nick Fiddes ’91 Research Fellow in the Department of Social Anthropology at Edinburgh Meat: A Natural Symbol 210<br />
<br />
The litany of social and … positive meanings of the past.<br />
<br />
The second problem is ignorant eating:<br />
<br />
The eating of industrial meats trains children to be ignorant of their food – this distance from food is problematic: it creates broader structures of ignorance about the world.<br />
<br />
Michael Pollan ‘6, Author and Agriculture Writer for the New York Times Magazine, 2006, Omnivore’s Dilemma: a natural history of four meals, p. 10-1<br />
What is perhaps most … only deepened by knowing.<br />
<br />
This is even worse with CAFO products – they create a compartmentalization of the social violence creating systems of ignorance. This type of compartmentalization-as-social-form is basis for most forms of violence and warfare.<br />
<br />
Michael Allen Fox ’99 Philosophy, Queen’s University Deep Vegetarianism 39-44<br />
<br />
Why do thoughtful people … imprint of human¬ity,&quot; and the like.<br />
<br />
What’s more – our relationship to the culture of meat is the most important impact. By structuring all of society, meat eating and its accompanying ignorance is at the foundation of all forms of domination in western society. Meat is the “red-thread” that runs through ideologies of power and violence.<br />
<br />
Nick Fiddes ’91 Research Fellow in the Department of Social Anthropology at Edinburgh Meat: A Natural Symbol 227-231<br />
<br />
Just as significant as such empirical … itself teetering on a precipice to oblivion.<br />
<br />
The plan solves: it’s an extremely empowering move in the context of food. School nutrition is a fertile site for the remaking and renegotiating of social norms and practices. Changing school wellness policies brings in local actors, and the policy process involved in the schools creates a participatory regime for nutrition and health.<br />

Summary and Explanation By … with policy more explicitly.<br />
<br />
And, the plan is key to changing food policy and the food system more broadly – it injects health into food policy, and focuses on food supply, which is where change has to begin<br />

Federal food policy determines the food system – this is historically true<br />
<br />
Emily J. Schaffer ‘2, Attorney, 2002, Food and Drug Law Journal, 57 Food Drug L.J. 371, p. 411-2<br />
<br />
The federal government … Americans depends on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, the NSLP is key -- it determines the food landscape in schools – changes in top level policies affect the whole program<br />

<strong>Advantage Two: <em>A Delicious Revolution</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>FIRST -- food isn’t isolated from the social – it’s part of a larger apparatus of industry and agency. The type of eating one learns determines one’s role in a social system – whether as a purely passive participant, or an active, critical agent.</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>What’s more, through <em>food</em> – and attitudes towards it – the entire world can be revisioned and reimagined, but starting with children is necessary. Eating consciously and pleasurably opens one’s senses and one’s mind – it restarts environmental consciousness.</strong><br />

TOPICALITY<br />
We eliminate two types of subsidies for CAFOs<br />
<br />
1. Commodity purchasing<br />

4. Counter-interpretation – a subsidy involves a government transfer of money, including purchasing goods<br />
<br />
US Code ‘8 (Title 19. Customs Duties, Chapter 4. Tariff Act of 1930, Countervailing and Antidumping Duties, General Provisions, 19 USCS § 1677)<br />
<br />
(5) Countervailable subsidy.<br />
(A) In general… purchasing goods.<br />
<br />
B. in the context of agriculture, subsidies have to be tied to food production<br />
<br />

<br />
Agricultural subsidies… the prices of agricultural products.<br />

The United States federal government should eliminate its promotion and procurement of products from concentrated animal feeding operations in and for schools.<br />
Advantage One: “What’s for lunch?”<br />
<br />
In 1946, the federal government created the National School Lunch Program with two conflicting goals:<br />
1. To remedy chronic malnutrition among children.<br />
2. To dispose of massive agricultural surpluses left over from the war.<br />
<br />
At the time, these two policies fit well together: farmers could dump their fatty meat and dairy products, and children could eat themselves into healthy weights.<br />
<br />
Times have changed, however – today over-nutrition, not malnutrition, is the problem. Children eat more fat than ever.<br />
<br />
But the NSLP has not changed either its mission or its guidelines. It still serves the same high-fat, cholesterol loaded food that it did in 1946. Here’s some facts: [Yeoman 3 [Barry, Mother Jones, Jan/Feb]]<br />
<br />
Every weekday at lunch… and pepperoni calzones<br />
<br />
As a result, childhood obesity is becoming a pandemic – school lunches are the key intersection<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, the American …. the full meal (Becker and Burros, 2003).<br />
<br />
What’s more, the school lunch program creates lifelong health problems:<br />
<br />
First – what children eat in school determines what they eat at home. It allows for successful industry propaganda and marketing.<br />

<br />
Advantage Two: The Ideologies of Eating<br />
Food is not only social, but it is symbolic. Eating actively creates and structures social form through the course of interaction and symbolic meaning attribution. Food is the most fundamental form of socialization, since it represents everyday activity. What we eat determines who we are.<br />
<br />
George Gumerman ’97 Department of Anthropology, Northern Arizona University (Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory, VoL 4, No. 2, “Food and Complex Societies”<br />
<br />
Food is intrinsically social…of the inner workings of complex societies.<br />
<br />
Eating is especially socializing when it comes to children – meals, in terms of what counts as food and what counts and social action, enable children to acquire social knowledge and language. As the most recurrent form of social participation, eating is the key site for the creation of culture.<br />
<br />

<br />
Anthropologists … and planning at the meal.<br />
<br />
Specifically, schools are the most important site of childhood socialization – they are the single social institution with the most access to children<br />

<br />
Schools are a logical … to base recommendations.<br />
<br />
<br />
As such, the current school lunch program is problematic in two respects:<br />
<br />
First – the culture of meat<br />
<br />
Eating of meat, more than any other food, is a political act. When children are socialized into the culture of meat, they are socialized, most of all, into a culture of domination. Meat symbolizes control dominion of all parts of the world and structures culture according to subservience. The result is that he entire American society is socialized into ignorance of suffering – the effects are large and are manifest in systems of institutional violence.<br />
<br />
Michael Allen Fox ’99 Philosophy, Queen’s University Deep Vegetarianism 28-33<br />
<br />
Anthropologist Nick Fiddes, … a need for the change.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, these forms of domination permeate all of society – contingent apocalypse lays forever on the horizon as long as we are socialized into meat. Ecological destruction becomes inescapable.<br />
<br />
Nick Fiddes ’91 Research Fellow in the Department of Social Anthropology at Edinburgh Meat: A Natural Symbol 210<br />
<br />
The litany of social and … positive meanings of the past.<br />
<br />
The second problem is ignorant eating:<br />
<br />
The eating of industrial meats trains children to be ignorant of their food – this distance from food is problematic: it creates broader structures of ignorance about the world.<br />
<br />
Michael Pollan ‘6, Author and Agriculture Writer for the New York Times Magazine, 2006, Omnivore’s Dilemma: a natural history of four meals, p. 10-1<br />
What is perhaps most … only deepened by knowing.<br />
<br />
This is even worse with CAFO products – they create a compartmentalization of the social violence creating systems of ignorance. This type of compartmentalization-as-social-form is basis for most forms of violence and warfare.<br />
<br />
Michael Allen Fox ’99 Philosophy, Queen’s University Deep Vegetarianism 39-44<br />
<br />
Why do thoughtful people … imprint of human¬ity,&quot; and the like.<br />
<br />
What’s more – our relationship to the culture of meat is the most important impact. By structuring all of society, meat eating and its accompanying ignorance is at the foundation of all forms of domination in western society. Meat is the “red-thread” that runs through ideologies of power and violence.<br />
<br />
Nick Fiddes ’91 Research Fellow in the Department of Social Anthropology at Edinburgh Meat: A Natural Symbol 227-231<br />
<br />
Just as significant as such empirical … itself teetering on a precipice to oblivion.<br />
<br />
The plan solves: it’s an extremely empowering move in the context of food. School nutrition is a fertile site for the remaking and renegotiating of social norms and practices. Changing school wellness policies brings in local actors, and the policy process involved in the schools creates a participatory regime for nutrition and health.<br />

<br />
Contention 2 is Trade<br />
<br />
FIRST – The WTO is on the brink of collapse. The continual breakdown of Doha negotiations and lack of judicial legitimacy threaten the relevance of the WTO.<br />
Blustein, 8-21 (Paul, Journalist in Residence, Global Economy and Development at The Brookings Institution, “Doha Trade Talks Collapse: What’s Next for Global Trade?,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0820_trade_blustein.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0820_trade_blustein.aspx</a>)<br />
<br />
There are two internal links to global trade:<br />
<br />
First – the Doha Negotiations<br />
<br />
If the Doha round fails, the WTO as an institution won’t be far behind. Absent the stability provided by the WTO, protectionist trade wars will break out, threatening the viability of the global economy.<br />
Ikenson, 06 (Daniel, Trade Policy Analyst at Cato, “The WTO After Hong Kong - Where Do We Go From Here,” February 14 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freetrade.org/node/710" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetrade.org/node/710</a>)<br />
<br />
BUT – despite the temporary setback at Geneva, there is still hope for the Doha. A renewed commitment from the US can finish the round before the end of the year.<br />
The Economist, 7-19 (“Defrosting Doha,” lexis)<br />
<br />
What’s more – the Geneva talks collapsed not because of SSM negotiations, but because the US refused to budge of cotton subsidies. The US engineered the collapse because it refused to let the cotton issue come to the table.<br />
Sharma, 08 (Devinder, food and trade policy analyst, “What Caused WTO Collapse? It Was Cotton Subsidies, Stupid?” Zmag, August 5, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.countercurrents.org/sharma050808.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.countercurrents.org/sharma050808.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
If left unresolved, the most recent cotton dispute at Geneva will end the Doha round forever.<br />

<br />
What’s more – the cotton dispute is representative for the WTO as a whole. Unless it gets resolved, the entire WTO system will lose authority.<br />
Pfeifer, Alpert, and Kripke, 04 (Kimberly, Gawain, and Emily, policy analysts for Oxfam and Senior Policy Advisor on international trade issues with Oxfam America and policy analyst for Oxfam America, “Finding the Moral Fiber”, Oxfam Briefing Paper 69, October, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/briefing_papers/cotton_brief101804/cotton_brief101804.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/briefing_papers/cotton_brief101804/cotton_brief101804.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
BUT – reaching an agreement on cotton would revive the talks:<br />
<br />
FIRST: spillover.<br />
<br />
it’s the most important impasse and would lay the groundwork for resolving all of the agricultural disputes.<br />
Pan et al 2007 (Suwen, Research Scientist, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, Cotton Economics Research Institute, Texas Tech University, “Cotton in a Free Trade World”, Economic Inquiry Vol. 45 Iss. 1, January, ProQuest)<br />
SECOND – trade leadership.<br />
<br />
Cotton is the leading drain on US trade credibility. It must be resolved before the US can reasonably lead the Doha negotiations.<br />
Hall 08 (Joshua, Scott Beaulier, Profs at Beloit College Dept of Economics, Madeline Helling, Beloit College, Wisconsin, USA, and, “HIGH COTTON: WHY THE USA SHOULD NOT PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO COTTON FARMERS,” Economic Affairs, Volume 28, Issue 2, Pages 65-66)<br />
<br />
What’s more – US trade leadership in the WTO is necessary to keep the world on a multilateral track. Absent US credibility within multilateral negotiations, bilateral and regional trade agreements are inevitable and will take down the whole system.<br />
Even if preferential agreements are inevitable – as long as the US can support the multilateral regime, they aren’t problematic.<br />
Tarullo, 07 (Daniel, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, “The Case for Reviving the Doha Trade Round,” Center for American Progress, January, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/01/pdf/doha.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/01/pdf/doha.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Striking a deal on cotton would enable the US to regain its trade leadership. The world is waiting.<br />

<br />
THIRD – enabling concessions.<br />

A US concession on cotton enable developing countries to make concessions on tariffs and NAMA. The plan ushers in new agreements in the Doha round.<br />

<br />
What’s more – a move of unilateral liberalization by the US would revive and fix the flawed WTO negotiating framework. It would propel negotiations forward.<br />

<br />
The SECOND INTERNAL LINK to global trade is COMPLIANCE.<br />
<br />
First – the upland cotton case renders the US out of compliance with WTO obligations<br />
Randy Schnepf, Specialist in Agricultural Policy Resources, Science and Industry Division, 2005 (July 11, &quot;Background on the U.S.-Brazil WTO Cotton Subsidy Dispute&quot;, CRS Report for Congress, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/57876.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/57876.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Failure to comply with the cotton case threatens the judicial legitimacy of the WTO as a whole.<br />
BENICCHIO, 05 (Romain, economist and a political adviser on trade for Oxfam International, based<br />
in Geneva, Switzerland. “The WTO ruling on the Brazil-US cotton dispute: Implications for African countries and agriculture Negotiations,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ictsd.net/downloads/2008/04/cotton_book_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ictsd.net/downloads/2008/04/cotton_book_en.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
What’s more – compliance with WTO rulings is necessary not just to the credibility of the DSB, but to the WTO as a whole. The US specifically must be seen as a compliant member or else the system will break down.<br />

<br />
And – A strong DSU is critical to sustaining norms of international trade while reviving negotiations<br />
Lawrence, 07 (Robert Z., Albert L. Williams Professor of International Trade and Investment at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, “The United States and the WTO Dispute Settlement System,” the CFR, March, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/WTO_CSR25.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/WTO_CSR25.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Compliance with judicial decisions are also necessary for negotiations to work – Doha can’t succeed unless the US starts complying with the DSB.<br />

Buck, Jr. Professor, Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Davis; and member of the Giannini Foundation.

<br />
Next are the impacts to Free Trade.<br />
<br />
First - Failure to save the WTO guarantees the world splits into US and China trade blocs<br />

Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University, “The Rise of China and the Future of the West,” Foreign Affairs, January/February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080101faessay87102-p30/g-john-ikenberry/the-rise-of-china-and-the-future-of-the-west.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080101faessay87102-p30/g-john-ikenberry/the-rise-of-china-and-the-future-of-the-west.html</a>)<br />
<br />
US-China trade disputes guarantees global economic depression and large scale conflict that escalates<br />

<br />
Impact is extinction<br />
Chalmers Johnson, author of Blowback: the Costs and Consequences of American Empire, 2001, The Nation, p 20<br />
<br />
And – the ensuing economic collapse causes nuke war<br />
Bearden Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army, 2000 [Tom, June 24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3aaf97f22e23.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3aaf97f22e23.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
Further - collapse of the WTO causes global thermonuclear war<br />
Copley News Service, December 1, 1999<br />
<br />
And – multiple studies prove that free trade reduces the likelihood of conflict<br />

2. disenchantment<br />
<br />
trade dispute will push lula closer to chavez's radical anti-americanism<br />
quiliconi 05<br />
&quot;the exhaustion of the neo-liberal&quot; and &quot;him from power&quot;<br />
<br />
cotton subsidies have become the determinate issue in the relationship<br />
– if lula is disenchanted with market capitalism, brazil will balance<br />
against he us with chavez – only a concession shore up lulas support<br />

if the us reconciles brazilian trade disputes it can keep brazil in<br />

disasterous – precipitating multiple wars<br />
