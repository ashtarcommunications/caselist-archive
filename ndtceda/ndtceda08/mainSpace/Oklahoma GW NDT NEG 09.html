 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The affirmative constructs themselves as all powerful egos capable of overseeing and manipulating international relations. This creates a dangerous relationship to the world in terms of objectification and only values the world in terms of strategic viability, discarding that which is not.

The only way out of this cycle of guilt and investment which must constantly revisit the site of injury is forgetting . we must forget the original injury which made us hate the wolrd and seek repayment indeed any repayment or forgiveness can only reinscribe the cycle of domination.

Their attempt to rectify human inhuman relationships is merely a particular manifestation of a fantasy that attempts to extirpate evil from good – it imagines a natural balance free of ecological devastation, ozone depletion and over consumption, erasing the devastation produced by nature itself.
