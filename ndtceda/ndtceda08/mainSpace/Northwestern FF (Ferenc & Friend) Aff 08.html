The current Israeli govt has manipulated the domestic political machinery of the US, creating an intractable pro-Israel bias in discussions of US Middle East Policy.<br />

Israel is a sacred cow in political discussions over the Middle East that inhibits free discussion<br />

<br />
Zionism is enshrined in American politics as the greatest form of political power<br />
Said 79 ZIONISM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ITS VICTIMS, Social text n1 Winter p7-58<br />
the special one might even call it ..... zionism in the present circumstances<br />
<br />
Western benevolence is part of Zionism's larger practice of historical fabrication - self serving idealism that focuses on the important and benign process of Israel's creation while ignoring the historical realities of Zionism's imposition on Palestinians<br />
Prior 1999 ZIONISM AND THE STATE OF ISRAEL p187<br />
the west's benevolent assessment ... indeed, it appears that Nakba denial is a necessary tenet of jewish christian dialogue<br />
<br />
This one-sided history creates a Messianic and apocalyptic imagination where the Jewish people perform historic revenge - a crude game of settling scores as the violence of the Jew's cruel history repeats itself as its own cure<br />
Rose 2005 QUESTION OF ZION p19-20<br />
up to 1492 the messianic .... mathematical game<br />
<br />
And, this revenge manifests itself in current Israel-US strategy toward Palestine: eradication of the all Palestinians locked in place by the suppression of critical debate<br />

The off limits nature of US support acts as a psychological masking of Israel's underlying existential fears<br />

&quot;this state of acute political and social psychosis&quot; &quot;recipe for widespread regional annihilation&quot;<br />

Israeli addiction to US aid enables its fictional obsession with security threats and maintenance of xenophobic paranoia that makes death and destruction inevitable<br />
Ritter 07 online<br />
&quot;the statements by Israeli officials concerning the recent National Intelligence Estimate&quot; &quot;aid must likely apply to Israel&quot;<br />
<br />
Only the US can open up a space for Israeli and Palestinian dialogue that will allow both sides to reconfigure their identities away from being victimized aggressors and allow them to mourn their fantasies of omnipotence and separate, ethnic states. Without the plan's shift in support and unique opportunity for dialogue, this space will continue to be filled with fear and threats that makes any reconciliation impossible and global war inevitable<br />

in short, effective political ideas like Zionism .... against liberal hegemony<br />
view zionism genealogically AND as a practical system for accumulation<br />
<br />
The aff is a weapon of criticism to bring academic discourse into the realm of political struggle - the mere attempt to give the Palestinian case material abundance, even on paper, is a concrete part of the struggle against Zionism and is a precursor to political change<br />

 <br />
1. DA buys into the same logic of Zionism's existential fear that perpetuates endless cycle of violence and revenge - this normalizes death as life no longer becomes an option - that's KHALAF (and the CP cannot solve)<br />
And, we must refuse to be gripped by annihilation anxiety that sees the reality of the other as a threat to our existence - that's ROBINSON - threat narratives fill potential spaces of dialogue and make conflicts impossible to solve<br />
<br />
2. Moreover the DA is a universalized manifestation of the spectacle of catastrophe - much like the Zionist state, it demands sacrifice of the other to free outselves from the penalty of dying.<br />
Beres Spr 1994 Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law<br />
humankind is different AND penalty of dying of being killed<br />
3. The Zionist dialectic of fear is now used by US policymakers as they maintain fear to sustain power<br />
Atzmon 06 online<br />
&quot;the following is a Jewish telegram&quot; &quot;Neocons use exactly the same tactic&quot;<br />
<br />
4. Once again in similar fashion to Zionism, the negative's focus on existential threats represents a surrender of individualism to the state - this mandates an endless cycle of &quot;holy wars&quot; in the name of survival - ironically these excursions makie life impossible, as the states merely lead us down the path to extinction<br />
Beres 94<br />
behind the play of nations and their wars AND it is their fate to create necropolis<br />
<br />
5. Voting affirmative to confront the existential fear inherent in Zionist psyche can now become part of a large project to connect to the transpersonal domain of the psyche, increasing our chances for survival<br />
Grof 01 Intl Journal of HUmanities and Peace v17<br />
these changes deepend and extend even further AND increase our chances for survival if it could occur on a sufficiently large scale<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc6"><a name="Northwestern FF - Cal, Rd 3 - Critical Zionism Aff-POLITICS DA Ans"></a>POLITICS DA Ans</h2>
 1. The DA is a fanatical reading of the political world - much like Zionism's current hegemony over political discussions, the DA allows manipulation of individual pieces of the puzzle to suit specific aims, ignoring the broader context of political events - just as Zionism chooses bits and pieces of historical events to ignore the death and destruction wrought against the Palestinians<br />
Bennett 96 POLITICS OF ILLUSION p58-59<br />

<ul><ul><ul><li>fragments are the problem</li></ul></ul></ul><br />
2. DA recreates fabrication of reality inherent in Zionism - voting for their fantastic political scenario conditions us as political actors to blindly accept fabrications of political reality - our ROSE evidence proves the end result is an endless cycle of death and destruction<br />
Bennett POLITICS OF ILLUSION p189<br />
beyond the social consequences .... emotional responses from the public<br />
<br />
3. Refuse to engage in decision making based on political solutions that do not work - political space dominated by expedient news precludes critical thinking to create effective solutions - moreover, acting upon these dominant images is self fulfilling as they foster realization of their convoluted scenarios<br />
