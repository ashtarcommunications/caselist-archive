<strong><u>Negatives for UCO CH and UCO SS</u></strong><br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri">The affirmatives description of the status quo is based upon the blindness of western knowledge’s objectivity which is a doctrine of science manipulated by religion. These Naïve descriptions of reality are unfounded, knowledge is relative, there is a liberating facet of not knowing what allows us to create a new picture of reality.<br />
<br />
Deloria 99<br />
<u>For This Land.</u> Pg. 103-105<br />
<br />
There is an underside to the affirmative that is glossed over by the 1ac’s progressive narrative. This underside is the relationship to land, the destruction of native Americans, and the trail of subsidies that followed the extermination of the buffalo. They view the land as an advesary and attempt to enclose land into territories, fields, and landscapes. This mindset alters the land and deprives it of its offering setting into corse a violent gridwork of oppositions.<br />
<br />
Marzec in 2001<br />
<em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri">Colonization and the Robinson Crusoe Syndrome: A Genealogy of Land in a Global Context.</span></em> (Project Muse)<br />
<br />
This ideological state of knowledge that the affirmative subscribes to enables a mass colonization of the “false” to the west’s distorted view of reality. This creates a pacification of any dissident others.<br />
<br />
Spanos 2000 (William, <u>Anatomy of an Empire</u>)<br />
<br />
The Focus of management of the world set catastrophe and violence into motion. Their role as managers of the planet enables us to forget the mystery of life by embracing the blindness of the multiple truths of the worlds reduces life to standing reserve.<br />
<br />
McWhorter in 92 (Ladelle, <u>Heidegger and the Earth</u>. ISBN 0943549068. Pg. 4-7)<br />
<br />
The Epistemic memory of American has been impaired- the spectre of the annihilation of native Americans has haunted our memories until recently when it was believed our memory was corrected because of the focus defeat of the Nazi’s and the Vietnamese- This forgetting hass allowed for genocidal violence to be conducted n the spectral other for centuries and makes that spectral violence inevitable.<br />
<br />
Spanos 2000 (William, <u>Anatomy of an Empire.</u> Pg. 261-262)<br />
<br />
Our alternative is a fundamental reorientation of the basic framework of reality. We renounce the affirmative’s call to action; this refusal resist the picure of reality set into motion by Western Epistomology. This reorientation allows us to decolonize this room and this debate space.<br />
<br />
Deloria 99<br />
<u>For This Land</u><br />
Our modality of thought strikes against the nihilistic destiny of western culture that has brought us the destruction of the buffalo, assimilation, nuclear testing, and the current path of collective suicide.<br />
