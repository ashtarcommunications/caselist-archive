Missouri State Neg vs. Concordai MR (metaphor aff)<br />
Metaphor T<br />
A- when a case relies upon metaphor, our argument is that the tenor- not just the vehicle- needs to be topical, Sitanen explains the terminology:<br />
Susan A. Siltanen, Butterflies are Rainbows, A Development investigation of metaphor comprehension, January 1986, Vol 35, Issue 1. Communication Education.<br />
It is not the puropose of this…tenor and vehicle.<br />
<br />
B- Violation- even if their plan is topical, their tenor is not. At best it is extra topical. <br />
C- Judging topicality based on the vehicle is bad.<br />
Infinitively regressive. A topical vehicle referring to a non-topical tenor unlimits the topic.<br />
Negative ground- Stable DA and CP ground are the best check.<br />
D Bad theory grounding the 1AC is a voting issue. <br />

Paradiastole DA<br />
Metaphor risks slipping into paradiastole, undermining the possibility or moral argument. <br />
Feldman in 2001, Conscience and the concealments of Metaphor in Hobbe’s Levithan, Philosophy and Rhetoric 34.1 <br />
Although Hobbs attributes…apply evaluative terms.<br />
<br />
Paradiastole risks valuation shifts, undermining the moral value of case.<br />
Same cite<br />
The reason for Hobbe’s…rhetorical redescription. <br />

Metaphor Case Turns<br />
Metaphor substitutes private judgment for public authority, turning case for 2 reasons: Vital to the appeal of case and error and description necessary to stealing of the land.<br />
Feldman in 2001, Conscience and the concealments of Metaphor in Hobbe’s Levithan, Philosophy and Rhetoric 34.1 <br />
Which Hobbes poses…of public authority.<br />
<br />
Their elevation of conscience undermines the notion of public reason that grounds their conclusions as public conclusions. <br />
Feldman in 2001, Conscience and the concealments of Metaphor in Hobbe’s Levithan, Philosophy and Rhetoric 34.1 <br />
In this account…Hobbes calls “Public Reason.”<br />
Metaphor makes knowledge private and secret- assuring its corruption and dispelling its ability to counter against competing options, which is vital to solvency.<br />
Feldman in 2001, Conscience and the concealments of Metaphor in Hobbe’s Levithan, Philosophy and Rhetoric 34.1 <br />
The last step of….or a private nomenclature.
