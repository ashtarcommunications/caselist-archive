 <ol><ol><li>Their affirmative presupposes an individual subject who is the source of controlling intention. This is strategic rationality. Intersubjectivity solves. – Benjamin Lee, 1992, “Tehnology Mediation and Public Discourse”, <u>Habermas and the Public Sphere</u> ed. Calhoun 403-404, “Habermas sees much…communicative action”</li><li>The affirmative’s project is a surrender to authority. – Fred Dallmayr, 1989, “The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity”, The Discourse of Modernity: Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger (And Habermas), Praxis International 8:4, “Heidegger’s later Kehre…history of being”</li><li>No link and turn – Only the negative forgets Being when they engage in a totalizing account of technologization – abandoning empiricism and the traditional sciences is the fastest path to their impacts – Bruno Latour, 1993, “We Have Never Been Modern”, 65-67, “Who has forgotten…kai entautha theous”</li><li>Embracing modernity is transformative – Jurgen Habermas, 1987, “The Philosophical discourse of modernity,” P. 308-310, “Reason is supposed…Descartes to Kant”</li></ol></ol><h3 id="toc4"><a name="x--Off Case Args:"></a><strong><em>Off Case Args:</em></strong></h3>
 <ol><ol><li>Framework<ol><li>Our framework for evaluating decisions is that actors, the jduges, should position themselves as members of a deliberative community that preferences communicative action over strategic action.</li><li>Our framework emphasizes the procedural requirements of the Habermas’ theory of communicative action. Procedural argumen FORMS are the means by which to evaluate if a team meets this framework. Communictaive action is best for debate: this framework creates the necessary conditions under which the better argument prevails by testing “what ought to be done,” the enactment of arguments within this framework is critical to limiting what Habermas labels as “strategic action” or what we would call “rational choice theory.” In the place of this technocratic decision-making we should evaluate arguments in the model of ar they ethical “for all in similar circumstances.” This creates better policy-making and creates a more democratic system. – G. Thomas Goodnight, 2007 “Jurgen Habermas”, <u>Perspectives of the Philosophy of Communication</u> ed. Arneson p. 97-101 “There is no term…the public sphere”</li><li>Our f/w is necessary to create dialogue by opening the onditions of communication to all participants. This dialogue is critical to the value to life and prevent perpetual violence. – Iver B. Neumann, 2003, “International Relations as Emergent Bakhtinian Dialogue”, Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, International Studies Review 5, 123-153, “The appeal of dialogue…to do our bit”</li><li>Communicative action is necessary to intersubjectively evaluate arguments. This kind of rationality is necessary to escape the iron cage of modernity and to overcome oppression. The affirmative can’t solve because they disavow the agency of the subject. Powell and Moody 2003, “The Challenge of Modernity: Habermas and Critical Theory”, “communicative action is linked…marketplace and bureaucracy”</li><li>Our framework provides the best methodology by which to evaluate arguments through a procedural ethics which means that by necessity it is a reason to vote negative because only we meet the requirements of our ethical framework. Our Goodnight evidence makes the argument that the real enactment of these procedures in argumentative communities implicates the function of communicative action. Debate is that argument community, they destroy communicative action.</li></ol></li><li>Counter-advocacy – Engage with the topic countries in a dialogue about human rights.<ol><li>Our model of dialogic engagement is what we will call Communicative engagement. This solves the affirmative’s impacts by creating a shared lifeworld through dialogue. – Marc Lynch, 2002, “Why Engage? China and the Logic of Communicative’s Engagement”, “Despite heated political…conceptions of interests”</li><li>Dialogue solves and link turns the K, a consistently deliberative commitment creates post-imperial human rights required in postmetaphysical thinking. – Amy Bartholomew 2003, “Human Rights and Post-Imperialism: Arguing for a deliberative legitimation of human rights”, “such a conclusion…worth struggling over”</li></ol></li><li><br />

Round 4<br />
Vs Team: Macalester<br />
Judge:<br />
<br />
Case Args:<br />
Ziezek is anti-Semitic<br />
Breger 01<br />
“Within the ideological”…”for the law.”<br />
<br />
This is true in terms of the Middle East. Zizek cannot address the actual events this leads to absurd utopian alternatives calling for radically different things.<br />
Davis 07<br />
“Chapter V is”…”underlies this critique.”<br />
<br />
You cannot eliminate r escape the death drive and it’s good- it gives responsibility and drives political action.<br />
Derrida 95<br />
“But the arguments”…”taking become possible.”<br />
<br />
Fantasy are good and produce agency<br />
Davis 07<br />
“Contra: we remain fixated”…”take within oneself.”<br />
<br />
Zizek’s anit-intellectual celebrity with no peer review, citation, or academic checks makes his work entirely part of the neoliberal and capitalistic<br />
Gilber 2007<br />
“Zizek’s ideal reader”…”so much attention.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
T- QPQ<br />
CP-NGO’s:<br />
The CP is necessary to confront the anti-Semitism of Hamas, words are the incitement to genocide. W/o a change of these word, peace in Palestine is impossible<br />
Richter 08<br />
“Last week the”…”community- to human life”<br />
<br />
Hamas is founded on Anti-Semitism<br />
Anti-Defamation League 2006<br />
“The founding covenant”…”by their intermediary.”<br />
<br />
Anti-Semitism K<br />
<br />
The reps of the 1 ac make Israel look monstrous. Using words like genocide and apartheid single our Israel. The basis for characterization is anti-Semitism<br />
Schoenfeld 04<br />
“More than a”…”be bruttaly punished.”<br />
<br />
Arab Anti-Semitism is not a result of any objectionable Israeli policy, its two fold. First objection is the existence of the Jewish state and how the ethnic cleansing is based on Anti-Semitism of Europe. The Nazi’s played a strong hand in politics of Palestine laying ground work for hatred of Jews and the Israeli state. The bigotry is western not Palestinian<br />
Kuntzel 05<br />
“Research and analysis”…”repressive sharia dictatorship.”<br />
<br />
Hamas was founded on the basis of destroying Israel. To engage is to endorse this.<br />
Mideast Mirro 07<br />
“Every so often”…”seeks to destroy us.”<br />
<br />
Anti-Semitism turns their argument. The bigotry of the 1AC creates a mimetic progression of power relations and fascism. If we win a link to Anti-Semitism than we win a bigger internal link to otherization impacts<br />
Adorno 1946<br />
“The machinery needs”…”it a neurosis.”<br />
<br />
The alt is zero tolerance. Rejection of Anti-Semitism os prerequisite for discussion on the Middle East. Ignoring anything else results in extinction<br />
Kuntzel 07<br />
“The anti-Jewish war”…”moment in history.”<br />
<br />
The new form of anti-Semitism is particularly pernicious, it has the ability to spread among racist groups. The alt is the only way to stop this/ It is essential now to call it out.<br />
Foxman 03<br />
“In such cases”…”particularly deadly cocktail.”<br />
<br />
Their anti-Semitism is the very otherization they condemn and prevents their solvency. You should accept racism of any group. The fact we have to go all in on this argument proves our point.<br />
Mamet 06<br />
“It is, unfortunately”…”world blames the jews.”<br />
<br />
To say Zionism is racism is a double standard<br />
Foxman 2003<br />
“Americans are accustomed”…”as anti-Semitism.”<br />
<br />
Chomsky link<br />
Sershowitz 03<br />
“Mr. Chomsky does”…”Israel means to me.”<br />
<br />
Your article concludes its not racism<br />
“But Gaza is”…”the 21st century.”<br />
<br />
We should use a 3d test to determine the objections of anti-Semitism<br />
Sharansky 04<br />
“But the new”…”a true peace.”<br />
<br />
The FW for the way we shape realty is based on symbolic choices<br />
Foss, Foss, and Trapp<br />
“We take seriously”…”of their lives.”<br />
<br />
Engaging Hamas justifies the Holocaust<br />
Cohen 06<br />
“While it is”…”in the past.”<br />
<br />
Palestinians kills civilians<br />
Dershowitz 03<br />
“In distinct contrast”…”calculus of death.”<br />
<br />
Hamas has not renounced its charter, in their own words<br />
Anto-Defamation League 06<br />
“Hamas will not”…”January 18, 2006.”<br />

Vio - doesn’t engage the gov of Iran<br />
Kills predictability<br />
Ground - no CP ground, test necessitity<br />
Voter - fair and edu<br />
<strong>2 - CP, don’t “offer” just “give” the plan</strong><br />
USFG will guarantee, an offer possibility that they’ll reject it<br />
Policies that attempt to modift behavior based on rewards and punishments begin w/ a basic assumption of state non-cooperation, which upholds the root of hostility and creates an ego oriented antagonistic self fulfilling prophecy<br />
Wendt 99<br />
“power relations play a critical…they will make”<br />
The exchange paradigm’s ego oriented antagonistic ensures serial policy failure and risks total extinction<br />
Vaughan 98<br />
“Since gift paradigm is based on… finally destroy life on earth”<br />
Gift Giving is the only way to solve the planet - a simple reintroduction of the gift paradigm will allow individuals to return to nurturing instead of antagonism, but only if the gift is first<br />
Vaughan 04<br />
“language is based on gift giving…theme for understanding the world”<br />
Any perm doesn’t solve - exchange is competitive and mutually exclusive exchange degrades fift giving w/ an absolute view of life and exchange puts the self before the other<br />
Vaughan 04<br />
“the institutions and social structures that are…satisfying and even delightful”<br />
The logic of tid for tat prevents gift giving because it is oriented only for the benefit for the self and justifies violence if the tat is not given<br />
Vaughan 04<br />
“The stage seems to have been set…spiritualities and art”<br />
Inherent in any offer is the prospect that the reviever will refuse it behind the giver’s back - the constant possibility of betrayal infects diplomacy with an underlying send of mistrust and hostility<br />
Plaxton 00<br />
“in the final analysis…never arrive at its destination”<br />
<strong>3 - Politics - Pepfar</strong><br />
Pepfar 2 is moving to the floor and will pass at expanded funding levels<br />
Physicians for Human Rights 3/19<br />
“Pepfar reauthorization bills have been…that will benefit people living with HIV”<br />
Link - the plan would be unpop, reverses the current policy pissing off neocons, environmentalists<br />
IPS 07<br />

Bush’s PC key to passage<br />
Dietrich 07<br />
“Bush’s move away from security arguments…moral commitment on the issue”<br />
