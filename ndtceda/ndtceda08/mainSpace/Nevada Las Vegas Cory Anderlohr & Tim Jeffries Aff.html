<strong>AIRSTRIKES AFF</strong><br />
Observation 1: Inherency<br />
<br />
More than 900 civilians have died in 2007 due to airstrikes and Karzai is pleading for US to work to prevent civilian casualties<br />
Associated Press 08, Noor Khan, 1/7/08 “Afghan Violence Leaves 10 dead” <br />
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><br />
Despite Calls from Karzai to cease air raids the US has continued to unilaterally attack Afghanistan<br />
Pajhwok Afghan News, 07, May 2, “Civilian casualties no longer acceptable, warns Karzai” Pajhwok Afghan news, Lexis<br />
<br />
Adv 1: Taliban Resurgence<br />
<br />
Instability is on the rise and the Taliban are gaining power due to opposition to US forces<br />
Senlis Council 06, Spring/Summer, International Global Policy Think-tank, “Afghanistan Five years later:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The return of the Taliban” <br />
<br />
Now is key, A spike in violence has put the country on the brink<br />
Nixon 07, Hamish, researcher on local governance issues at the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit, Unit. April 2007.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>“Aiding the State? International Assistance and the State building Paradox in Afghanistan. “ <br />
<br />
We are going to isolate four internal links to Taliban resurgence<br />
<br />
First is community relations: The civilian casualties caused by US air strikes benefit the Taliban it is their best form of Propaganda, turning the public in favor of Radical Taliban violence<br />
Senlis Council 06, December, An assessment of the hearts and minds campaign in Southern Afghanistan<br />
<br />
Second is recruitment: Civilian deaths in air strikes are giving entire regions to the Taliban via boosted recruitment<br />
Johnson 07, Thomas H. , Research prof of the Dept. of national security Affairs @ the Naval Postgraduate school, “ON the edge of the big muddy: The Taliban Resurgence in Afghanistan”, China and Eurasia Forum Quarterly, Vol 5 No. 2<br />
<br />
Third is Parliamentary Support: Air Strikes are pushing the Afghani parliament towards the Taliban Institutionalizing their support base<br />
Gall and Cloud 07, May 10, “Afghans say US airstrikes killed 21 civilians”, New York Times online<br />
<br />
Fourth is Permanent Base of Operations: Local recruitment for the Taliban is the most likely scenario for resurgence via establishing a permanent base of operations<br />
Jones 07, Ph.D. in Political Science, University of Chicago, Seth, 1/31/07, “Afghanistan’s Local insurgency<br />
<br />
<br />
And allowing the Taliban to establish a permanent base of operations in Afghanistan would be really really bad they’ll launch new attacks in the region and globally<br />
Rubin 2007, Director of Studies and Senior Fellow at NYU Center on International Cooperation, January/February, “Saving Afghanistan”, Foreign Affairs<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally this attack sparks full scale nuclear retaliation and world wars<br />
Speice 06, Patrick F Jr., “note: negligence and nuclear nonproliferation: eliminating the current liability barrier to bilateral US Russian nonproliferation assistance programs” William and Mary Law Review 06<br />
<br />
That’s Extinction<br />
Johnathan Schell, Wesleyan University, The fate of the Earth, 1982<br />
<br />
Thus we offer the Following Plan:<br />
The United States Federal Government should constructively engage the government of Afghanistan by offering them a security guarantee including a Status of Forces Agreement that mandates the significant reduction of airstrikes by the United States military with the goal of zero innocent civilians casualties for United State’s military operations in return for closer coordination with the Afghan Ministry of Defense and Afghan National Army.<br />
<br />
Now its Observation 2: Solvency<br />
First The Plan’s Stauts of Forces Agreement is key to stabilizing our commitment to Afghanistan and decreasing Air Strikes<br />
Inderfurth 07, Karl F., a professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University, served as US assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs from 97-01<br />
<br />
And reducing reliance on air strikes is key to stability and wouldn’t require an increase in troops just a change in tactics<br />
