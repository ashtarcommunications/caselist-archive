We meet-<br />
C/I- for is to belong to they ignore the word<br />
Justify extra T<br />
We give them more ground like shift Das<br />
Reason- good is good enough<br />
No in round abuse<br />
<strong>CP</strong><br />
Word PICs are bad<br />
-can’t leverage, makes about minuta, inflates bad args, aff never wins, inf regression, doesn’t solve for ground loss, this sovles all their round<br />
perm both<br />
perm do CP<br />
Conditionality bad<br />
NB doesn’t make sense in the case of the aff<br />
‘Domestic’ key- plan will get derailed<br />
<strong>Budget</strong><br />
Cap is at an all time high<br />
Perm: do plan and pass budget<br />
Congress wont back lash<br />
No spillover- unrelated parts of agenda<br />
Turn- family farmers key<br />

“one hundred and fifty family farmers….CAFOs are going to be allowed”<br />
Ruhl 00 Ecology Law Review 2000, 27<br />
“Farms possess immense political power….politicians are dominated by them”<br />
Growing consumer ethic will temper backlash<br />
Lawrence &amp; Silbergeld 08, Putting Meat on the Table: Industrial Farm Animal Production in America<br />
“Reliance on voluntary standards alone is not….pulic concerns about animal welfare”<br />
Turn-Blue dogs key<br />
Aff is a K of their impact<br />
Blue dogs &amp; fiscal conservaties love the aff<br />
Lillis 11-25-08 Washington Independent Reporter<br />
“Obama pointed specifically to controversial subsides…we don’t have that luxury anymore”<br />
And here is conclusive evidence- Obama knows that Blue Dog support the make or break issue<br />
Nather 11-9-08<br />
“But centrist democrats, including those in the house….with Obama yet about their priorities”<br />
<strong>Vilsack</strong><br />
Can’t solve- industrial lobbies will oppose those kinds of reform<br />
Obama will take the blame, not Vilsack<br />
LT- EQIP not sustainable in the SQ, our ev says farmers WANT a shift, so that helps Vilsack</span><br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Solvency</strong><br />
We solve all our impact<br />
Tech laborinth is really bad<br />
Plan is a derailment on the rail to technicism<br />
ROB: judge = ag policy making<br />
We need to discuss how to frame or decisions before we make them<br />
Aff gets to define ‘nearly all’- we say basically everything, otherwise the aff could go the other direction and not have to do any, which would get us out of Das<br />
<strong>Framework</strong><br />
We are in favor of science- it’s a question of how we use it<br />
SQ application of science is BAD, its try or die for the aff<br />
If econ is privileged solely, the enviro never wins<br />
We don’t make any calc arguments</span><br />

 <br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">dramatic change and action leads to rapid action<br />
they don’t change the corporate culture<br />
<strong>Budget</strong><br />
We’ll win link d here- EQIP and Sub debates have never been divided until now<br />
Our blue dogs LT, which they dropped, solves the blacklash argument<br />
<strong>Vilsack</strong><br />
Intentions are more important than product<br />
Our ethics solve racism<br />
Their Vilsack evidence is bias- all policy makers<br />
Common interest doesn’t exist in big ag- only with plan<br />
Our impact is bigger- theirs is a subset of ours<br />
Econ rationality doesn’t solve warming in the sq<br />
Incrementalism fails</span><br />
