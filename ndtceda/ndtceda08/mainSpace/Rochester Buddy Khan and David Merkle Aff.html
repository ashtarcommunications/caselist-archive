Zizek Iran Aff Outline<br />
<br />
As Iran seeks to obtain nuclear weapons, the US is becoming increasingly insecure, ultimately threatening to pre-emptively strike Iran<br />
Zizek 2005 – &quot;Give Iranian Nukes a Chance&quot;<br />
<br />
US Imperialism is out of control – our desire for infinite consumption is intricately linked to our desire for global hegemony<br />
Steinmetz 2003 – &quot;The State of Emergency and the Revival of American Imperialism&quot;<br />
<br />
Capital is at the root of all evil – derailing the megamachine is a prerequisite to social freedom<br />
Zizek 1989 – &quot;The Sublime Object of Ideology&quot;<br />
<br />
Thus, the plan: The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Iran by offering the transfer of nuclear capabilities to Iran if it challenges US hegemony and global capitalism.<br />
<br />
Our affirmative ties the particular of US hegemony to the universal of global capitalism – metaphoric condensation threatens the very core of capitalist ideology<br />
Zizek 1999 – &quot;The Ticklish Subject&quot;<br />
<br />
Our affirmative is a shattering act – giving Iran nukes is beyond the ideological stop-gap that capitalism currently creates – the impossibility of the aff paves the way for a new beginning<br />
Zizek 2005 – &quot;Give Iranian Nukes a Chance&quot;<br />
<br />
Global capitalism threatens our survival – we must take the risk<br />
Zizek and Daly 2004 – &quot;Conversations with Zizek&quot;<br />
<br />
Challenging the dominant capitalist order is the only ethical act<br />
Zizek and Daly 2004 – &quot;Conversations with Zizek&quot;<br />
<br />
Capital exists only because we believe in it – the plan solves all their impact turns<br />
Johnston 2004 – &quot;Psychoanalysis, Culture &amp; Society&quot;<br />
<br />
We must wipe the slate clean. This is a sequencing question.<br />
Zizek 99<br />
<br />
Risking self-destruction shatters the super-ego – in the face of fear you should run into the fire<br />
Zizek 2000 – &quot;Contingency, Hegemony, Universality&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Indingenous/non-indingenuous dichotomy destroys anti-cap resistance.<br />
Jared James 2001 (“Indigenism,” Summr, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/index.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
This is actually the same issue as the nationalities question…and is just as misguided.<br />
<br />
Identity politics only divides those who must mobilize together.<br />
James Petras November 1997 (A Marxist critique of post-Marxists, LINKS, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dsp.org/au/links/back/issue09/petras.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsp.org/au/links/back/issue09/petras.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
The post-Marxists attack the Marxist notion…(nationalism and class consciousness).<br />
<br />
Perm: do both – combining approaches is key to solve capitalism and existing hierarchies.<br />
Andrea Smith 2005 (Co-founder of INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence, the largest grassroots multiracial feminist organization in the US, Assistant professor of Native American Studies at the University of Michigan, Ph.D in History of Conciousness, CONQUEST: Sexual Violence and American Indian Genoice; South End Press (Cambridge, MA) E 98. W8S62 2005, p. 187-8)<br />
<br />
There are local organizing models…rejection and isolation.<br />
<br />
Our method is key to understanding current social movements.<br />
Dean, Assoc Prof Political Theory, Hobart-William Smith Colleges, 2005 (Jodi, “Enjoyment as a Category of Political Theory,” Paper at the Annual Meeting of American political Science Association, Sept, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://jdeanicite.typepad.com/i_cite/files/aspa_05_enjoyment.doc" rel="nofollow">http://jdeanicite.typepad.com/i_cite/files/aspa_05_enjoyment.doc</a>)<br />
<br />
The notion of jouissance, in other words…under communicative capitalism.<br />
<br />
Attempts at Group Definition Ignore the difference that are excluded for the illusion of sameness – since all these groups depend upon the selection of a specific fiction among others, claims of authenticity are simply used for exclusion and essentialism.<br />
Jerry Frug, Prof Law at Harvard, ARTICLE: Decentering Decentralization, University of Chicago Law Review, Spring, 1993, Lexis<br />
<br />
One way to understand the critique…is identity affirmed.<br />
<br />
Defining the other as a specific individual, race, class or gender is dangerous – identity politics’ use of otherness eliminates the quality of alterity that is critical to any productive use of the subject.<br />
Tamise Van Pelt, Assoc Prof English at Idaho State University, “Otherness,” Postmodern Culture – Volume 10, Number 2, January 2000, p. 151-2<br />
<br />
As half of a signifying binary…speaking on its behalf.<br />
<br />
Contingency fails – it doesn’t overcome the discourse of the master.<br />
Newman, postdoctoral fellow &amp; lecturer at University of Western Australia, 2004 (Saul, Psychoanalysis, Culture &amp; Society, December v9 i3 p. 298, infotrac)<br />
<br />
Moreover, as Lacan shows, political…it tried to negate.<br />
<br />
Only psychoanalysis holds individuals responsible for their interactions with the real – contingencies don’t solve.<br />
Daly, Lecturer Int’l Studies at University College of Northampton, 2004, (Glyn, “Slajov Zizek: Risking the Impossible, www.lacan.com/zizek-primer.htm)<br />
<br />
Zizek’s thought is concerned crucially…the political itself.<br />
<br />
The attempt to deal with untie victimization without challenging the fantasy is a waste of time, we must recognize and assume pleasure in the fantasy to solve.<br />
Slavoj Zizek, Are We Allowed to Enjoy Daphnee du Maurier, Center for Theology and Politics, 2004, (www.lacan.com/zizdaphmaur.htm)<br />
<br />
This also resolves the problem of…of subject’s being.<br />
<br />
We are not a celebration of violence – instead we are tragically aware that liberation as a process if painful.<br />
Zizek, Senior researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 2003 (Slavoj, Liberation Hurts – an interview with Zizek, 9-29, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://evans-experientalism.freewebspace.com/rasmussen.htm" rel="nofollow">http://evans-experientalism.freewebspace.com/rasmussen.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
A kind of litmus test is…no, sorry, it hurts.<br />
<br />
Liberation hurts – violence is necessary to revolution.<br />
Zizek, Senior researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 2003 (Slavoj, an interview with spiked-online, Nov. 15, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000002D2C4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000002D2C4.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
But at the same time…never be a solution.<br />
<br />
Robinson groups six contradictory lack authors into one – this makes it difficult to trust any conclusion they come to.<br />
Thomassen, Department of Government, University of Essex, 2004 (Lasse, The British Journal of Politics &amp; International Relations Volume 6 Issue 4, p. 558, November, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-856X.2004.00157.x?cookieSet=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-856X.2004.00157.x?cookieSet=1</a>)<br />
