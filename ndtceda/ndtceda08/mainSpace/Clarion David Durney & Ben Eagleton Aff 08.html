The most dangerous place on the planet …inclination to ratify an impending Fissile Material/Cut-off Convention.<br />
Therefore the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan by (1) pressuring Afghanistan to not negotiate with the Taliban and (2) providing Afghanistan with increased funding for reconstruction and stabilization activities. The US should guarantee 25 billion dollars be provided over the 2007-2010 time period. Funds should be allocated directly to the Afghanistan government as per the Afghanistan National Development System priorities and encourage direct Afghan participation when possible.<br />
