CWA and CAA advantage<br />
Framework<br />
Government action is necessary. Alternatives like anarchy, localism, spirituality, and eco-centrism will get squashed and worsen current destruction<br />
Bron Taylor, 2000, beneath the surface, p. 282-284<br />
“a more trenchant problem is how bioregionalists (and the anarchists…models will be overwhelmed and futile.”<br />
Anti-systemic discourses caus cynical resignation and block political action. Their focus on personal-aspolitical is demobilizing<br />
Keenan 98, theory and event, v 2, n1, muse<br />
“the question these reflections leave one with, then, is how the complexity…against even engaging political issues to begin with.”<br />
Anti-systemic alternatives block collective action and reinforce elite control<br />
Chandler, 2004, millennium, 33:2, p. 339, building global civil society “from below’?<br />
“the struggle for individual ethical and political…the powers that be can sleep peacefully in their beds.”<br />
Debating in favor of state action is necessary to accomplish their political goals<br />
Chandhoke, 2002, the limits of global civil society, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2002/2002chapter2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts /global/Publications/Yearbooks /2002/2002chapter2.pdf</a><br />
“on the other hand, global civil society actors need states and their institutions to substantiate and codify their demands…civil society looms especially large here.”<br />
Environmental critique prevents change and ensures extinction<br />
Lewis, 1992, green delusions, p. 250<br />
“in conclusion, environmentalism’s challenge must be…wish to save the earth.”<br />
Management is inevitable – it’s only a question of what kind of intervention is used. Past interventions will result in extinction unless actively reversed<br />
Levy, 1999, discourses of the environment, p. 215<br />
“if the ‘technological fix’ is unlikely to…will be decided.”<br />
Perm do both it overcomes important dualisms while acknowledging the need to situate in particularity and their own author supports<br />
Glazebrook, 2005, ethics and the environment, 10.2, 75-99<br />
“gynocentric ecologics are situated…bodily, mortally, in time.”<br />
More ev<br />
Glazebrook, 2005<br />
“I pluralize “eco-logics”…guidance over authority.”<br />
Claims that gender discrimination is the root cause is not true and reinforce and entrench oppression<br />
Barlett, 90, 103 harv. L. rev. 829, p. lexis<br />
“despite the valuable insights offered by feminist…onto the experiences of others.”<br />
Debates about the foresight and prevention of catastrophes avert extinction and enable social change<br />
Kurasawa 2004, constellations, 11:4, p. 455-456<br />
“this brings us to the transnational character of preventive foresight…construction of an alternative world order.”<br />
The criticism can’t solve – empirical data proves that support for ecofeminism does not lead to political action in support of the environment<br />
Leahy, 2000, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.octapod.org/gifteconomy/content/ecofemintlong.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.octapod.org/giftecon omy/content/ecofemintlong.html</a><br />
“more seriously still, the support for ecofeminism suggested by attitude…amongst women voters.”<br />
Skepticism of expert decision-making is justified, but not a reason to reject<br />
Both expert and lay judgment are necessary to resolve environmental action<br />
Barry, 1999, rethinking green politics, p. 2<br />
“to adequately address the technological and scientific roots…critique of science and technology.”<br />

1AC – Morrison, Biodiversity Advantage (same as casebook)<br />
2AC AT: Environmental Managerialism<br />
Your search for the ontological self is fruitless – we all define ourselves through our unique circumstances – claiming an ontological self to search for allows cooption, leading to a new Hitler within transnational capitalism.<br />
Graham, 2000 – “Heidegger’s Hippies,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.philgraham.net/HH_conf.pdf" rel="nofollow">__www.philgraham.net/HH_conf.pdf__</a><br />
“Armed with a volume…of all worries”<br />
Critique of tech leads to extinction<br />
Michael Zimmerman, 89 – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC22/Zimmerman.htm" rel="nofollow">__www.context.org/ICLIB/IC22 /Zimmerman.htm__</a><br />
“A critique I hear…really hurting?”<br />
It is impossible to do nothing in the environment. Our very existence impacts on the environment and is a form of management. We must figure out ways of acting that minimize the effect of our existence on the environment and historical examination of ecosystems allows us to do so. Their claim that it is too complex for predicting the effect of any of our actions is false.<br />
Bowman, 01 – Journal of Biogeography 28 (5)<br />
“Land managers can use…ecosystem function”<br />
Debates about the foresight and prevention of catastrophes avert extinction and enable positive social change<br />
Fuyuki Kurasawa, 04 – “Cautionary Tales: The Global Culture of Prevention and the Work of Foresight,” Constellations, 11:4<br />
“This brings us to the…alternative world order.”<br />
Epistemological pluralism creates the best chance for dialogue and accurate knowledge.<br />
Rudra Sil, 2000 – “Beyond Boundaries? Disciplines, Paradigms, and Theoretical Integration in International Studies,” p. 166<br />
“In the final…foundational assumptions”<br />
Lack of capital T truth doesn’t deny the necessity of logic and data. Incomplete knowledge is still useful.<br />
Rudra Sil, 2000 – “Beyond Boundaries? Disciplines, Paradigms, and Theoretical Integration in International Studies,” p. 161<br />
“In the end…epistemological positions”<br />
Cultural change can only succeed from within. Demands for stepping outside of Western culture are destined to fall on deaf ears.<br />
John Barry, 99 – “Rethinking Green Politics: Nature, Virtue, and Progress,” p. 123<br />
“Attention to the cultural…bounds set by that culture”<br />
The CWA is key to quality of life<br />
Appalachian Voices, 2005<br />
“The Clean Water…mountaintop removal:<br />
Doing nothing denies life, internal link turning their whole K. Action to stop apocalypse motivates change.<br />
Gerald Keaney, 06 – “Comments on Hakim Bey,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://brisbaneanarchy.org/node/86" rel="nofollow">__http://brisbaneanarchy.org /node/86__</a><br />
“We can begin with…justifies the unjustifiable”<br />
Having the government do nothing in the area of the aff perpetuates harm because it locks in the bureaucratic inertia of the structures of the status quo. Doing nothing is worse than doing the plan.<br />
Susan Bandes, 90 – 88 Mich. L. Rev. 2271<br />
“The assumption that…improper basline”<br />
Giving up on the implicit kernel of Utopianism blocks all progressive reforms and social change.<br />
Raymond Tallis, 97 – “Enemies of hope: a critique of contemporary pessimism”<br />
“We may smile…of contemporary thinkers”<br />
No link and turn – not all reforms necessitate exclusion. And their pessimism reinforces conservatism and ongoing oppression.<br />
Andrew Robinson, 05 – Theory and Event, v8<br />
“there is a danger…plague of fantasies”<br />
Management is inevitable – it’s only a question of what kind of intervention is used. Past interventions will result in extinction unless actively reversed.<br />
Neil Levy, 99 – “discourses of the environment”<br />
“If the technological life…will be decided”<br />
No solvency for the alt. Business have a global environmental management program that the alt can’t eliminate does not eliminate. Managerialism inevitable.<br />
GEMI, 06 – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gemi.org/" rel="nofollow">__www.gemi.org__</a><br />
“Since 1990…manufacturing facilities worldwide”<br />
The CWA is not high tech management. It is about stopping industry from dumping pollutants into the environment.<br />
Encyclopedia of Small Business, No Date – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://answers.com/topic/clean-water-act" rel="nofollow">answers.com/topic/clean-water -act</a><br />
“The Clean Water Act has…World Report”<br />

“During the 1960s…to 173 million, in 1998”<br />
Our impact claims are true. Prefer empirics over nonfalsifiable claims.<br />
James Lett, 2000 – The Psychological Community, v1 i3<br />
“There are two principal ways…tails you lose”<br />
<br />
Skepticism of expert decision-making is justified, but not a reason to reject the plan. Both expert and lay judgment are necessary to resolve environmental action.<br />
John Barry, 99 – “Rethinking Green Politics: Nature, Virtue, and Progress,” p. 195-6<br />
“To adequately address…science and technology”<br />
The alternative locks in a delay that makes action too late. They have to wait until a better approach comes to them. Without immediate environmental actions extinction is inevitable.<br />
Anil Rajimwale, 06 – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.vedamsbooks.com/no44381.htm" rel="nofollow">__https://www.vedamsbooks.com /no44381.htm__</a><br />
“Melting glaciers…giant scrap heap”<br />
Environmentalism’s disdain of intervention, growth, and technocratic government make extinction inevitable – its environmentalists not the environment that pose the greatest risk of extinction<br />
Michael Berliner, 2006 – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=4643" rel="nofollow">__http://www.capmag.com/article .asp?ID=4643__</a><br />

Anti-management results in mass extinction.<br />
