CP Text: The United States federal government should renounce its pursuit of rendering Iran a noble entity.<br />
<br />
The power of recognition is a mechanism of control which insidiously reproduces anxiety and instability—the aff can never achieve a stable, ordered, grid to organize terror<br />
<br />
John Roberts, senior lecturer at the Judge Institute of Management, University of Cambridge, 2K5 (Organization, 12;5 “The Power of ‘Imaginary’ in Disciplinary Process, SAGEPUBS)<br />
<br />
The organizational…any identification.<br />
<br />
The aff’s attempt to fix the identity of Iran in a benevolent US derived light initiates a perpetual search to control and manage the image of Iran-turns the entirety of the case.<br />
<br />
John Roberts, senior lecturer at the Judge Institute of Management, University of Cambridge, 2K5 (Organization, 12;5 “The Power of ‘Imaginary’ in Disciplinary Process, SAGEPUBS)<br />
<br />
Part of… berate ourselves.<br />
<br />
The 1AC is structured around the narrative of a silenced Iranian history of oppression, and the plan functions to represent a group excluded from political discourse-this use of storytelling to bring to light a victimized group is what exacerbates conflict and locks in acrimnoiousness<br />

Funk, Assist. Prof peace and conflict studies, Conrad Grebel University and Said, Senior PF of IR, American University, 4 (Nathan C. And Abdul Aziz, “islam and the West: Narratives of conflict and conflict transformation, International Journal of Peace Studies, V9 N1, Spring/Summer)<br />
<br />
According to Marc…goals and experiences.<br />
<br />
The Aff is not emancipation its replacement-it creates a new restrictive victimized identity, staticizing the Iranian experience<br />

<br />
In any situation.. improved relations.<br />
<br />
The aff’s appeal reinscribes the pain of subjugation and closes of emancipatory political projects<br />
<br />
Goodman, prof of English at FSU, 06 (Robin Truth, “Sami al-Arian, the Politics of Injury and the Academic Bill of Rights, College Literature, 33.4)<br />
<br />
The protest… or inclusive.<br />
<br />
The aff is reappropriated as a palliative for American guilt, and sadistic pleasure in the subjugation of the Iranian/victim-this victim stands in for the self and reproduces itself in guilt that is deployed in aggression against the world<br />
<br />
Brown, Prof of Poli Sci and Women’s Studies, Berkeley, 01 (Wendy, Politics Out of History, p.53-55)<br />
<br />
Yet suffering… for oneself.<br />
<br />
The Kind of resentment creates escalatory global violence-it is what sustains the war on terror, not fear of disorder or lack of clarity regarding Iran<br />
<br />
Karyn Ball, Prof of English at University of Alberta, 2 (Cultural Critique “wanted, dead or distracted on ressentiment in history, philosophy, and everyday life,” project Muse)<br />
<br />
It is the… of the repressed.<br />
<br />
The offer plays a powerful symbolic roles in both bolstering and depersonalizing domination-the “single” offer of the plan becomes embedded and naturalized into interactions making reciprocal exchange the presumptive model of international relations<br />
<br />
Sharon S. Harzenski, Prof of Law, Beasley School of Law, 1 (Redefining Violence: Some Thoughts about Justice, power, Peace, Respect, and The Fabric of Our Social Experience)<br />
<br />
As naked power.. instituted morality.<br />
<br />
Rejecting the aff’s urge of identification, to legitimize, fix and stabilize a non terrorist Iranian identity is a prerequisite to emancipatory politics<br />
<br />
John Roberts, senior lecturer at the Judge Institute of Management, University of Cambridge, 2K5 (Organization, 12;5 “The Power of ‘Imaginary’ in Disciplinary Process, SAGEPUBS)<br />
<br />
As O’Doherty and Williams…. Displacing of responsibility.<br />
<br />
Resisting the politics of representations/recognition is critical to stem genocide-opening the question of politics is critical to short circuit the aff’s impacts<br />
<br />
Athena Athanasiou 2003, A journal of feminist cultural studies, 14.1 “technologies of Humanness, Aporias of Biopolitics, and the Cut Body of Humanity”)<br />
<br />
The task for political… of modern biopolitics.<br />
<br />
Recognition is itself the problematic of cinema they identify. The political problematic comes into play because of the way in which they constitute Iran as an object for our gaze. The ultimate problematic in 300 is not just that it exists—but how we recognize it-how it constitutes us as viewers who participate in its enjoyment. They are undone by their choice of metaphor.<br />

<strong>Team Name Neg Northwestern BM</strong><br />
<strong><em>Round # 3</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Vs Team: Harvard RW</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Judge: Munksgaard, Richey, Walters</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Case Args:</em></strong><br />
AT: Miscalc<br />
1.Gates bureaucratic moves solve miscalculation. Newsweek ’07 (Dan Ephron, Michael Hirsh and Evan Thomas. 12/10/07. Lexis. “To avoid that scenario…avoid sparking a conflagration.”)<br />
2. Don’t believe conspiracy hype—consensus proves the strike risk is near zero. Washington Post 3/13/08. (Lexis. “The abrupt resignation of…right now,” she said.”)<br />
3. Six independent reasons we won’t strike Iran. Arkin 3/14/08 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/" rel="nofollow">blog.washingtonpost.com</a>. “here are six signs….that’s nonsense.”)<br />
AT: Ethnic separatism<br />
1. Iranian public is focused on economy—they’ll ramp up hostility toward Ahmadinejad without economic gains, solves moderation without escalation. Koch ’07 (Christian, “The ball remains firmly in the Iranian court.” 12/26/07. “The NIE might yet…his government in power.”<br />
2. Removing pressure on Iran now would strengthen hardliners. Cohen ’07 (Ariel, The Washington Times, 12/10/07. Lexis. “The National Intelligence Estimate….hardliners in the clerical regime.”)<br />
AT: Iraq Adv<br />
1. Gains in Iraq are sustainable—Iraqi forces are taking over security missions successfully. Agence France Presse 3/26/08. (“Morell, however, disputed…are in jeopardy,” he said.”)<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Off Case Args:</em></strong><br />
CP: The United States federal government should offer a guarantee to the government of Iran that the United States will not engage in a war of aggression against Iran. The United States federal government should end funding for separatist groups in Iran.<br />
NB: (Some of these are 2NC/1NR cards—hard to figure out which is which)<br />
1. The rhetoric of the plan o/w substance of the sec guar – iran will backlash against assurances that don’t acknowledge its legitimacy. Takeyh ’07 (Ray, March/April. “Time for détente with Iran.” Foreign Affairs online. “As the United States reconsiders…authority of the Islamic Republic.”)<br />
2. The term “regime” should e replaced with “government” in US engagement w/ Iran – designating its government as a regime paints Iran as an enemy. Critical Montages ’07 (9/14, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://montages.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">montages.blogspot.com</a>. “It’s been a norm to use…or the US and Iranian regimes.”)<br />
3. War must be exposed as war of aggression—accepting Bush’s contrived terms cedes the broader ideological struggle even as it engages the battle. Engelhardt 06 (Tom, 10/9. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://tomdispatch.com/" rel="nofollow">Tomdispatch.com</a>. “For Homer those epithets…rule of a Commander-in-Chief.”)<br />
4. Institutionalization of military euphemisms into policy discourse by accepting their use = extinction. Bosajian 84 (author of <em>The Language of Oppression</em>. <u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.religion-online.org/" rel="nofollow">www.religion-online.org</a></u>. “our nation has, of course…a cancer, virus or demon.”)<br />
5. Confronting military euphemisms is essential to accurate policy evaluation and the cultivation of appropriate military policy—voting negative does not abandon military force, it enables a more nuanced cost-benefit analysis. Mral ’04 (Brigitte, May. “Big events sometimes…unacceptable in democratic communities.”)<br />
6. US government uses the term ‘regime’ to designate Iran as evil and untrustworthy. Deber ’04 (Charles, <u>Regime Change Begins at Home: Freeing America from Corporate Rule</u>, p 21.)<br />
7. The term ‘regime’ is used to shape perceptions of other governments, the aff engages in hostile administration rhetoric of war to paint Iran’s govt as illegitimate. Doyle ’03 (Michael, Fresno Bee. “Bush administration officials deploy…post-Saddam Hussein Iraq.” )<br />
8. The term “regime” is used exclusively to refer to governments that the US condemns—using it implies US hostility toward Iran. Strange 82 (Susan, International Organization, Vol 36 No 2, spring. “A critique of regime analysis.” P 497. “The third point to be wary….nor efficiency in administration.”)<br />
9. FW – language key. Terms of the debate are crucial. Fitrakis ’03 <u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freepress.org/" rel="nofollow">www.freepress.org</a></u> “Rather than really thinking…protecting “homeland security.””<br />

The Affirmative misidentifies the war on terror as being a crisis of misrepresentation. In fact it is the fear of chaos, of materiality, the desire to secure recognition for past injury which reproduces a violent search for order and creates escalating cycles of guilt and retribution<br />
The power of recognition<br />
Power of recognition is a mechanism of control which insidiously reprocess anxiety and instability- the Aff can never achieve a stable, ordered, grid to organize terror.<br />
<br />
Roberts 05 (The Power of the Imaginary in Disciplinary Processes)<br />
<br />
“ The organizational parallels… character of any identification”<br />
<br />
The aff attempt to fix the identity of Hamas in a benevolent US derived light initiates a PERPETUAL SEARCH TO CONTROL AND MANAGE THE IMAGE OF PALESTINIANS- TURNS THE ENTIRETY OF CASE<br />
Roberts 05 (The Power of the Imaginary in Disciplinary Processes)<br />
<br />
“Part of the merit… berate ourselves”<br />
<br />
How does Denver come to know the body of Hamas? Their call for recognition, to represent Hamas, is a violent exercise in authority, the ability to make absence (the Palestinian body politic) present at their decree- only alternative creates a space free from the demand for representation<br />
Athanasiou 03 (Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies, “Technologies of Humanness, Aporias of Biopolitics, and the cut Body of Humanity”)<br />
