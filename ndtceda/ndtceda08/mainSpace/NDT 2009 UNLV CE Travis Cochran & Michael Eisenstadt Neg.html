 <strong>We have read some or all of the following cards in the shell:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A. The 1acs call for a practical solution is an attempt to transform the world in a particular image. This passion for the eal requires a radical simplification of the world. This justifies all forms of violence and suffering<br />
Badiou 3 (Alain Badiou, professor of philosophy, “Beyond Formalisation: An Interview” <u>Angelaki</u> Vol. 8, No. 2, August, pp. 115-116)</strong><br />
<strong>I should begin by…is in turn enfeebled.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>B. The 1AC’s method is grounded in an a prioi construction of ethics disguises particular truths as universal</strong><br />
<strong>Hallward 1 (Peter, professor of philosophy at Middlesex University, <u>Ethics an Essay on the Understanding of Evil</u>, “Translators Introduction” Verso 2001, pg. xiv)</strong><br />
<strong>Badiou’s fundamentally ‘divisive’…figurations of active thought.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>C. The ethics the affirmative endorses subordinates the individual to the recognition of evil placing them in a perpetual status of the victim which paints the subject as disposable. It is this mentality that allowed the ride and the efficacy of the camps, imperialism, and colonialism.</strong><br />
<strong>Badiou 1 (Alain Badiou, professor of philosophy, <u>Ethics an Essay on the Understanding of Evil</u>, Verso 2001, pg. 10-12)</strong><br />
<strong>The heart of…of its subhumanity.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>D. Truth and identities are irreconcilable—because every identification with a community is a form of negation and every truth is an affirmation. We must be indifferent to difference.</strong><br />
<strong>Hallward 3 (Peter, prof of philosophy @ Middlesex University, <u>Badiou: A Subject to Truth</u>, University of Minnesota Press, p. 26)</strong><br />
<strong>This last point is…not at all.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>E. The affirmatives methodology of emphasizing localized sites of oppression reduces questions of truth to rhetorical judgments and linguistic relativism only recognizing the particularities of identities—this renders life as nothing but being for death.</strong><br />
<strong>Hallward 3 (Peter, prof of philosophy @ Middlesex University, <u>Badiou: A Subject to Truth</u>, University of Minnesota Press, p. 25)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>F. ID politics and respect for the other is a guide for western dominance</strong><br />
<strong>McCarraher 3 (Eugene, Prof at Villanova U, “Rene—Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil,” April 9, 2003)</strong><br />
<strong>So far, so good…military domination.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>G. An ethic of truths induces the individual into a singular irreplaceable subject</strong><br />
<strong>Hallward 1 (Peter, professor of philosophy at Middlesex University, <u>Ethics an Essay on the Understanding of Evil</u>, “Translators Introduction” Verso 2001, pg. xxxvi)</strong><br />
<strong>With Badiou…such a part.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>H. The alternative is to embrace situational ethics by rejecting the affirmatives pre-calculated ethics and adopting an ethical system based on singular events that reveal truth</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I. The squo imposes itself into the subject, structuring our interpretations through particularities defined through the language of the state of the situation. Only a reconfiguration of our ethical calculations to an ethic of truths can we have a subtraction from the particularity of static knowledge and transcend the objective individual and move to the plane of immortality.</strong><br />
<strong>Hallward 1 (Peter, professor of philosophy at Middlesex University, <u>Ethics an Essay on the Understanding of Evil</u>, “Translators Introduction” Verso 2001, pg. ix)</strong><br />
<strong>The realm of knowledge…this mortal objectivity.</strong><br />
<br />
<h1 id="toc3"><a name="Kappeler K"></a><u>Kappeler K</u></h1>
 <br />
<strong>The Affirmative is the instantiation of mental deputy politics by beginning political discussion with institutions- this destroys individual responsibility.<br />
Kappeler 95</strong><br />
(Susanne, Associate Professor at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The politics of personal behavior, Pg.10-11)<br />
Yet our insight that... expression in ever more prevalent formulations like ‘I want to stop this war’, ‘I want military intervention’, ‘I want to stop this backlash’, or ‘I want a moral revolution.<br />
<br />
<strong>Turns the case- individual mindsets are the root cause of case harms.<br />
Kappeler 95</strong><br />
(Susanne, Associate Professor at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The politics of personal behavior, Pg.9)<br />
war does not...happen.<br />
<br />
<strong>We have Read Two different alternatives:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1. Our Alternative text is to affirm the ethical commitment of the 1AC in its immediacy.<br />
This critical to solve the affirmative- engagement with political institutions as a center for ethics mediates our ethical relation to politics making genuine ethical obligation impossible.<br />
Santilli 2k3</strong><br />
Paul Santilli, Siena College May 18th-22 2003 www.isud.org/papers/pdfs/Santilli.pdf<br />
If we retain this original sense of...the abyss of suffering.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Alternative Text (this alt has had some combination of the following 3 parts): (1)Reject the methodology of the 1AC and (2) embrace personal responsibility for violence, and (3) embrace the ethic of the 1AC in its immediacy.<br />
The alternative solves the case- placing individual ethics at the centre of political decisionmaking is the only effective strategy for genuine mindset shifts and is a prerequisite to the affirmative.<br />
Kappeler 95</strong><br />
(Susanne, Associate Professor at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The politics of personal behavior, Pg.5-6)<br />
A politics aiming at a change in people’s behavior...a non-violent society.<br />

<h1 id="toc5"><a name="Environment Discourse PIC"></a><u><strong>Environment Discourse PIC</strong></u></h1>
 <strong>The Affirmatives justification for environmental protection is focused upon the immediate threat of environmental crisis. This creates a dichotomy between humans and nature that precludes long term environmental protection.<br />

<strong>This crisis based politics, embodied in The ecological Horror story frames the environment as having purely instrumental value- this ensures that the environment will only be protected when catastrophe looms- this legitimates environmental destruction, turning case.<br />

 <strong>CP Text: Plan text minus the term agriculture, replaced with cultivation. I.e. &quot;domestic agricultural support&quot; becomes &quot;domestic cultivation support.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>The Term agriculture invokes a cultural narrative that transforms the living world into nothing more than a unit of production- propping a false dichotomy between human and nature.<br />

Where this system breaks down—...still have in horticulture.<br />
<br />
<strong>The best alternative is to replace agricultural with cultivation- this allows us to reshape farming as pro-active reorientation of our relationship to nature.<br />

<h1 id="toc27"><a name="FRAMEWORK 1NC"></a><u>FRAMEWORK 1NC</u></h1>
 <strong>A. Our framework –the affirmative must defend that it would be a good idea to decrease united states agricultural support, specifically the removal of subsidies. This does not preclude affirmative’s from arguing in any specific method as long as they also defend the resolution for purpose of negative ground.<br />
<br />
B. Vote Negative-<br />
1. Predictable limits- The resolution is the baseline for negative research- disadvantages, solvency arguments, and counterplans are all predicated off of defense of the resolution.<br />
<br />
2. Project Parameters and Forum Specialization- Ultimately each forum for discussion has a different purpose, and a focus on that purpose instead of unrelated issues is critical to generating meaningful education. This does not exclude discussion of other, important issues in other forums.<br />
<br />
AND Both of these outweigh their turns-</strong><br />

The development and implementation of design games…depends on the particular project and the rules created at the outset.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Their project is self naïve and self-destructive- Rulebreaking is ultimately self-defeating- sublime modes of knowledge production require the very boundaries they attempt to destroy in order to exist.<br />

Such a play-space … reciprocity of Iserian play.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Rules are not Genocide- They must be evaluated in their particularity rather than based on their ontology or epistemology- the manifold way in which power can be deployed demands a non-essentialist analysis.<br />

The Fictive and the Imaginary …borrows from his teacher Gadamer:<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Framework solves the case- Rules creates a framework for nonrepressive deployments of power that make creativity and innovation possible. In context of debate, there are ways to express the advocacy of the affirmative within the bounds o the resolution.<br />

Iser's notion of play offers a way of conceptualizing power …it depends, rather, on how games are played.<br />

 Prior to November, we read an Obama good elections DA in every non-CAFOs debate with the impact of Russian Relations. We also read a dem majority disad with the impacts of stem cell research (post-human and human warfare), iraq withdrawl bad. Post-elections, we have read Obama good in every non-CAFOs debate--the scenarios have been health care (impact is heg, khalilzad), and energy legislation (impact is warming). Against CAFOs affirmatives, our elections argument was McCain Good, impact was also Russian Relations, did not read the landslide DA. Since then, the impact to CAFOs has been health care bad (impact econ collapse, Mead 2009).<br />
