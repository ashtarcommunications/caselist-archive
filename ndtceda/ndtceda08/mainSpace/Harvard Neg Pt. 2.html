<br />
1 maintaining the public/private distinction is necessary to respond to different types of violence—while both private and public violence are bad, conflating the two produces ineffective responses.<br />
Tracey E. Higgins, Fordham University School of Law, 2k<br />
(75 Chi.-Kent. L. Rev. 847)<br />
“The first and simplest reason for” “individual and policy level”<br />
2. Relying on judicial rejection of the public/private distinction would make the world worse for women-taking advantage of public power is the only way to end discrimination<br />
Tracey E. Higgins, Fordham University School of Law, 2k<br />
“Finally, there are practical reasons for maintaining the public/private distinction” “help to balance this private power through democratic means”<br />
3. MacKinnon’s critique is too totalizing—appeals to privacy are not inherently doomed. Rejecting all appeals does more harm than good---reorienting current approaches solves better than rejecting the distinction altogether<br />
Laura W. Stein, Associate Professor, New York Law School 1993<br />
(77 Minn. L. Rev. 1153)<br />
“It is not clear whether the feminist critique of privacy solely concerns privacy as a constitutional doctrine or whether it is directed more broadly at the entire legal, or even philosophical” “Feminists simply must be wary”<br />
<br />
Status Quo Solving Now<br />
Domestic Violence Courts—States Adopting them Now<br />
States adopting specialized domestic violence courts now<br />
Maine Law Review 2k4<br />
(Jennifer Thompson, JD Candidate, 56 Me. L. Rev. 407, p.426-7)<br />
“The solution adopted by some courts” “Judicial activism to creative court programs”<br />
<br />
State courts have developed specialized domestic violence courts—provides more comprehensive therapeutic approach<br />
Betsy Tsai, Domestic Violence Resource Coordinator, 2k<br />
(Fordham Law Review, March, 68 Fordham L. Rev, 1285, p.1286-7)<br />
“Those who work in the criminal justice system are often frustrated and embarrassed by their inability” “Commitment to providing comprehensive services”<br />
<br />
States increasingly adopting specialized domestic violence courts<br />
Betsy Tsai, Domestic Violence Resource Coordinator, 2k<br />
(Fordham Law Review, March, 68 Fordham L. Rev, 1285, p.1286-7)<br />
“As domestic violence gains increasing national attention, the number of states developing specialized criminal justice responses to such violence continues to expand” “Dade County, Florida, and the District of Columbia exemplify this approach”<br />
<br />
<br />
The Civil Rights Remedy Fails<br />
1. Federalizing the civil remedy encourages local authorities to ignore the problem—any signal is counterproductive<br />
Curt Levey, Director of Legal and Public Affairs, Center for Individual Rights, 2k1<br />
(Loyola Law Review, Spring, 47 Loy L. Rev, 535, p.551-2)<br />
“Whether it is different policy choices or people not being indicted when we think they should be, it is a far cry from evidence” “Department of Justice will look at it”<br />
<br />
2. The discrimination model backfires—judges are more likely to excuse violence under the guise of relationship then punish on account of gender.<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Assc. Prof Rutgers School of Law, 2k3<br />
(American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender society Policy &amp; L.251, p.265-7)<br />
“Despite these encouraging signs, it is important to remember” “overlook the possibility that such violence is discriminatory”<br />
<br />
3. Torts are not effective remedies—defendants have no money and they don’t deter<br />
C. Quince Hopkins 2k1<br />
(Associate Professor, Washington and Lee University School of Law, 9 Va. J. Soc, Pol’y &amp; L. 411)<br />
“Like criminal law, however, the law of tort, typically falls short as a tool for victims of abuse” “similar shallow-pockets problem”<br />
<br />
4. Inadequate Structure<br />
a. Civil Suits are expensive—most people don’t have adequate resources<br />
DePaul Law Review, 2k1<br />
(Jennifer R. Havan, JD Candidate) Spring, 50 DePaul L. Rev. 919, p.959<br />
“Title III represented the federal government’s response to a serious problem” “might be a costly and futile effort”<br />
<br />
b. Not enough lawyers who will litigate civil proceedings<br />
Freedman, Professor of Law, Rutgers 2k3<br />
(Ann E. American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol’y &amp; L. 567, p. 593-4)<br />
“The cost of legal services is a primary factor” “law litigants and potential litigants”<br />
<br />

<br />
Harvard—Abortion Bad (Vs. Oklahoma)<br />
Frontline<br />
The best scientific and philosophical evidence proves that the fetus is a human being worthy of the right of life from the point of conception. All of their arguments to the contrary are based on an ignorance of science or a false functionalist view of personhood<br />
Irving 93<br />
“What then is a human being or person” “he or she is already a human being”<br />
2. If we win our scientific and philosophical claims that the fetus is a human life, we win the debate—ignoring this conclusion and insisting on the right to choice at that point would mean the end of all human rights, social justice, and prohibitions on mass murder, as well as a systematic death toll greater than warfare; they create a world in which there is no ethical basis for ANY prohibition on oppression<br />
Randy Alcorn, Doctorate of divinity, writer, and founder and director of Eternal Perspective Ministries, 2k<br />
(“Pro-Life Answers to Pro-Choice Arguments,” p. 37-38, 103-104)<br />
“Abortion is the most frequently performed surgery” “would ultimately mean the end of all human rights and social justice”<br />
<br />
3. Abortion is a modern-day shoah which saps society of all ethics and respect for human life across the board. The philosophical underpinnings of abortion view humanity not as intrinsically valuable, but as hunks of meat to be disposed of at will. This paves the way for eugenics, racism, and mass murder<br />
Randy Alcorn, Doctorate of divinity, writer, and founder and director of Eternal Perspective Ministries, 2k<br />
(“Pro-Life Answers to Pro-Choice Arguments,” p. 278-279)<br />
“Abortion is a modern holocaust which is breeding unparalleled violence” “African Americans, the elderly, the disabled, and others”<br />
<br />
4. Abortion is rooted in a eugenic history which praises the elimination of so-called social undesirables like minorities and the poor through the elimination of their offspring. Pro-Choice advocacy is inextricably linked with racist social Darwinism and oppressive population management<br />
Randy Alcorn, Doctorate of divinity, writer, and founder and director of Eternal Perspective Ministries, 2k<br />
(“Pro-Life Answers to Pro-Choice Arguments,” p. 148-150)<br />
“It is the poor and minorities—not the rich and white” “the cause of upper-class white supremacy”<br />
<br />
Err on the side of protecting all unborn fetuses—in a world of uncertainty, assuming that life begins at conception is the most rational choice to minimize violence<br />
Francis J. Beckwith, Associate Professor of Philosophy at Trinity International University, Spring 1991<br />
(Christian Research Journal, http//www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0077a.html)<br />
“Throughout the history of the abortion controversy” “but human beings with much potential”<br />
<br />
KRITIKS OF SCIENCE BAD ANSWERS FROM 2K3 ACHTEN LAB “Ks of science bad”-page 2<br />
--Markovits and Deustch 1980<br />
Harre, 1995 Realism Rescued .<br />
<br />
FEMINISM<br />
Their argument that abortion on demand is a prerequisite to female liberation assumes that pregnancy and female biology are impediments to equality and must be eliminated. They strive for equality by surgically altering feminine biology to mold females into the image of man, rather than celebrating these distinctive aspects of womanhood. Only an ethic which acknowledges and rejoices in the distinctiveness of the feminine can achieve true equality<br />
Anne M. Maloney, philosophy professor at the College of Saint Catherine, 1995<br />
(You say you want a revolution? Pro-Life Philosophy and Feminism, Life and Learning V)<br />
“The worldview proposed by the Androgynous Idealists is problematic” “competitive world—the male world”)<br />
<br />
2. Legalized abortion facilitates sex-selected killing of female fetuses—this sets society down the road tot total gendercide<br />
Ben Voth, Professor of Communication at Miami University, 2k3<br />
(Life and Learning XIII, “Making the Best Arguments for Unborn Life,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://uffl.org/vol13/voth03.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://uffl.org/vol13/voth03.pdf</a>)<br />
“Sex-selection abortion makes abortion the most serious life threat to women on the planet today” “defective as to be worthy of discard”
