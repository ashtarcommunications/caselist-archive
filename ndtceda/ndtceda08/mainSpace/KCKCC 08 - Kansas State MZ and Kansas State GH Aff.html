Individuals through their tax dollars have literally paid for the rapid expansion of CAFOs through an unlimited, unchecked capital infrastructure budget paid through subsidization. Though these subsidies are technically available to all farmers, the technical arrangements of our agricultural tax policy ensure that only large CAFOs receive the vast majority of these funds.<br />

Our story turns to tribal communities, where the magnified effect of industrialized, consolidated agriculture has collapsed the very way of life for indigenous peoples. Subsidies provided both by the politicians in Washington D.C. and the consumption patterns of Americans who continually consumed factory-farmed meats have increased profits of CAFOs.  These profits are used to cause expansion to tribal lands. This rapid expansion of agriculture has had the effect of disrupting and destroying the natural ecological cycles of reproduction. We share the story of the Rosebud community – they are one of many.<br />

<br />
Industrialized agriculture’s effects are not isolated in tribal communities—CAFOs have crushed the possibilities for alternative lifestyles in rural communities. Individuals are placed in front of a closed-circuit, forced choice—endorse CAFOs or change your life. This is a system of demonization for false victims who are living the only lifestyle they can afford. Our narrative is the history of these rural communities—that is part of where we come from.<br />

I once interviewed a young ... producers is very important.<br />

<br />
But even within this forced lifestyle, the techniques and practices of CAFO farming concentrate heavy metals in the soil, which have the long-term effect of slowly choking off all agriculture.<br />

On a more holistic level, the bifurcation of agriculture into animals and commodity crops has collapsed the natural nitrogen cycles that are important to sustaining food production altogether.<br />

Empowering the small scale farmer can produce a global revolution – small scale farmers make more appropriate agro-ecological choices – this increases soil preservation, provide the appropriate knowledge to translate into healthier farms, greater food for everyone and decreases poverty.<br />

We think that:<br />
<br />
The subsidies to factory farms should end.  We must recognize that payments or as the government calls them subsidies happen both with our tax dollars and the dollars we spend on the food we consume.<br />

<br />
We as individuals are not powerless to change the current system of agricultural production. You have no greater power as an individual than to decide, three times a <br />
day and for some unfortunately only once or twice a day, when you sit to eat. Today, individual food choices can, in large enough numbers, dictate to the food-producing sectors of our economy what we will not eat.<br />

Most of my suggestions come down...once again real food for us to eat.<br />

<br />
Even if we never effect government policy, learning about how it works is necessary for us to understand where our food comes from and what market forces are at work.<br />

<br />
What should we do to confront this change in agriculture? First, as a nation we need to reignite the debate over ag industrialization. Ag Secretary Bergland tried to do so in the late 1970s ... for the farm sector.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, adopting a people-friend civic approach to shaping agricultural policy offers a unique gateway of opportunity to discuss and resist dominant ideas about agriculture. You cannot have resistance to the government unless you understand how the government contributes to that problem. To ignore the government is to ignore the ways in which the market is manipulated BY the government to benefit rich, wealthy individuals. We are not role-playing the government, but failing to interrogate this question makes us net-worse social advocates.<br />

Assuming that there is a singular focal point of social location ignores the larger intersections of identity that shape and influence the identities of multiple individuals. Failure to account for a more intersectional approach dooms politics to inevitable social injustice, which ensures continuation of inequality and injustice.<br />
