<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Paul Gordon, 2001, “Psychoanalysis and Racism: The politics of defeat Race &amp; Class v. 42, n. 4) </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“The postmodernist’s problem is that they cannot … just to interpret it, need to look elsewhere.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Psychoanalytic political theory is tautological and cannot be the foundation for an approach to the political </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Paul Gordon, 2001, “Psychoanalysis and Racism: The politics of defeat Race &amp; Class v. 42, n. 4) </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“The problem with the application of … as a story about ‘racial’ invasion.” </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The politics of negativity fails to break w/ the humanist tradition and fosters an inauthentic relationship with otherness</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Steven Shaviro, 1993, “The Cinematic Body”, pgs. 258-259</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“This contact implies a radical immanence … proximity with a more manageable gap. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">John Bellamy Foster, 1998, Monthly Review, April</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Having said this, however, Gould goes … our fate with that of the planet.”</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Stanley Foundation, 1989, “Environmental Problems: A Global Security Threat”, #1-2</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Advocates of using the concept noted the real threats .. on international environmental concerns.” </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Treating environmental degradation as a risk to security elevates its importance to the gov’t and prompts an end to destruction</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Stanley Foundation, 1989, “Environmental Problems: A Global Security Threat”, #1-2</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“In addition to direct threats posed by environmental … a real security threat is involved.”</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Existential risks are distinct from global endurable … how much we discount future benefits [15,16].” </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Portraying eco-damage as “extinction level” is a crucial communication act that forestalls complete extinction – it solves their turn because it sparks a new social ethic </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Richard J. Epstein and Y. Zhao, 2009, “The Threat That Dare Not Speak Its Name; Human Extinction” Perspectives in Biology and Medicine Vol. 52, No. 1, Winter 2009, Project Muse</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“While theoretical debates at academic conferences are important … be open to the patterned mess that is human history.” </span><br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">AT Nietzsche<br />
Ressentiment links to itself—Nietzsche’s theory relies upon blaming the slaves for their creative force in distorting true morality. This proes that hoping for a better world is inevitable and internal link turns your K.<br />
Ruddiger Bittner. Nietzsche, Genealogy, Morality, ED Schacht. 1994. P. 135-6<br />
A third reason, connected again….But somewhere with us it must be.<br />
The aff’s selfless act of helping others transcends ressentiment<br />
Philip Rolnick, Person, Grace and God. 2007. P. 134<br />
Max Scheler’s critical response…into evolutionary struggle.<br />
Double Bind—either Nietzsche only rejects a particular form of morality which means no link, or he requires a rejection of all morality which means the alt links<br />
Maudemarie Clark, Associate Professor of Philosphy at Colage, 1994, Nietzsche, Genalogy, Morality; Essays on Nietzsche’s On the Genealogy of Morals, ed. Richard Schacht, p. 15-16<br />
Alhtough Nietzsche quite….he rejected all morality.<br />
Inversion of morality </span><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">à</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Natural Law<br />
Comte-Sponville, prof of Philosophy @ Sorbonne, 91<br />
[Andre, The Brute, the Sophist, and the Aesthete: Art in the Service of Illusion, Why we are not Nietzscheans, edited by Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut, p. 33-36]<br />
This is what Nietzsche calls….said: Ultimi barbarorum<br />
Turns and outweighs their impact—natural law leads to the worst forms of moral calulation and oppression<br />
MacSaorsa, ‘7<br />
[Iain, “The Myth of Natural Law,” </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spunk.org/texts/otherpol/critique/sp001283.txt" rel="nofollow">__www.spunk.org/texts/otherpol/ critique/sp001283.txt__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">]<br />
Some degree of suffering may be inevitable, but we need not accept all of them—truly horrific acts of violence or suffering must be rejected<br />
Cynthia Halpern. Suffering, Politics, Power. 2002. P. 211<br />
When Nietzsche speaks in the previous…such magnitude and inconceivability?<br />
Morality inevitable—denouncing it justifies the worst atrocities<br />
Comte-Sponville 91<br />
It is a question I once….the Christian moralists you so detest?<br />
Concept of fatalism is not a point of radical beginning—alt doesn’t solve the af its try or die<br />
Ferry and Renault, 97<br />
[Luc and Alain, Professor of Philosphy at the Sorbonne and the University of Caen and Professor of Political Science at the Sorbonee, Why we are not Nietzscheans, p. 101-103]<br />
A complex relation indeed, for Nietzsche rules…unto the most outrageous provocation<br />
The alt does not provide any basis for collective political action—cannot resolve any of their link or impact args because they will never move beyond a politics internal to the subject—takes out the uq for all their offense and proves the perm solves<br />
Coole 98<br />
[Diana, University of London, “the politics of reading Nietzsche” Poliitcal Studies XLVI]<br />
the difficulty, however, lies in moving from the essentially….it might be preferable to look elsewhere<br />
Perm resolves the alt’s moral relativism and prevents oppression<br />
Hatab, Prof of Philosphy and Religion Studies Old Dominion, ‘2<br />
[Lawrence, Prospects for a Democratic Agon: Why we can still be Nietzscheans, Journal of Nietzsche Studies, issue 24, p. Project Muse]<br />
Democratic respect forbids exclusion….inviolably possessed by an originating self.<br />
Alts inversion of values leads to worst forms of oppression<br />
Comte-Sponville 91<br />
We would have to lmultiply….exceptional, no less distressing<br />
Nietzsche ciricizes the human tendency to suffer because of suffering—you have to win that the aff’s depictions actually themselves result in suffering<br />
Arthur Danto. IN reading Nietzsche, ed. Solomon and Higgins. 1990. P. 21<br />
I think the answer must lie….which themselves generate suffering.<br />
Violence not inevitable—believing so denies life<br />
Andrew Fiala, Associate Prof of Philophy @ Wisconsin. Practical Pacifism. 2004. P. 90-3<br />
Many theorists in the Western tradition…promoted through peaceful means.</span><br />
