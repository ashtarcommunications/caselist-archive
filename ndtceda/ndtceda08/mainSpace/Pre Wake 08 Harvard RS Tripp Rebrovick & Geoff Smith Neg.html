<br />
1. The Limit of the aff’s imagination is telling-that solutions to hunger and food security are thought through techniques of global integration and global production reveals the underlying ideology that informs discourse. Understanding food through categories of global linkages and assemblages that enable the expansion of global food networks is the process by which neoliberal ideologies infiltrate and appropriate policies.<br />

“Global food governance…’fix’ the world”<br />
<br />
2. The aff channels solutions to the environment through the mechanisms of neoliberal capital-it freezes in place the current producing social relations and empowers structures that enable environmental exploitation in the first place. Until the logic of social relations moves in a new direction, the removing subsidies only makes things worse.<br />

ENCLOSURE CITES<br />
<br />
The Thesis:<br />
<br />
Primitive accumulation is the founding moment of capitalism – neither innocent nor spontaneous nor inevitable, the creation of markets constitutes the founding of a mode of production.<br />
<br />
“In actual history, it is a notorious fact that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, in short, force, play the greatest part…the methods of primitive accumulation are anything but idyllic…so-called primitive accumulation…is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production…and this history, the history of expropriation, is written…in letters of blood and fire”<br />
- [Marx, Capital, “The Secret of So-Called Primitive Accumulation”]<br />
<br />
BUT, the modern site for the expansion of capital is NEOLIBERAL ENCLOSURE.<br />
<br />
The new enclosures are different from the violent bloody expropriation of the English countryside. The regime of neoliberal capital works by enclosing the last vestiges of public commons and embedding them within new markets.<br />
<br />
A Haroon Akram-Lodhi ‘7 Department of International Development Studies, Trent University (Third World Quarterly Vol. 28, No. 8, 2007, pp 1437 – 1456)<br />
<br />
The continuous character of … neoliberal agrarian restructuring.<br />
<br />
The Links:<br />
<br />
First, the plan’s rollback of subsidies is an act of enclosure – it forces reliance on the market and inserts the market as a mediator between the producer and means of livelihood.<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘4 “’Opposing Fetishism by Reclaiming our Powers’. The Social Forum Movement, Capitalist Markets and the Politics of Alternatives” International Social Science Journal, N. 1882 (December 2004).<br />
<br />
There is not the space here to … system of freedom (De Angelis, 2002).<br />
<br />
More importantly, the enclosure of the 1ac works discursively – the description agriculture and the market are just techniques for making subjects subservient to global neoliberalism. Acts of enclosure are more than physical appropriation of resources – they are ways of understanding the rationality of markets in order to bring subjects into neoliberal social relations.<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘4 Lecturer, University of East London, Historical Materialism, volume 12:2 (57–87) “Separating the Doing and the Deed”<br />
<br />
If capital encloses, it … of such a normalised subject.<br />
<br />
What’s more – the rollback of subsidies should not be interpreted as a limit on the power of the state – it’s the displacement of the power of the state away from authority into governmentality – the state becomes an institution of neoliberal governance, arranging things so that market logic begins to dictate behavior<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘7 Lecturer, University of East London The Beginning of History 88-9<br />
<br />
This double function can … microcredit and export promotion.<br />
<br />
Fourth, political economy as the technique for criticizing and limiting state power is simply a new art of governing – it must be understood in terms of the discourse of the market as the site of truth and as the emergence of biopolitical techniques of governance. The discourse of enclosure provides a point of expansion for government.<br />
<br />
Foucault ‘8 The Birth of Biopolitics 17-19<br />
<br />
So, with political economy … grasp what biopolitics is.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Impacts:<br />
<br />
First -- the biopolitical technique of governance links primitive accumulation to expansion of the state apparatus – it provides a new justification for imperial governance and the further deterritorialization of the land as commons.<br />
<br />
Robert P. Marzec ‘2 Associate Professor postcolonial studies and contemporary criticism at the State University of New York at Fredonia (boundary 2 2002 29(2):129-156 “Enclosures, Colonization, and the Robinson Crusoe Syndrome: A Genealogy of Land in a Global Context”)<br />
<br />
The pervasive lack of …… citizenry can inhabit the earth.<br />
<br />
Second, the process of enclosure in the North is part of the same process that colonized the South – the expansion of neoliberal enclosure creates global violence and global death zones of humanity – perpetual suffering, wars, ethnic cleansings, and catastrophes are inevitable.<br />
<br />
Balibar ‘4, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at The University of Paris-X, 2004 [Etienne, also Distinguished Professor of Humanities at University of California at Irvine, We, The People Of Europe?: Reflections On Transnational Citizenship, p. 115-116, 126-129]<br />
<br />
With this pretentious title, I …as a threat for &quot;civilization.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Alternative: produce commons, not enclosures.<br />
<br />
The production of commons is a struggle against enclosures – this is struggle is most important in the commodification of land and food.<br />
<br />
The direction of the plan in relation to markets is the problem, even if it seems that flawed subsidies are the problem. The alternative is the opposite – its in favor of commons, against enclosures.<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘4 Lecturer, University of East London, Historical Materialism, volume 12:2 (57–87) “Separating the Doing and the Deed”<br />
<br />
In the context of contemporary … protection from the market.<br />
<br />
The political discourse of the commons solves – articulating the power of individuals to reclaim the commons is all that is necessary. It’s not a question of mass revolution or consciousness shifting – the alternative merely points out the ability of any enclosed space to be a commons.<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘3 Lecturer, University of East London “Reflections on alternatives, commons and communities” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commoner.org.uk/deangelis06.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.commoner.org.uk/deangelis06.pdf</a><br />
<br />
This movement has posed …through the social fields.<br />
<br />
And finally, that subsidies exist now sets up a choice – we can move in the direction of neoliberal enclosure, thickening the control of markets in social practice, or push AGAINST further accumulation. The alternative is mutually exclusive with the plan – it moves in the OPPOSITE direction with relation to enclosure.<br />
<br />
Subsidies aren’t commons, but the best response isn’t to eliminate them. What’s needed is an attempt to create commons out of entitlements and make the commons better, not eliminate them.<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘5 (Development (2005) 48, 48–52)<br />
<br />
First, we have to see the whole … communicational processes.<br />
<br />
2. Agriculture in the North is the final frontier – the plan exposes the last vestige of production to the whims of the market, completing the building of a neoliberal order.<br />
<br />
A Haroon Akram-Lodhi ‘7 Department of International Development Studies, Trent University (Third World Quarterly Vol. 28, No. 8, 2007, pp 1437 – 1456)<br />
<br />
Agrarian political economy is … commodification and enclosures’.33<br />
<br />
Think of the permutation as the enclosure of the commons by the plan.<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘3 Lecturer, University of East London “Reflections on alternatives, commons and communities” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commoner.org.uk/deangelis06.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.commoner.org.uk/deangelis06.pdf</a><br />
<br />
Note: they open the question … alternative form of co-optation.<br />
<br />
First – a withdrawal of the state is never innocent, but towards some purpose.<br />
<br />
A. The plan is not merely a withdrawal, but a withdrawal of the state on behalf of capital – this is especially true for agriculture.<br />
<br />

This was not an ….an negative property and its “free” rights.<br />
<br />
C. State withdrawal is not a decrease in intervention – its intervention in favor the construction of a market. The plan only disembeds a market – enclosing agriculture within a neoliberal construct.<br />

<br />
But the notion of a “free” …capitalism is a social phenomenon.<br />
<br />
A. The call for limits to the state is not the ‘reduction of state power’ – it simply marks the transition to a new art of governing. What makes the biopolitical state distinct and different from the sovereign monarchical state is the justifications offered for state policy – instead of advancing the interest of the King, the state now advances the interests of the ‘population.’ The transformation of legitimation relies on a construct of the market as the producer of truth – it is in the affirmative call to ‘limit the state’ that the plan’s real complicity with capital is revealed.<br />
<br />
Foucault ‘8 The Birth of Biopolitics 9-13<br />
<br />
Broadly speaking, this is how I tried to …? Obviously, it is political economy.<br />
<br />
AND, the emergence of pro-market discourse is linked with the emergence of the biopolitical state. The other side of governmentality lies with the claim that the market is the site of truth.<br />
<br />
Foucault ‘8 The Birth of Biopolitics 30-33<br />
<br />
Let's put it more dearly. The … [the market] must be articulated.<br />
<br />
The privatization and enclosure of agriculture in the North is the culmination of neoliberal expansion – structural adjustment during the 80s and 90s already deprived the global south of its independence and livelihood. Privatization in the north is merely the most recent manifestation of the movement of capital.<br />
<br />
Worldwide enclosures must be understood in terms of their linkages<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘1 Lecturer, University of East London, (The Commoner, “Marx and primitive accumulation” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commoner.org.uk/02deangelis.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.commoner.org.uk/02deangelis.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The emphasis here put … the issue of commons.<br />
<br />
The denial of the permanent, continuous nature of primitive accumulation is the technique of capital to make its bloody origins invisible – history reveals the necessity of enclosure in the growth of capitalist production<br />
<br />
David Moore ‘4 Economic History and Development Studies Programme at the University of Natal Durban (Third World Quarterly, Vol 25, No 1, pp 87–109)<br />
<br />
Only after global depression … primitive accumulation is in order.<br />
<br />
primitive accumulation is not simply a single historical act. It’s a permanent and continuous ENCLOSURE OF THE COMMONS by the logical capital.<br />
<br />
Werner Bonefeld ‘1 Department of Politics, University of York (The Commoner “The Permanence of Primitive Accumulation” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commoner.org.uk/02bonefeld.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.commoner.org.uk/02bonefeld.pdf</a>)<br />

<br />
Strategies of enclosures are … international division of labour.<br />
<br />
Markets don’t come from nowhere – a neoliberal state apparatus is necessary to clear the space for markets to takeover agricultural regimes. This type of state ‘intervention’ is the foundation of enclosure.<br />

The creation of markets is the generative moment of enclosure<br />

<br />
The generative moment is …is always co-production.<br />
<br />
Although the alternative asks questions about alternatives to capital as a mediator of social relations, it’s not about capitalism as an economic system. It’s about the role enclosure plays in creating those systems.<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘7 Lecturer, University of East London The Beginning of History 5-7<br />
<br />
Whether this 'progress' is … role in reproducing the system.<br />

Removing ag subsidies doesn’t solve trade inequality – declining terms of trade for the south means that even if ag is more competitive, the game is rigged for the north<br />

And what if the reader … this book is directed.<br />
<br />
The alternative produces commons-as-struggles against enclosure – it’s a resistance to any act or discourse the attempts to inject a market in between producers and their means of livelihood.<br />
<br />
The key question is one of social relations – voting negative means voting for social relations defined by commons, not markets.<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘7 Lecturer, University of East London The Beginning of History 29-31<br />
<br />
But the story does not end here. …merging from their interactions.<br />
<br />
The alternative is not an attempt to overthrow capitalism; it’s not even about capitalism – it’s about neoliberalism, but more specifically, it’s about resisting ENCLOSURES – it’s something totally different.<br />
<br />
The question for the alt is how there can be life despite capitalism, not after capitalism. The key claim is the production of commons as a social practice, not necessarily an attempt to re-engineer society. What’s importance is the opposition to enclosures.<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘4 Lecturer, University of East London, Historical Materialism, volume 12:2 (57–87) “Separating the Doing and the Deed”<br />
<br />
However, we must be fully … the problematisation of their articulation<br />
<br />
Voting negative just means you endorse social practices which attempt to resist the injection of a market in between individuals and their means of livelihood.<br />
<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘7 Lecturer, University of East London The Beginning of History 31-33<br />
<br />
However, the bottom-line question, the … depend on a myriad of other factors.<br />
<br />
<br />
The production of commons is not about policies – it’s about practices. What is important is creating relations among individuals that are structures not by markets but by commons.<br />

Taking over the state makes problems worse – it misunderstands the nature of power and inevitably involves a complement of nationalism, preventing true commons.<br />

Changing the world through state can’t work and only makes the problems worse. The question is how to change the world without taking power.<br />
