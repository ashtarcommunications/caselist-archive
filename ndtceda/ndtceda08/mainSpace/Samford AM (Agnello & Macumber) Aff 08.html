Poppies 1ac (for Liberty)Observation 1: Inherency:The illegal opium trade currently dominates the Afghan economy—this isfueling the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan now:<br />
Tom Hyland, 10/28/2007 (staff, Sunday Age; Lexis)<br />
THE opium poppy...supply and pay its guerilla fighters.<br />
The Plan: The United States Federal Government should offer to thegovernment of Afghanistan that it will end drug eradication andprovide all necessary foreign assistance for poppy licensing projectsfor morphine-free poppy crops if the government of Afghanistan agreesto allow the United States to establish a licensing program for legal,morphine-free, medical poppy cultivation in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 is terrorismThe status quo counter-narcotics policy is failing: a more successfulstrategy to win the hearts and minds of the Afghani people isnecessary to stop the Taleban--<br />
Kendall and Macdonald '07 (Raymond, former Secretary General ofInterpol, and Norine, Founding President of the Senlis Council,&quot;Winning with opium in Afghanistan&quot;, 7/15, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dailytimes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailytimes.com</a>.pk)<br />
Despite considerable effort... and stable Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
The trade in illegal narcotics fuels terrorist groups in Afghanistan:<br />
Jochen Luypaert, 10/26/2007 (EUobserver.com; Lexis)<br />
Explaining its motives... utterly failing to control them:<br />
Tom Allard, 10/10/2007 (Sydney Morning Herald, Lexis)<br />
More than six years... 93 per cent of the world's illegal heroin.<br />
Afghanistan stability is teetering on the edge in the statusquo—anti-government insurgents are creating strongholds throughoutAfghanistan:<br />
Zach Lowe, 10/3/2007 (Capitol Hill Press Releases; Lexis)<br />
Afghanistan is teetering on the edge... support their anti-western agenda.<br />
<br />
And, insurgent groups in Afghanistan remain the greatest risk forstability—their success depends upon gaining support from the people:<br />
Jones '06 (Seth G, political scientist at RAND Corporation and AdjunctProfessor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown, &quot;SecuringTyrants or Fostering Reform?&quot;, rand.org)<br />
The Taliban and Hezb-i-Islami... are involved in the drug trade.<br />
Terrorists will use nuclear weapons triggering global nuclear war and extinction<br />
Mohamed Sid-Ahmed, 2004 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm,26%20August%20-%201%20September%202004" rel="nofollow">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm, 26 August - 1 September 2004</a>)<br />
What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack... infects thewhole planet, we will all be losers.<br />
Future terrorism will be nuclear in nature—multiple sources allowterrorists to acquire nuclear weapons:<br />
Marvin Cetron, 5/1/2007 (The Futurist, Lexis)<br />
2. Terrorists will gain weapons of mass destruction....eitherIslamabad or Tehran.<br />
<br />
Advantage Two is India-PakistanFailure in Afghanistan risks a collapse of the Pakistanigovernment—this risks a nuclear war with India:<br />
Larson '07 (David, contributing editor and columnist for The AmericanConservative and PhD student at Univ. of Chicago, &quot;Krauthammer onIraq: A Foreign Policy Only Someone From Another Planet CouldUnderstand&quot;, 3/30,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://larison.org/2007/03/30/krauthammer-on-iraq-a-foreign-policy-only-someone-from-another-planet-could-understand/%29" rel="nofollow">http://larison.org/2007/03/30/krauthammer-on-iraq-a-foreign-policy-only-someone-from-another-planet-could-understand/)</a><br />
If you were to then tell... and we already knew this.<br />
Fears of Pakistan being taken over by Islamic extremists would promptan Indo-Pak nuclear war:<br />
Thomas E. Ricks, 10/21/2001 (staff, Washington Post; Lexis)<br />
The prospect of Pakistan...an expert on strategic games.<br />
Indo-Pak war risks extinction<br />
Duffy '04 (accessed at:<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ccds.charlotte.nc.us/History/India/03/duffy/duffy.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccds.charlotte.nc.us/History/India/03/duffy/duffy.htm)</a><br />
All of this strife... both have developed nuclear weapons.<br />
And nuclear deterrence will break down in India-Pakistan: 3 reasons--<br />
Patrick French, 1999 (The Independent, May 30, 1999, Lexis)<br />
Unlike the Cold War...never win a conventional war with India.<br />
<br />
Advantage 3 is MalariaMalaria is the most deadly disease on the planet—half the world'spopulation is at risk of the disease:<br />
Colin Hinshelwood, 2004 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cpamedia.com/history/malaria_miracle_drug/%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpamedia.com/history/malaria_miracle_drug/)</a><br />
Alongside tuberculosis... tropical or sub-tropical regions and istherefore at risk.<br />
And…the death toll from malaria is rising now:<br />
Carol Harker, 2007 (February,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iowalum.com/magazine/feb07/exclusive/malaria.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.iowalum.com/magazine/feb07/exclusive/malaria.html)</a><br />
Unbelievable as it may seem...how to prevent and to treat.<br />
And we outweigh their disads…Malaria has killed more people than allwars and illnesses combined:<br />
Carol Harker, 2007 (February,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iowalum.com/magazine/feb07/exclusive/malaria.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.iowalum.com/magazine/feb07/exclusive/malaria.html)</a><br />
Identified as the most deadly disease...<br />
This puts over a million people at risk each year:<br />
World Health Organization, 2007 (April 26th, Division of Control ofTropical Diseases,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.microbiologybytes.com/introduction/Malaria.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.microbiologybytes.com/introduction/Malaria.html)</a><br />
Approximately 300 million people... that causes the disease.<br />
And…Malaria devastates development in Africa:<br />
World Health Organization, 2007 (April 26th, Division of Control ofTropical Diseases,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.microbiologybytes.com/introduction/Malaria.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.microbiologybytes.com/introduction/Malaria.html)</a><br />
Malaria thus has social consequences... more than $US1,800 million.<br />
<br />
Economic development is key to African democratization:<br />
States News Service, 2006 (December 8, 2006. Online. Internet. May 1, 2007).<br />
Perhaps the single most significant...judged by their own people.<br />
Democracy promotion key to preventing inevitable extinction<br />
Diamond, senior research fellow at Hoover Institution, 95<br />
(Larry, Promoting Democracy in the 1990s: Actors and Instruments,Issues and Imperatives, A Report to the Carnegie Commission onPreventing Deadly Conflict, December 1995, p. 6)<br />
This hardly exhausts the lists...popular sovereignty, and openness.<br />
<br />
Observation Two is SolvencyLicensing poppy cultivation is the only way to break the Taliban'sgrowing control over Afghanistan:<br />
Bhattacharji '07 (Romesh, former narcotics commissioner of India,&quot;India's experiences in licensing poppy cultivation for the productionof essential medicines ­ lessons for Afghanistan&quot;, June, http:<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/021_publication/documents/india_case_study%29" rel="nofollow">//www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/021_publication/documents/india_case_study)//</a><br />
<em>&gt;From a drug crop control perspective...poppy-based medicines such as morphine<br />
<br />
Poppy licensing systems is the key to reverse public support away fromthe Taliban ­ it secures the means to reconstruct Afghanistan andfight terrorism<br />
Kendall and Macdonald '07 (Raymond, former Secretary General ofInterpol, and Norine, Founding President of the Senlis Council,&quot;Winning with opium in Afghanistan&quot;, 7/15, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dailytimes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailytimes.com</a>.pk)<br />
A system in which poppy...sever ties with the insurgency.<br />
And the perception alone is enough—creating the licensing scheme sendsa positive signal to the farmers of Afghanistan that we've got theirback—helping us win their hearts &amp; minds:<br />
Jared Ferrie, 2007 (Canadian Business and Current Affairs, March 2007/ April 2007; Lexis)<br />
Poppy cultivation also feeds... without giving them something,&quot; he admitted.<br />
<br />
Status quo resistance to the plan is a result of US pressure foreradication ­ the plan reverses that pressure and encourages Karzai toaccept<br />
Andersson '06 (Camilla, Department of Economics at Umea University,&quot;Impact Assessment of Crop Eradication in Afghanistan and LessonsLearned from Latin America and South East Asia&quot;, Kabul InternationalWinter Symposium on Drug Policy, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.senliscouncil.net%29/" rel="nofollow">www.senliscouncil.net)</a><br />
Nevertheless, Karzai... stemmed the tide.<br />
Karzai's on board ­ he'll approve the plan<br />
Robichaud '07 (Carl, program officer at the Century Foundation, &quot;Bushand Karzai Show Signs of Divergence on Key Issues&quot;, 8/16,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tcf.org/list.asp?type=NC&amp;pubid=1660%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.tcf.org/list.asp?type=NC&amp;pubid=1660)</a><br />
As we have seen...Karzai has to say.<br />
<br />
And don't listen to their evidence quoting Karzai's public statements: privately he has changed his mind to support licensing if theinternational community takes responsibility for the licensing scheme:<br />
Francis Elliott, 4/15/2007 (The Sunday Independent; Lexis)<br />
Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai, who has opposed the idea in thepast...plug a worldwide shortage in medicinal opiates.<br />
Morphine free poppies like thebaine are an important step in furtherdeveloping poppies for medicine:<br />
Deborah Smith, 11/16/2004 (staff, Sydney Morning Herald; Lexis)<br />
Variations in some of Norman's genes... Dr Larkin said.<br />
Thebaine rich poppies are ideal for Afghanistan—they require lowinputs and gain high yields:<br />
Senlis Council, 11/23/2005(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.drug-policy.org/modules/events/london_hague_2005/the_hague_2005/executive_summary%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.drug-policy.org/modules/events/london_hague_2005/the_hague_2005/executive_summary)</a><br />
Dr. Anton Haverkort, Research Manager at the WageningenUniversity...special leaf shape or flower color.<br />
Thebaine provides the building blocks for malaria treatments:<br />
Bruce Mounster, 11/19/2004 (staff, Tasmanian Country; Lexis)<br />
Mr Rice said poppies produced a huge range of substances as steps...are tailored to produce alternative pharmaceuticals,&quot; Dr Larkin said.<br />
Scientists need more raw materials for the fight against malaria:<br />
Deborah Smith, 11/16/2004 (staff, Sydney Morning Herald; Lexis)<br />
Australian scientists have found a way...future as a source of rawmaterials for malaria drugs, Dr Larkin said.<br />
Afghanistan would be a huge source of raw materials for drug research:<br />
The Times of Central Asia, 6/9/2006 (Lexis)<br />
If opium poppy growth is ever legalized...another voluntary destruction.<br />
Plus there is zero diversion or black market risk from theibane: yousimply can't make heroin out of it:<br />
Francis Moraes, et al, 2003 (The Little Book of Opium, accessed viagoogle books)<br />
Thebaine has a chemical structure... is little worry that this formof opium would be diverted to the Illicit market, since the illicitmarket is only interest in morphine for conversion into heroin.A licensing system creates revenue and bolsters Afghanistan's infrastructure:<br />
Green Party of Canada '07 (&quot;A closer look at the Senlis Council'sproposed Poppy for Medicine projects in Afghanistan&quot;, August,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.greenparty.ca/en/policy/documents/P4M%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenparty.ca/en/policy/documents/P4M)</a><br />
The crux of these projects... supply system for emerging countries.Afghan-village made medicines can provide for the global un-met needfor morphine.<br />
<br />
And their disads are hopelessly non-unique: The House and Senate havepassed a continuing resolution guaranteeing billions in aid toAfghanistan in the status quo:<br />
Leys 10/7/2007 (Jeff, &quot;Iraq-Afghanistan War Spending: LegislativeUpdate&quot;, 10/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://vcnv.org/iraq-afghanistan-war-spending-legislative-update-oct-7-2007%29" rel="nofollow">http://vcnv.org/iraq-afghanistan-war-spending-legislative-update-oct-7-2007)</a><br />
Both the House and the Senate...Congress at the end of July.<br />

 Observation One is Inherency<br />
In the status quo, US-lead eradication teams in Afghanistan have expanded their campaigns – driving the hearts and minds further away from the War on Terror<br />
Senlis Council ‘06 (The last article cited in the text of the document was written 8/06 and there wasn’t a date for the pdf, “Opium Poppy Eradication in Afghanistan: Ill-Conceived Policy Undermines Support for Karzai and Exacerbates Poverty”, www.senliscouncil.net/documents/HM_c5)<br />
