Democracy Promotion<br />
a. the administration has retreated from its dem march, choosing instead more limited demo promo that fosters stability. Bush is trying to revive sweeping demo promo but America’s image prevents the world from taking him seriously – perception is key<br />
traynor 6/6/07 – the guardian<br />
“george bush last night…vunerable to criticism and denunciation”<br />
<br />
b. link – plan improves our image in the ME – allowing muslims to overcome their hatred of US policy and embrace more broad demo promo efforts <br />
fisher 5/10/07 www.truthout.org/docs_2006/051007k.shtml<br />
“the us war to bring… threaten our mutual security”<br />
<br />
c. impacts – a push for ME democratization will spark mass terrorism, make true democracy more unlikely and spark a major war in the ME<br />
layne 07 American Empire: A Debate pg 95-96<br />
“simply put, … power in the ME.”<br />
<br />
That goes nuclear and escalates globally<br />
Steinbach march 02<br />
www.wagingpeace.org/articles/02.03/0331steinbachisraeli.htm<br />
<br />
and their turns are useless – even if demo promo can be good our flawed methods ensure failure and miscalculation in the short term – demo promo is easy and dangerous<br />

the economist 7/14/07 <br />
“if forced to bet… his reforms through”<br />
<br />
b. sarkozy as defined himself as pro-lebanon – meaning he will have no choice but to piggy back on us action – this sends a signal of cooperation<br />
kouchner 9/3/07 – newsweek<br />
“but doesn’t this trip… but the Us and Europe.”<br />
<br />
This hurts sarkozy in 2 ways<br />
Us steals sarkozy’s thunder – Lebanon is key for sarkozy – he wants to use diplomacy there to pursue French historical ties – he wants no outside interference<br />
Mideast mirror 5/14/07<br />
“even chirac’s policy… assassination of rafiq hariri”<br />
<br />
moves sarkozy too close to the us-sarkozy’s popularity based off his willingness to disengage from the America in Lebanon <br />
