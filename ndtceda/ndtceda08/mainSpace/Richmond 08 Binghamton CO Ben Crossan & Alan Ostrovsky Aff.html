Thus we advocate an end to all prisons for their location in the continuum of black civil death marks them as an extension of the biggest subsidy ever given to agriculture in America the inscription of black bodies with the status of slave through the raw carceral brutality of the middle passage and plantation servitude. <br />
Angola, Caledonai, Parchman, none of these places stand on their own as aberrations in an otherwise miraculous story of hard-working American agricultural magicians that pulled a white, fuzzy country out of the cotton top hat of ingenuity and industrial grit. No, these prison farms, these plantations, these unbilical cords flailing from the belly of slave ships all exist as sepulchers for the disavowed kernel of America’s existence – The slave, the abject black body zero-point repository of Amerca’s constitutive atrocity. <br />
Debate as an activity is not separate from the technologies of racism that form these networks of cruelty. Far from being a sanitized laboraty cleansed of Eurocentric epistemology, traditional policy debate force marches marginalized bodies into the Disneyland dath camps that populate the periphery of our amnesia stained fantasy space. <br />
Against this we propose a three point methodology for putting anti-white supremacist scholarship into practice. <br />
1. Droppin’ science. An active use of commjunicative styles such as spoken word and hip-hop with roots in non-european forms of expression that throw white horizons of ignification and thus subjectivity into crisis. In other words, the deployment of speech that disrupts the linguistic hegemony of technocratic communication and its attendant position of mastery over knowledge formation. <br />
2. Know your roots. A genealogical interrogation of otherwise a-historically posited institution like prisons and agriculture that politicizes technologies of domination as products of material and subjective social networks as opposed to inevitable and natural events that exist outside the realm of human will. <br />
3. An investment in voice as a political project. Reading from those whose narratives and bodies are disappeared and discounted, imprisoned intellectuals like Creola Scott, George Jackson and Jarvis Jay Masters that retain perspectives and social positions marked as inappropriate and dangerous to the dominant field of representation and epistemology. <br />
Thus our framework for the debate is that you should vote for whoever has the best methodology for creating fissures in the concrete that policy debate’s carceral regime has laid over the soil of communities resistance. <br />
In a debate community that thrices off the cultivation of white supremacy through the privileged handshake of ballots and the policing of non-white discourse through losses, voting affirmative means two things. <br />
1. Giving us the ballot is a gesture of giving up your badge – to vote affirmative means you forfeit your role as a cop by surrending the policing function of the ballot that operates by silencing challenges to white epistemology and Eurocentric modes of aethethic ordering through losses. <br />
2. In an activity where ballots are the currency in debate’s economy of truth voting affirmative constitutes an investment in counter-knowledges that form communities of resistance between academics and those possessing no authoritative voice that challenge a white supremist ordering of the world. Moreover, this investment is a simultaneous divestment from white thinking, it is a refusal to formulate the ballot into another token of privileged white solidarity and fraternity, the common handshake with which the debate community writ large sanctions white technocratic epistemology through the constant endorsement of postions defending economic and militaristic security and American exceptionalism. <br />

America’s agricultural lineage is not a sanitary story of industrious white citizens creating an empire of produce out of the untilled and empty land that presented itself to them upon Columbus’s “Discovery”. Rather it is a continuum steeped in the foundation of mass graves, shackled limbs and kidnapped bodies. Specifically, America’s entire agricultural economy was birthed out of the capture, control and reduction of black bodies to fungible objects, rendering the social death conferred upon Africans through the processes of the middle passage and slavery the biggest subsidy ever given to agriculture in America since it was American Agriculture’s very condition of possibility. <br />
Far from a bloody stain bleached b the march of historical progeress, the civil death accorded to indigenous and black bodies exists as the constitutve tissue of America’s body politic. The figuration of black bodies as repositories for slavery’s gratuitous violence and slavery itself never ended, both merely evolved and transposed their carceral logic into the estashblishment of our current riminal justice system. White cvil society continues to constitute itself through the capture, policing and forced labor of black bodies. Paradigmatic of this reality is the prison farm modern day plantations with histories loced firmly in the roots of chattel slavery <br />
<br />
This question of black civil death is not relegated to the space of prison farms but rather finds its instantiation in every prison. The constellation of carcerality in America has its legal and genealogical roots in the technologies of confinement and control, torture and bodily disintegration cultivated in the middle passage. ALL prisons exist as spatial continuums, catalyzing a process of ontological subjection that craves out the boundaries of humanity and the countours of political possibility, thereby existing as the scaffolding for white supremcy’s structural and social network of domination. <br />
As Jarvis Jay Masters and George Jackson account, prisons exist as the sptial manifestation and process of white civil society’s constitutive condition – the Physical and social assassination of black bodies. <br />
The deployment of disenfranchised voices refigures speech as a poltical project of visibility which radicalizes academic spaces like debate into communities of resistance <br />

Food is the heartbeat; populations march to the rhythm of its drum. In the 18th century, the population of Europe was marching west. Colonization allowed an expansion beyond previous carrying capacity because the Americas fed Europe <br />

By the middle of the 19th century, eating was a global capitalist affair. English agriculture was overcome by production from the US, Australia and Argentina. Food producers were at the mercy of long-range flows of fertilizer. Tereby subjected to the antimarket influence of transnational corporations – corportations that would later genetically modify crops to require extreme fertilization. By dawn of the 20th century, gene manipulation, facilitated by seed-based agriculture, took control of corn. <br />

The American population expanded into what Deleuze deems “the rhizomatic West with its Indians without ancestry, its ever receding limit, its shifting and displaced frontiers.” Among the native plants of the Great Plains was switchgrass – tall prairie grass, Panicu Virgatum – but with the settlers came sodbusters. <br />
