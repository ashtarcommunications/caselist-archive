<strong>Observation 1 – Inherency</strong><br />
<strong>Congress established checkoff programs to support agricultural commodities</strong><br />
Wilde, Patrick, June 2006, Obesity, Vol. 14, Online<br />
“Congress has authorized…government’s own message”<br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The United States Federal Government should eliminate United States Department of Agriculture support for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations in Schools and nutrition guidelines</span><br />
<h3 id="toc28"><a name="x-Harvard JP Aff-1ac w/ cites"></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><em>1ac w/ cites</em></strong></span></h3>
 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In 1946, the federal government created the National School Lunch Program with two conflicting goals:<br />
1. To remedy chronic malnutrition among children.<br />
2. To dispose of massive agricultural surpluses left over from the war.<br />
At the time, these two policies fit well together: farmers could dump their fatty meat and dairy products, and children could eat themselves into healthy weights.<br />
Times have changed, however – today over-nutrition, not malnutrition, is the problem. Children eat more fat than ever.<br />
But the NSLP has not changed either its mission or its guidelines. It still serves the same high-fat, cholesterol loaded food that it did in 1946. Here’s some facts: [Yeoman 3 [Barry, Mother Jones, Jan/Feb]]<br />
Every weekday at lunch… and pepperoni calzones<br />
Eating of meat, more than any other food, is a political act. When children are socialized into the culture of meat, they are socialized, most of all, into a culture of domination. Meat symbolizes control dominion of all parts of the world and structures culture according to subservience. The result is that he entire American society is socialized into ignorance of suffering – the effects are large and are manifest in systems of institutional violence.<br />
Michael Allen Fox ’99 Philosophy, Queen’s University Deep Vegetarianism 28-33<br />
Anthropologist Nick Fiddes, … a need for the change.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And, these forms of domination permeate all of society – contingent apocalypse lays forever on the horizon as long as we are socialized into meat. Ecological destruction becomes inescapable.<br />
Nick Fiddes ’91 Research Fellow in the Department of Social Anthropology at Edinburgh Meat: A Natural Symbol 210<br />
The litany of social and … positive meanings of the past.<br />
The second problem is ignorant eating:<br />
The eating of industrial meats trains children to be ignorant of their food – this distance from food is problematic: it creates broader structures of ignorance about the world.<br />
Michael Pollan ‘6, Author and Agriculture Writer for the New York Times Magazine, 2006, Omnivore’s Dilemma: a natural history of four meals, p. 10-1<br />
What is perhaps most … only deepened by knowing.<br />
This is even worse with CAFO products – they create a compartmentalization of the social violence creating systems of ignorance. This type of compartmentalization-as- social-form is basis for most forms of violence and warfare.<br />
Michael Allen Fox ’99 Philosophy, Queen’s University Deep Vegetarianism 39-44<br />
Why do thoughtful people … imprint of human¬ity,&quot; and the like.<br />
What’s more – our relationship to the culture of meat is the most important impact. By structuring all of society, meat eating and its accompanying ignorance is at the foundation of all forms of domination in western society. Meat is the “red-thread” that runs through ideologies of power and violence.<br />
Nick Fiddes ’91 Research Fellow in the Department of Social Anthropology at Edinburgh Meat: A Natural Symbol 227-231<br />
Just as significant as such empirical … itself teetering on a precipice to oblivion.<br />
Solvency:<br />
The plan solves: it’s an extremely empowering move in the context of food. School nutrition is a fertile site for the remaking and renegotiating of social norms and practices. Changing school wellness policies brings in local actors, and the policy process involved in the schools creates a participatory regime for nutrition and health.<br />
