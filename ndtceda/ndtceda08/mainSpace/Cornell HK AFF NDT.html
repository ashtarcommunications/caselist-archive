 <br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Q: Your evidence says pharmaceutical prescriptions are being handed out, isn’t this a big causality?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A: No – aquaculture is a big internal link. That is a small alternate causality to fish, which travel all over world and carry antibiotic resistance. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Q: The virus Merca is not a zoological, how does your internal link answer that question?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A: Right. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Q: Why would aquaculture salmon not fill in for Pacific salmon?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A: They are not adept to wild environment. The GM salmon can’t survive in the wild. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Judges: Anders, Brooks, Jarman<br />
<br />
1AC: CIL Cotton Aff --- I-Law, Russia, and Kashmir<br />
Plan Text: The United States Supreme Court should rule that Upland Cotton subsidies should be capped at 18% of current allocation. This should include counter-cyclical payments, loan deficiency payments, marketing assistance loans and direct payments. The United States Supreme Court should rule on the grounds that the Charming Betsy Standard demands compliance with the Upland Cotton ruling by the World Trade Organization.<br />
