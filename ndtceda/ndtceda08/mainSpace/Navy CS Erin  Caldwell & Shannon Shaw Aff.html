The Federal government provides massive subsidies to the ethanol industry at all levels of ethaol production and consumption.<br />

<br />
Observation 2 is the Advantages<br />
Advantage 1 is Food Prices<br />
Scenario 1 is Starvation<br />
<br />
The diversion of corn to ethanol disrupts food and commodities markets rapidly increasing the price of staple crops across the globe.<br />
RUNGE AND SENAUER 07 (C. Ford Runge and Benjamin Senauer, “How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor,” Foreign Affairs, May/June 2007, C. Ford Runge is Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Applied Economics and Law and Director of the Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Minnesota. Benjamin Senauer is Professor of Applied Economics and Co-director of the Food Industry Center at the University of Minnesota)<br />

Complacency in the face of famine is murder, there is more than enough food to feed every hungry person.<br />
Africa News, June 30 2007 “Africa: Food for 12 billion. So why did 854 million go without?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.africa-interactive.net/index.php?PageID=5038" rel="nofollow">http://www.africa-interactive.net/index.php?PageID=5038</a> accessed July 2, 2007 SS<br />

cenario 2 is the Economy<br />
<br />
The tightening of corn supply makes any disruption drive food prices into the stratosphere.<br />

Reliance on corn ethanol is driving up world food prices – this ensures a global economic meltdown<br />
Elliot, 2008 (Larry, Journalist, “Soft Landings and Hard Realities: The IMF Thinks We Can Ride Out This Crisis, But There Could Be Far Worse News To Come”, Guardian Weekly, April 18, Lexis)<br />
<br />
Economic downturn causes nuclear war<br />
Chris Lewis, environmental historian, University of Colorado-Boulder, 1998, The Coming Age of Scarcity, p. 56<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 is the Earth<br />
Scenario 1 is Global Warming<br />
<br />
Continued use of corn-based ethanol will not reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but will actually increase them by 93%, massively speeding the process of global warming.<br />
USA Today, February 8, 2008 (H. Josef Hebert, AP Writer, “Study: Ethanol May Add to Global Warming”, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usatoday.com/weather/climate/globalwarming/2008-02-08-ethanol-study_N.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/weather/climate/globalwarming/2008-02-08-ethanol-study_N.htm</a></span>)<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario 2 is Soil Erosion<br />
High prices mean that increasing farmers have no incentive to put land into the Conservation Reserve Program which is necessary to prevent soil erosion and protect fragile habitats.<br />
Richard Conniff, 2007 2007 Guggenheim Fellow. Who's Fueling Whom? Why the biofuels movement could run out of gas * Smithsonian magazine, November 2007 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/presence-biofuel-200711.html?c=y&amp;page=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/presence-biofuel-200711.html?c=y&amp;page=4</a><br />
Soil erosion threatens all life on the planet.<br />
Horne and McDermott 2001 (James E., PhD and Maura, The next green revolution, p 69)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 3 is Venezuela<br />
<br />
Our ethanol policy enrages Venezuela and tanks relations.<br />
Reuters, April 12, 2007 (“Venezuela’s Chavez slams Bush’s energy plan”, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/41347/newsDate/12-Apr-2007/story.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/41347/newsDate/12-Apr-2007/story.htm</a></span>)<br />
Decreased relations with the US have led Venezuela to befriend terrorist organizations and state sponsors of terror.<br />

Venezuelan travel documents make it easy for terrorists to enter the US.<br />
