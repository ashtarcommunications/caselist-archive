Assembling fragments of information into a seemingly coherent conception of the Other is the ultimate reduction of the Other to the same. In light of these perils of knowledge production, the question of this debate must be recast—accepting their startin point always results in death and destruction of the other<br />

The Palestinian cause is simply an elaborate hoax. It presupposes a blatantly false mythology meant to justify hatred of Jews.<br />
Jeff Jacoby columnist for the Boston Globe, December 26, ’01 (Capitalism Magazine “The Myth of the Arab Country of Palestine?”)<br />
“Strip away the rhetoric…trying ever since.”<br />
<br />
The true goal of Palestinians is the destruction of Israel – the peace process ensures endless terrorism and war in an attempt to realize this dream.<br />
Robert W. Tracinski, editor and publisher of The Intellectual Activist and TIADaily, which offer daily news and analysis from a pro-reason, pro-individualist perspective, October 15, 2k (Capitalism Magazine “The Peace Process War in Israel/Palestine”)<br />
“After seven years…at least survival.”<br />
<br />
And the aff ensures Israel loses this war. American engagement of the Palestinian Authority cripples Israel by forcing concessions in the face of continuing violence.<br />
Elan Journo, writer for the Ayn Rand Institute, July 20, ’06 (Capitalism Magazine “Appeasing a Mortal Enemy: The U.S.-Israeli Suicide Pact”)<br />
“The Iran-Hamas-Hezbollah…commitment to appeasement.”<br />
<br />
Only one side can win this war. American policy-makers must decide, so our alternative is to choose Israel. Only through a commitment to winning the war can we establish a lasting peace and create a true Palestinian polity.<br />

Consequentialism<br />
( ) Consequentialism is the best way to evaluate U.S. policy towards the Middle East – it’s ethically bankrupt and shortsighted to let morality trump consequences, particularly when the lives of people across the Middle East are at stake<br />

( ) The project of U.S. diplomatic engagement envisions the world as a mass of barbarians to be conquered by diplomatic force one by one. Constructive engagement with ___ is not benign – it’s an extension of U.S. imperial power that paves the way for total global war.<br />
Aron Pease, Professor of English at the University of Florida, 2002, Politics and Culture, Issue 3, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://aspen.conncoll.edu/politicsandculture/page.cfm?key=176" rel="nofollow">http://aspen.conncoll.edu/politicsandculture/page.cfm?key=176</a>, accessed September 7, 2007<br />

Round 5 – Neg vs Oklahoma<br />
<br />
Take the land back: disclosed round 1—we read one less card<br />
<br />
<br />
Framework:<br />
A. Our framework – the aff can only defend advantages based on the consequences of hypothetical enactment of their plan by the USFG. They should win if the topical plan is the best policy option presented. The neg should win if the plan is worse than the status quo or an alternative competitive with the plan.<br />
<br />
B. Violation – the aff claims advantages independent of the enactment of a plan by the USFG<br />
<br />
C. Prefer our interpretation:<br />
<br />
1) Stable and predictable ground – using their plan as a starting point for some other discussion or to access an advantage independent of the plan’s enactment undermines our ability to generate offense that’s stable and predictable. They could read a plan with any advantage that the neg could never predict or adequately prepare for.<br />
<br />
2) Judge evaluation – their framework will have no coherent criteria for how the judge should assess competing claims or weigh impacts.<br />
<br />
3) Topic education – their framework is designed to dodge education about the core questions of Middle East policy, which makes debate devolve into repetitive discussions of micropolitics that aren’t educational. Lack of predictability means the aff is never tested in-depth and every debate is shallow. Topic-specific education is the most important benefit of debate.<br />
<br />
D. Vote negative – their framework is unfair, and there’s in-round abuse. Extra-topicality is an independent voter because it proves the resolution insufficient and is outside the judge’s jurisdiction.<br />
<br />
Definition – USFG is the Agent of the Resolution<br />
( ) The topic is defined by the phrase following the colon – the USFG is the agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters<br />
Webster’s Guide to Grammar and Writing, 2000, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm</a><br />
Use of a colon before a list or an explanation that is preceded by a clause that can stand by itself. Think of the colon as a gate, inviting one to go on… If the introductory phrase preceding the colon is very brief and the clause following the colon represents the real business of the sentence, begin the clause after the colon with a capital letter.<br />
<br />
( ) “The USFG” is the government in Washington D.C. – not individuals<br />
Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2000 [<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://encarta.msn.com" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com</a>]<br />
“The federal government of the United States is centered in Washington DC.”<br />
<br />
( ) Our definition excludes action by smaller political groups or individuals.<br />
Black’s Law Dictionary Seventh Edition Ed. Bryan A. Garner (chief) 1999<br />
Federal government 1. A national government that exercises some degree of control over smaller political units that have surrendered some degree of power in exchange for the right to participate in national political matters.<br />
<br />
“Resolved” expresses intent to solve the question posed by the resolution – this is distinct from individual debaters being ‘resolved’<br />
American Heritage Dictionary 2000, online: www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=resolved<br />
To find a solution to; solve …<br />
To bring to a usually successful conclusion<br />
<br />
( ) “Should” denotes an expectation – this means the resolution shows expectation that its agent will enact the plan<br />
American Heritage Dictionary – 2000 [www.dictionary.com]<br />
3 Used to express probability or expectation<br />
<br />
<br />
This is not a reason to vote affirmative - Resistance to the constraints of the topic/debate is discursive evasion that neutralizes most of the relevant negative ground. By refusing to take a stand for limited discourse they undermine the point of judging between competitors in the first place<br />

Our argument provides a-priori reasons to vote negative. You must use your ballot to ratify constraints on discourse to preserve a politically-enabling discussion<br />

“To put this point … support that we can give them.”<br />
<br />
( ) Debate about personal beliefs devolves into fights over issues that cannot be resolved through consensus-building discourse – this destroys the productive potential of their advocacy<br />
Edwin Bryan Portis, Professor Political Science at Texas A&amp;M, 2000, Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 2<br />
“Moral commitment, on …necessarily more rational than another.”<br />
<br />
( ) Forcing transcendence of personal beliefs nurtures democratic deliberation – the alternative is unending social conflict<br />
Thomas A. Spragens, Professor of Polisci at Duke, 2000, Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 90<br />
“I have argued here …this form of discourse.”<br />
<br />
( ) Traditional policy debate is good – education about policy choices is critical to the goals of the left. Debaters have more ability to affect the world than the other team believes – rejecting traditional debate allows the Karl Roves of the world to dominate the political unchecked.<br />
Oliver Broudy, freelance journalist/columnist and former editor of the Paris Review, November/December 2006, Mother Jones, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/11/revenge_of_the_nerds.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/11/revenge_of_the_nerds.html</a>, accessed November 11, 2006<br />

( ) Individual politics are the most likely breeding ground for unethical and immoral actions – only democratic politics prevents this by forcing public accountability. And, if their alt is implemented on a wide scale, it kills everybody.<br />
