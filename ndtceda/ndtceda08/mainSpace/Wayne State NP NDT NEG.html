 5 off<br />
1 – T – CE = uncondo<br />
<br />
2- Capitalism/zizek K<br />
The aff radically depoliticzes the economy -0 this can never obtain the dimension of universiality because it precludes acts of authentic politics<br />
Zizek 1999 Ticklish Subject p.252-55<br />
“what one should bear in mind…fundamental fantasy”<br />
repoliticizing the economy is th e only mechanism which creates the necesary6 conditions for the realization of subordinate groups demands<br />
zizek again p.356<br />
“of course, one should…so on, demands”<br />
our question of self-orientation precedes political action<br />
Johnston 2004 Psychoanalysis, culture and society vol 9 issue 3<br />
“the height of zezek’s…coopted by it”<br />
<br />
our alternative is to completely withdraw from the ideology of apital – this is eesential to destroy the fettish that allows capital to thrive<br />
Johnston again<br />
“perhaps the absence of a detailed…I choose fetishism”).”<br />
It is not possible to sovle any situation without solving them all – only a criticism which attacks the universal of capitalism can solve their impacts and the inevitable destruction fo the earch and tis people<br />
Zizek 1989 The sublime Object of Ideology p. 3-4<br />
“it is upon the unity…governed society”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3- Elections – Obama Bad<br />
McCain will win now – divisive nomination battle dooms democrats<br />
Malone march 27<br />
“in addition, a new gallup poll…democratic party apart”<br />
Israeli lobby hates the plan<br />
Petras 2006 “a grand settlement versus the jewish lobby”<br />
“in November this year…negotiating with them”<br />
They are key to elections<br />
Mearsheimer and Walt 2006 Weekend Australian<br />
“AIPAC forms the core…not to antagonize them”<br />
McCain will take the blame – he is tieed to bush<br />
“Dan Nowicki 2007 arizona republic<br />
“a spokesman for McCain’s presidential…worse every day”<br />
Obama will start a trade war wuth China<br />
Tharp 2007 new york pos<br />
“with help from some western spin…protectionist legislation”<br />
This risks war with china – most probable scenario for nuclear war<br />
Lancy 2007<br />
“The greatest threat…ability to lead economically”<br />
<br />
<br />
4 – Strike Iran CP<br />
the usfg should engage in military regime change campaign agains thte government of Iran. The usf should<br />
-ustilize an effects-based strategy, targeting critical infrastructure, including electricity, communications transportation, and industrial nodes<br />
-target Iranian gasoline refineries and storage facilities, Iranian nuclear facilities, and nuclear infrastructure<br />
- suppor tethinic resistance groups within iran both logistically and financially in order ot turn sections of the country into regional autonomous zones<br />
-not use any type of nuclear weapons during this mission<br />
-increase the air force budget by 20 billion dollards for 2009<br />
-deploy all necessary forces to the gulf of oman to enforce a halt of all shipments of irnaian oil and guarantee the safety of tankers and other platforms carrying nbon-iranian oil<br />
0deploy special operation forces to seize key Iranian oil assets, including series of 100 offshore wells and platforms built on iran’s continental shelf, as well as the north and south pars offshore fields<br />
-ensure a steady reliable access of oil and LNG to China, Russia, turkey, and India<br />
- send special operations forces to secure the oild fields and tankers belonging to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Kuwait<br />
-allow Iraqi refugees to move outside camps and into cities<br />
-form a corporation for public deiplomacy, to be modeled on the US corporation for public broadcasting to guarantee the free flwo of information<br />
This strategy would e most effective – it would bankrupt the Iranian government cripple their ability to retaliate, and safeguard oru economic interests<br />
Herman 2006 “getting serious about iran” a military option”<br />
“the first step would be…could enter free fall”<br />
solves terrorism<br />
Solomon 2006 “confronting the worlds new petro-powers”<br />
“should the day come…inviting Iran’s fate”<br />
more ev<br />
kristol 2006 “its our war”<br />
