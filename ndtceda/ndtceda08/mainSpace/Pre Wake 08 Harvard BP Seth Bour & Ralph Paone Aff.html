<strong>Contention 1: The chef d’Eat</strong><br />
<br />
<span style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times"><strong>Biopolitical sovereignty begins not with a contract but a meal. Managing heterogeneous bodies requires the production of a population, humans, in opposition to a dangerous outside, animals. The reduction of animals to ‘units of meat’ to be consumed by the populace is the first step in the production of this line between the inanimate energy source known as Animal and the lively consumer called Human. What results is a national dietetics, a prescribed order of consumption, that is focused on optimizing the human-health of the population against the dangers of animality, which range from sexual ‘predation’ to society-threatening ‘parasites.’</strong> </span><br />

<span style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times"><strong>The American Chef proffers an experience in concentrated consumption.. Carcass factories and ghettos. This massifying isolation of zones of animality from the rest of humanity forms a standing-feast upon which the political order must constantly feeds to stabilize its existence.</strong> </span></span><br />

</span><br />
<span style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times"><strong>The fixity of the boundary between the Human and the Animal is not natural, but an active production of an ensemble of governmentality.</strong> </span><br />

<span style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times"><strong>The reduction of animals-as-multiplicity to already-dead matter is coded into the federal government’s depiction of the farm. The relationship between what goes on at a flesh factory and the consumers of its so-called products is obscured by legal discourse that construes agricultural production in purely economic terms. The notion of the farm as a site of cultural production is emptied in favor of a sanitized ‘agricultural sector.’</strong></span><br />

<span style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times"><strong>Despite receiving substantial subsidization from the government, the relationship between the Sovereign’s consumption pattern and the CAFO remains concealed by a legal language of absence.

<span style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times"><strong>This motion is not a call for a transcendental government solution, but rather part of an immanent deconstruction of the diet of the biopolitical body. Calling for the elimination of subsidies for that which does not textually exist in subsidy law, the CAFO, positively marks the negative exclusion of animality that conditions the current social order. Drawing attention to absence as the ontological subsidy that enables the massification and elimination of populations deemed ‘animal’ renders fragile the smooth digestion of the Animal as mere source of energy. This deconstructive work challenges the stability of the human-animal divide and opens new space for ethical interaction.</strong> </span></span><br />
