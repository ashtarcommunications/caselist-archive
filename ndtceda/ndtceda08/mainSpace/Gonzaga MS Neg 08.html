Heidegger – rounds 1 and 5<br />
<br />
The aff's call for crisis based politics engages in a type of thinking that reduces all life on earth to a tool to be instrumentalized, further disconnecting ourselves from what it means to be.<br />
<br />
Swazo 02 – Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alaska (Norman K., Crisis Theory and World Order: Heideggerian Reflections, p. 110-11)<br />
<br />
The inevitability of such a fight ... its instrument in technocracy.<br />
<br />
Their 1AC's call for constructive engagement is an attempt to comprehend and master the world around us. This creates a violent relationship with Being that not only turns their case but disconnects us from what it means to be.<br />
<br />
Geiman 01 (Clare Pearson, &quot;Heidegger's Antigones.&quot; A Companion to Heidegger's Introduction to Metaphysics.<br />
Ed. Richard Polt and Gregory Fried. New Haven and London: Yale University Press)<br />
<br />
What Heidegger is calling for ... Poetic thinking points to just such a move.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the dawn of the 21st century, we live in an era of profound insecurity regarding humanity's relationship to Being. This insecurity has been met with a maniacal attempt to master and control Being itself. Human rights are perhaps the ultimate example of a modernist metaphysics that reduces humanity to a mass of standing reserve by forgetting its ownmost Being. Although they have been hailed as the means to global emancipation, human rights require the reduction of the human subject to an item of valuation. The subjects of human rights can never just Be, can never act as instances of Being disclosing itself, but are comprehended and valued only through the eyes of the modernist subject. This drive to valuation and control of the world through human rights produces a global culture of techno-nihilism, both the cause and the symptom of humanity's domination of the earth and of itself.<br />

<br />
Martin Heidegger ... horrors of metaphysical arrogance?<br />
<br />
Loss of Being obliterates the value to life and is a fate worse than nuclear annihilation<br />
<br />
Zimmerman 94 (Michael, Prof of Philosophy @ Tulane, Contesting Earth's Future, p.119-120)<br />
<br />
Heidegger asserted ... as good as dead . )<br />
<br />
Continued domination of technological thought risks extinction through global conflict and the deterioration of Earth.<br />
<br />
Swazo 02 – Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alaska (Norman K., Crisis Theory and World Order: Heideggerian Reflections, p. 157-60)<br />
<br />
The grounding question ... `earthly-temporal' is transformed . )<br />
<br />
The affs attempts to reorient politics to sustain peace in a techno-cratic order is doomed to failure. Absent a connection to being, planned and mediated steps to achieve change will produce the opposite results because reforming the world necessarily requires reforming ourselves.<br />
<br />
Swazo 02 – Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alaska (Norman K., Crisis Theory and World Order: Heideggerian Reflections, p. 55-58)<br />
<br />
Gadamer poses fundamental ... cannot even reform themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to reject technological thought by voting negative. The Affirmative's conception of the world is shaped by technological ordering and must be interrogated through meditative thought.<br />
<br />
Korous 97 (George, Yale Law Graduate, Copeland Winner, Become What You Are, p. 22-25)<br />
<br />
The thought that ... what constitutes reality.<br />
<br />
Rejecting their call to action and engaging in meditative thought allows us to open up the horizons of thought and regain a connection to being.<br />
<br />
Swazo 02 – Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alaska (Norman K., Crisis Theory and World Order: Heideggerian Reflections, p. 10-12)<br />
<br />
At least for now, I am not ... for theoretical critique -)<br />
<br />
We must be Herculean in our call for meditative thought. Any endorsement of immediate action sustains a chain of technological thought.<br />
<br />
Swazo 02 – Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alaska (Norman K., Crisis Theory and World Order: Heideggerian Reflections, p. 24-25)<br />
<br />
Accordingly, if one ... Dismissal of crisis theory.<br />
<br />
Their impact scenarios should not be evaluated when deciding the round. These scenarios are existential threats that blackmail us into maintaining technological thought. Aff impacts are prejudices that are created to maintain the system.<br />
<br />
Swazo 02 – Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alaska (Norman K., Crisis Theory and World Order: Heideggerian Reflections, p. 12-14)<br />
<br />
In line with ... quest to create a just world order<br />
<br />
Inevitability and preferential calculations should be withheld from decision-making: their truth claims force us to play the game on the system's own terms. Only our alternative reshapes the coordinates of reality.<br />
<br />
Swazo 02 – Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alaska (Norman K., Crisis Theory and World Order: Heideggerian Reflections, p. 134-36)<br />
<br />
All of the foregoing ... coordinates of the world system.
