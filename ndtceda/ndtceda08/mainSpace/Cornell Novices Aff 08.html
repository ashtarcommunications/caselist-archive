 Observation 1 is Inherency – <br />
<br />
THE U.S. AND NATO ARE CURRENTLY LOSING THE WAR AGAINST TALIBAN INFLUENCE - 2007 IS THE TIPPING POINT FOR AFGHANISTAN – WHO CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY WILL DEPEND ON THE NEXT FEW MONTHS<br />
<br />
Lekic, Correspondent for the Associated Press, April 28, 2007 (Slobodan, US Ex-Diplomat: Afghan's Karzai Faltering”) <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2007/04/28/us-ex-diplomat-afghan-s-karzai-faltering.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2007/04/28/us-ex-diplomat-afghan-s-karzai-faltering.phtml</a><br />

IN 2006, THE U.S. PULLED OUT THEIR SECURITY DETAIL FOR HAMID KARZAI FOR AN ALL AFGHAN BODYGUARD FORCE TRAINED BY DYNCORP<br />
Nawa, award-winning Afghan-American journalist, June 13, 2006 (Fariba, New America Media, “The Business of Fear: Private Companies Hawk Security in Afghanistan”) &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=6b4596f3e8e576ce5c02cea6b40499ed" rel="nofollow">http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=6b4596f3e8e576ce5c02cea6b40499ed</a>&gt; <br />

Adv. 1 Assassination –<br />
<br />
JUST 2 WEEKS AGO THERE WAS ANOTHER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON HAMID KARZAI <br />
<br />
Reuters, September 9, 2007 “Afghanistan’s Karzai hustled away after gunfire scare” &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://newsroom.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2007-09-09T074802Z_01_ISL139023_RTRUKOC_0_US-AFGHAN-KARZAI.xml" rel="nofollow">http://newsroom.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2007-09-09T074802Z_01_ISL139023_RTRUKOC_0_US-AFGHAN-KARZAI.xml</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
TWO MONTHS AGO THE TALIBAN TRIED TO ASSASSINATE KARZAI – IT WAS THE 3RD ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE<br />
<br />
International Herald Tribune, June 10, 2007 “UN ‘outraged’ after assassination attempt on Karzai” <br />
<br />
2007 WILL BE A CRITICAL YEAR – THE TALIBAN WILL INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO ASSASSINATE HAMID KARZAI AND ATTEMPT TO DISRUPT THE GOVERNMENT’S AUTHORITY<br />
<br />
Boucher, Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, March 8, 2007 (Richard, “Moving Forward in Afghanistan,” Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.state.gov/p/sca/rls/rm/2007/81606.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/p/sca/rls/rm/2007/81606.htm</a>&gt;<br />
THE U.S. SECURITY DETAIL FOR KARZAI PASSED ON THE DUTY TO AFGHAN BODYGUARDS IN 2006 – THEY WILL FAIL TO PROTECT HAMID KARZAI DUE TO LACK OF ARMED VEHICLES, WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT, AND INTELLIGENCE NECESSARY – TALIBAN SYMPATHIZERS WILL INFILTRATE THEM AND ASSASSINATE KARZAI<br />
<br />
Saeed, Correspondent for the Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting in Kabul, November 13, 2005 (Abdul Baseer, “Karzai’s Afghan Protectors”) &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iwpr.net/?apc_state=hpsiarr2005&amp;l=en&amp;s=f&amp;o=262129" rel="nofollow">http://www.iwpr.net/?apc_state=hpsiarr2005&amp;l=en&amp;s=f&amp;o=262129</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
ASSASSINATION IS INEVITABLE BECAUSE THE U.S. TRAINED AFGHAN BODYGUARDS ARE WHOLLY INCAPABLE OF PROTECTING KARZAI – THERE ARE ALSO TRIBAL AND ETHNIC PROBLEMS AS KARZAI HAS NO ONE HE CAN TRUST WHO WILL TAKE A BULLET FOR HIM<br />
Pelton, Award winning investigative journalist and author of The World’s Most Dangerous Places, 2006 (Robert Young, Licensed to Kill, Hired Guns in the War on Terror) pg. 70-71<br />
<br />
KARZAI IS THE ONLY THING KEEPING THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN TOGETHER – IF HE IS ASSASINATED, THE WHOLE SYSTEM FALLS APART AND AFGHANISTAN REVERTS BACK TO PRE-1992 WHERE THE MUJAHIDEEN RULE THE COUNTRY<br />
<br />
Fang, U.S. News and World Report Correspondent, November 8, 2004 (Bay, “After the Election, What? Suddenly in Afghanistan, its actually put up or shut up time”) &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/041108/8afghan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/041108/8afghan.htm</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
ASSASINATION ALLOWS CONSERVATIVE FORCES WITHIN AFGHANISTAN TO TAKE OVER THE <br />
GOVERNMENT, ELIMINATE ALL MODERATES AND REFORMERS, AND CREATE A BRUTAL, DEMOCIDAL REGIME IN AFGHANISTAN<br />
<br />
Neef, Correspondent for Der Spiegel, May 27, 2007 (Christian, “New Alliance Threatens Karzai: Power Struggle in Afghanistan”) &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allArticles/16710DBA1DF6C61D872572DB005D0C98?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allArticles/16710DBA1DF6C61D872572DB005D0C98?OpenDocument</a>&gt;<br />

COLLAPSE OF THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WOULD SPILLOVER TO COLLAPSE PAKISTAN, AND SPIRAL INTO A WIDENING REGIONAL WAR BETWEEN SUNNI’S AND SHIITES ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. <br />

COLLAPSE OF PAKISTAN LEADS TO NUCLEAR WAR AND NUCLEAR TERRORISM<br />

A MIDDLE EAST WAR BETWEEN SUNNI’S AND SHIITES WILL ESCALATE AND ENVELOP THE U.S. AND END IN EXTINCTION<br />

<br />
PLAN – THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONSTRUCTIVELY ENGAGE THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN BY OFFERING A SECURITY GUARANTEE TO PROVIDE U.S. SPECIAL FORCES FOR HAMID KARZAI’S SECURITY DETAIL – WE’LL CLARIFY<br />
<br />
U.S. SPECIAL FORCES ARE CRITICAL TO PROTECTING KARZAI – THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WITH THE REQUISITE TRAINING, INTELLIGENCE, AND ARE ARMED WITH SNIPERS TO SCOPE FOR POTENTIAL ASSASSINS, SNIFFING DOGS TO FIND EXPLOSIVES, FORTIFIED CHECKPOINTS, ETC. <br />
Pelton, Award winning investigative journalist and author of The World’s Most Dangerous Places, 2006 (Robert Young, Licensed to Kill, Hired Guns in the War on Terror) pg. 74<br />
<br />
PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN WANT U.S. BODYGUARDS FOR HAMID KARZAI – THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEADER SHOULD BE ALIVE ABOVE ALL ELSE<br />
Khallili, Afghan Ambassador to the U.S., February 2, 2006, (Masood, “Leaving the snake half wounded will be more dangerous”) &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/feb/02inter1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/feb/02inter1.htm</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
U.S. SPECIAL FORCES AND INTELLIGENCE HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE AT KILLING HIGH LEVEL TALIBAN COMMANDERS AND THWARTING TERRORIST ATTACKS <br />
<br />
Rohde, Pulitzer Prize Winning Journalist, September 2, 2007 (David, “Afghan Police Suffer Setbacks as Taliban Adapt” &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/world/asia/02taliban.html?_r=1&amp;th=&amp;emc=th&amp;pagewanted=print" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/world/asia/02taliban.html?_r=1&amp;th=&amp;emc=th&amp;pagewanted=print</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
U.S. SPECIAL FORCES ARE THE ONLY ONES WITH UNFETTERED ACCESS RAPID COMMUNICATIONS, INTELLIGENCE, AND MILITARY SUPPORT – THERE IS ONLY A RISK OF BUREAUCRATIC DELAY WITH THE AFGHAN POLICE – THAT COULD PROVE TO BE FATAL AS KARZAI’S LIFE HANGS IN THE BALANCE<br />
<br />
Tepperman, Former Deputy Managing Editor, Foreign Affairs, January 13, 2003 (Jonathan D., “Response to Correspondence” The New Republic) &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20030113&amp;s=correspondence011303twp" rel="nofollow">http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20030113&amp;s=correspondence011303twp</a>&gt;<br />
SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES COUPLED WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE CAN ELIMINATE THREATS FROM AL-QAEDA – AN ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY OF LIGHT MILITARY PRESENCE SOLVES BEST<br />
Stewart, Author of ''The Prince of the Marshes and Other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq.'' July 23, 2007 (International Herald Tribune, “More Troops Isn’t the Answer – Afghanistan”) pg. Lexis<br />
<br />
THE U.S. COMMITMENT TO AFGHANISTAN IS KEY TO SOLVE – THE SECURITY SITUATION IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS AND PREVENTS KARZAI’S GOVERNMENT FROM EXERTING AUTHORITY<br />
