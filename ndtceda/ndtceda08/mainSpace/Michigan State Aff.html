Hate crimes<br />
<strong>Post September 11th, hate crimes have increased. New legislation is necessary to send a symbolic message</strong><br />
<strong><u>Abel, 2k5</u></strong> (Jason, Associate, O'Melveny &amp; Myers LLP, Washington D.C. J.D., 2003, University of Pennsylvania Law School. 12 Asian L.J. 41. Lexis)<br />

<strong>Hate crimes are increasing</strong><br />
<strong><u>Lobe, 2k6</u></strong> (9/18. Jim, IPS correspondent. Lexis)<br />
<u>Complaints of discrimination,</u><br />
and<br />
sentiment among the general public here.<br />
<br />
<strong>Morrison is the key precedent that prevents hate crime legislation</strong><br />
<strong>Wethington</strong>, JD at University of Arkansas at Little Rock School of Law, <strong>2001</strong><br />
(Jennifer L., University of Arkansas at Little Rock Law Review, Winter, Lexis)<br />
<br />
<u>By invalidating the Civil Rights Remedy</u><br />
And<br />
After Morrison, Congress is powerless to set the national standard under the Commerce Clause.<br />
<br />
<strong>Even if the legislation is inadequate, <em>new</em> legislation sends a symbolic message that decreases crime</strong><br />
<strong><u>Beale, 2k</u></strong> (Sara Sun, Professor of Law, Duke. 80 B.U.L. Rev. 1227. Lexis)<br />
The previous section concludes that <strong><u>there may be</u></strong><br />
and<br />
reassuring symbolic pat on the back. 92<br />
<br />
<strong>Hate crimes are a form of slavery and racism – federal action is key</strong><br />
<strong><u>Abel, 2k5</u></strong> (Jason, Associate, O'Melveny &amp; Myers LLP, Washington D.C. J.D., 2003, University of Pennsylvania Law School. 12 Asian L.J. 41. Lexis)<br />
Cicero said, &quot;To be ignorant of the past is to remain as a child.&quot; 100<br />

<strong>Enacting hate crime legislation is necessary to break down racism</strong><br />
<strong><u>Abel, 2k5</u></strong> (Jason, Associate, O'Melveny &amp; Myers LLP, Washington D.C. J.D., 2003, University of Pennsylvania Law School. 12 Asian L.J. 41. Lexis)<br />
<u>Racism is a plague on this entire country,</u><br />
and<br />
Then, and only then, can we move forward as one America.<br />
<br />
<strong>You must reject each instance of racism.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Barndt, 91</u></strong> (Joseph, co-director of Crossroads, a ministry to dismantle racism, 1991, &quot;Dismantling Racism: The Continuing challenge to White America,&quot; p. 155-6.)<br />
To study racism is to study walls. We have looked at barriers and<br />
and<br />
For the sake of the world and ourselves, we dare not allow it to continue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tolerating hate crimes threatens human survival.</strong><br />
<strong>Selbin</strong>, JD Candidate at Harvard Law School, <strong>1993</strong><br />
(Jonathan David, Oregon Law Review, Spring, Lexis)<br />
State governments have an important, if not compelling, interest in preventing hate violence.<br />
And<br />
threats of violence and acts of vandalism. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=336871e562119835ca586c9a97fe80fc&amp;docnum=8&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAV&amp;_md5=7ee5ac64c220107218f4b8d0cbd03661&amp;focBudTerms=hate%20crime%2521%20w/15%20extinct%2521%20or%20survival%20or%20humanit" rel="nofollow">79</a> [*178]<br />

<strong>Hate crimes result in extinction</strong><br />
<u><strong>Jones, 2k3</strong></u> (Christopher Lee, BBA, University of Michigan. 29 T. Marshall L. Rev. 17. Lexis)<br />
Providing protection for &quot;difference&quot; and against &quot;hate crimes&quot; are not mutually exclusive endeavors.<br />

First, the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Morrison represented the pinnacle of its attempt to curtail federal power – Morrison went beyond the Lopez precedent to undermine the Rational Basis test and prior precedent on the Commerce Clause.<br />
Howard, Journal staff and currently attorney at law, 2001<br />
(Ambre, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy and the Law, Lexis)<br />
<br />
Nowhere has the curtailment of congressional Commerce Clause … It seems that Congress would have to demonstrate that the particular problem exists in every state,<br />
<br />
Second, Morrison is still the key precedent on the books – decisions such as Raich have not eliminated its significance.<br />
Barnett, Professor at Boston University School of Law, 2005<br />
(Randy E., Lewis and Clark Law Review, Winter, Lexis)<br />
<br />
Raich looms large now … to leave in place<br />
Third, the next case is key – Raich has not determined which test the Congress will use to interpret the Commerce Clause.<br />

Contention 1: Raich doesn’t solve our aff;<br />
<br />
Raich did not undermine the Commerce Clause- only a new move from the Court can cement the trend towards increased Congressional power.<br />
<br />
Kreit 06 Alex, clerk to Hon Michael 4th circuit US Court of Appeals, associate at MoFo, Rights, Rules, and Raich, West Virginia Law Review, Spring, 2006, 108 W. Va. L. Rev. 705)<br />
<br />
And, Raich was just a narrow exception to Morrison- as long as it is still on the books, courts will continue to apply Morrison as precedent to limit federal authority.<br />
<br />
Brown 05 (George, prof of law at Boston College, Counterrevolution?-National Criminal Law After Raich, Ohio State Law Journal, 2005, 66 Ohio St. L.J. 947)<br />
<br />
And, Raich cant send a signal away from federalism- it is perceived as a drugs case, not a federalism case.<br />
<br />
Parry 05 (John, prof of law at Pitt, BIOPOLITICS AND THE COMMERCE CLAUSE IN GONZALES V. RAICH, Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review, Winter, 2005, 9 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 853)<br />
<br />
And, Raich is a victory for New Federalism.<br />
<br />
Brown 05 (George, prof of law at Boston College, Counterrevolution?-National Criminal Law After Raich, Ohio State Law Journal, 2005, 66 Ohio St. L.J. 947)<br />
<br />
Thus the plan,<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule its holding in United States v. Morrison [529 U.S. 598] that Congress may not regulate noneconomic activity based solely on the conduct’s aggregate effect on interstate commerce.<br />
<br />
Contention 2- Federalism:<br />
<br />
In Morrison, the Supreme Court significantly curtailed federal authority- it went farther than Lopez.<br />
<br />
Howard 01 (Ambre, America U Journal Gender Social Policy and Law)<br />
<br />
Thus, reversing Morrison allows for unlimited Congressional authority.<br />
<br />
Zietlow 00 (Rebecca E., Associate Professor, University of Toledo College of Law, “BELONGING, PROTECTION AND EQUALITY: THE NEGLECTED CITIZENSHIP CLAUSE AND THE LIMITS OF FEDERALISM” University of Pittsburgh Law Review, Winter, (62 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 281)<br />

<br />
Khalilzad 04 (Zalmay, debate and fopo badass, Federal News Service, October 27, 2004)<br />

Thus the impacts,<br />
<br />
First, Federalism will cause neighboring states to interfere, accelerating disintegration.<br />
<br />

Thus the plan,<br />

The United States Supreme Court should overrule its holding in United States v. Morrison [529 U.S. 598] that Congress may not regulate noneconomic activity based solely on the conduct’s aggregate effect on interstate commerce.<br />

Another reason sometimes offered in support of…more publicly acceptable rule should actually increase public respect for the system<br />
<br />
<ol><li>Overturning decisions that forbade legislation increase the court’s legitimacy.</li></ol><br />
Rhenquist 86<br />
<br />
A recurring argument is that overrulking of precedent jeopardize the supreme court’s legitimacy…may be more popular than overrulings forbidding previously permissible action<br />
<br />

<br />
All MSU teams, except for MSU DR, are reading a version of the Morrison aff. These are all the advantages that teams will read initially – but not all teams will read all of the advantages.<br />
<br />
First, the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Morrison represented the pinnacle of its attempt to curtail federal power – Morrison went beyond the Lopez precedent to undermine the Rational Basis test and prior precedent on the Commerce Clause.<br />
Howard, Journal staff and currently attorney at law, 2001<br />
(Ambre, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy and the Law, Lexis)<br />
Nowhere has the curtailment of congressional Commerce Clause … It seems that Congress would have to demonstrate that the particular problem exists in every state,<br />
<br />
Second, Morrison is still the key precedent on the books – decisions such as Raich have not eliminated its significance.<br />
Barnett, Professor at Boston University School of Law, 2005<br />
(Randy E., Lewis and Clark Law Review, Winter, Lexis)<br />
Raich looms large now … to leave in place<br />
<br />
Third, the next case is key – Raich has not determined which test the Congress will use to interpret the Commerce Clause.<br />
Harper, law review at Mercer University Law School, 2006<br />
(Laura W., Mercer Law Review, Summer, Lexis, NOTE: This is the conclusion of this article)<br />
The Court's decision in Raich … in certain instances.<br />
<br />
No clear federalism precedent exists – next case key<br />
Strang, marshall law review, 2006<br />
“the minority in raich forgeited a chance” … “raich with lopez and Morrison”<br />
<br />
The Court’s federalism fears in Morrison were incoherent - The Violence Against Women Act was the result of extensive federal-state cooperation.<br />
Goldfarb, Associate Professor of Law at Rutgers University School of Law, 2002<br />
(Sally F., Fordham Law Review, October, Lexis)<br />
The states are not … acknowledged national problem.&quot; 190<br />
<br />
The result of the Court’s decision has to establish a precedent against cooperative federalism – overturning Morrison is critical to establish a more productive precedent.<br />
Goldfarb, Associate Professor of Law at Rutgers University School of Law, 2002<br />
(Sally F., Fordham Law Review, October, Lexis)<br />
cooperative rights federalism … the states' interest in autonomy and individuals' right to equality<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision was too narrowly focused on a state’s rights conception of federalism<br />
Goldfarb, 02 (same cite as above)<br />
“despite the majority’s pervasive” … “for cooperative rights federalism”<br />
<br />
Federal preemption is bad – we’ll defend that cooperative federalism establishes an effective middle ground between preemption and state rights<br />
Weiser, 2001 North Carolina law review<br />
“the rhetoric of a “duel federalism” characterizes” … “to delegate regulatory authority to the states”<br />
<br />
This precedent is crucial – US federalism gets modeled internationally.<br />
Waldron, Professor of Law at Columbia University, 1998<br />
(Jeremy, Columbia Human Rights Law Review, Summer, Lexis,<br />
Note: The Professor Black he is citing is Charles Black, Professor at Yale Law School)<br />
wants us to view the American rights tradition as something which …<br />
in which we have embodied a commitment to human rights in the foundations of our system of government.<br />
<br />
First, global democracy: Morrison’s rejection of cooperative federalism makes reaching political agreements impossible – causes democratic deficits and poverty.<br />
Aman, Professor of Law, Indiana University School of Law and Director, Institute for Advanced Study, Indiana University, 2004<br />
(Alfred C. Jr., Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies, pp.114-115)<br />
Consider, for instance, the Court's invalidation of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) …<br />
The principles of federalism, carried too far, can exacerbate the most significant externalities of globalization: democracy deficits and poverty.<br />
<br />
And, you can’t win any offense – excessively privileging local levels destroys democracy.<br />

Turn – court confusion<br />
a.) leaving Morrison on the books creates confusion as to what<br />
precedent lower courts should follow.<br />

Tennessee Law Review, Spring, Lexis)<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of the trouble… and inconsistent results.&quot;<br />
<br />
b.) the cp only makes it worse – implicit overruling doesn't tell the<br />
courts which precedent to follow – prevents a clear signal in favor of<br />
cooperative federalism.<br />
<br />

First, global democracy: Morrison’s rejection of cooperative federalism makes reaching political agreements impossible – causes democratic deficits and poverty.<br />
Aman, Professor of Law, Indiana University School of Law and Director, Institute for Advanced Study, Indiana University, 2004<br />
(Alfred C. Jr., Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies, pp.114-115)<br />
Consider, for instance, the Court's invalidation of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) …<br />
The principles of federalism, carried too far, can exacerbate the most significant externalities of globalization: democracy deficits and poverty.<br />

And, you can’t win any offense – excessively privileging local levels destroys democracy.<br />
