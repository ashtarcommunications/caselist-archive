Affirmative Plan<br />
The United States Supreme Court should affirm a federal civil rights remedy for domestic violence by overruling the U.S. vs. Morrison (529 U.S. 598) decision in holding that gendered violence regardless of the biological sex or sexual orientation of the parties has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.<br />
<br />

Observation I: Status Quo Race Theory<br />
<br />
Legal applications of desegregation efforts are rooted in the dominant racial paradigm of the status quo where discourse is reduced to black versus white, excluding the plight of other minorities and ignoring other ways in which discrimination functions in society.<br />
Luna, 2003 [Eduardo, J.D. at Berkeley School of Law U of California, LA RAZA LAW JOURNAL, Vol. 14, Issue 2, p. 225-253]<br />
<br />
Ameliorating the segregation …and present experiences.”<br />
<br />
Specifically, Milliken’s holding of intent to discriminate omitted any discussion of the unique needs of Latino/a’s, reaffirming this paradigm.<br />
Rachel Moran, Professor of Law, Berkeley, CONNECTICUT LAW REVIEW, Spring 1997 29:1079 p.ln<br />
<br />
In contrast to African Americans, … disadvantaged are African-American.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the paradigm is unsustainable – skin color is not the primary axis of discrimination in the status quo.<br />
Alcoff, 2003 [Linda Martin, Dept. of Philosophy, Syracuse University, The Journal of Ethics 7:5-27]<br />
<br />
Thus my last argument … characteristics as static..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Moreover, within the black/white binary, white supremacy uses other marginalized racial groups to reinforce each others negatively constructed identity and fracture potential coalitions.<br />
Arriola, 1997 [Elvia R., Assistant Professor of Law, University of Texas – Austin, University of Miami Inter-Am Law Review, Volume 28, Latcrit Theory, International Human Rights, Popular Culture, and the Faces of Despair in INS Raids]<br />
<br />
Latinas/os and LatCrit … before the<br />
<br />
Acknowledging race as an … and other groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the U.S. black-white paradigm is exported internationally.<br />
Bourdieu, 1999 [Pierre, professor of sociology at College De France, and Loic Wacquant, Associate Professor at Berkeley, THEORY, CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY 1999 16(1) p 41-58]<br />
<br />
To turn to a domain … the ‘American model.’<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, the black-white binary is unsustainable - by society’s failure to recognize alternative and different types of oppression, the paradigm blocks effective solutions towards solving the discrimination exhibited to many groups in America.<br />
Yzaguirre and Kamaski, 1997 [Raul &amp; Charles, President and Senior Vice President of the National Council of La Raza, THE LATINO CIVIL RIGHTS CRISIS, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/latino97/latino97.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/latino97/latino97.php</a>]<br />
<br />
We believe, in short that … discrimination against Latinos.<br />
<br />
Observation II: The Impacts<br />
<br />
Foremost, the Black-White paradigm shapes our understanding of racism in judicial decision making by sub Law, University of Texas – Austin, University of Miami Inter-Am Law Review, Volume 28, Latcrit Theory, International Human Rights, Popular Culture, and the Faces of Despair in INS Raids]<br />
<br />
Latinas/os are indeterminately … and judicial decisionmaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Black-White binary reinforces white supremacy in America by falsely representing its realities; opening a new framework for racial discussion is necessary in moving away from oppositionality and towards pluralism.<br />
Alcoff, 2003 [Linda Martin, Dept. of Philosophy, Syracuse University, The Journal of Ethics 7:5-27]<br />
<br />
Thus, thinking … and differences can occur).<br />
Also, the paradigm supports other hierarchies through the production of white supremacy.<br />
Ross, 1995 [Loretta, veteran civil rights and feminist organizer, Program Research Director, Center for Democratic Renewal, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.publiceye.org/eyes/whitsup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.publiceye.org/eyes/whitsup.html</a>]<br />

The fact that race … and religious fundamentalism.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, White Supremacy in the United States threatens the survival В the Faces of Despair in INS Raids]<br />
<br />
The foundational structure…supremacy in the United States.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, the call for school desegregation is a necessary part of breaking down larger structures of discrimination in society.<br />

COMMENTS:<br />
<br />
Need offense and defense from 1nr<br />
Fucked up – you still get to weigh consequences, should’ve gone for cp/da<br />
Just go for the kritik – it’s kind of fucked up<br />
Restructure disad to be not unique<br />
Assert that there could be this in the future<br />
Say “we don’t know what the future looks like” – 9/11, etc. – we can’t predict anything into the future<br />
Explain framework as “fuck the future, it’s about the now”<br />
Be generic<br />
It would be OK in 2nr to shirk framework, go for disad and just explain it in very basic terms<br />

JUDGE: ELIZABETH WILEY<br />
<br />
Contention One: Inherency<br />
<br />
In US v Morrison, the Court ignored congressional findings linking domestic violence to commerce – stripping the nation of a national civil rights remedy for domestic violence<br />
<br />
American Civil Liberties Union, June 2006, “Dimming the Beacon of<br />
Freedom: U.S. Violations of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights”, Prepared for the United Nations Human Rights Committee on the occasion of its review of ‘The United States of America’s Second and Third Periodic Report to the UN Committee on Human Rights Concerning the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights’, p. 25-26, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/iccprreport20060620.pdf#search=%22%22violence%20" rel="nofollow">http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/iccprreport20060620.pdf#search=%22%22violence%20</a><br />

The rollback in civil rights protections has specific ramifications for<br />
women….without uniform federal legislation, many victims remain<br />
unprotected.<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Violence<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Domestic Violence<br />
<br />
Initially note that every year 2,000 to 4,000 women die from domestic abuse – in America alone, and 75% of Women will be the victims of some form of abuse<br />
<br />
Adrienne J. Vaughan, Associate @ the Law Offices of Richard M. Costa, Fall 2000, “The Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act as Litigated in United States V. Morrison: The Supreme Court's Sacrificial Lamb to Reinforce United States V. Lopez”, Hamline Law Review, 24 Hamline L. Rev. 163, p. L/N<br />
More women in Minnesota have been killed in domestic crimes this year than….provided a perfect opportunity to reinforce the Congressional boundaries set forth in Lopez. n20<br />
<br />
Domestic violence affects all women, relegating women to a life of fear<br />
<br />
Senator William S. Cohen, Senator from Maine (R), 12-12-93, “Violence Against Women: Fighting the Fear”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/vawa/doc7.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/vawa/doc7.htm</a>, ACC: 9.13.06, p. online<br />
Women who seek protection from abuse often face a judicial…friends and<br />
neighbors and coworkers who are being victimized as well.<br />
<br />
Additionally note that males are victims of domestic violence every 38 seconds – at the end of this round another 135 men will become victims<br />
<br />
Vince Imhoff, Esq., Managing Partner of Imhoff &amp; Associates, P.C., 3-1-05, “Domestic Violence: Male Victims”,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.criminalattorney.com/pages/firm_articles_dom_vio_innocent.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.criminalattorney.com/pages/firm_articles_dom_vio_innocent.htm</a>, ACC: 9.12.06, p. online<br />
In recent years, male victims of domestic violence constitute an … to<br />
male victims and failed to mention any violence by women against men.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the Civil Rights Remedy was necessary to empowering victims by ending local inaction and making domestic violence a civil rights issue<br />
<br />
Sarah F. Russell, Connecticut Federal Defender (Domestic Violence), 2003, “Covering Women and Violence: Media Treatment of VAWA's Civil Rights Remedy”, Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law, 9 Mich. J. Gender &amp; L. 327, p. L/N<br />
In 1994, as part of the Violence Against Women Act, Congress enacted…women and the problems that victims of this violence faced in state legal systems.<br />
<br />
And, Sexual violence is a form of social control where the perpetrator dooms the victim to “social death”<br />
<br />
Peter Gordon, Professor @ the University of Southern California, and Kate Crehan, Professor of Gender Studies @ the University of New York, 2000, “Dying of Sadness: Gender, Sexual Violence, and the HIV epidemic”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.undp.org/hiv/publications/gender/violencee.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.undp.org/hiv/publications/gender/violencee.htm</a>,<br />
ACC: 9.2.06, p. online<br />
Attempts to explain sexual violence in terms of nature, biology or evolutio…can include rejection, &quot;social death&quot; and further violence.<br />
<br />
We have an obligation to stop violence against women – it robs them of their right to life<br />
<br />
Amnesty International, 2006, “Domestic Violence”,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/women/violence/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amnestyusa.org/women/violence/</a>, ACC: 9.13.06, p. online<br />
Violence against women is a global…their obligation to protect women<br />
from torture.<br />
<br />
Torture is the ultimate form of dehumanization<br />
Elaine Scarry, Harvard English Professor, 1985, The Body in Pain<br />
Pablo Ibbieta’s experience in “The Wall” is close to if not<br />
identical…infliction of physical pain is always a mock execution.<br />
<br />
Systemic violence against women creates a regime of political domination tantamount to interstate war<br />
Amy Ray, US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 2-1997 American University Law Review<br />
Because, as currently constructed, human rights laws can reach only individual perpetrators during times of war… violence occurred inside a bedroom, on the streets of the city, or in a concentration camp in a foreign country.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advance Two: Identity Hierarchies<br />
<br />
The Civil Rights Remedy was necessary to shatter binaries by describing gendered violence as sexual discrimination against gender identity<br />
<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law @ the<br />
University of Michigan Law School, and long-term visitor @ the University of Chicago Law School, Signed the Brief of Law Professors as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioners, Morrison, 120 S. Ct. 1740 (2000) (Nos. 99-5, 99-29), November 2000, “The Supreme Court, 1999 Term Comment: Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison”, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. L/N<br />
Congress further perceived that the body of law that had pervasively … alter perpetrators' behavior and to value and restore survivors.<br />
<br />
And, Discussing sexual identity related violence in the context of domestic violence breaks down sexual-gender binaries<br />
<br />
Adele Morrison, Professor of Law @ Northern Illinois University College of Law, Fall 2003, “Article: Queering Domestic Violence to &quot;Straighten Out&quot; Criminal Law: What Might Happen When Queer Theory and Practice Meet Criminal Law's Conventional Responses to Domestic Violence”, Southern California Review of Law and Women's Studies, 13 S. Cal. Rev. L. &amp; Women's Stud. 81, p. L/N<br />
Intimate partner abuse within LGBT communities has given rise …. a<br />
misunderstanding of gender and its construction.<br />
<br />
Next, Morrison was a grave defeat for domestic violence victims – the court told them to “go home,” “go back to the private realm,” where they would be further abused<br />
<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law @ the University of Michigan Law School, and long-term visitor @ the University of Chicago Law School, Signed the Brief of Law Professors as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioners, Morrison, 120 S. Ct. 1740 (2000) (Nos. 99-5, 99-29), November 2000, “The Supreme Court, 1999 Term Comment: Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison”, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. L/N<br />
It is in light of this concrete and urgent need that the Morrison outcome…the power to dispute male sovereignty in women's hands.<br />
<br />
Additionally, The Court’s ruling in Morrison showcased their intent to continue upholding sexual inequality and inattention toward domestic violence<br />
<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law @ the University of Michigan Law School, and long-term visitor @ the University of Chicago Law School, Signed the Brief of Law Professors as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioners, Morrison, 120 S. Ct. 1740 (2000) (Nos. 99-5, 99-29), November 2000, “The Supreme Court, 1999 Term Comment: Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison”, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. L/N<br />
Instead, the Morrison majority revived a long discredited tradition … factual record of systemic gender-based inequality before the Court.<br />
<br />
Binaries are the root cause of oppressive identity hierarchies<br />
<br />
Meredith Render, Professor of Law @ the University of Maryland, Winter<br />
2006, “Misogyny, Androgyny, and Sexual Harassment: Sex Discrimination in a Gender-Deconstructed World”, Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender, 29 Harv. J.L. &amp; Gender 99, p. L/N<br />
However, at their intersection, (particularly postmodern) feminist and… &quot;person,&quot; rather than &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; manifestations.<br />
<br />
Finally, heterosexism is the binary we must deconstruct before we can successfully interrogate other hierarchies<br />
<br />
V. Spike Peterson, Professor, University of Arizona, Political Science, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 1:1 June 1999, p.55<br />
Between heterosexist groups, the dominant empirical register of hierarchy/oppression …historically constructed ‘difference’ we most need to see – and to deconstruct.<br />
<br />
Hierarchies of domination create us-them dichotomies which reproduce war and threaten our survival<br />
<br />
Dr. Jill Steans, Senior Lecturer in International Relations Theory @ the University of Birmingham, 1998, Gender and International Relations: An Introduction, p. 102-103<br />
In this view, not only is war part of women’s daily existence, but war,… political community and security and feminist ‘revisions’ are the subject of chapter 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hence the plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should affirm a federal civil rights<br />
remedy for domestic violence by overruling the U.S. v. Morrison (529 U.S. 598) decision in holding that gendered violence regardless of the biological sex or sexual orientation of the parties has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.<br />
<br />
Contention Three: Solvency<br />
<br />
Initially note, using the Commerce Clause to end domestic violence sends a strong signal of respect for domestic violence victims<br />

Observation I: Status Quo Race Theory<br />
<br />
Legal applications of desegregation efforts are rooted in the dominant racial paradigm of the status quo where discourse is reduced to black versus white, excluding the plight of other minorities and ignoring other ways in which discrimination functions in society.<br />
Luna, 2003 [Eduardo, J.D. at Berkeley School of Law U of California, LA RAZA LAW JOURNAL, Vol. 14, Issue 2, p. 225-253]<br />
<br />
Ameliorating the segregation …and present experiences.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Specifically, Milliken’s holding of intent to discriminate omitted any discussion of the unique needs of Latino/a’s, reaffirming this paradigm.<br />
Rachel Moran, Professor of Law, Berkeley, CONNECTICUT LAW REVIEW, Spring 1997 29:1079 p.ln<br />
<br />
In contrast to African Americans, … disadvantaged are African-American.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the paradigm is unsustainable – skin color is not the primary axis of discrimination in the status quo.<br />
Alcoff, 2003 [Linda Martin, Dept. of Philosophy, Syracuse University, The Journal of Ethics 7:5-27]<br />
<br />
Thus my last argument … characteristics as static..<br />
<br />
<br />
Moreover, within the black/white binary, white supremacy uses other marginalized racial groups to reinforce each others negatively constructed identity and fracture potential coalitions.<br />
Arriola, 1997 [Elvia R., Assistant Professor of Law, University of Texas – Austin, University of Miami Inter-Am Law Review, Volume 28, Latcrit Theory, International Human Rights, Popular Culture, and the Faces of Despair in INS Raids]<br />
<br />
Latinas/os and LatCrit … before these even have been assembled.<br />
<br />
<br />
And acknowledging racialization of Latina/os is consistent with recognizing differences within the defined group itself and other marginalized non-black/white groups. Overarching terminology is inevitable, but social construction is what matters.<br />
Arriola, 1997 [Elvia R., Assistant Professor of Law, University of Texas – Austin, University of Miami Inter-Am Law Review, Volume 28, Latcrit Theory, International Human Rights, Popular Culture, and the Faces of Despair in INS Raids]<br />
<br />
Acknowledging race as an … and other groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the U.S. black-white paradigm is exported internationally.<br />
Bourdieu, 1999 [Pierre, professor of sociology at College De France, and Loic Wacquant, Associate Professor at Berkeley, THEORY, CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY 1999 16(1) p 41-58]<br />
<br />
To turn to a domain … the ‘American model.’<br />
<br />
Finally, the black-white binary is unsustainable - by society’s failure to recognize alternative and different types of oppression, the paradigm blocks effective solutions towards solving the discrimination exhibited to many groups in America.<br />
Yzaguirre and Kamaski, 1997 [Raul &amp; Charles, President and Senior Vice President of the National Council of La Raza, THE LATINO CIVIL RIGHTS CRISIS, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/latino97/latino97.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/latino97/latino97.php</a>]<br />
<br />
We believe, in short that … discrimination against Latinos.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation II: The Impacts<br />
<br />
Foremost, the Black-White paradigm shapes our understanding of racism in judicial decision making by subordinating other people of color into the rigid categories it establishes. This excludes the unique experiences of other marginalized groups in society and therefore denies them space within racial discourse.<br />
Arriola, 1997 [Elvia R., Assistant Professor of Law, University of Texas – Austin, University of Miami Inter-Am Law Review, Volume 28, Latcrit Theory, International Human Rights, Popular Culture, and the Faces of Despair in INS Raids]<br />
<br />
Latinas/os are indeterminately … and judicial decisionmaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Black-White binary reinforces white supremacy in America by falsely representing its realities; opening a new framework for racial discussion is necessary in moving away from oppositionality and towards pluralism.<br />
Alcoff, 2003 [Linda Martin, Dept. of Philosophy, Syracuse University, The Journal of Ethics 7:5-27]<br />
<br />
Thus, thinking … and differences can occur).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, the paradigm supports other hierarchies through the production of white supremacy.<br />
Ross, 1995 [Loretta, veteran civil rights and feminist organizer, Program Research Director, Center for Democratic Renewal, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.publiceye.org/eyes/whitsup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.publiceye.org/eyes/whitsup.html</a>]<br />
<br />
The fact that race … and religious fundamentalism.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, White Supremacy in the United States threatens the survival of the planet.<br />
Henderson, 1995 [Errol Anthony, Assistant Professor of Political Science and International relatinions, University of Florida, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www/" rel="nofollow">http://www</a>. Nbufront.org/html/FRONTalView/BookExcerpts/EAH1.html]<br />
<br />
During this century… planet itself.<br />
<br />
Finally, racial segregation policies throughout the world have lead to unimaginable costs of war, genocide, and oppression.<br />
Levit, 2005 [Nancy, Professor Law UMKC, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW, 2005:455 p.ln]<br />
<br />
The international …, and Nazi Germany.<br />
<br />
Hence the plan: We stand resolved that the United States Supreme Court should overrule the Milliken v. Bradley decision, using Sheff v. O’Neill as a guide, by reversing the holding requiring intentional discrimination to be proven for courts to order desegregation plans.<br />
<br />
Observation III: Call of the 1AC<br />
<br />
Racial identification in order to investigate the Latina/o experience transforms societies perception of equal protection jurisprudence and future antidiscrimination law.<br />
Arriola, 1997 [Elvia R., Assistant Professor of Law, University of Texas – Austin, University of Miami Inter-Am Law Review, Volume 28, Latcrit Theory, International Human Rights, Popular Culture, and the Faces of Despair in INS Raids]<br />
<br />
Much of critical race … and antidiscrimination law.<br />
<br />
Moreover, broader understanding of racial identity combats subordination throughout society.<br />
Arriola, 1997 [Elvia R., Assistant Professor of Law, University of Texas – Austin, University of Miami Inter-Am Law Review, Volume 28, Latcrit Theory, International Human Rights, Popular Culture, and the Faces of Despair in INS Raids]<br />
<br />
Self-identification for many …and their interrelatedness.<br />
<br />
And including experiences outside of black/white discourse is key to creating a framework that renders other people of color as targets of racism and discrimination.<br />
Arriola, 1997 [Elvia R., Assistant Professor of Law, University of Texas – Austin, University of Miami Inter-Am Law Review, Volume 28, Latcrit Theory, International Human Rights, Popular Culture, and the Faces of Despair in INS Raids]<br />

Feminist scholars have long recognized sexual violence as a tool used…deserves much more attention than it has traditionally received.<br />

Systemic violence against women creates a regime of political domination tantamount to<br />

Review<br />
<br />
Because, as currently constructed, human rights laws can reach only individual<br />
perpetrators during times of war… violence occurred inside a bedroom, on the streets of<br />
the city, or in a concentration camp in a foreign country.<br />

The Civil Rights Remedy was necessary to shatter binaries by describing gendered<br />

In this view, not only is war part of women’s daily existence, but war, … political<br />
community and security and feminist ‘revisions’ are the subject of chapter 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hence the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should affirm a federal civil rights remedy for domestic<br />
violence by overruling the U.S. v. Morrison (529 U.S. 598) decision in holding that<br />
gendered violence regardless of the biological sex or sexual orientation of the parties has<br />
a substantial effect on interstate commerce.<br />

Contention Three: Solvency<br />

of respect for domestic violence victims<br />

Finally, Civil remedies are a crucial supplement to criminal laws – domestic violence is<br />
