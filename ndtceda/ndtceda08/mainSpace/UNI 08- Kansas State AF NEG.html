Notes: flat out refuse to defend an impact, an alternative, or any action, say the act of asking about these things are what they are critiquing. Say they may or may not even be making arguments, don’t specify the agent of the alt or what the alt actually does. – 1NC has some (not a lot) performance and demonstrations about who the subject and object is, pound on the table, discuss the hand as a hammer- in the 2AC overview they say that their alternative is to play in the fields that the aff discusses.<br />
Are comfortable using sexed language and fuck- do this regularily<br />

<strong><u>One off hiedegger K</u></strong> <br />
<u>The notion that one environmental situation indicates another in which we must either have concern for, or attempt to harness the usefulness of, fixates upon and challenges nature forth into infinite presence, something present at hand for theoretical calculation and scientific objection- this denies us the ability to embrace the world outside the singular framework of stock in which being can only remain eclipsed</u> <br />
Foltz ’95 (bruce v. inhabiting the earth, 1995 p 26-7)<br />
It may be asked … possibly assume<br />
<br />
<u>The scientific principles of ecology and the management of environmental crisis depend upon the role of the “expert” in providing intellectual machinery for the production of political resources. This concern with echological crisis is part of the larger ‘regulatory biopolitics of the population’ that expands through new environmental techniques of ecological governmentality</u> <br />
Rutherford ’99 (paul, discourses of the environment p37-8)<br />
Modern thinking about … ‘ecological governmentality’<br />
<br />
<u>Deploying notions of “deficiency in order to address some further environmental concern employs entities as mere tools for proper production. When we claim that there is a problem with a certain “corner stone” species in an effort to secure plan passage, we begin to think such beings in term of production alone. We must always demand these entities remain infinity present at hand for our inspection and manipulation, nothing more than resources at our disposal – all other potentialities obscured under the role of enframing</u> <br />
Foltz ’95 (bruce v. inhabiting the earth, 1995 p 29-30)<br />
“being in the world … readiness to hand”<br />
<br />
<u>With risk becoming an addition to material labor and capital the removal of subsidies is but a shallow attempt to climb out of the insurance racket that the subsidies have placed us in. Unfortunately, the so-called free market will only commodify the new exposure to contingency, trading with it, our space for being</u> <br />
Dillon ’08 (underwriting security, sdi.sagepub.com/cgi/consent/abstract/39/2-3/309 )  <br />
“the capitalization associated with … managerial account”<br />
<br />
<u>Politics operate as a violent imposition of a program on being through systematic attempts to order and manage the world. Only the radical departure from this system can allow for the relevation of politics that come to us, destroying the violent imposition of the subjective will</u> <br />
Geiman ’01 (clare pearson geiman, “heidegger’s antigones“ a companion to Heidegger’s introduction to metaphysics) <br />
“what Heidegger is … just such a move”<br />
<br />
<u>Relating to nature in terms of its economic values participates in the economy of objectifying subjectivism</u><br />
Pardrutt ’92 (Heidegger and the earth, McWhorter, pp27)<br />
“just as problematic … “qualitiative growth”<br />
<br />
<u>The notion of an economic crisis as an event to be prevented ignores the everyday misery that our worldwide system of capital perpetuates. This mindset entrenches the docile masses into further biopolitical control</u><br />
Agamben ’00 (means without end p133-4)<br />
“nothing is more … human misery”<br />
<br />
<u>The entire foundation of agriculture is based on technology, which gives rise to the biopolitical power of the sovereign- production practices are based on tech</u> <br />
Athanasiu ’03 (technologies of humanness, aprias of biopolitics, and the cut body of humanity <em>differences: a journal of a feminist cultural studies</em> 14.1 (03) <br />
“my theme here … theorizing at the limit” <br />
<span style="text-decoration: none"> </span><br />
<u>The age of protest is dead; we must live in the whatever singularity</u> <br />
Agamben ’00 (means without end p88)<br />
“for this reason … simply nonexistent”<br />
<br />
<u>Releasement offers us the foundation to dwell in the world and endure technology without being periled by it</u>  <br />
Kockelmans ’85 (joseph, Hiedegger and science p254)<br />
As hiedegger sees it, Gelassenheit in regard to beings and openness to the mystery belong together. By means of them, through can grant us in principle the possibility of dwelling in the world in a new way. They promise us a new foundation upon which we can stand and from which we can endure in the world of technicity without being periled by it. <br />

<strong><u>Block extentions</u></strong> <br />
<u>Releasement doesn’t preclude the possibility for action, but rather just the opposite- the alternatives advocacy of “letting be” entales a participation in the world that refuses to embrace indifference or neglect</u> <br />
Thiele (leslie paul, Timely mediations p183)<br />
<br />
<u>Saving humanity for nuclear apocalypse means nothing if we are separated from our being- because as we find ourselves separated from who we are we become the walking dead</u> <br />
Fandozzi ’82 (phillip, nihilism and technology: a heideggerian investigation, p. 74)<br />
For Heidegger … explored and controlled<br />
<br />
<u>The creation of humanity as calculable leads to viewing humans as currency and some as more valuable than others this is what creates the worst atrocities</u> <br />
Dillon ’99 (political theory p 165)<br />
“economies of evalutation necessity …whatever exceeds measure”<br />
<u>Using technology via the state apparatus causes new aberrations of biopolitics, which ensure a future full of rape, violence and genocide</u> <br />
Athanasiou ’03 (technologies of humanness, aprias of biopolitics, and the cut body of humanity <em>differences: a journal of a feminist cultural studies</em> 14.1 (03)<br />
“the challenge … of the name”<br />
<br />
<u>Releasement exists beyond the distinction between subject object action inaction, all other metaphysical dualisms. This renouncement of will is simply being resolved allows for a re-evaluation of being outside of the domain of calculation, the will and metaphysics – where thinking is able to take place</u> <br />
Zimmerman ’81 (Eclipse of the self: the development of heidegger’s concept of authenticity, pp 245-248)<br />
“under the domination … god of creation”<br />

Dillon ’08 (underwriting security, sdi.sagepub.com/cgi/consent/abstract/39/2-3/309 )<br />
