In August of 1982 the United States established an agreement with the PLO, which deployed a peacekeeping force to ensure a reasonable end to the conflict between Lebanon, Syria, and Israel while simultaneously ensuring the protection of refugees from each nation. This politics, while beginning with good intentions, soon met with devastating results as the US Marines were gunned down in the “disaster of Beirut.” In the end, this representation cemented the American commitment to a form of hegemonic imperialism aimed at securing the world against Islamic terrorism.<br />

<br />
The result of this supposed disaster was the presentation of Islam itself as a threat significant enough to warrant numerable wars and human rights violations.<br />
Edward Said, Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, “Irangate: A Many-Sided Crisis,” Journal of Palestine Studies, Volume 16, Number 4, Summer, 1987, pg. 30—31<br />
<br />
Moreover, the story of “disaster in Beirut” has been overshadowed by the narrative of September 11th. Yet, the characters in this new tale remain the same. Underlying our unwillingness to confront our own capacity for violence and atrocity is a reluctance to see ourselves as vulnerable. The product of this structure is the devaluation of otherness to the point of nothing.<br />
Judith Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, 2004, pg. 5-7<br />
<br />
This repression of vulnerability provides a smooth historical explanation for the need to be violent aimed at the compulsive elimination of any hint of weakness. This strategy of approaching injury and pain cements a community in a hostile relation to exteriority. Hence, the politics of fear and loathing.<br />
Peter A. Petrakis associate professor of political Southeastern Louisana University,“Eric Voegelin and Paul Ricoeur on Memory and History” 2006, pg. Ask Meredith<br />
<br />
These events have come to historically constitute American identity. Rather than being guided through vulnerability the United States produced a form of ahistoric patriotism that vibrantly employes warfighting and violence to achieve its aims. This mentality still pervades contemporary thinking about our relationship to the world and reflects an unwillingness to challenge the most basic presuppositions concerning our own superiority over Islam and terrorism. Reopening dialogue and debate undermines these constructs, which have governed our national experience of joy and pain for generations.<br />
Edward Said, Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, “Irangate: A Many-Sided Crisis,” Journal of Palestine Studies, Volume 16, Number 4, Summer, 1987, pg. 31-38<br />

The idea of warmaking as heroic and mythic endorses never-ending chaos and war. <br />

<br />
The lives that exist outside of these limited narratives of war, loss and revenge become simply unreal or unlivable. Written out of our frame of existence legitimizing unparalleled violence to extinguish the intelligibility of the Other.<br />
Judith Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, 2004, pg. 33-35<br />
<br />
This force spills over causing scapegoating, vicitimization, sacrificial politics, genocide, and even necessitates nuclear war because it promises a life without risk. <br />

Plan: the United States Federal Government will constructively engage with the government of Lebanon by substantially increasing foreign assistance for the expansion of public access to food, healthcare, and educational services.<br />
<br />
Foreign aid is the crucial ground for changing the practices of hegemonic politics. Lebanon currently receives guns not butter, reversing this trend, will challenge the politics of imperial imposition by deconstructing the link between Islam and terror.<br />
As’ad AbuKhalil, associate professor of political science at CSU-Stanislaus and research fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of California-Berkeley, “Lebanon: Key Battleground for Middle East Policy,” Foreign Policy in Focus, Volume 5, Number 2, February, 2000, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.irc-online.org/fpif/briefs/vol5/v5n02leb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irc-online.org/fpif/briefs/vol5/v5n02leb.html</a>, accessed 9/4/07<br />
<br />
Questions of justice in the war on terror requires us to examine issues of history and vulnerability. The current response of violence in response to violence can only beget more violence. In contrast, we should reach out and historicize our own vulnerability, the truth of our own lack of supremacy to challenge our desire for violence.<br />
Judith Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, 2004, pg. 17-18<br />
<br />
Letting ourselves experience vulnerability is essential to making the transition from violence to non-violence because it brings into question the precise basis of our fear and hatred of otherness. Only by adopting a politics of vulnerability can we escape the devastating condition of modernity.<br />
Judith Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, 2004, pg. 28-29
