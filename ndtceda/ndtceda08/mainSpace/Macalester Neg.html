<br />
The affirmative is a fundamental misreading of politics and the reproduction of social relations. The state and capital move hand in glove- one cannot exts without the other. Only a total distance from the modern state can allow for the destruction of capital. Otherwise what is pushed out the door only comes back in through the window.<br />
<br />
Meszaros 95 <u>Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition</u><br />
The modern state as the comprehensive political command structure of capital….reamining faithful to the Marxain concern with the eithering away of the state<br />
<br />
The absence of structural historicism is no mere oversight nor is it enough to simply mention economics in a few of your cards- the reliance of identity based politics is not an accidental instance of ignoring class. The deman arises out of the crisis of liberalism- such politics particularizes the oppressions of capitalism to the point that the universal system is naturalized. Attaining white, male bourgeoisse privilege becomes the bench mark of political success, re-entrecnching the very foundation of the system.<br />
<br />
Brown 1993 <u>Political Theory</u><br />
<br />
Although the detente between universal and particular within liberalism…identity through normalizing practices<br />
<br />
From the perspectice of structural K there can be no such thing as making things better their model of politics, no matter how subversive or conservative all fundamentally exaggerate the importance of the formal institution of politics and power, isnoring the ways such a system creates knowledge- only a Marxist shift to K the structure and create mass social consciousness will overcome this failure of politics<br />
<br />
Harnecker 00 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dsp.org.au/links/back/issue16/harnecker.html/wyo" rel="nofollow">www.dsp.org.au/links/back/issue16/harnecker.html/wyo</a><br />
<br />
To think about the construction of forces….only needs to be stirred up but as something that has to be built<br />
<br />
There is no such thing as an ethical action that stands outside of politics- your ethical demand to come prior to the structural negation of capital is the largest violation of ethics<br />
<br />
Mezaros 95<br />
Politics and morality are so closely intertwined…taking fully on board the painful lessons of the recent past<br />
<br />
Vote negative to validate and adopt the method of structural/histoirical criticism that is the 1NC. This is not the alternative, but in truth the only option- a radical socialist reimagination of politics is the only solution to the crisis of capital- institutional political action is the road to nowhere as capitalist intertial will destroy any radical component<br />
<br />
Meszaros 95<br />
<br />
If however the questioning remains….through which the realization of socialist economic aims 1st become feasible at all<br />

Not going for framework<br />
<br />
Case debate- total turn- calculation is inevitable-need the best solution- ontology is detrimental- analysis of calculation is new in the 1ar. Illogical- can calculate without capitalism- use socialism- calculations within capitalism are detrimental- not link into own arg. Doesn't answer Derrida- Derrida functions as a complete turn- their case becomes a complete barrier to what they’re trying to solve for.<br />

Prefer abuse standard<br />
In round abuse- spike out of stare decisis- we didn't understand- new articulation of plan screws- get rid of precedent<br />
<br />
Key to education and predictability<br />

Set up a standard for what a plan is- grant their standard of plan in a vacuum- define plan as everything on plan text- extra- topical on precedent argument<br />

Grounds are useless- shouldn't be forced to pic out to access grounds-<br />
