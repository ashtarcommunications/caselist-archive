Advantage Equality<br />
<br />
The state court system is gender biased, blocking court access to female victims of gender-motivated crimes.<br />

Without federal civil remedy, gender discrimination in the state courts will further victimize women<br />

The VAWA civil rights remedy is crucial for securing equality and protection of women’s rights.<br />
Goldfarb 2002, Sally F. Associate Professor of Law, Rutgers University School of Law-Camden, “The Supreme Court, The Violence Against Women Act, and the Use and Abuse of Federalism.” Fordham Law Review, P.57 October 2002<br />
<br />
Civil Litigation is the only way to make progress in solving for gender-motivated violence since it 1.) eliminates the possibility for defendants to invoke legal loopholes only afforded to them in criminal court and 2.) puts the control of the lawsit in the hands of the victim allowing them to obfuscate potentially-biased prosecutors.<br />
Goldfard 2000, Sally f. WVU Law Review. Spring 2000.”No civilized system of justive: The fate of violence against women act”<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s decision in the Morrison case is a perfect example of categorical federalism. By the Supreme Court granting family and crime issues solely to states, their extension of categorical feminism assumes this division of power to be natural, bipolar, and exclusive<br />
Resnik 2001, (Judith, Professor of Law. Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” Yale Law Journal, December 2001 l/n DOA: 9-16-06)<br />
<br />
The problem with such neat allocations of power is that it allows the government to conceal itself from responsibility. The court both hides its own responsibility in buffering away violence as not “national-enough.” The notion of categorical federalism is a way of hiding the way the courts have gendered family relations.<br />
Resnik 2001, (Judith, Professor of Law. Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” Yale Law Journal, December 2001 l/n DOA: 9-16-06)<br />
<br />
Categorical federalism undermines the ability to hold actors politically accountable for their decisions. The states exclusivity sets up a barrier to the process of social change. The states exclusivity sets up a barrier that prevents the process of social change. It is a way of deferring to legal concepts of jurisdiction instead of contesting patriarchal control.<br />

<br />
Morrison – commerce clause &amp; 14th Amend.<br />
<br />
Advantages:<br />
If a new affirmative is read or you hear a new advantage, you should get complete cites. Otherwise, just list the advantages that the affirmative claims.<br />
1. Inequality – MacKinnon ’05, must overrule Morrison to force out the inequality in the law &amp; this inequality founds &amp; permits a vicious cycle of violence against women<br />
2. Slavery – MacKinnion ’05 &amp; Peterson ’00 mostly – public/private dichotomy is the root cause of sexual discrimination … Then there’s a link drawn between slavery &amp; domestic abuse about fear of reprisal &amp; another having control over one’s mind and body such that victims don’t escape.<br />
<br />
2AC Answers to Offcase Arguments:<br />
List the affirmative's answers to each offcase argument read. Get cites for any arguments that you have not heard before or don't have answers to.<br />
States CP to enact Gendered Violence Act: MacKinnon ’05 national legislation is best – must get as much distance as possible from the private sphere as that is where women get power (the card says this, but is doesn’t actually say that Federal is less domestic than State, this is AFF’s interpretation).<br />
Extended lots of case args about Morrison key to legal inequality.<br />
