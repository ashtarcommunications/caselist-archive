The model that privileges cost/benefit analysis and opportunity costs is rooted in infrastructures which channels ethical objections into status quo institutions.<br />
BIRKELAND 1991 (Janis, An ecofeminist critique of Manstream planning, Trumpeter 8:2 (spring) pg 71-72)<br />
Traditionally Planning has generally… ultimately conflict generating.<br />
The production of risk enacts a system of organized irresponsibility that relies on obsolete political ideologies. The aff challenges the current epistemology of risk- it’s not sufficient to respond to risk as a purely material event.<br />
Anthony Elliott, Foundation Director of the Centre for Critical Theory at the University of the West of England, “Beck’s sociology of Risk: A Critical Assessment,” Sociology, Sociology, Vol. 36, No. 2, 2002<br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A/T Buyout CP<br />
Doesn’t solve production<br />
Daryll E. Ray, May 11 2005 (Western Farm Press “Why not a buyout program for all crops?”)<br />
Much of the paper… would continue unabated.<br />
Counterplan competition is a bad model for debating the production of risks. Even if they win it’s a superior policy option, it begs the question of how to make political calculations.<br />
First, organized irresponsibility. Judging the plan versus the CP hides the production of risks behind legal procedures and expert opinions to defer individual liability. Elliot says these deferrals are self-created dead ends for challenging politics. Only the aff solves the risk society by locating the politics of risk at the heart of decisionmaking.<br />
Second, information overload. You only need to evaluate the plan. The affirmative asks a question about action versus inaction. This ethical choice is the first question of the debate. The CP’s model of hypothesis testing requires infinitely more alternatives in order to maximize benefits and minimize costs. But infinite questioning leads t odeferral and inaction.<br />
The notion of counterplan competition is a Trojan Horse for precisely the type of decision-making the 1AC criticizes. It requires implicit acceptance of the possibility of pure objectivity.<br />
Edward Wayne Younkins, Philosophers of capitalism, 2005, p. 61-62<br />
Action is purposeful… exploitation of those opportunities.<br />
Perm- do both is the ultimate claim of responsibility since it embraces all strategies to improve the lives of cotton farmers.<br />
Justifications are important- the neg doesn’t challenge the risk society since it is justified in terms of the disad. This is a fear of preventing the worst that Beck says is incapable of challenging risk. Only actions like the aff try to make the world better instead of acting for fear.<br />
Conditional CPs don’t solve ethics- only the unconditional stance in affirmation demonstrates purpose in morality.<br />
Alan Gewirth, 1978 (Reason and Morality, p. 65)<br />
In the agent’s statement… in an unqualified way.</span><br />
