Since 2001 the United States has largely avoided hard trade-offs between security and development. With overall ODA levels rising, the administration could reward Pakistan, Jordan and other “GWOT” allies even as it got PEPFAR and MCA up and running. Nor is there any evidence through 2005 that core USAID aid resources have suffered from new strategic priorities. 20 But as a yawning budget deficit exerts downward pressure on spending, development accounts will become tempting targets. The administration’s FY07 budget, which calls for cuts in accounts for Development Assistance (-15%) and Child Survival and Health (- 13%) but a surge in Economic Support Funds (+23%) for strategic countries and International Narcotics and Law Enforcement funds (+69%), may signal the start of a troubling trend<br />

Thanks for the comment and question, Michael. I have not done the analysis of the data to see if the PMI is having a negative impact on the funding levels of other health initiatives-- and given all of the other changes in the US foreign assistance budget I am not sure it would ever be possible to isolate the impact of the PMI. However, during a recent CGD event, Congressman Kolbe talked at length about the future challenges in maintaining foreign assistance funding levels in light of increasing domestic federal expenditures. Mark Lippert, the Director of Foreign Policy for Senator Barak Obama also touched on this key issue at an April CGD event about the future of MCA. The message from each of these speakers was that funding levels for any particular initiative or priority should be looked at in the broader context-- and that the appropriations process is essentially a zero-sum game full of trade-offs. In today's tight budget climate, I think that there is no doubt that funding for the PMI and other new intiatives will detract from real or potential funding for other areas of the foreign aid budget-- and that that reality should be a part of the conversation about the successes and opportunities of the initiatives.<br />

Seeking to bolster Russia's influence in the Middle East, Vladimir Putin arrives in the United Arab Emirates today for the first visit by a Russian president to the Gulf Arab state. Boosting trade ties and promoting peace in the Middle East will be on the agenda of Putin's talks with Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahayan, president of the OPEC oil-exporter. The UAE state news agency called the visit a &quot;new phase of political and economic cooperation&quot;. Putin visited US allies Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan in February, in a tour that demonstrated Russia's desire to play a bigger diplomatic role in the Middle East troublespots of Iran, Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<br />

Emboldened by an economic boom and seeing an opening caused by Muslim anger at the United States, the Kremlin seems to be using the Middle East as a forum to reach with new confidence for an independent global role.<br />
<br />
Russia's deep interest in the region is also driven by economics and by hope that good relations with the Muslim world may cool any support for Russia's own Islamic insurgencies in and around Chechnya.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Middle East is one of their historic bastions of influence,&quot; said Clifford Kupchan of the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm in Washington. &quot;I think they see their old contacts and their history there as an opening for a resurgent Russia to return to the world stage.&quot;<br />

Canada currently has the opportunity to play a unique and significant role on the global<br />
stage in terms of conflict resolution, peace building and security operations. Canada<br />
has been an active member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) since it<br />
was founded in 1949, and its sixth largest contributor to the Alliance’s military and<br />
civil budgets. In Afghanistan, NATO leads the International Security Assistance Force<br />
(ISAF) mission, which is now in charge of providing security and stability to the whole<br />
of Afghanistan. Canada is one of the biggest contributors to this mission with more<br />
than 2,500 troops on the ground. Given its large contribution to the NATO-led ISAF<br />
mission in Afghanistan, Canada should take the opportunity to build on its current role<br />

Insecurity will worsen in insurgency-ridden Afghanistan, and democracy can fail if police are not reformed and depoliticised, according to an International Crisis Group report. The report examines the worsening violence in the country, whose police were overlooked in the early stages of the international intervention in favour of building the army. President Karzai’s government still lacks political will to tackle a culture of impunity and end political interference in appointments and operations, it observes.<br />

NATO troops deployed in Afghanistan have intercepted an Iranian arms shipment destined for the Taliban in what appears to be an escalating flow of weaponry between the two former enemies. The shipment was intercepted on September 6, according to officials from countries in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. It included armour-piercing bombs known as explosively formed projectiles, which have been especially deadly when used as roadside bombs against foreign troops in Iraq. The NATO-led force interdicted two smaller shipments of similar weapons from Iran into southern Helmand province on April 11 and May 3. This time, the arms were shipped into the western province of Farah, a vast but sparsely populated area, indicating an attempt to find routes less likely to be discovered. &quot;They're clearly trying to vary their routes and not get caught,&quot; a US official said. A senior Iranian official called the allegation baseless. &quot;We have no interest in instability in Iraq or Afghanistan,&quot; the official said. &quot;Why should we send weapons to the opposition?&quot; Iran has long opposed the Taliban. But their co-operation is based on common opposition to foreign troops in Afghanistan, according to officials in the international force. &quot;They're playing with the enemy,&quot; an official from one of the participating countries said. &quot;They have no love lost for the Taliban. The Taliban killed several Iranian diplomats. We believe it's about hurting the Americans and the international community.&quot;<br />

It doesn't make the headlines, but the capital of Afghanistan is being transformed from a city shattered by war to a thriving metropolis with a population of 2.5 million and growing. The catalyst for this boom is the aid money for reconstruction pouring into the country. But as you travel around the city, it’s obvious to see that many people here are also part of the economic upturn by setting up businesses to try to grab a share of the new prosperity.<br />

Most homeland security experts say that Hurricane Katrina's flooding of New Orleans shows how vulnerable we are to terrorists. In fact, it shows that most Americans have better things to worry about. By any statistical measure, the terrorist threat to America has always been low. As political scientist John Mueller notes, in most years allergic reactions to peanuts, deer in the road, and lightening have all killed about the same number of Americans as terrorism. In 2001, their banner year, terrorists killed one twelfth as many Americans as the flu and one fifteenth the number killed by car accidents. Most experts dismiss this history. They contend that because both weapons technology and Sunni extremism are spreading, the terrorist danger is ahistorical. But while both these trends are real, we should not leap to the conclusion that the threat is growing or greater than more mundane dangers. There is no obvious reason to believe that September 11 was the start of an era of ever deadlier terrorism, rather than its high-water mark.<br />

This argument does not endorse complacency among government officials.<br />
Even a small threat of nuclear terrorism should provoke a better organized<br />
non-proliferation policy than the United States now has. Nor does this argument<br />
imply that another terrorist massacre in America is unlikely. If enough people<br />
try, eventually some attack may well succeed. But attacks are likely to be rare<br />
and conventional, on the scale of the London attacks, not apocalyptic<br />
nightmares.<br />
Even if attacks killing thousands were certain, the risk to each of us<br />
would remain close to zero, far smaller than many larger risks that do not<br />
alarm us, or provoke government warnings, like driving to work every day. And<br />
if something far worse than Sept. 11 does occur, the country will recover.<br />
Every year, tens of thousands Americans die on the roads. Disease preys on us.<br />
Life goes on for the rest. The economy keeps chugging. A disaster of biblical<br />
proportions visited New Orleans. The Republic has not crumbled. The terrorist<br />
risk to the United States is serious, but far from existential, as some would<br />
have it.<br />

While it may be far from inconceivable that bin Laden's network may have the capability to create a dirty bomb, operating a nuclear program would be a Herculean challenge for an organization whose survival depends on its relative invisibility. Even fully-functioning states such as Pakistan have needed decades of research and the assistance of nuclear-capable allies to develop their bomb programs, and they haven't had to hide the extensive scientific and industrial infrastructure required to build nuclear weapons. And given that a dirty bomb's function is primarily to spread terror through contamination, terrorists may be inclined to view chemical and biological weapons as a more attractive investment.<br />

If before 9/11 their concerns about the threat posed by al-Qaeda sometimes fell on deaf ears or were at least greeted by scepticism in government that is surely no longer the case. When the intelligence community raises the alarm, government tends to listen these days. Since the &quot;war on terrorism&quot; began the agencies have also learned more about al-Qaeda from the interrogations of those captured - though that in itself has been a controversial issue. And the intelligence agencies have far more resources. Nearly six years on from the attacks on New York and Washington the CIA claims to have tripled the number of trained case officers and to have opened or re-opened more than 20 stations or bases overseas.<br />

First, key mistakes were made by the American administration in the first years of the U.S.-led occupation of Afghanistan due to a variety of ideological idees fixes that included a dislike of &quot;nation building,&quot; an aversion to reliance on international forces, and a preoccupation with Iraq as a supposed centre of world terrorism. That meant that Afghanistan was short changed on a number of levels. The initial deployment of international troops was the lowest per capita commitment of peacekeepers to any post-conflict environment since World War II. The Pentagon also initially blocked efforts by soldiers of the international coalition, known as ISAF, to patrol outside of Kabul and to extend a security umbrella to other parts of the country until August 2003. And aid per capita to Afghans in the first two years after the fall of the Taliban was around a tenth of that given to Bosnians following the end of the Balkan civil war in the mid- 1990s. As Ambassador James Dobbins of RAND has pointed out &quot;Afghanistan was the least resourced of any major American led nation building operation since the end of WWII.&quot; These early errors helped pave the way for the resurgence of the Taliban.<br />

In the meantime, the United States has only limited ground force capability<br />
ready to respond to other contingencies. The absence of a credible strategic<br />
reserve in our ground forces increases the risk that potential adversaries will be<br />
tempted to challenge the United States Since the end of World War II, a core element of U.S. strategy has been<br />
maintaining a military capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating aggression in<br />
more than one theater at a time. As a global power with global interests, the United<br />
States must be able to deal with challenges to its interests in multiple regions of the world<br />
simultaneously. Today, however, the United States has only limited ground force<br />
capability ready to respond outside the Afghan and Iraqi theaters of operations. If the<br />
Army were ordered to send significant forces to another crisis today, its only option<br />
would be to deploy units at readiness levels far below what operational plans would<br />
require – increasing the risk to the men and women being sent into harm’s way and to the<br />
success of the mission. As stated rather blandly in one DoD presentation, the Army<br />
“continues to accept risk” in its ability to respond to crises on the Korean Peninsula and<br />
elsewhere. Although the United States can still deploy air, naval, and other more<br />
specialized assets to deter or respond to aggression, the visible overextension of our<br />
ground forces has the potential to significantly weaken our ability to deter and respond to<br />
some contingencies.<br />

Fortunately, observers on both sides of the border think that change is in the air. One reason is globalisation, particularly the role played in it by the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 'The survival of the fittest will be the order of the day. We might as well treat India as just another country and let businesses dictate their own terms,' says Mr Siraj Kassam Teli, president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 'Pakistan will be the ultimate beneficiary.' Another reason is that Pakistan, like India, is shining now. A buoyant economy makes a breakthrough in relations more likely. The Indian economy is estimated to have grown by 8.1 per cent in the year to March 2004, helped by a rebound in the farm sector and growth in manufacturing and services. As for Pakistan, it grew by more than 5 per cent last year, inflation is low at around 3 per cent, foreign exchange reserves are more than 17 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), and the exchange rate is stable, says Mr Abdul Moiz Bokhari, Pakistan's ebullient High Commissioner to Singapore.<br />

A second major change is that there is a worldwide effort against this organization. Now before September 11 in many countries, I would say, including the United States, there was effectively a permissive environment for al Qaeda; that as long as their activities were not too egregious, they could often operate below the radar screen and not be picked up by local security forces. Today this is much harder. This doesn't mean that everywhere there is an equally vigilant effort; but it does mean that the organization has to make far fewer mistakes in order to survive.<br />

The International Crisis Group has published a new report warning that Uzbekistan, formerly part of the now-defunct Soviet Union, continues to pose a risk to surrounding countries. In &quot;Uzbekistan: Stagnation and Uncertainty,&quot; the Crisis Group argues that the world's nations should be prepared for a potential civil conflict when current Uzbekistan president Islom Karimov departs the scene.<br />
<br />
According to the report, President Karimov, whose term officially ended nearly a year ago, has given no indication that he will relinquish power, and that the lack of a distinct replacement or even a replacement process could result in a violent contest for control of the country. Additionally, the Crisis Group says, Uzbekistan's human rights situation is dire and there is a lack of foreign investment and rampant poverty.<br />
<br />
Robert Templer, Asia Program Director for the International Crisis Group, says, &quot;The political scene is full of uncertainty. The apparent public apathy reflects not support for the regime but rather pervasive fear and a sense of hopelessness. There is great resentment, increasing the chance of serious unrest whose impact will be felt throughout Central Asia once Karimov steps down.&quot;<br />

He stated that Pakistan was striving to promote regional peace and stability through improvement in relations with India including efforts aimed at the solution of all outstanding issues including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.<br />
The Foreign Minister said the country is also supporting efforts for the promotion of peace, stability and reconstruction in Afghanistan. This is very important for our internal stability as well as the realisation of our economic goals vis- a- vis Central Asia, he added.<br />
Speaking about the ties of Pakistan with India, he said we have time and again made it abundantly clear that we do not wish to enter into an arms race with India, nuclear or conventional. We believe that such a race would be destructive for the entire region.<br />
He was of the opinion that to give a hopeful future to their peoples, who remain mired in poverty, Pakistan and India need to invest in tools of development and not destruction.<br />
He said today the situation of relations between India and Pakistan was much more stable and both the countries were engaged in a Composite Dialogue process since January 2004.<br />
Both the neighbours have agreed on several Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) to remove m istrust between the two sides, he said.<br />
