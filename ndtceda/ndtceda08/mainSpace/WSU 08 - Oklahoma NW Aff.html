Therefore garrison and I stand in affirmation with this year’s focus on the questioning of agricultural support in the instance of sugar subsidies. We defend the 1ac as a presentation of contingency to be understood on its own terms. We think engaging the subaltern of the topic results in intellectual advantages for those who choose to debate in this way. We will always defend that subaltern voices are discounted now, that academic work misunderstands them, that traditional IR is gendered and destructive, and that listening is the correct stance for students of privilege.<br />

Americans like to lose themselves in reliving the glory days of overthrowing slavery, upholding presidents and advocates of civil rights as martyrs that have transformed our society. However, despite this shallow lip-service to a white sense of self accomplishment, there is still very real slavery that exists in the world<br />

One such instance of modern day slavery is in the Dominican republic, where unwilling Haitians are kidnapped and kept to work on American-supported sugar plantations. We must accept responsibility for our complicity in this violence<br />

We believe that our questioning is only the first step in opening a new space for discourse about an ongoing oppression that few stop to address. For far too long, the focus has been on how to do politics, rather than why we do them. This methodology inevitable leaves one locked inside of a system, incapable of thinking or analyzing behavior. A specific re-reading of the sugar plantion economy in places like the Dominican republic acts as a catalyst for challenging colonial dominance<br />

Narratives are the best way to work towards this objective. In listening to these stories, we’re able to open up a space for a real relationship with the other that does not feed into the master/slave dichotomy.<br />

Failure to challenge the binary logic that creates rigid hierarchies only reporoduces domination and exploitation<br />

Furthermore, challenging hegemonic positions enables us to lead meaningful lives.<br />

Not everyone can be spoken for simultaneously, but we can do our best. By refusing to adhere to a concrete plan of action, we leave open space for these narratives and their authors to compose futures of their fashioning. Traditional frameworks, which parade with banners of “Action of ontology” uniquely eliminate these voices<br />

Furthermore, our form of politics avoids the need of a blueprint. By committing to an etho-political relationship with the word. We open the space for true change.<br />

We need a new conception of politics, yours leaves off with accepting the Machiavellian perspective and starts with the attempts to heed to the demands of freedom as an absence of oppression. We contend that you should accept this static view of accepting your role in “politics” we need to question the politcs of facticity implicit within your politics<br />
