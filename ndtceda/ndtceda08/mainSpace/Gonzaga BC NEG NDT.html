<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">NEG – Gonzaga BC v. West Georgia BS</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1NC – Old Affs Bad</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A. They read an old aff – it’s on the caselist</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">B. New affs are good – every replay reduces the amount of knowledge produced xHanson</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">C. Voter for competitive equity and degradation – not reading a new aff means they don’t think we’re worth it. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1NC – Have to read a plan</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1NC Anarchy K</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The aff’s embrace of the primitive is a form of elitism that ignores humanities need for social connection and is based on a hatred of the masses. This negative view of human nature will inevitably devolve to an appeal to hierarchical power to institute their primitive utopia</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Brian Sheppard 2004, Dec. 10, “Bakunin versus the primitivists” </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“a tendency in the contemporary American radical movement is…. Freedom, happiness or equality. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The aff makes us all walking dead – allegiance to the collective ensures our eventual sacrifice, making life worthless. Prostrating themselves to the god-state suppodely to prevent extinction ironically makes the death of billions possible.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Louis Beres, 1994, 11 ariz j. int’l &amp; comp law</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Flood, Andrew, 2005 – civilization, primitivism and anarchism</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“primitivism offers no hope and ho program for… emergence of this struggle” </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Rejecting the state allows for a new relationship with tech and civilization devoid of hierarchy that solves the aff</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Flood again</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1NR K cards</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Primitivism shoots itself in the foot – even if it doesn’t directly support the state, critiquing civilization undermines the social organization necessary to overthrow the state. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Flood again</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“most primitivists run away from the requirement for mass…. Here is an interesting critique” </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Domination over nature is not a intrinsic part of human nature but rather a result of our culture hierarchies and social structure. Only the alt which addresses this fundamental issue create a “harmony with nature”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Flood again,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“on the relations of man and his environment, we have…. Consequence of a new socialization” </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We don’t view tech as the savior of all but still recognize the importance of scientific advancements. Only the alt can remodel existing tech practices and form the most sustainable society, proving we solve the bad parts of tech</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Flood again</span><br />

Layne “American empire: a debate” 2007<br />

Kupchan july/august 2007 foreign affairs<br />

“a counterfactual doesn’t inherently…the opposing rhetoric”<br />
Counterplan eliminates any need or possibility for theplan – smoot Hawley act was the precursor to the modern farm bill<br />
Mclaughin 2007 “farm bill follies”<br />
“family farmers have…still hurt consumers”<br />
Nb:<br />
The smoot Hawley tarrif caused hitler’s rise and Japanese militarism<br />
Wanniski 2001 “remember pearl harbor”<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“but the shoah…of the jews”<br />
Solvency<br />
The smoot Hawley tariff amplified the great depression and established global protectionism; our counterfactual changes the votes and allows us to imagine a different world<br />
Miller 99 “parade of protection”<br />
“there is little…the harsh tariffs”<br />
Our counterfactual is politically important – Nazis were a product of great depression. Analysis allows us to see the connections between political actions and violence<br />
Eichengreen and temin 2001 “counterfactual histories of the great depression”<br />
“rivers of ink…than a decade”<br />
Ashtar<br />
The aff’s call on the judge to imagine the literal apocalypse casts us into the role of the sole survivor gazing down on a mythical post – apocalyptic world. Such an imagining produces a form of knowledge based in death and desire for the bomb<br />
Chernus 86 “ dr. strangegod” 86-87<br />
“if this kind…of in myth”<br />
There is an alternative mythology to the linear narrative destruction however; hovering above the earth, the ashtar command will prevent any nuclear escalation and bring a new utopian peace on earth. We should welcome nuclear conflict as part of this new mythology of peace<br />

Bataille – cites round 1<br />
Death and violence are inevitable – the only question is whether they are thrust upon us or are engaged in willfully and with excessive purpose<br />
Itzkowitz 99 “to witness spectacles of pain: the hypermorality of georges batalille”<br />
“how is this …and agree to?”<br />
Acting in deference to the future represses the mystical , irrational part of humanity. Our inevitable pursuit of the sacred creates the impulse for self –destruction. The only choice is whether to acknowledge this impulse though sacrifice, or experience global annihilation<br />
Itzkowtiz 99 same cite<br />
“in other words…unusual self-knowledge”<br />
Vote neg to sacrifice the aff and politicization of artistic meaning. Giving up on the value of the affirmative is the joyful squandering of carefully hoarded resources. it’s the only way to escape the confines of utility and return of the animality that founds life<br />

The aff views death as a limit which can be pushed back or delayed this condition life into a constant search for escape. Instead death is a merely a possibility we should not be swayed by<br />

Avoiding death is organic chauvinism that represents fear of change. No impact to aff – just elements changing form<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The act of sacrifice draws both the object of the sacrifice and the sacrifice into immanence.

Forget the Holocaust<br />
Text: Do the 1AC minus the Holocaust references<br />
References to the Holocaust entrench a false utilitarian mindset which would kill millions to save thousands- the memory has no benefit, it’s time to forget<br />

The Claim that society is an oppressive structure to be overturned through individual protest mirrors the tactics of Lenin, complaining about industrialism while enjoying the high standards of living it makes possible- their “local activism” is complicit with socialism<br />

Their refusal to openly defend the Marxist implication of their performances makes it particulary dangerous. Even after the fall of Communism, Western academics employing Fold Marxist assumptions keep the ideology alive, allowing it tot spread undetected through the universities<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The plan rescues the commodity of cotton but in so doing it renders it alien and instrumental in a world of objects. Sacrifice turns your back on the world of cause and effect, impossibility against all costs enables a true return to immanence.<br />
(Bataille, Georges. Theory of Religion, 1992, pg. 41-46) “The Worker and the Tool…as a thing insofar as it is mortal. “<br />
Acting in deference to the future represses the mystical, irrational part of humanity. Our inevitable pursuit of the sacred creates the impulse for self-destruction. The only choice is whether to acknowledge this impulse through sacrifice, or experience global annihilation.<br />

Vote Neg to sacrifice the affirmative. Precisely because the plan would be a good idea, it must be destroyed. Giving up on the value of the affirmative is the joyful squandering of carefully hoarded resources. It’s the only way to escape the confines of utility and return to animality that founds life.<br />
