<br />
today activists question whether slavery... who would otherwise have none.<br />
<br />
<br />
now, our story moves to the north, to the united states, where sugar subsidies and import quotas keep the american sugar prices at twice the value of that of everywhere else in the world.<br />
<br />
adam dean, &quot;artificially sweetened: an analysis of the united states sugar program,&quot; university of penn college undergrad research electronic journal, 3-27-06, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://repository.upenn.edu" rel="nofollow">http://repository.upenn.edu</a><br />
<br />
although the difference between the US tobacco and sugar.... should adjust the tariff-rate quota accordingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
they do this in an elaborate system of import-quotas and subsidies that go directly to the processors of sugar cane. the fanjul family owns both processors and plantations. 75% of dominican sugar goes to the united states through these quotas.<br />
<br />
nyt, &quot;america's sugar daddies,&quot; november 29, 2003<br />
<br />
the government does not pay sugar... producers at a disadvantage.<br />
<br />
<br />
in addition, the US sugar quotas and subsidies keep the fanjul family extremely rich-- sugar subsidies ensure that the fanjul family can sell the sugarcane made in the dominican republic by slaves for an inflated rate that gives the fanjuls an extra 125 million dollars each year.<br />
<br />

the largest beneficiary of continued... cost american consumers billions of dollars.<br />
<br />
<br />
in other words, the us market that fanjuls profit from is an artificially created one. the market that these ag supports create directly fuels the slavery in the dominican republic, the us is complicit in the exploitation that occurs there. only by removing the supports can we destroy the market for slave plantations and the profit that the fanjuls receive from it.<br />
<br />
kent rosenthal, &quot;resistance movements, conspiracy theories, religion and the media, hispaniola: a remnant of the slave trade,&quot; july 30, 2005<br />
<br />
sugar has been called the oil... keeps the DR under its wing.<br />
<br />
<br />
this artificial market created by subs is furthermore bolstered by the fact that currently subsidies are conditioned on the production outputs recipients. this means that the fanjuls receive payments primarily because they can operate on a large scale via slave labor, rendering the impact of us sugar policies both cyclical and deadly.<br />

<br />
the current farm bill... more than $2 million in 2003.<br />
<br />
<br />
only the united states action can stop this narrative from continuing. we created the market that allows for dominican slavery to continue. we must disable the market in order to stop the exploitation. this action by the united states would be a first step in relieving the slaves that live in the bateys so close to our coast.<br />

the legal protections for the displaced... stone's throw from america's shore.<br />
<br />
<br />
TEXT:<br />
<br />
this prompts us to propose the following:<br />
<br />
the united states federal government should eliminate all import tariffs for sugar. Additionally, the united states federal government should eliminate all subsidies for sugar that are conditioned on production outputs.<br />

ACT 2: our own narrative begins<br />
<br />
barndt, 91<br />
<br />
<br />
in a nutshell, the US needs to face its complicity. it supports the fanjul family and directly supports the bateys in the dominican republic. the us and by extension all of us support the exploitation that occurs there. only by making this recognition can we overcome the hypocrisy of the current situation and spark real change around the globe.<br />

<br />
of course, there is not a single solution... how can we say we are free?<br />
<br />
<br />
not only does the narrative of the 1ac come first but security discourse naturalizes violence and war-- only by exploring alternative discourses will we find peace.<br />
<br />
josefina echavarria, &quot;re-thinking insecurity discourses from a critical perspective,&quot; asteriskos j of intl and peace studies, instituto galego de estudos de seguranza e da paz, vol 1/2, 2006<br />
<br />
this reading of security discourses... rhetoric of violence and war.<br />
<br />
<br />
ACT 3: a body without rights is not human at all<br />
<br />
the fanjuls treatment of haitians in the dominican republic is nothing short of the manipulation of bodies for profit, the eradication of their common humanity-- the slave has no rights, no feelings, no value to life under slavery. this manipulation constitutes the worst form of biopolitics as they become mere numbers in calculations for profit.<br />
<br />
achille mbembe, &quot;necropolitics,&quot; public culture 15.1, 2003, 11-40<br />
<br />
any historical account of the rise... take on the face of a &quot;war without end.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
mbembe's arg isn't overblown in the slightest. the ability to reduce human life simply to calculable numbers is the worst atrocity-- it robs life of its inherent worth and justifies total eradication.<br />
<br />
michael dillon, &quot;another justice,&quot; political theory 27.2, april, 155-175<br />
<br />
economies of evaluation necessarily require.... to the requirement for decision.<br />
<br />
<br />
in light of these atrocities, we have only two choices. we can remain insular in the world of self-privileging american sugar politics, allowing the fanjuls to continue to exploit and render dispensible all human life, or we can undercut the fanjul's ability to exploit. we can, in fact, simply say no.<br />

Although action is essential we cannot actinindicidually. The liberal state is critical to ethical actions because it is the only way ot univeralize ethical commitments, like the pal, and create systems of justice that maintain order against transgression. We must also imagine governmental action as key stie for fighting against injstuce and ensureing a progressive politics<br />

First our relationship to the law is tied to the stories that we choose to tell about the law and its implications in ourlives. Framing this story through the lens of overly determined psychological and cultural forcesis ultimately debilating and must be resisted<br />

And a hermenuticds of suspicion posits an elitist view of the critic as existing apart form and above the social forces that have been masked from the general population. Given this stance, it is often undervalues lived experience, undermines any potential for reform, and undermines more pragmatic attempts to tella postitive and transformative story<br />
