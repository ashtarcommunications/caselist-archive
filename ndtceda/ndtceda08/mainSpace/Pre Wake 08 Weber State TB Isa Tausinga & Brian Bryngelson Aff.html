<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">First, current discussions of agriculture reduce food to the status of abstracted commodities and subsidies as an economic rather than a moral choice. Reducing discussions of food to policy technicalities obscures the moral issues at stake and est. market and globalization as natural and healthy. Reinjecting moral questions that recognize that growing food is not an industrial but a naural process is crucial to reversing this </span><br />

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And, the legal framing of animals as commodities to be manipulated by market forces such as subsidies reduces them to objects rolling off an assembly line. In order to maximize productivity any action is justifiable regardless of the impact on their welfare or quality of life. As a result animals have simply become exempt from any moral calculus. </span><br />

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And subsidies are crucial to this process. They allow the industry to keep pumping out “cheap” pork chops while turning their farms into sunless hells of metal and concrete full of tortured animals. Whenever moral questions about the treatment of animals are asked, the consumers are forced to shut up and mind their own business out of gratitude for the cheap meat they eat. </span><br />

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">First, the commodification and intentional torture of animals through factory is the root of all commodification and objectification.

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And this economic rationality justifies every atrocity. The earth and all its creatures become expendable trash. The final triumph of neoliberalism is a world where all human institutions, foreign policy, the military, science, and finance are fused into a single totalitarian entity engaged in constant war, ecocide, racism, patriarchal violence and destruction in order to guarantee growth. The very possibility of human freedom and choice will be eradicated as we are enslaved by the economic and consumer demands of this monster. </span><br />
