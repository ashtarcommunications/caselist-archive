In the Sumerian colony, in what was known as Persia, the Sumerians employed Bitumen to bind bricks nearly 6000 years ago. Sinc ethen it has been constructed in the telling of noah’s arch, moses’s blanket, and the construction of the towel of babel. Zoroasterian follows even worshiped in temples lit be mysterious vents fueled by an unknown source. Only in the last hundred yrs has bitumen, more namely oil, has taken on its modern meaning  <br />

Contemporary knowledge about oil is not monolithic- there are many perspectives from which one can derive their relationship with oil., the dominant story surrounding Iranian oil in the united states is seen as a tool for power and security. This notion is used to control the “backwards people” of the middle east who can’t use their own resources effectively . This perpetual notion that all people from Iran are backward and incapable has tainted the US Relationship with the Middle East. When we assume the entirety of the Middle East can be subsumed by their relationship to oil that the west has constructed, we ignore discourses that are antithetical to the western story. It is time to interagate that histort in order to develop a more complete and nuanced understanding of the current U.S-Iranian relationship based on a genealogical approach to US-Iranian Oil Politics. <br />
<br />
And the true beginning between the us and iran may never be known but there are multiple theories concerncerning its emergence. For exmpale, although weary of angering European powers, the us and iran agreed to establish diplomatic relations as the result of the American Presbyterian mission in 1835 to open an all-girl’s school in Iran <br />
Heravi, 1970(Mehdi. Born in Iran, Education in Iran, England, and US Prof Tenn Tech, Iranian-American Diplomacyp 12-13 <br />
“the missionaries brought about the first significanct contact between the two countries” <br />
And “The US did respond to the Iranian request for aid by sending financial advisors” <br />

The anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now B.P&gt;, was the first petroleum industry in Iran, When first established they were helpful supporters throughout the community, and still today BP has a vested interest in housing, medical care, and education throughout the region <br />
B.P. 2007 <br />
(BP Oil Company, “History of B.P.” In Society. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryld=9014511$contentld=7027672" rel="nofollow">http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryld=9014511$contentld=7027672</a> <br />

Oil is used as an instrument of Western Imperial Power to control, plunder and manipulate the Iranian people and their livelihoods. Bani-Sadr deemed oil a ‘sucking maching’, sucking up the culture and destroying the economy on which the citizens of iran depend <br />
Bakhash 1982 (Shaul, “the Politics of Oil and Revolution in Iran: pg 5-6) <br />
‘oil remained a central concern in Bani-Sadr’s work” and “bani-sadr described the relationship between oil company and producing state as one of ‘plunder’” <br />
<br />
Oil need not be polarized into totalizing categories. To do so would misunderstand the history and nature of oil. Oil has brought countries to great victories as well as defeat. This cycle of the rise and fall of oil is a tale that will never have an ending. Oil has created and fueled wars as well made economies dependent. While the same resource has fueled travel, industrialization and been the savior to trapped economies <br />
Hamilton 2005 <br />
(Adrian, “Focus: Oil” EROEI.com, Sept 18, 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eroei.com/articles/2005_articles/focus:_oil/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eroei.com/articles/2005_articles/focus:_oil/</a> <br />
“It is the great liberator that has changed the course of history” and “there is the tale of the industry that made it happen” <br />
<br />
The importance of oil in us-Iranian relations is unmistakable and has shaped policy since its discovery. Oil has been the impetus for the us-sponsored overthrow in 1953 and of the Iranian takeover of the US embassy in 1979. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 may have banned direct investment into Iranian Oil sector; but left significant loopholes to still access oil. This contradictory policy underscores the gray area in which oil survives. Intervention in Iran, though has been also with benign intentions <br />
Mossavar 1997 (Mossavar-Rahmani, Bijan, “oil in US-Iran Relations” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worlddialogue.org/pdf/speech8.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.worlddialogue.org/pdf/speech8.pdf</a> <br />
“It has been said that wherever you dig in Iran, you either hit oil or uncover history” and “the hands of paying, reliable, customers” <br />
<br />
Finally, put those T shells away, We are 100% topical. Through BP the US constructively engages with Iran. The Discusssion of Oil is directly germane to a topic discussion <br />
B.P. 1999 <br />
BP.com “ARCO Executives Urges US to Adopt Economic Engagement Policy with Iran’ Press Release. Release Date: March 2, 1999 <br />
“the most effective way to influence the political future of the Iran” and “the hard fact is that current US policy will do nothing to influence Iran’s foreign policy or behavior” <br />
<br />
Genealogies force us to rethink political freedom, power, identity without causing the polarization of totalizing ideas <br />
Clifford 2001  <br />
(Michael, Political Genealogy After Foucault Savage Identities pg 6 <br />
<br />
Memory is intimately tied to the reproduction of identitires and underlies all political actions. Treating memory as a plural category breaks hold of the dominant narratives and causes a shift in historical consciousness critical to breaking down the dominant forms of knowledge and creating a more complete understanding  <br />
Silverson and Makdisi, 2006 (Paul and Ussama, Memory and Violence in the Middle East and North , pg 9-11.  <br />
“violence as pragmatic process of community construction” <br />
And “becomes the possibility for forgoing unity in the aftermath of violent disunity” <br />
<br />
The aff is not an attempt to create a new truth or subject.  It opens a space of hybridity in which polar opposites no longer form our political opinions. This is where counter-narratives are allowed to interact with the dominant ones in order to better understand our world, more specifically the West towards Middle East and Vice Versa. Cultural misunderstanding and misconceptions can be eliminated through an analysis that includes multiple histories, which is why the genealogical process is vitally important <br />
Bhabha 1994 (Homi, The Location of Culture, “The commitment to Theory” Routledge publishing, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/bhabha/commit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/bhabha/commit.html</a> <br />
“A critical discourse does not yield a new political object” and because there is no given community or body of the peope whose inherent, radical historicity emits the right signs” <br />
<br />
Today the world is continually cut up and divided into two pieces and being analyzed without thinking twice about what is the ME, what is Iran, and what it meansfor the US to constructively engage with nations in the resolution has been tainted by the exclusive nature of the Western Imperial view imposed on the ME. Such a view of the world has predetermined ideads about how the US is supposedto interact with Nations and does not allow for ways of knowing contrary to these so-called truths. <br />
<br />
This leads to policymaking and decisions concerning others that operate on incomplete knowledge and are doomed to failure. The consequences of such doomed policies are not limited to just achieving their goal, the backlash that such misplaced and cofused policies can be catastrophic. The US constructs many of its own threats solely because they think there is only one way the world can work. But the pendulum swings both ways, the dominant narrative of the East equally sermonizes the US and their policies, as wekk as the oil companies they promote. Misunderstandings on both sides lead to avoidable mistakes. <br />
<br />
Why should you vote aff? First, voting aff is voting to affirm that the dominant narrative that control the lives of the periphery are not the way in which the world can be viewed. It means there should be more than one way to affirm the topic, the current solution paradigm we engage in, misses many of the underlying problems debaters claim to fiat through. Alternatives exist beyond the confines of these prescribed and rudimentary views. Secondly, voting affirmative confirms that there are new ways in which to view the world, ones that have been previously ignored and pushed aside. Thus we must interrogate what it means to affirm this topic, we refuse to believe that the only way to defend the resolution is by bowing to conventional notions of policy action. We believe the aff should inform the resolution; this is because truly no policy or solution can be understood when our knowledge about Iranian oil comes in the form of two sentence politics cards and fabricated nuclear war scenerios.  <br />
<br />
There are a number of implication to this; that it breaks down the cycle of violence in the ME because we cannot separate ourselves from the other because of our relationship with oil, it means that the Iranian and US governments are not allowed to justify violence, death, and the eradication of individual’s identities. Iran can hold people hostage because they are the only leverage on the war on oil. The US can sanction Iran because we view them as backwards. And the US has to offer security gurantees or financial assistance to the ME because they are incompetent to make their own policies. The value lies in the expansion of our knowledge base and the resulting increase in the recognition of possibilities that exist that may explain how today’s dominant narrative has become so dominant, while simultaneously offering explanations for why certain identities have been inscribed involuntarily on people and why people seem to accept them as something has and always will be. Being able to challenge the static notions of knowledge means that our genealogy allows for the rupturing of the dominant narratives and creates a space in which other, and qually important forms of knowledge can exist and be understood.
