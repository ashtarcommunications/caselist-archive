 THE POLICY OF REGIME CHANGE TOWARD IRAN IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE AGGRESSIVE RHETORIC OF GOOD AND EVIL. THE ONLY APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION IS TO TREAT IRAN AS A NAZI-LIKE ENEMY WHO IGNORES RATIONALITY IN EXCHANGE FOR ANNIHILATION. THIS POSITIONS IRAN AS FANATICAL AND DERANGED AND FURTHERS THE PROJECT OF ABSOLUTE MORALISM.<br />
Greenwald, 2k7 (A tragic legacy: how a Good vs. Evil Mentality Destroyed the Bush Presidency, Random House, pp- 153-155)<br />
The simplistic….accordingly<br />
<br />
THIS RHETORIC PERSISTS EVEN AFTER NEW INTELLIGENCE REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY PURSUES A PROJECT OF REGIME CHANGE THAT IS NOT BASED ON REALITY AND RELIES SOLELY ON ECONOMIC AND COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. WHETHER IRAN IS DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS IRRELEVANT TO THE AFFIRMATIVE INSTEAD WE FOCUS ON EXPOSING THE POLICY OF REGIME CHANGE AS ONE THAT IS OBSESSED WITH IRANIAN NIGHTMARE SCENARIOS AND APOCALYPTIC RHETORIC.<br />
HEARD 2007 (LINDA, IRAN IS NO THREAT AND THAT'S OFFICIAL, CASMII, ARAB NEWS, DEC. 12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.campaigniran.org/casmii/index.php?q=node/3569" rel="nofollow">http://www.campaigniran.org/casmii/index.php?q=node/3569 </a>)<br />
There is one…mutual hostility<br />
<br />
THE AXIS OF EVIL DISCOURSE, FOCUSED AT IRAN, HAS EVOLVED INTO A DANGEROUS FORM OF RELIGIOUS MORALIZING THAT TURNS EVERY CONFLICT, EVERY FOREIGN POLICY INTERVENTION, AND EVERY POLICY DECISION INTO A FORCED CHOICE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL OR GOD AND THE DEVIL. THIS RELIGIOUS RE-DEFINITION OF RHETORIC DIRECTED TOWARD THE MIDDLE EAST IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT CONFLICT ENSUES INDEFINITELY.<br />
CHERNUS 2006 (IAN, MONSTERS TO DESTROY, 151-3)<br />
Michael Gerson…test us<br />
THIS RHETORIC SHOULD BE INDEPENDENTLY REJECTED DESPITE IT'S APPEAL TO SAFETY. IT CREATES AN OBSESSION WITH SECURITY. REGIME CHANGED IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT LIFE CAN BE RENDERED SAFE AND SECURE IF WE ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT US FROM THE EVIL ENEMY. SAFETY AT THE EXCLUSION OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS CREATES A TRANQUILIZED EXISTENCE. REGIME CHANGE COLLAPSES THE ENTIRE DOMAIN OF ETHICS AND MAKES THE GOOD UNACHIEVABLE<br />
Greenwald, 2k7 (A tragic legacy: how a Good vs. Evil Mentality Destroyed the Bush Presidency, Random House, pp- 235-237)<br />
The scare tactic…cease to exist<br />
THIS GOOD VERSUS EVIL RHETORIC SHAPES REALITY. A REFUSAL OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S STORY IS A PRE-REQUISITE TO UNDERSTANDING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS<br />
CHERNUS 2006 (IAN, MONSTERS TO DESTROY, 5)<br />
On September 11…real world<br />
FURTHER THIS OBSESSION WITH ABSOLUTE EVIL IGNORES THAT THE GOOD CAN NEVER COMPLETELY OVERCOME EVIL. THE UNITED STATES INSISTENCE THAT GOOD AND PEACE CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTROLLING IRAN'S BEHAVIOR AND REDUCING TERRORISM IS FLAWED. THE INSISTENCE THAT IF IRAN ADOPTS DEMOCRATIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS THE WORLD WILL BE SAFER AND FREE OF EVIL IS ILLUSORY. THIS WILL TO THE GOOD MANIFESTS ITSELF THROUGH UNIMAGINABLE VIOLENCE BY ATTEMPTING TO ERASE ANY ADVERSARY AND ULTIMATELY EVEN DEATH ITSELF.<br />
BAUDRILLARD 2001 (JEAN, THE SPIRIT OF TERRORISM, LE MONDE, TRANSLATED BY DR. RACHEL BLOUL, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cryptome.org/baud...spirit" rel="nofollow">http://cryptome.org/baud...spirit</a> of terrorism<br />
THE PROJECT OF ATTEMPTING TO SECURE THE IRAN IS PART OF A LARGER STRATEGY TO ELIMINATE SIN AND DISORDER FROM THE WORLD. THE GOAL IS ABSOLUTE AND TOTAL CONTROL. THIS DE-VALUES LIFE AND MAKES CONFLICT INEVITABLE BECAUSE IT ARGUES THAT WE MUST STOP INSECURITY AND THAT INSECURITY IS INEVITABLE. THE PROMISE OF PEACE IS AN ILLUSION THAT IS ONLY USED TO JUSTIFY INCREASED SECURITY POLICIES.<br />
THE FRAMING OF ABSOLUTE EVIL SHOULD BE REJECTED BECAUSE IT MAKES WAR SEEM A NECESSITY<br />
CHERNUS 2006….absolute control<br />
THE U.S. POSITION TOWARD IRAN IS NOT ABOUT ACTUAL WAR IT IS ABOUT THE THREAT OF CONTINUED VIOLENCE. THE ACT OF REGIME CHANGE IS FAR MORE DESTABILIZING THAN ACTUAL VIOLENCE. THIS STATE OF WAR CREATES A FORCED CHOICE BETWEEN CATASTROPHE OR COMPLETE CONTROL. ONLY CERTAIN CONSEQUENCES ARE CONSIDERED LEGITIMATE. REFUSING TO VIEW IRAN AS AN ENEMY IS THE ONLY WAY TO MOUNT A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO A STATE OF PERMANENT WAR<br />

Once again….practice<br />
THIS PERPETUAL STATE OF WAR OUTWEIGHS ALL MATERIAL IMPACTS. THE CONSTANT STATE OF WAR WAGED BY ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES AGAINST IRAN HAS RENDERED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES IRRELEVANT. THIS STATE OF WAR HAS REDUCED INDIVIDUALS IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO A STANDING RESERVE WAITING TO BE ANNIHILATED.<br />

<br />
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION POSITIONS IRAN AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO CANNOT BE NEGOTIATED WITH AND OUR OUTSIDE OF LANGUAGE. THIS PLACEMENT OF THE IRANIANS AS OUTSIDE OF LANGUAGE AND DIPLOMACY IS COLONIALIST AND PLACES THEM OUTSIDE THE REALM OF SOCIAL JUSTICE. THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHO IS AND WHO IS NOT HUMAN IS THE ULTIMATE DEVALUATION.<br />

<br />
From the Western perspective, the prime benefit of engaging Syria is isolating Iran. The Iranians are threatening to go nuclear and remake the Middle East in their image. They have spent the last 27 years sending their emissaries throughout the Middle East - spreading their vision of Islamic revolution.<br />

Regardless of the ….the current stalemate.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE: IRAQ<br />
<br />
1. SYRIAN TRANSFER OF TERRORISTS IS THE SOLE REASON FOR TERRORIST SURVIVAL- IF CONTINUED LARGE PERCENTAGES OF ATTACKS WILL ENSUE- SYRIA HAS THE POWER TO STOP IT<br />
DENENBERG 2K7 (THE BULLETIN, How To Lose A War By Ignoring And Denying It, AUGUST 24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thebulletin.us/site/news.cfm?newsid=18743154&amp;BRD=2737&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=576361&amp;rfi=6%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebulletin.us/site/news.cfm?newsid=18743154&amp;BRD=2737&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=576361&amp;rfi=6)</a><br />
Now we have to ….and must stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
2. TERRORISTS IN IRAQ WILL BUILD NETWORKS INTERNATIONALLY<br />

Another vexing problem ….the anti-Soviet struggle in Afghanistan.19<br />
<br />
3. MUST FOCUS ON IRAQ<br />

A similar trend …..basic, long-held beliefs.&quot;<br />

5. TERRORISTS CAN GET THE BOMB<br />
Cohen 05 Ariel, Research Fellow at Heritage Foundation, Federal Document Clearinghouse, “Subcommittee on international terrorism and nonproliferation”, April 14 lexis<br />
Experts believe that …..build a nuclear bomb.<br />
<br />
6. A SUCCESSFUL TERRORIST ATTACK WOULD CAUSE RETALIATION LEADING TO NUKES<br />

The terrorist act can ….. themselves merchants or terrorists.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO: ISRAEL-SYRIA PEACE<br />
<br />
U.S. IS BLOCKING SYRIA/ISRAELI GOLAN NEGOTIATIONS. ISRAEL AND SYRIA ARE BOTH INTERESTED IN PEACE TALKS<br />
Rahman, 2007 (Professor As'ad Abdul Rahman, Chairman of the Palestinian Encyclopedia, Gulf News, April 7, 2007, US HOLDS KEY TO SYRIA-ISRAEL PEACE, LN)<br />
Washington seems to…. help move this track.<br />

Bashar Assad is likely…. full-scale Middle East conflict.<br />
<br />
ANY RISK OF NEGOTIATIONS CAUSES RIPPLES OF PEACE IN THE REGION<br />

<br />
ADVANTAGE THREE: RELATIONS<br />
<br />
LACK OF SYRIAN-U.S. RELATIONS MEAN MIDDLE EAST WAR INEVITABLE NOW<br />
Robert Rabil, Assistant Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Political science Dept at Florida Atlantic Univ, 2006, Syria, the United States, and the War on Terror in the Middle East, p. xx<br />

We have greatly changed …..would follow.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE: LEBANON<br />
<br />
Our hardline policies toward Syria are driving them to re-impose their hegemony over Lebanon, supporting violence and undermining their democracy<br />

<br />
Above all, Lebanon’s ….in and from Lebanon.<br />
<br />
<br />
The impact to this instability in Lebanon is global war<br />
stuart 6 “Lebanon – the struggle continues” www.alt3.co.uk/discussion_files/lebanon.htm<br />
<br />
Why is this important? …. much to stop.<br />
<br />
And, reaction to Syrian-led violence in Lebanon will lead to crackdowns and larger wars, including Hezbollah attacking Israel. These wars will spin out of control in the Middle East and last for decades.<br />

<br />
Apparently, Bashar Assad …..an exciting time to be alive.<br />
<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
The United States federal government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Syria. This should include offering them a security guarantee that the United States does not seek regime change in Syria as an inducement to engage in dialogue about the United States-Syria relationship. This engagement will also include the United States announcing that it will return an ambassador to Syria, support negotiations for and the return of the Golan Heights to Syria, acknowledge Syria's special interest in Lebanon, and announce that it will be willing to remove Syria from the Department of State's list of countries sponsoring terrorism in exchange for Syria's ending of support for militant/terrorist organizations, cooperation on Iraq and respect for the political independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon.<br />
