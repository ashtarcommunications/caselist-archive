Text: The USFG should constructively engage Iran by offering Iran a binding guarantee that the US will not use force to change the borders or form of government of Iran, lift nearly all US sanctions levied against Iran, settle all bilateral claims with Iran, establish democratic relations with Iran, and commit to working with Iran to enhance its economic interests if Iran agrees to limit its enrichment program to one facility with full transparency and strengthened monitoring by the IAEA and if Iran supports US regional interests including cooperation in Iraq and Afghanistan. The USFG should commit to implementing the results of this agreement.
