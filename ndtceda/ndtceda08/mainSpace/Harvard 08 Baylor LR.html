One of many actions necessary to overcome years of oppression by peoples more interested in self-centered greed than a community with others.  We recognize that other ways of thinking, speaking, and interrelating to the larger world are possible. At no point will we argue that a particular style of argumentation, speaking, or debating is necessary. However, we similarly think that framework-based arguments made against us are problematic. Our framework is that the affirmative should present a topical example of the resolution, and the negative should negate that argument. Our approach is intentionally open ended and inviting. However, the necessity of the affirmative to first posit the framework for the round ensures the best debate possible. And our open ended and easily met framework argument solves back any offense to their approach."></a><span style="font-weight: normal">We understand that our affirmative is not an end point, but a starting point.
