Obs 1: The Status Quo<br />
<br />
The dominant mode of politics today is post-politics, which attempts to replace real ideological battles with compromises made by technocrats. This accepts in advance the necessity of global capitalism and prevents authentic politics<br />
Zizek 1999 (Slavok Zizek, The Ticklish Subject pp 198-9)<br />
<br />
Today, however, we are dealing with another form … considered ‘possible’ in the existing constellation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Post-politics relies upon a depoliticization of the economy – the economic structures of global capitalism are seen as an objective description of reality and accepted as a starting point. Only a politics that breaks from this logic can lead to radical change.<br />
Zizek 1999 (Slavoj Zizek, The Ticklish Subject pp. 353-4)<br />
<br />
The big news of today’s post-political age … compulsion that effectively runs his life.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These economic structures doom countless millions to incalculable poverty and suffering: capitalism depends upon its ability to disavow the vast social exclusion and violence its economic structures produce<br />
Zizek &amp; Daly 2004 (Glyn Daly and Slavoj Zizek, Conversations with Zizek pp. 14-6)<br />
<br />
This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde … postmodern forms of consumerism and lifestyle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Capitalist militarism leads to a cycle of irrational war and conflict which guarantees extinction<br />
Meszaros 2003 (Istvan Meszaros, “Militarism and the Coming Wars”, Monthly Review June 2003 pp. 17-9)<br />
<br />
Today the situation is qualitatively different… make Hitler’s irrationality look like the model of rationality.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The US stubbornly clings to cotton subsidies for its farmers even as it demands that other countries open up to free trade. This hypocritical logic of outsourcing is the exemplary economic strategy of capitalism<br />
Zizek 2004 (Slavoj Zizek, 2 Sept 04, “Knee-Deep”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizek-deep.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizek-deep.htm</a> )<br />
<br />
One should ask the naïve question: why … democracy and guardians of universal human rights.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus, the plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support by eliminating all of the domestic subsidies for cotton.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Obs 2: Solvency<br />
<br />
Our demand to eliminate cotton subsidies is a metaphoric condensation for our universal opposition. Our plan is not merely a particular demand for reform but a criticism of the structural conditions of capitalism.<br />
Zizek 1998 (Slavoj Zizek, “For a Leftist Appropriation of the European Legacy”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizek-leftist.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizek-leftist.htm</a> )<br />
<br />
Are we then condemned to … is thus effectively the end of politics proper.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We endorse an Ethics of the Real – from the starting point of recognizing our personal responsibility for the construction of the capitalist order, we must engage in a new form of politics that is willing to risk the impossible to break out of the political structures of the status quo<br />
Zizek &amp; Daly 2004 (Glyn Daly &amp; Slavoj Zizek, Conversations with Zizek pp.18-9)<br />
<br />
For Zizek, a confrontation with … exhorts us to risk the impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Capitalism exists only because we internally believe in it – rupturing this belief shatters capitalism.<br />
Johnston 2004 (Adrian Johnston, “Psychoanalysis, Culture &amp; Society”, i3 p259 via infotrac)<br />
<br />
Perhaps the absence of a detailed political roadmap … (“Capitalist commodity fetishism or the truth? I choose fetishism&quot;).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Risking self-destruction shatters the superego – in the face of fear you should run into the fire<br />
Zizek 2000 (Slavoj Zizek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality pp 122-4)<br />
<br />
What these three gestures have in common … explicit symbolic texture of his or her identity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation Three is framework<br />
<br />
<br />
The role of the ballot is to endorse or reject the ethical stance of the 1AC.<br />

‘Should’ expresses moral duty –<br />
