Spanos K Shell Link<br />
A. Their Aff’s framework of “constructing” engagement and “benign” assistance is grounded in a metaphysical logic which justifies American exceptionalism, an ontology that enables all domination, eradication of difference, and perpetuation of violence by making being standing reserve. The only way to replace this genocidal mentality is to rethink these specters of American exceptionalism, to reencounter and expose the undecidability of Western ontology that always results in violence against the other.<br />
