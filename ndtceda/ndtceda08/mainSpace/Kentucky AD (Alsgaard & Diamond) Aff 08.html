<strong>2007 is the try or die year for Afghanistan stability—the nation is backsliding and the United States must act immediately or risk another Iraq</strong> <br />

<br />
[2007 will likely...more vibrant economy]<br />
<strong>Thus the Plan:</strong><br />
The United States Federal Government, specifically the United States Agency for International Development, should constructively engage the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by offering a substantial increase in its financial and technical support to Afghanistan's reconstruction efforts. The United States' support will be predicated on the Afghani government's continued support of the international reconstruction effort. Specifically, we: <br />
1. Provide an additional $205 million in support to the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan<br />
2. Provide an additional $4 billion in support of road, electric, and irrigation systems construction.<br />
3. All funds are to be targeted to reconstruction and microfinance efforts in rural areas<br />
<h2 id="toc0"><a name="x-Observation II: The Taliban and Reconstruction"></a>Observation II: The Taliban and Reconstruction</h2>
 <br />
<strong>The war will be won or lost in rural areas: However, lack of reconstruction efforts in rural areas is shattering local confidence in the government, thus helping the Taliban win popular support and positioning the organization as an alternative to the Karzai government.</strong> <br />
