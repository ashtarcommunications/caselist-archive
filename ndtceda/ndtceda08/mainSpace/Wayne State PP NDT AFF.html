Text: Through all necessary means, the United States Federal Government should reduce to the point of elimination nearly all its domestic subsidies for biofuels. The United States Federal Government should exempt corn-based ethanol from requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard and expand the Renewable Fuel Standard's definition of “reneable biomass” to include thinning materials and woody residues from federal lands.<br />

Expanding sustainable feedstocks to include wood biomass is key to energy security – insulates the economy from oil shocks and sustains hard power<br />

At the same time the price of fossil fuels has skyrocketed ... while furthering securing our energy supply<br />

Adv 1: Food Prices - prices will fall, egypt not key to heg, food aid isn't key, heg sustainable, heg doesn't solve war, chinese economy risilient, russian economy risilient<br />
Adv 2: Environment – deadzones irreversable, water resilient, alt cause to ocean biod, oceans reslient<br />
Adv 3: Food Diplomacy – science diplomacy high, alt cause education, accidents wont escalate news solves<br />
Adv 4: Oil Dependency – no resource wars, renewable oil is infinite, no crunch<br />
