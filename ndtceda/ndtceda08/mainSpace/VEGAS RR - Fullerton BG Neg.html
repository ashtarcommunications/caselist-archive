The rest of the rounds we said...<br />
<br />
The language of elimination of barriers or liberalization effaces the distinction between fantasy and material reality. The barriers removed are living wages for workers and small business. The people will be liberated into low wage, temporary jobs, with no benefits - which conveniently fees the economy to seek foreign business. The plan will cause poverty, decrease freedom, famine and debt.<br />
Rebecca Saunders, 2001 (Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, &quot;Uncanny Presence: The Foreigner at the Gate of Globalization&quot;, p. 94)<br />
<br />
The aff's neoliberal discourse is a utopia of a pure and perfect market. Neoliberalism severs itself from social realities. Bordieu, 2003 (Pierre, &quot;Neoliberalism -- UTOPIA OF ENDLESS EXPLOITATION&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dc.indymedia.org/newswire/display/79016" rel="nofollow">http://dc.indymedia.org/newswire/display/79016</a><br />
<br />
And their utopian fantasy of a perfet, harmonius world is based upon a violent orgin. The harmonious social order if the persisting disorders are eliminated. The form of social order can only be sustained if the persisting disorders are eliminated. This form of social cohesion results in totalitarian coercion<br />
Stavrakakis, 1999 (Lacan and the Political, p. 107-8)<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to vote negative to traverse the fantasy. We should stop trying to make our lack bearable, and accept the anti-utopian nature of reality. Acceptance of the imperfections of our world detaches us from the symbolic order, which is a pre-requisite to change. Without it, the aff maintains the staus quo. McGowan, 2004 (Lacan and Contemporary Film, 164-169)<br />

<strong>Pedagogy vs Psychoanalysis</strong><br />
“The bodies experience is a pre-requisite to good theory. Our evidence compares the aff and neg approach. The psychoanalytic alternative reduces the body to being formed completely in the social, which justifies micro-engeneering or domination. Resistance to hegemonic subdiscourses, such as fantasmatic projections, cannot come from within this practice. A better approach is a social praxis; it remedies the aff’s failures via directness.”<br />
(Rajan 1990 )<br />
Second, the aff theory results in passivity. Stavrakakis might seem rouge, but wallowing in the gap is basically now. Dress it up how ever you want… The alienated rhetoric of the Affirmateive indoctrinates the oppressed. The sweetness of the bread and circus will draw the oppressed into the affirmative. The aff is active oppression approaching the pople to soften them up- the rsulting passivity turns the oppressed into spectators instead of considerers. This is necrophilia—a love of our death<br />
(Freire 1970)<br />
Oppresive controle reduces people to objects—inanimate thigns.. Instrumentalization is a form of inexcapable manipulation. Our impact is the denial the essential qualities of life<br />
(Freire 1970) Pedagogy of the Oppressed<br />
The affirmative is akin to a military coup—without dialogue they have created a theory of desire for the world. The danger of the coup is it does the very thing the aff tries to avoid. The coup hallows out life and existence. It takes the joy possible in the world by reducing any body to an object—a dead thing<br />
(Freire 1970)<br />
<br />
Thrid, politics should not be relegated to human desire. The affirmative approach is circular and therefore not useful politics. Politics should be paraxial, or a theory and action approach guided by dialogue. Praxis is net beneficial to the affs approach<br />
Acceptance of the oppressed/oppressor reality, once exablished, becomes a way of life perpetuated for generations. Every vote for the affirmative engrains the theory deeper into the oppressed. The result will be doing away with humanity<br />
(Freire 1970)<br />
This way out of the circular existence created by the affirmative theory is through praxis. Praxis is resolution through reflection and action with others. People are assigned a fundamental role, not provided in the aff theory. The negative theory best explains human will and harnesses it for commitment to liberation<br />
(Freire 1970)
