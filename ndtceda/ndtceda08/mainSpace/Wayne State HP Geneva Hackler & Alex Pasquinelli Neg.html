Cap k<br />
1. Matrix has us cap is perpetuated by a false belief system which is ordered by a logic of cap failure to question this invisible logic will cause extinction<br />
Zizek 99 The ticklish subject p 350-351<br />
This already brings us to the second aspect…more and more depoliticized<br />
2. removing subsidies in the expectation fo a total market continues neoliberal dominance Murphy 04 Globalization With A Human Face p 14-15<br />
This image of an autonomous economy…be more platable and reasonable.<br />
3. the alt: completely withdraw from the ideaology of cap- essential to destroy the fetish that allows cap to survive<br />
Johnston 04 Psychoanalysis, culture and society p 259<br />
Perhaps the absence of a detailed political roadmap…(“Captialist commodity etishism or the truth? I choose fetishism”)<br />

CAP CP<br />
Text: The United States Federal Government should eliminate nearly all counter-cyclical payments, direct payments and marketing assistance loans for corn while maintaining domestic subsidies for individual recipients of subsidies whom earn less than 250,000 annual income per year and ban production of high fructose corn syrup<br />
Cp solves the case and leads to broader ag reform- resolves us trade commitments, dumping, and family farm collapse<br />
