A. THE BRIDGE TO NOWHERE—<br />
<br />
IF ONLY THE MARKET RAN “CORRECTLY” NO ONE WOULD STARVE, NO ONE WOULD DIE. IF ONLY, IF ONLY.<br />
<br />
THIS CONSTANT REFRAIN SUSTAINS THE SYSTEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WRONGS IT CLAIMS TO RIGHT - THE SYSTEM OF GLOBAL CAPITALISM.<br />
<br />
THIS SAME SYSTEM DEPENDS ON UNEMPLOYMENT TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY - WITHOUT A LABOR SURPLUS HOW DO YOU PRODUCE GOODS CHEAPLY?<br />
<br />
WHEN IT FUNCTIONS CORRECTLY, CAPITALISM KILLS. 20,000 PEOPLE STARVE EVERYDAY<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|[1]]]</span>.<br />
<br />
OF COURSE, NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE DEATHS. EVERYONE KNOWS HUNGER IS JUST A NATURAL CAUSE OF DEATH. IT CAN'T BE OUR FAULT. AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T CAPITALISM'S.<br />
<br />
PREVAILING WISDOM TELLS US THE END OF HISTORY IS NOW. THE LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC ORDER OF CAPITALISM HAS ARRIVED, AND OUR JOB IS SIMPLY TO RENDER IT MORE JUST AND TOLERANT. TO “FIX” IT.<br />
<br />
THE LOGIC OF THE 1AC EXTENDS THIS NATURALIZATION OF CAPITAL. THE AFF PRESENTS US WITH TWO “CHOICES,” BOTH EQUALLY DAMNED: STATE INTERVENTION IN THE MARKET, OR A “FREE MARKET” THAT WILL RIGHT ALL WRONGS.<br />
<br />
THESE ARE THE WRONG QUESTIONS TO ASK. THE ONLY TRUE QUESTION TODAY IS, DO WE ENDORSE THE NATURALIZATION OF CAPITAL OR DO WE OPPOSE IT?<br />
<br />
MULTIPLE ANTAGONISMS FROM ECOLOGY TO MASSIVE SLUM REVOLUTIONS PROVE CAPITALISM IS DESTINED FOR SUICIDAL REVOLUTION.<br />

Agricultural subsidies. Payments made ... prices of agricultural products.<br />

T<strong>heir interpretation is self-serving—it is a loose abstraction of what a subsidy could mean and provides no limiting function to the topic. Prefer our MIT dictionary ev</strong><br />
