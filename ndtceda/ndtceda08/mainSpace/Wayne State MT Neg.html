Sexuate rights and multiplicity will never be effective in the law. The laws drive for judgment freezes multiplicity into singularity and ensures that identity is always produces in static form. (Pottage 1998, “Law and Postmodern Mind” p.14-17)<br />
“For Irigaray the quality…alter to ego.”<br />
Even Irigaray agrees that changing a particular instance of the law, such as abortion, will never alter the historical and sociologic basis under which women are excluded. Only our alt can solve. (Pottage)<br />
Sexuate rights reinforce conservative views of women and fails to transform the symbolic order- ethics demand critiquing law as the starting point for liberation (Cornell 1998, Drucilla, p.19-42)<br />
Irigaray’s conception of the feminine is culturally essentializing and closes off the use of identity for political and ethical (Cornell)<br />

Our criticism is one of starting points – 2acs focus on race is comforting but dangerous because it obscures the question of capitalism<br />
Darder and torres 99 – <u>Shattering the Race Lens,</u> from Critical Ethnicity p 173-174<br />
In recent years, “race” has been the focus of theoretical…social investment within the national-domestic sphere.”<br />
In the world of fast paced globalization struggles against racism are over-determined by our ties to capital – our criticism is more than a root cause argument – its that the 1ac focus obscures strategies of assimilation and partakes in oppression<br />
Darder and torres 99 – <u>Shattering the Race Lens,</u> from Critical Ethnicity p 175-6<br />
Over the last three decades, there has been an…overwhelming tendency of capitalism to homogenize rather than to diversify human experience<br />
Voting negative is essential to assure that our criticism isn’t simply a footnote in the aff’s struggle – our argument is that capitalism over-determines social location – K necessary precursor<br />
Darder and torres 99 – <u>Shattering the Race Lens,</u> from Critical Ethnicity p 177-9<br />
There has been a tendency in postmodern and…shaped within the context of the ever-changing global economy.<br />
The 1ac cannot divorce itself from the process they engage in – their method of politics defined by Giroux falls short because it does not adequately address the question of capitalism<br />
Darder and torres 99 – <u>Shattering the Race Lens,</u> from Critical Ethnicity p 178-9<br />
Recent works in cultural studies, multicultural education, and critical pedagogy…limitation in our efforts to construct a theory and practice of democratic life.<br />
<br />
Our alt is to start with cap – only mechanism to solve oppression<br />
Holloway 2k5 – <u>Human Dignity: Social Autonomy and the Critique of Capitalism</u> p 173<br />
The story of Frankenstein is often taken as a metaphor…revolutionary politics. Perhaps it opens new hope.<br />
Curriculum doesn’t solve- the ultimate question is where does curriculum leave us – if its tied to globalizaition it’s a non-starter for progressive action<br />
Darder and torres 99 – <u>Shattering the Race Lens,</u> from Critical Ethnicity p 188-9<br />
In summary, we deny any place for the use of “race” as an…traditions on the left that fial to support a democratic vision of life for all people<br />
Their call for intersectionality is just a strategy of erasing the root of the 1ac harms<br />

K1: Lacan/Fort-Da/Sacrifice Sacrifice - The Aff attempts to master rather than<br />
mourn the loss of the feminine by suggesting the possibility that women's lives<br />
could get better. This attempts to cover up inherent gaps in the symbolic order<br />
and obscures the reality that the symbolic order itself is the root of violence<br />
against women. The alternative is to sacrifice the affirmative. I could<br />
insert quite a few editorial comments of my own here, but I've decided not to.<br />
<br />
K2: Intersectionality/CRT K Specific to Domestic Violence Law - The way current<br />
domestic violence laws are enforced is bad for women of color. The alt is to<br />
reject the initial recourse to the law in favor of starting with movements who<br />
will incorporate the concerns of women of color before making appeals to<br />
domestic violence law.<br />
<br />
K3: Zizek/Capitalism - Capitalism is the root cause of patriarchy and violence<br />
against women. You don't kill all capitalism. The alt is to withdraw from<br />
capital. When pressed to specify what this would entail, they suggest that<br />
their advocacy is something of an individual ethical dissent from capitalism.<br />

TEXT:<br />
The United States Federal Government will ban the preemption doctrine. The President of the United States will enter into genuine binding veto consultation with Russia in the NATO Russian Council (NRC) over whether or not the United States Federal Government should integrate customary international lawto regulate private acts of gender motivated violence under section 5 of the 14th amendment. We can clairifiy<br />
