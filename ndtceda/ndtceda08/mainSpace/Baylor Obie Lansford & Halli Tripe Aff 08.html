 same as pre-districts... no changes to the fatal strategies (baudrillard) aff or the Syria aff.<br />
one round at districts we didn't use the word &quot;security&quot; in the plan text of the Syria aff.<br />
We broke a new aff at districts about Baudrillard and Challenge. There is only one cite: an article by Jerry Coulter in the <span style="font-family: Arial"> new International Journal of Baudrillard Studies (Volume 5, Number 1 (January, 2008).</span> <strong>&quot;Passings: Richard Rorty and the Voluntary Servitude of Philosophy&quot;</strong>) the 1AC is about taking thought seriously and challenging thought by provoking it to the next level. framework and T arguments are the opposite of challenge, they suck. in the article coulter talks about how baudrillard took nietzsche's thought seriously (by responding to it w/ challenge) but Rorty didn't (b/c his thought was ultimately sacrificed to humanist goals) - we compare this to debate and say that we should take debate seriously by playing the game for its own sake and seeing what may come instead of sacrificing it to humanist/boring endpoints.<br />

 <strong>we have been running the fatal strategies (baudrillard) aff listed below, as well as the Syria aff. There have been no changes made to the Baudrillard aff.<br />
We have read the same Syria plan that is listed below, no changes.<br />
We have not been reading the Lebanon or Iraq advantages in the 1ac.<br />
<br />
Only changes to the Syria aff:<br />

Baylor LT Fatal Strategies Aff (from Harvard)<br />
<br />
We begin w/ two different ways to evaluate a debate round:<br />
Judgement: a metaphysical view harkening back to prophetic claims of judgment day, putting you in the position to decide between good &amp; evil. This type of thinking is aligned w/ the empire of the good. Or<br />
We say you should evaluate our args as expressive of our life stories &amp; views on life. Our strategy will be expressive of our genuine affirmation of life and our own sovereignty. This is opposed to the empire of the good<br />
Smith 07 (Daniel w., “deleuze and the question of desire” parrhesia, number 2, p 66-78<br />
Now according to Deleuze …… and active affections, in Spinoza).<br />
<br />
<br />
We affirm resolved: that the united states federal government should increase its constructive engagement with one or more of the following countries – iran, Syria, Lebanon, the PA, or Afghanistan and that it should include offering them a security guarantee and/or a substantial increase in foreign assistance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our affirmation come about thru our fatal strategy of thnking evil. We aff the rez as it is, affirming the evil form of the rez that exists in a way that does not attempt to make the world better.<br />
To think evil means that we are complicit in everything that happens to us. Our participation in the intelligence of evil acknowledges that we are great enough for our own evil genius.<br />
Baudrillard, 05 (Intelligence of evil, p. 151-154<br />
A victim economy …. Never explain, never complain.<br />
<br />
<br />
We draw a distinction between 2 types of strategies – the fatal and the banal. Critical theory is banal, always recycling the same notions of subjectivity, responsibility, &amp; dialectical progress.<br />
Our strategy is fatal – it is aligned w/ fate, and it is destined to die.<br />
The subject and the object are reversible &amp; irreconcilable.<br />
Our fatal strategy analyzes the world from the perspective of the object b/c that view diverts every system &amp; object from its intended goal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Debate has a fatal destiny, it was invented as a rational political medium, but that has been abandoned.<br />
Debate mirrored the political disenchantment of students thru the civil rights era. It is now a magical medium, void of the real.<br />
<br />
There is no answer to how we should debate. All social spaces are constituted by the masses which fundamentally don’t believe in politics or the real.<br />
Baudrillard 83 (In The Shadow of the Silent Majorities, translated Paul Foss et al, p. 30-48<br />
The mass realizes … desire-breaching minorities.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 1AC adopts the rez as a strategy of destiny. We affirm the evil of the rez, we put subjectivity back onto the path of disappearance that puts us on a chain of symbolic forms causing a transference of identity and destiny that make life sovereign.<br />
Baudrillard explains in the Impossible Exchange (p. 33-34)<br />
A double, contradictory …. Lurching into the void.<br />
<br />
And he continues four years later in the Intelligence of Evil (p. 207-212)<br />
The text of this card is the whole chapter entitled “Anamnesis”<br />
<br />
The fate of our current world is an exponential stake, threatening an end to our species in the final collapse of the global system and its internal opposition through the sharing of extreme terrorism.<br />
But this is where we are headed, let us not turn our heads abashedly.<br />
We can’t go back and change history.<br />
Instead we should transfer the whole terroristic battle for and against the system to the symbolic level where we as individuals capable of thought have the upper hand. Any combat at the level of the real fails b/c it still participates in the fundamental nature of the modern world system that wants to make the world good.<br />
The real is stuck in a cycle of terrorism and extreme violence that must be dislodged and put onto a different trajectory, at the symbolic level.<br />
<br />
The 1ac is a mirror of terrorism. We accept the rez and its lack of truth or meaning. We are impotent in the real and thus terroristic symbolically<br />
<br />
<br />
The death of evil only exacerbates problems symbolically – this is why speaking evil is important. It teaches us to make symbolic problems disappear from the symbolic and is not involved in producing more economies of violence and misfortune.<br />
