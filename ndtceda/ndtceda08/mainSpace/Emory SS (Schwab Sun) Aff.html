<strong>Amazon:</strong><br />
Morrison is a direct threat to federal environmental law.<br />
Gildor 2005 (on case list)<br />
Anti regulatory justices have enough votes to unravel all environmental protections<br />
Klein 3 [“The environmental commerce clause,” 27 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 1]<br />
“In contrast to the willingness…undue interference by the Supreme Court.”<br />
Brazilian courts model US judicial decisions on the environment.<br />
Benjamin 3 [“Globalisation and decentralization: the role of legal frameworks”]<br />
“Throughout its development, Brazilian…planning cannot be exaggerated.”<br />
Lack of judicial enforcement is the major obstacle to lasting environmental reforms<br />
Kellman 2 [“The Brazilian Legal Tradition and Environmental Protection: Friend or Foe”]<br />
“The disparity between the laws…to lasting social change.”<br />
Amazon deforestation rates are underestimated by 60 percent.<br />
Hopkins 5 [“Amazon drought: deforestation and climate change to blame”<br />
“The finds have been backed…Earth’s biodiversity.”<br />
Illegal logging accounts for 80 percent of this destruction.<br />
Greenpeace 2k [“The Amazon’s major threat: illegal logging”]<br />
“The Amazon rainforest…rather than the exception.”<br />
Brazil contains 30 percent of all the species in the world. Deforestation is a direct threat to global biodiversity.<br />
Lazarus 3 [“A War Worth Fighting: The Ongoing Battle to Save the Brazilian Amazon”]<br />
“Brazil, a country…an area larger than Maryland.”<br />
Even if logging doesn’t directly lead to extinction, it reduces genetic diversity, which has the same impact<br />
Andersen et al 2 [The Dynamics of Deforestation and Economic Growth In the Brazilian Amazon]<br />
“The number of species…other negative effects.”<br />
Extinction<br />
Barry 5 [<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://forests.org/blog/archives/rainforest_conservation/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://forests.org/blog /archives/rainforest_conservati on/index.asp</a>]<br />
“The Amazon, the Earth’s…lost or diminished.”<br />
Amazon deforestation risks the release of deadly viruses.<br />
Chivian 93 [“species extinction, biodiversity loss and human health”]<br />
“Recently in Brazil…disruption of the rainforest.”<br />
Release of these pathogens risk human extinction<br />
Butler 4 [Rhett, “loss of species for forest regeneration”]<br />
“The emergence of tropical…around the world.”<br />
Additoinally, the amazon’s reaching the tipping point. Continued destruction will drive a stake through the heart of the world by severely altering global weather patterns<br />
Bunyard 5 [“A stake through the heart of the world”]<br />
“Scientists mapping…on the Amazon basin.”<br />
Amazon is key to sustaining the global water cycle.<br />
Bettwy 5 [“tropical deforestation affects rainfall in the U.S. and around the globe”]<br />
“Today, scientists estimate…exacerbate greenhouse warming.”<br />
Life on earth impossible without it<br />
Mohanty 6 [“water: the elixir of life and wonderful gift”]<br />
“Water: The Fountain Head of Life…principal attributes of water.”<br />
Judicial decisions are key. They shape social values &amp; give Brazil’s environmental laws teeth.<br />
Kellman 2<br />
“Deficiencies in Brazil’s…in the law books.”<br />
Courts are key. All other efforts fail without enhanced enforcement by them<br />
Akella &amp; Cannon 4 [“Strengthening the Weakest links: strategies for improving the enforcement of environmental laws globally”]<br />
“Biodiversity conservation efforts…at the same time.”<br />
Judicial enforcement can make up for ineffective agencies.<br />
Akella &amp; Cannon<br />
“The role of the judge…to environmental violations.”<br />
<strong>CRR:</strong><br />
Generic CRR good stuff (on case list)<br />
87 percent of children witness domestic violence. It’s a gateway to prison.<br />
Ver Steegh 2k [“Children in the law issue: the silent victims: children and domestic violence” 26 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 775]<br />
“E. The Effect of…have found similar results. 105]<br />
Overruling Morrison will alter the gendered patterns of our economy inside &amp; outside the home. It will prevent lower court destruction of the Family Medical Leave Act<br />
Resnik 2 [“Engendering Democracy through Understanding Federal Family Law”]<br />
“What is the difference between…grandparents or grandchildren.”<br />
Parental involvement key to school readiness<br />
Davidson 97 [“Challenge to emphasize school readiness and parental involvement,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.challenge.state.la.us/edres/school.html" rel="nofollow">__www.challenge.state.la.us /edres/school.html__</a>]<br />
“As the century comes to a close…make learning a priority.”<br />
American primacy is vital to accessing every major impact: the only threat to world peace is if we allow U.S. withdrawal<br />
Thayer, 6 [The National interest, “In defense of primacy”]<br />
“A grand strategy based on American primacy…have been humanitarian in nature.”<br />

New Advantage – ESA /Mexico Relations<br />
ESA Under attack, court shift to right will doom<br />
Bishop 06 “Does the endangered species act regulate commerce?” 24th Annual Law Conference February 23-24 2006<br />
The major federal environmental statutes were adopted….State for protection, not FWS.<br />
The rapanos decision is a harbinger of thigns to come. The esa is in jeopardy<br />
Joel B. Eisen “The State of the Chesapeake Bay In the Twenty-First Century: Article: Rapanos, Carabell, and the Isolated Man” University of Richmond Law Review May 2006 40 U. Rich. L. Rev. 1099<br />
Now just as we consider the ramping….but that is a subject for another day<br />
Shifting the court’s commerce clause analysis will create a reliable precedent that sustains the ESA<br />
Diane Summers Clakre “It’s not easy being green: The Constitutionality of Implementing the Endangered Species Act under the Commerce Clause” Southeastern Environmental Law Journal Spring 2006. 14 Southeastern Envtl. L.J. 297<br />
Whether congress’ authority….courts could create a much more reliable precedent.<br />
ESA will be used to protect the Colorado river basin from water diversion projects<br />
Wood 98 – Mary Christina Wood “Reclaiming the Natural Rivers: The ESA as applied to Endangered River Ecosystems” Arizona Law Review Spring 1998 40 Ariz. L. Rev. 197<br />
The Columbia and Colorado rivers are the lifeblood….celebrated northern spotted owl<br />
Water Diversion risks species extinction throughout the continent<br />
Glennon &amp; Culp 02 The Last Green Lagoon 28 Ecology L.Q. 903 (2002 Ecology Law Quarterly)<br />
Notwithstanding this dire state of affairs….delta a seemingly insurmountable task<br />
Preservation of the river is key to human survival<br />
Master Flack &amp; Stein 98<br />
“Imperiled Assets: Freshwater Species at Risk” January 1998 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.earthscape.org/r3/ES14443/riverslife_ch2.pdf" rel="nofollow">__www.earthscape.org/r3/ES14443 /riverslife_ch2.pdf__</a><br />
Human survival has always been dependent on….well-being and quality of life.<br />
And ESA provides western states with strong incentive to conserve water<br />
Doremus 1 “Water Population Growth and Endangered Species in the West” <u>University of Colorado Law Review</u> Spring 2001. 72 U. Colo. L. Rev. 361<br />
D. The ESA Can Encourage Changes to State Law….diminished quality of life the West’s people<br />
These states are diverting water from agriculture to support urbanization. Conservation is key to prevent the tradeoff<br />
O’Driscoll 7 “Report warns water crisis looming in arid Southwest” Updated 2/22/2007 USA Today<br />
Denver – The fast-growing states of the arid….in the arid U.S. West”<br />
Decline in US agricultural output will have global ramifications<br />

The result is famines – 2.2 billion die<br />
Roberts 06 – “Grain Drain: Get ready for Peak grain. Two months of global food reserves is all that’s separating us from mass starvation,” NOW Magazine July 20-26 Vol 25 no 47<br />
Turns out that if massive disaster strikes….a raft of new policy issues will need to be addressed<br />
(Was supposed to be 1ac, but here on was 2ac addon)<br />
Colorado river is contentious in US-mexico relations<br />
Smith ’00 <u>Inevitable Partnership: Understanding Mexico-U.S. Relations</u> 2000<br />
Water. Water rights and quality are still issues....in the future<br />
Depletion will devestate broader US-Mexico relations<br />
Cornelius et al 03 “www.environmentaldefense.org /documents/2931_RecentDevelopme ntsColoradoRiver.pdf “<br />
The lower Colorado is increasingly….would obviously be enormous<br />
Productive relations are critical to prevent the entry of nuclear weapons into the US<br />
Papademtriou 02 Sneior Associate Carnegie Endowment for International Peace “Convering Realities of the US-Mexico Relationship” July 1, 2002 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=35" rel="nofollow">__http://www.migrationinformation .org/feature/display.cfm?ID=35__</a><br />
For the Untied States….as the route of illegal entry<br />
The impact is an all-out nuclear attack. All that is needed the transfer of weapons into the US<br />
Farah 5 “If al-Qaida as nukes, why wait to use them? 8/82005 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?article_ID=45649" rel="nofollow">__http://www.worldnetdaily.com /news/article.asp?article_ID =45649__</a><br />
Bin Laden has been….timed and carelessly coordinated<br />
Courts action is key. It sets the parameters for agency implementation and only it can provide injunctive relif needed to solve the short time frame<br />
Wood 98 – “Reclaiming the Natural Rivers: The ESA as applied) Cited above<br />
As Part IV suggests….the river basin context<br />
Independent scientific studies conclude that esa will restore the Colorado River<br />
Wood 98 above<br />
The greatest challenge now facing both….protection efforts in each basin.<br />
The threat of the ESA for municipalities to account for the risk of environmental degradation when pursuing water diversion projects<br />
David H. Getches 05 “Interbasin Water Transfer: Interbasin Water Transfers in Western United States: Issues and Lessons” Water Conservation, Reuse, and Recycling: Proceedings of an Iranian-American Workshop”<br />
The endangered species act….often provide incomplete relief where the objectors lack political or legal strength.<br />
ESA is producedurally elastic enough to respond to the complexity of threats to the Colorado river.<br />
Wood 98 – “Reclaiming the Natural Rivers: The Endangered Species Act as applied…(Cited above)<br />
In both basins, the ESA….underutilizing the mechanism<br />

“the problem with inserting ideology… they aggre with more”<br />

VAWA's civil rights provision does more than fail to … elements of the problem to the best of its capabilities is exactly how a dual system should operate.<br />
<br />

CRR will successfully modernize the gender status regime. The ensuing social struggle will transform political elites into a bulwark for gender equality. History is on our side<br />

They can’t win a case turn. Current criminal penalties lack teeth and encourage domestic violence. A strong federal signal will have a greater deterrent effect<br />
