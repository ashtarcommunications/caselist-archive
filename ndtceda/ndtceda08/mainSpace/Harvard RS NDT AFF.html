<strong>Aff: Shit (Critical CAFO aff)<br />
1AC Outline:</strong><br />
Let’s start with a history: about CAFOs, EQIP, and Shit.<br />
<br />
The development of agriculture in America is intimately linked up with the way we relate to waste and shit – especially the shit that is produced in CAFOs. Concentration of animal agriculture is and has been especially important in the emergence of invisibility of waste in our everyday lives.<br />
<br />
Historically, waste was first rendered invisible in the cities as it was moved onto the farms; as agriculture was restructured and industrialized, waste was made invisible even in the country side. Everywhere one now goes, shit is “matter out of place.” But let’s be clear: this is a very novel phenomenon.<br />
<br />
In other words: two things have been rendered invisible by the respatialization of agriculture<br />
-- the shit that is produced by the CAFOs is cordoned off<br />
-- the CAFOs themselves are hidden thus rendering local agriculture ‘out of place’<br />
<br />

<br />
The paper begins by focusing upon ….. 50,000 pounds of faecal matter daily.1<br />
<br />
<br />
It is not accidental that the invisibility of industrial agriculture emerged co-terminously with the invisibility of waste and shit. The regime of waste’s invisibility relies on and profits from the ways in which concentrated agricultural relates to its own spaces.<br />
<br />
Waste and Shit weren’t always invisible – or even relegated to the disgusting. The “virtues of waste” used to be known.<br />
<br />
But, a double movement occurred: as shit became invisible in the cities, agriculture became invisible everywhere; as food production became invisible, the broader structures of invisibility were strengthened and deepened.<br />

WHILE NATURE'S ROLE IN …..key turning point-on a par even with the ecological consequences set in motion by the Columbian Exchange-in the nation's environmental history.<br />
<br />
At the other end of the historical continuum we find EQIP, the government program that subsidizes and encourages the CAFOs to keep their waste invisible and confined – and to keep themselves invisible and confined. EQIP is the filter through government relation to waste is passed.<br />

Andrew Martin ‘8 Food and Beverage Industry correspondent for the New York Times (NYT 1/13/2008 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/business/13feed.html?_r=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/business/13feed.html?_r=1</a><br />

IT may not surprise you to …..are split on the merits of using EQIP money to manage manure on big farms.<br />
<br />
But – EQIP was not always like this. Only when the program was changed in 2002 did it become legal to use EQIP money to make waste and shit invisible and confined.<br />

<br />
NOW – Let’s step back a little. Waste relations are important in society.<br />
<br />
Waste is symbolic and social – the way in which a culture treats its waste is code for its structural make-up. In other words, the relations established to waste are not just products of social ordering, but themselves make up social form; they determine both individual subjectivity and collective identity.<br />
<br />
The pressing question of today is how to energize a new relation to waste.<br />
<br />
Gay Hawkins ‘6 senior lecturer, university of new south wales The Ethics of Waste 1-5<br />
<br />
When waste is noticed something …..d what we call things is ever present.6<br />
<br />
Two factors are of crucial importance in the status quo relations to waste<br />
<br />
First – it’s confinement to invisibility.<br />
<br />
The practice of disposing waste – of making it invisible – is the means by which modern practices of consumption and production, the corresponding politics of disposability, sustain themselves. Waste, the dark shameful secret of production, is made hidden in order to continue a mode of living that produces unthinkable quantities of waste.<br />
<br />
Every time waste is disposed of – every time the boundary is drawn between what is waste and what is included – the social order founded upon invisibility is restructured and drawn afresh.<br />
<br />
Zygmunt Bauman ‘4 Wasted Lives 27-9<br />
<br />
The story we grow in and with has ….. modern war against ambivalence.<br />
<br />
The Impacts<br />
<br />
Until this politics of waste is confronted at its foundational level, a literal shit apocalypse is inevitable.<br />
<br />
The planet is full – meaning, there is nowhere else for our waste to go. Extinction, wars, conflicts, genocides – all of these will be inevitable in the attempt to make room for waste.<br />
<br />
We have already seen how it happens in our everyday life – once something is categorized as waste, it can be brushed aside and exposed of.<br />
-- The brushing aside of the shit of the CAFO is key enabler of CAFOs themselves.<br />
-- CAFOs are the key enablers in the restructuring of global agriculture and the elimination of the farmer.<br />
<br />
These ‘local solutions’ to ‘global problems’ spill over – now that the planet is full, only massacres can solve the problems of waste.<br />
<br />
Zygmunt Bauman ‘4 Wasted Lives 69-73<br />
<br />
Perhaps the two trends signalled here are but ….. outside the borders of their country.<br />
<br />
And what’s more, this social ordering – which confines waste, whether people or cafos or literal shit – to invisibility and disposability is at the foundation of global violence on a massive scale. The ability to render objects disposable and invisible is the first step on the pathway to global destruction.<br />
<br />
Giroux ‘6, Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University, 2006 [Henry A., “Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability,” College Literature 33.3 (2006) 171-196, muse]<br />
<br />
While biopolitics in Foucault and Hardt and …..that followed Hurricane Katrina.<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should eliminate the Environmental Quality Incentives Program for concentrated animal feeding operations.<br />
<br />
How to interpret the Plan:<br />
<br />
The plan’s passage follows from the genealogy that we have constructed in the 1AC. The telling of history matters: “History is vision, because history is also fighting” [Unger, False Necessity, xix].<br />
<br />
The plan is the product of political imagination. To understand reality is to conceive of it as transformed. To understand reality is to change it – we must actualize this concept of history and reality. This is our interpretation of FIAT – how we imagine what should be done.<br />
<br />
Unger ‘4 Social Theory 43-47<br />
<br />
These remarks hardly justify ….. the insight into transformation.<br />
<br />
“Programmatic thought is sequence, not blueprint, music, not architecture.” It is musical in the sense that it promotes “cumulative change [but] without evolutionary compulsion.” Each new action is merely a new note in an already established historical sequence of other notes. The plan is not an attempt to ‘re-build’ the world all over again, but to use to the possibility of a new note to change to meaning of the entire score.<br />
<br />
In re-describing the world and re-constructing knowledge of history, the world itself changes and the solutions we seek emerge.<br />
<br />
As Foucault teaches us, “the successes of history belong to those who are capable of seizing these rules…invert their meaning, and redirect them against those who had initially imposed them…A knowledge of history easily disintegrates the unity” of the present and the past. “History becomes effective to the degree it introduces discontinuity into our very being…This is because knowledge is not made for understanding; it is made for cutting” [Foucault, “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History”]<br />
<br />
Thus, the plan solves:<br />
<br />
By refusing to be complicit in the invisibility of CAFO shit is a way of confronting and encountering the invisibility of waste in the broader social order. This confrontation gives way to a new type of public political action.<br />
<br />
This move is part of creating a new and broader political imaginary in which politics includes the everyday. An engagement with waste – that happens both in the imagination and in the material world – is necessary to actualize the politics of disturbance.<br />
<br />
The actualization of this politics of disturbance is more effective the more it challenges the spaces of invisibility – which means, the site must be agriculture and CAFOs, the place where the practices of shit remain most invisible and most external to our everyday lives.<br />
<br />
Gay Hawkins ‘6 senior lecturer, university of new south wales The Ethics of Waste 120-2<br />
<br />
The tools I have used to do political …..dam Phillips calls &quot;the arts of transience.&quot;9<br />
<br />
Re-imagining waste is thus part of a larger vision of politics – a politics of the next step, rather than of total revolution. We must begin to conceive of action and its solvency within the penumbra of next steps, rather than of its end; small changes must become internalized in our account of everyday activity.<br />
<br />
Only this image of political action avoids the inevitability of crisis that comes with a sole focus on total change.<br />
<br />
This is especially true in the context of waste – it builds up as solutions are delayed because they don’t do enough. Waste’s invisibility must be challenged head on.<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">First – knowledge works like te social order – just as society confines certain products to the waste bin, so too does the telling of a story: the description or predication of what might happen in the future. Their choice to focus on the ;political process’ renders doubly-invisible the shit that is piling up, the wreckage that is ever growing. Voting negative on the politics DA would be another excuse to keep shit hidden – to keep it from emerging as part of a politics of disturbance. What they chose to highlight is just as important as what they render invisible and hidden.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Second – the presentation of certain features of American political and institutional life as un-altrable and constricting of avenues for chagn is part of the political imaginary which necessitates crisis.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The institutional fetishism that present sthe current arrangement of political institutions as constraining means that they will never change. We must, instead, view institutions not as constrainging – but as empowering and transformable. The work of the political imagination is to reconstruct our politics in thougt so that it becomes a tool for experimentalism rather than a tool for singing in our chains Its more than that the Da fails to conceive of politics beyond the political institutions of Congress, but that the argument itself <em>performs a restriction</em> of politics. This is a question that goes all the way to the ballot: to vote negative means to construct politics as constrainging; to vote affirmative is to think politics as empowering</span><br />

If we win our thesis about the make u of the social order, it determines how you view the knowledge produced by that social order: you reject as an ideological construction.<br />

The mandatory check-off contributions represent an extential threat to small farmers in America. First, the required contributions siphon off money that might otherwise be spent on advertising the superiority of produce from small farms, as the US District Court in Michigan noted in 2002:<br />
Michigan Pork Producers 2002<br />
(v. Campaign for family farms, us district court, western district of Michigan, opinion, <u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.flaginc.org/topics/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flaginc.org/ topics/</a> news/checkoff/20021025_ DistCourtOpinion.pdf</u> , p28-9<br />
“As noted above…unconstitutional and rotten.”<br />
Second, the advertising is called “generic” for a reason: it sends the very clear message that beef is beef and pork is pork, regardless of how it was raised<br />
Public Citizen 2004<br />
(Veneman v. LMA, Amicus Brief for the Respondent’s, 2003 US Briefs, 1164, p2-3)<br />
“The way beef…is just plain “beef”.”<br />
The combination of these two links threaten the very survival of sustainable alternatives to CAFOs<br />

“By paying the mandatory…supports industrialized agriculture.”<br />
UNFORTUNATELY, industrial agriculture practices will cause ecological collapse – extinction is inevitable barring a shift to sustainable agriculture<br />

“We have created…civilization will not survive.”<br />
Food is a key cause of this environmental crisis – its production, manufacturing and consumption are all leadinvg causes of enviormental problems; with food lie all of the solutions<br />
Morgan and Sonnino 2008<br />
(“The School Food Revolution: Public Food and the Challenge of Sustainable Development p5-9)<br />
“Social and natural scientists…industrialized food system.”<br />
And, if left unchanged, the food industry threatens extinction – it even outweigns nuclear war<br />
Cook 2004<br />
(“Diet for a Dead Planet: how the food industry is killing us, p.243-4)<br />
“The title of this book…concerning human survival.”<br />
FORTUNATELY, the plan solves – eliminating the checkoff program addresses the CAFOs economies of scale market advantage by creating competitive local networks of sustainable agriculture organizations<br />
Campaign for Family Farms et al, 2004<br />
(Veneman v. LMA, Amicus Brief in support of Respondents, 2003 US Briefs, 1164, p.2-3)<br />
“The organizations include…and livestock “markets today”.”<br />
And, only a shift to sustainable small farming can avoid inevitable ecological collapse<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">They’ve misread Nietzsche as an anti-institutionalist. Self-creation occurs in coexistence with rules of lwa and order. The alternative is orgiastic self-annihilation.<br />
Hatab, 2002 [ Lawrence J., “Prospects for a Democratic Agon: Why We Can Still Be Nietzscheans,” The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 24 (2002) p132-147, project must]<br />
It is a mistake, however . . . execute departures from the norm.<br />
The plan is a move toward democratic openness. This move, despite its risks of failure, is infinitely more courageous and life-affirming than the alternative’s defeated docility.<br />
Hatab, 2002 [ Lawrence J., “Prospects for a Democratic Agon: Why We Can Still Be Nietzscheans,” The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 24 (2002) p132-147, project must]<br />
Appel insists that a radical . . . done in democracy’s name.<br />
We must escape the reactive forces of pure negation through an affirmation of difference regardless of recognition<br />
Norman, 2000 [Judith, Continental Philosophy Review 33: 189-206]<br />
Obviously, we cannot escape . . . actuality of such a reply.<br />
Attempts to purify Nietzschean anti-foundationalism fall into the same slavish morality of certainty the negative wants to critique—posting the question in terms of “for or against institutions” is just another form of reactive politics. The affirmative’s critique of the intersection of identity with space and violence pluralizes Nietzsche’s thought into a radical democratic ethos of critique.<br />
