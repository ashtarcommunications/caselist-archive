Observation One: Inherency<br />
The Supreme Court did not recognize VAWA as a civil rights issue in the public realm because legislation was consumed by political controversy. This allowed the Courts to turn a blind eye to gender violence<br />
Gleason, 2001, Fall, Women’s Rights Law Reporter, Presence, Perspectives and Power<br />
“While the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 is a comprehensive piece…the economy and government power.”<br />
<br />
For this reason my partner and I advocate that the United States Supreme Court should overrule United States vs. Morrison, which overturned section 13981, on the grounds of the 14th amendment.<br />
<br />
Advantage 1: Silence and Rape<br />
<br />
State law treats domestic violence as a lenient crime, silencing victims of domestic violence<br />
Hagan, 2001, Depaul law review,<br />
The judiciary not only treated the victims…violence including domestic violence.”<br />
<br />
Rape is a tool of oppression and domination that primarily exists at the level of family life and is thus considered a private matter – making rape inevitable.<br />
Mackinnon, 2005, Women’s Lives Men’s Laws, p. 150-151<br />
“In social reality, rape and the fear of rape operate…illegal but de facto permitted.”<br />
<br />
Rape in all 4 of its dimensions each uphold a power dynamic of hierarchy in society. Rape is a reflection of masculine dominance that disempowers and silences victims of gender violence<br />
Sivakumaran, 2005, Human Rights Quarterly, Male/Male rape and the taint of homosexuality<br />
“At first sight, it may be considered that the issue of…not addressed the issue of male/male rape more fully.”<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Recognition<br />
<br />
Gender violence is not recognized as a criminal act which upholds violence in the nanme of renewing social order and rejecting intelligibility<br />
Butler, 2004, Undoing Gender, p. 34-35<br />
“I served for a few years on the board of the International gay…in the gendered order of things.”<br />
<br />
Victims of violence are trapped within the sphere of the unreal where certain lives are not considered lives at all. This gives rise to inevitable violence against those who are not recognized as real.<br />
Butler, 2004, Undoing Gender, p. 24-25<br />
“So what is the relation between violence…mean for communities there?”<br />
<br />
Our sense of personhood is linked to our desire for recognition and thus our demand for legal protection in the public realm is key to sustaining our viability as humyn<br />
Butler, 2004, p. 32-34<br />
“To assert sexual rights, then takes on a specific…for others without which we cannot be.”<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Solvency<br />
The act is gender neutral and provides for any person victim to gender motivated violence<br />
Goldfarb, 2000, spring, 102 w. va. L. rev. 499<br />
“The most innovative section of the statute…charged, prosecuted, or convicted.”<br />
<br />
VAWA was an important first step in changing our conceptions of violence. It required that we view gender motivated violence as a global issue instead of just individual ats<br />
Goldfarb, 2000<br />
“The principal contribution of VAWA’s civil…overhaul from the ground up.”<br />
<br />
We will always defend that overruling Morrison is a good idea and that VAWA is empowering. But what is most important in this round is to recognize the way that politics and societal norms have silenced womyn into a marginalized group. We need to give voice to those affected by gender motivated violence in order to give power to the resistence.<br />
Lorde, 84, p. 43-44, Sister Outsider<br />
“And of course I am afraid, because the transformation…many silences to be broken.”<br />

Affirmative Disclosure--Negative Disclosure:<br />
Well this is hard because they (this is their coach) do not read a plan or qoute people. They instead at times mention authers who support what they are saying but really do not really on them. they instead talk about how parts of debate are bad and how debate as a whole &quot;banks&quot;. This includes things like speed, flowing, mindless reading of cards. They do not say all debate is bad and do find some good in the activity they would like it to be more inclusive. They instead would love for teams to have a discusion with them about life and the topic to discuss what the future could be like in debate. They do say this in all rounds, but it is different and not a preplanned discusion and change depending on what the other teams say and also what they feel like.
