Observation 1: Bush refuses to engage Syria<br />
Israel and Syria both want peace, but Syria won’t negotiate without US engagement, and Israel can’t negotiate without US permission. The US refuses both. UPI explained on July 11, 2007 /bgb (news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/features/article_1328655.php/Rumors_of_war_talk_of_peace) <br />
'Bashar Assad, I`m ….. and most powerful ally.<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Federal Government will constructively engage Syria. The United States will offer normalized relations, a security guarantee to not pursue regime change, and support for the return of the Golan in accordance with track II negotiations in exchange for peace between Syria and Isreal, full cooperation on terrorism, pressure to moderate Hamas and Hizbollah and assistance in resolving issues in Iraq. The agreements will be negotiated quid pro quo. Funding and enforcement through normal means <br />

Advantage 1: War <br />

<br />
<a name="_Toc176922033"></a>Israel is concerned …..to lure Syria into a deal.<br />
<br />
2. Any Syrian-Israel war would spread like wildfire. The Global News Wire – Asia Africa Intelligence Wire, July 11, 2007. L/N /smb<br />
As the Middle East …… front against Israel from Gaza.<br />
3. The war will not be restrained, as both sides look for existential strikes to obliterate each other. Israel Today news reports on July 17, 2007 /bgb <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=13461" rel="nofollow">http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=13461</a><br />
A senior Israeli general …..as many missiles as possible. <br />
4. Fortunately, constructive engagement would solve completely in a very short time. The world’s leading historian of modern warfare, Gabriel Kolko explained on March 30, 2007: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/kolko03302007.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.counterpunch.org/kolko03302007.html</a> /bgb<br />
A treaty could be finalized ….. legally in a state of war. [, mar 8, 9; Wash Times, Mar 7} <br />
5. Both Syria and Israel would love the plan. David Kimche, the former head of Israel’s Foreign Ministry explained on August 4, 2006<br />

Our refusal to have ….. us than previous efforts.<br />
<br />
6. A US-Syrian relationship based on constructive engagement is the ONLY way to bring peace to the region. Rebecca Sinderbrand, Middle East reporter, August 5, 2006 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/L/Joshua.M.Landis-1/syriablog/2006/08/more-calls-to-engage-syria.htm" rel="nofollow">http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/L/Joshua.M.Landis-1/syriablog/2006/08/more-calls-to-engage-syria.htm</a> Washington Monthly /bgb<br />
The idea isn't limited to …..of the international isolation.<br />
<br />
<a name="_Toc176922034"></a>IRAQ<br />
<br />
1. The war in Iraq continues due to insurgents entering Iraq through Syria. Raghavan explains in 2007: <br />
<br />
Raghavan 2007 (Sudarsan Raghavan, Washington Post Foreign Service, “U.S. Military Calls Al-Qaeda in Iraq 'Principal Threat',” Washington Post, July 12, 2007, L/N) /cds<br />
Bergner said al-Qaeda ….. gateway for foreign combatants.<br />
<br />
2. The resulting collapse in Iraq will lead to civil war, world war and a nuclear Iran. Gitz 2007<br />
Gitz 2007 (Bradley Gitz, professor at Lyon College, “Forget the National Interest,” Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, April 15, 2007, L/N) /cds<br />
But even if Democrats won't do it, ….. nostalgic for our current Iraq troubles.<br />

Advantage 3: Terrorism<br />
<br />
1. Syria is the key to global anti-terrorism efforts. Matthew Levitt, explained on September 19, 2002, Washington Institute for Near East Policy senior fellow in terrorism studies, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=1538" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=1538</a> /bgb<br />
Inducing Syria to abandon ….. than diplomatic background noise.<br />
<br />
2. Syria provides support and safe haven for al-Qaeda and similar groups and makes it far more difficult for the US to contain them. Levitt continues: <br />

<br />
Syrian support for …. shelter and support.<br />
<br />
3. The result is a substantial risk of global nuclear terrorism, the devastation of the United States, and global depression. <br />

The threat of a nuclear …… a nation-state that needs protection. <br />
<br />
4. Isolating Syria can only increase the risk, while engaging them solves. Ben-Meir is professor of international negotiation at the Center for Global Affairs, explained in 2007  NYU, July 18, 2007 (United Press International Realpolitik: Back to the debate on Syria) L/N AL<br />
<br />
Another argument against …. immediately after Sept. 11.<br />
<br />
5. In addition to sharing intelligence, Syria would immediately shut down all militant training camps, ending terrorists threats. Ben Meir continues in 2006: <br />
