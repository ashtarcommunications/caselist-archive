<strong>Contention 1 is Afghanistan Instability</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Failed reconstruction has created an expectations gap that will single handedly unravel the nation building effort in Afghanistan – improving the quality of life for Afghan citizens is the critical variable to promote stability</strong><br />

<br />
A nuclear attack by terrorists...we will all be losers.<br />

<strong>The plan’s massive aid package will promote effective reconstruction and stabilize</strong> <strong>Afghanistan</strong><strong>. The appointment of a Special Inspector General will ensure that aid is spent effectively and bolster Karzai politically.</strong> <br />

<strong>In Addition, anti-American is tanking</strong> <strong>U.S.</strong> <strong>hegemony by spurring isolationism and making it impossible for foreign leaders to make concessions to the</strong> <strong>U.S.</strong> <strong>– winning the support of moderate Muslim populations is necessary to restore</strong> <strong>U.S.</strong> <strong>leadership</strong>  <br />
