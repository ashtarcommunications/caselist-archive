Contention one: the marine ecosystem<br />
<br />
fisheries subsidies will cause a collapse of global fish stocks, destroy the marine ecosystem, and condemn billions of people to starvation<br />
<br />

Overfishing simplifies the ecosystem—makes it vulnerable to collapse<br />
<br />
Christian Science Monitor, 08 (Moises Velasquez-Manoff, Staff Writer, “How Overfishing Can Alter An Entire Ecosystem,” June 19, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2008/06/19/how-overfishing-can-alter-an-ocean%E2%80%99s-entire-ecosystem/" rel="nofollow">http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2008/06/19/how-overfishing-can-alter-an-ocean%E2%80%99s-entire-ecosystem/</a>) <br />

it isn’t just the quantity of fish being taken from the ocean—the practices encouraged by overfishing creates the conditions for complete marine ecosystem collapse.<br />

<br />
throw away your alternative causalities—overfishing is the greatest threat to the marine environment. <br />
<br />

contention four: solvency<br />
<br />
immediate removal of fishing subsidies is critical to preventing collapse of fish stocks—all alternative methods of managing fish stocks have empirically failed and resulted in more subsidies<br />
