Seacomb 2000- “fractured community” Project muse<br />
The aboriginal political strategy……….the living community<br />
<br />
Crucial to this process is the 1ac’s depiction of mastery over death they proclaim they can tame, conquer and remove the threat of death from social order and all of humanity, this is a critical tool for control and is a strategy to gain control over all life, taking up life and death in the name of survival<br />

Seacomb 2000 “fractured community” muse<br />
<br />
A2 Permutation<br />
1ac seeks to turn subjects into instruments to be utilized, this destroys the goal of the alternative<br />
Nietzsche 1882 “the gay science”<br />

The attempt to create a universal community is a thinly veiled attempt to obliterate and marginalize differences under the guise of neutrality<br />
Secomb 2000 “fractured Community”<br />
Other feminists have……………. obliterates or marginalizes difference<br />
<br />
2ac<br />
<br />
Turn- Genocide-embracing the alt results in a normless world incapable of subliminating desire to the good- the result is the new auschitz except this time the impact is the destruction of all life<br />
Fasching 93 “the ethical challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima” p 28-29<br />
Our modern technological………….apocalyptic self-destruction<br />
<br />
Schmitt’s friend/enemy distinction only exists to provide justification for humanitarianism. He ultimately concludes on the importance of helping people<br />
Meister 2005 “never again, the ethics of the neighbor and the logic of genocide, postmodern culture<br />
Although few, if any……………..third party intervention<br />
<br />
The lave morality of neoliberal conservatism will result in the politics of disposability which cedes power to neoliberal institutions and makes fascism inevitable<br />
Giroux 2006 “Katrina and the politics of disposability” henryagiroux.com/online_articles/Katrina_Pol_Disposability.htm<br />
A new politics…………………of being reclaimed<br />
<br />
Ethics precede ontology- only though an ethical responsibility to the other can current notions of ontology be questioned<br />
Manning 93- Interpreting otherwise than Heidegger p 118<br />
But what does levinas mean……………….is first philosophy<br />
<br />
Sacred orders refuse to embrace the inherent lack, whereas holy communities embrace lack in their experience of the infinite. This prevents persecution of the other<br />

Insofar as death and life………..hedonistic last man?<br />
<br />
CX 1ac<br />
Why should we always welcome the stranger<br />
-1st 2 pieces of fashing, not being open to the stranger makes it impossible to see the ultimate value of all people, you assume you are a complete person independent of relationship to others- it is genocidal<br />
Why should we care about global poverty<br />
Same answer as above- people interconnected,<br />
Why does their wellbeing constitute ours?<br />
We are not levinas, you have to be open to the stories of others, we should not dismiss the views of others outright.<br />
Can anyone be excluded?<br />
We should be open to all people<br />
<br />
CX of 1nc<br />
What does it mean to “suck it up”?<br />
Fun name for a 1nc<br />
Alternative is to reject your mode of politics and create an agonistic model of politics- doesn’t look to be responsible to others and allow us to affirm our position within the political<br />
How do u solve our impacts?<br />
It internal link turns the impact- fasching has it wrong, we say that what you do makes extinction inevitable. We shold affirm differences with people<br />
How does recognizing that you are not someone else mutally exclusive with other pople having an influence?<br />
We should not look to other people.<br />
Does it result in getting rid of biofuel subsidies?<br />
We probably solve the impact to the aff but we don’t get rid of subsidies. Your model of politics- selfish people eliminated</span>
