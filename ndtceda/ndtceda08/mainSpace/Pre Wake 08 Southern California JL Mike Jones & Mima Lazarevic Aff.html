First, Biofuel Competition<br />
US biofuel subsidies are the single most important driver of food prices – nearly all expert analysis agrees<br />

At the time of the first flurry of concern about ... of corn-based ethanol produced in the United States.27<br />
<br />
Biofuel competition depletes the global supply cushion<br />
David Loyn, BBC News, 10.15.8, “World wakes up to food challenge,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7672536.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7672536.stm</a><br />
The price spike was more pronounced ... waves crashing against the money markets.<br />
<br />
Supply cushion is necessary to mitigate the impact of inevitable shocks<br />

While not all of these risks to food security ...for domestic and international policy-makers.<br />
<br />
Subsidy elimination is key<br />
Andrew S. Natsios, Distinguished Prof in Diplomacy at Georgetown and Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute, 9, January, The Washington Quaterly, “The Coming Food Coups,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.twq.com/09winter/docs/09jan_NatsiosDoley.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.twq.com/09winter/docs/09jan_NatsiosDoley.pdf</a><br />
Fourth, lavish subsidies to convert grain into biofuels ...to a staggering $7 billion a year.48<br />
<br />
Tax credits key – they’re a huge production incentive<br />
IBD, Investors Business Daily, 12.26.8, “Ethanol Bailout? Time to Shuck Corn,” www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx%3Fid%3D315188051785999<br />
Energy Policy: The heavily subsidized ethanol industry is the latest ...it still can't compete.<br />
<br />
Renewable Fuel Standard is key – it’s a safety net which protects ethanol from falling oil prices<br />
CSM, Christian Science Monitor, Mark Clayton, 11.7.8, “Are alternative fuels reliving the 1980s?,” Lexis<br />
But even if falling oil prices sap political will and investor ...for every gallon of ethanol they use.<br />
<br />
Eliminating both RFS and tax credit is key – otherwise the other would fill in<br />
Bruce A. Babcock, Director of the Center for Agriculture and Rural Development, Iowa State University, 5/12/08, Market Research Analyst, “Impact of the U.S. Ethanol Industry on the Price of Corn,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.marketresearchanalyst.com/2008/05/12/impact-of-the-us-ethanol-industry-on-the-price-of-corn/" rel="nofollow">http://www.marketresearchanalyst.com/2008/05/12/impact-of-the-us-ethanol-industry-on-the-price-of-corn/</a><br />
Because the blenders’ tax credit and ... met with domestically produced ethanol.<br />
<br />
Second, Speculators<br />
The RFS generates a food price bubble<br />

The Financial Times published a series Oct. 22 ... Business &amp; Media adviser Don Boudreaux.<br />
<br />
The plan would cause food prices to drop immediately<br />

Inevitably, the huge loss of grain for food caused by its diversion ... could bring prices down in the short term.<br />
<br />
Third, Research<br />
Ethanol subsidies push research dollars away from food supply innovations<br />
