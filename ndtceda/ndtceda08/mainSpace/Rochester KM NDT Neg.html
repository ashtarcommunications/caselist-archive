<br />
Off Case Args: Framework and Zizek<br />
Framework:<br />
a. interp - topical action thru advocacy<br />
b. RTP<br />
1. Links –we can’t generate them<br />
2. Extra t – can’t compete<br />
3. Topical version of their plan<br />
c. Voter for competitive equity and debateability<br />
<br />
Zizek:<br />
Calls to action are always calls wthin the coordinates of the dominant ideology, even honorable goals translated into acceptable non-challenging limits<br />
Slavoj Zizek, Critical Inquiry, Winter 2002 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/zizek/zizek-a-plea-for-leninist-intolerance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.egs.edu/faculty/zizek/zizek-a-plea-for-leninist-intolerance.html</a><br />
“Habermas designates the present…no one to anything determinate.”<br />
<br />
The revolution must strike trice, striking the form i.e. the political order and the content i.e. the symptoms of capitalism. The affirmatives strike against the content fails to go far enough as they still affirm the existing political order. This provides for disastrous politics that lock us into the very structures that we seek to reject i.e. the existing that apparatus. Vote negative for a utopian rejection of the form and content.<br />
Zizek 2<br />
“In February 1917 Lenin…different forms of retreat.”<br />
<br />
The fact that you want “good” or “real” democracy is irrelevant – the impact considers democracy as a forced choice, either we have democracy of terror – such a decision forecloses a reconception of politics<br />
Jodi Dean, Prof at Hobart and William Smith, Post Politics and the Technological Fetish, September 2003 (cf.hum.uva.nl/wetenschapsfilosofie/session3.pdf)<br />
“The workshop questions elide...brutalities of capitalist globalization.”<br />
<br />
Democracy, even in its radicalized dimension, is still nothing more than the underside of totalitarianism, it justifies violence and exclusion in the name of people who form its basis.<br />
Slavoj Zizek, Robespierre of the “Divine Violence” of Terror, Lacan.com, 2007 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizrobes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizrobes.htm</a>)<br />
“The Orwellian proposition…certainty of having to obey.”<br />
<br />
Democracy is not automatically more responsive to citizens – the structure of democracy merely assures compliance rather than representation – democracy doesn’t fail because of inaccurate real world translations, but because the notion itself is idealized<br />
Slavoj Zizek, Hooray for Bush!, London Review of Books, December 2, 2004, (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizhooray.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizhooray.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
The affirmatives belief in the law is an act of repression – kowtowing to this system of ideology ignores the nonsensical and often dominating nature of the Law<br />
Keenan, Professor of Philosophy at Fairfield University, 2004 (Dennis King, Hypatia, fall page proquest gjm)<br />
“The Real, for Lacan, is the…by making the other the other of the same.”<br />
<br />
The fantasies creates by the affirmative structure are ultimately false, the response to such failures in the inevitable violence which attempts to bridge the gap between the everyday world and the belief which undermines the affirmative<br />
Zizek 2002 (Slavoj, “Welcome to the Desert of the Real,” The Symptom Issue 2, Spring 2002, www.lacan.com/desertsym.htm, accessed 8-20-04)<br />
“As Badiou demonstrated apropos…so it means business.”<br />
<br />
Global capitalism threatens life possibilities—we must take the risk – the impact is incalculable<br />
Slavoj Zizek and Glyn Daly 2k4 (Conversations with Zizek, Polity Press, Cambridge, UK, pp. 14-16)<br />
“For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through…in an otherwise sound matrix.”<br />
<br />
The alterative is to enforce an ethical position universally opposed to capitalism. We must reject particularized struggles to pave way for the universal. We must wip the slate clean in order to confront the structural conditions that give way to the aff. This is a sequencing question.<br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, 1999 (Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, page 153-154, gjm)<br />
“It would therefore be tempting to risk…a newly emerged master-signifier.”<br />
<br />
Capitalism exists only because we believe in it. The alternative solves all of their impact turns<br />
Johnson, interdisciplinary research fellow in psychoanalysis at Emory University, 2004. (Adrian, Psychoanalysis, Culture &amp; Society, December v9 i3 p259 page info trac gjm)<br />
“Perhaps the absence of…I choose fetishism”).”<br />
<br />
Radical negation of the particular is the only mechanism to establishing a concrete universal<br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, 1999 (Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, page 91-92, gjm)<br />
“However, are things really so….as the biological anticipation of concept).”<br />
<br />
Perm cards:<br />
The logic of capitalism is contagious, one cannot undermine the dominant structure without engaging in the critique—capitalism’s ability to incorporate resistance in the dual structure of use and exchange value makes total rejection necessary.<br />
Slavoj Zizek, Critical Inquiry, Winter 2002 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/zizek/zizek-a-plea-for-leninist-intolerance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.egs.edu/faculty/zizek/zizek-a-plea-for-leninist-intolerance.html</a><br />
“The battle to be fought is thus…the free deployment of productivity.”<br />
<br />
The inertial organization of capital means that the permutation is doomed – any residual capitalist organization will regenerate itself like the hydra<br />
Kovel (Alger Hiss Prof at Bard) 2002 [Joel, The Enemy of Nature, Zed Books, p. 142-3/wyo-tjc]<br />
“The value-term that subsumes everything…and greater ecodestruction.”<br />
<br />
The aff mislocates fundamentalism as outside of us. Fundamentalism is based on a super-egoic hatred of the self.<br />
Zizek 2k6 (Slavoj, “The Antinomies of Tolerant Reason: A Blodd Dimmed Tide is Loosed: A glance into the Archives of Islam” Lacan.com/zizantinomies.htm)<br />
“There is a feature that clearly distinguishes…demanding respect for the others.”<br />
<br />

<br />
The aff plan of foreign assistance and constructive engagement is an attempt to open Syria up to market capitalism<br />
<br />
Leon Cohen 10/03 In Defens of Marxism Circle, Israeli Marxist Society<br />
<br />
“We live in an historic epoch…restoration of capitalism inside Syria.”<br />
<br />
The era of post politics radically depoliticizes the economy – this can never obtain the dimensions of universality because it precludes acts of authentic politics – we must establish a radical strategy that repoliticizes the economy in order to break free from the chains of global capitalism<br />
<br />
Zizek 99 The Ticklish Subject pg 352-355<br />
<br />
“What one should bear in mind…of building.”<br />
<br />
The aff’s belief in the law is an act of repression<br />
<br />
Dinnis King Keenan Hypatia fall page proquest 2004<br />
<br />
“The Real, for Lacan, is the maternal…other the other of the same.”<br />
<br />
Any system of ethics based around the other is ultimately a deferral of responsibility<br />
<br />
Zizek, Robespierre or the ‘Divine Violence’ of Terror 2007 Lacan.com<br />
<br />
“We can see now why Lacan’s motto…what my duty is.”<br />
<br />
Alt is to endorse an ethical position universally opposed to capitalism. We must reject particularized struggles to pave way for the universal<br />

<br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially increase foreign assistance for refugees from Iraq on the condition that Syria allows refugees from Iraq into Syria with the option of staying in Syria unless Israel agrees to end all policies of targeted assassination.<br />
<br />
Pressuring Israel to stop targeted killing is necessary to restore US negotiating cred in the Middle East, prevent coups in Egypt and Saudi Arabia and stabilize Iraq<br />
