the debates our ommunity has partaken in surrounding so called CAFOs reflects how chickens have become an absent referent. The beings that inhabit factory farms in nearly all ‘cafos’ affs are metaphors for larger theoretical questions like Agamben’s theory of bare life or how we can avoid catching the bird-flu.

 <span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">Same as round II plus one util/calculation card at the end of the 1AC.<br />
The insistence that the affirmative have a plan that can be compared to and rationally evaluated against competing alternatives endorses and ethic of dominance that positions debate as a netural abstract sphere able to evaluate two textual advocacies that can be added and subtracted from and based on calculation of abstractimpact calculus. This etehic of dominance is designed to separate ousevles from our embodied experiences and is implicitly anthropocentric and oppressive.<br />

Their statistical evidence is from parli debate.<br />
Plan text has limits. They assume stable and dominant subject to control our identity.<br />
We solve their nearly all argument.<br />
Plumwood evidence says the factory farm affects our entire lives.<br />
They can impact turn, alternative prescriptions, CAFO link arguments, or critiques.<br />
Fairness separates us from our experience. Prefer in-round abuse.<br />
Individual relations are the focus of the resolution.<br />
Critique team vs. critique team proves debate can live.<br />
Policy analysis is bad (card).<br />
Plumwood evidence. Their framework puts the blinders on us. Makes extinction inevitable from long-term impacts.<br />
We’ll defend the plan text, solves their offense.<br />
Concerns of predictability echo the dom form of masculinity that needs clearly defined, ridged forms of knowledge production. Under this view, education is only gained by reordering the same forms of thinking and locks out alternative perspectives<br />

<span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">Plumwood evidence is a not this type of rationality. It is exclusive of alternate perspectives. Our case is about women who are excluded.<br />

Reasons must be politicized by exposing its denial of feminine and earthly attributes – the aff transforms it into a force of life.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">Everything is a narrative, what they do is disembody. Negative action proves it is self-serving.<br />
WE are not Bush on ethics.<br />
We are a prerequisite to inclusion.<br />
They focus too much on identity that precludes the ability for people to change and means people leave debate. Also means there’s no impact to their education.<br />
Shanahan cards say over limiting debate is bad, other policy affs solve their offense.<br />
Wolend evidence we deal directly with personal complicity. We have a hard right economics case, they get plenty of ground.<br />
Two performance teams can still debate.<br />
Makes it impossible to self actualize the impact is Pullman and blindness.<br />
It’s masculine, rigid topic. Focus on this means we cannot envision the topic.<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Adapted from Karen Davis’ The Life of One Battery Hen;</strong> (PhD is the founder and president of United Poultry Concerns, The Life of One Battery Hen, 1990, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.upc-online.org/thinking/lifeofhen.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.upc-online.org/ thinking/lifeofhen.htm</a>)<br />
<strong><u>Sound of a Battery Hen</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>You can tell me: if you come by the</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>North door, I am in the twelfth cage</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>On the left-hand side of the third row</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>From the floor; and in that cage</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>I am usually the middle one of eight or six or three</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u>But even without directions, you’d</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Discover me</u></strong>. <strong><u>We have the same pale</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Comb</u></strong>, <strong><u>clipped yellow beak and white or auburn</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Feathers</u></strong>, <strong><u>but as the door opens and you</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Hear above the electric fan a kind of</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>One-word wail</u></strong>, <strong><u>I am the one of</u></strong> [<strong><u>9 billion</u></strong>]<br />
<strong><u>Who sounds loudest in my head</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u>Deep inside an industrial incubator filled with thousands of chick embryos, a baby hen is growing</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>During the first 24 hours</u></strong> <strong><u>the chick’s tiny heart started beating, and blood vessels formed that joined her to the yolk which feeds her as she floats and grows</u></strong> <strong><u>The baby hen has had feelings since her 21st hour of life inside the incubator, and since her 24th hour of being there, she has had eyes</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u>The baby hen has comforting exchanges with the other embryos in the incubator, but a forlornness is felt inside each bird that passes from shell to shell</u></strong>. <strong><u>The two-way communication between themselves and a mother hen</u></strong> – <strong><u>the continuous interaction which they are genetically endowed to expect, and which they need</u></strong> – <strong><u>has not occurred</u></strong>. <strong><u>The mother hen’s heartbeat is missing, and she does not respond to the embryos’ calls of distress or comfort them with her soft clucks</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u>by the 20th day, the baby hen occupies all of her egg, except for the air cell, which she now begins to penetrate with her beak, inhaling air through her lungs for the first time</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u>Twelve hours later, wet and exhausted, she emerges to face the life ahead</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u>The baby hen and her fluffy yellow companions are being wheeled down the hall in the incubator cart</u></strong>. <strong><u>When it stops, three workers</u></strong> <strong><u>toss, sort and dump the discarded shells, the half-hatched chicks, the deformed chicks and</u></strong> the <strong><u>male chicks into the trash</u></strong>. <strong><u>One of her companions hops onto the edge of the tray and falls to the floor</u></strong>. <strong><u>High-pitched screeches occur as the carts</u></strong>, <strong><u>crushing the fallen ones, plastering them in blood on the floor</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u>Now it’s the baby hen’s turn, and as her face is pushed against the blade, an agonizing crunch and pain shoots through her beak and her body causing her to flap her wings, cry out, and lose her bowels</u></strong> <strong><u>the traumatized chicks, each with a stumped red hole in front of her face, are sprayed with something chemical, and the baby hen blanks out</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u>Throbbing pain in her head and her beak, jostling of others around her, wires hurting her feet, air that makes her sick. The hen can never get comfortable. She cannot obey her impulse to walk and run. She is in a cage in the &quot;pullet&quot; house, where she and the other young hens, thousands of them, will eat mash from the trough, excrete into the manure piles, and grow until, five months later, they are moved to the layer house and into the smaller egg-laying cages</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u>She suffers excruciating pain when she accidentally bumps her wounded beak several times against the metal trough when she tries to eat the mash</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u>When a cagemate dies and rots</u></strong>, <strong><u>the hen stands on top of her to get off the wires</u></strong>. <strong><u>Her cage is somewhere among stacks and rows of cages</u></strong>. <strong><u>She is in a universe of cages</u></strong>. <strong><u>Eggs form in her body, are expelled with difficulty, and roll away</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u>Somehow the hen has managed to get her head and one spiny wing stuck between the bars of her cage, and she can’t free herself. Ignorant people say that a chicken doesn’t know she is going to die, but the hen knows that she is going to die. When a hand – the most brutal, cruel thing she knows – opens the cage door and pulls her backward from inside, yanking her almost in two, she shrieks as she is dropped into the bucket where other hens, oozing eggs, pieces of shells and blood await her. They absorb her into themselves, as something heavy and soft plops on top of her that moves just a little, or so she feels, in being carried away</u></strong>.<br />
<strong>SIMILAR STORIES LIKE THE ONE JUST TOLD ARE UNFOLDING IN 9 BILLION DIFFERENT INSTANCES IN THE BROILER CHICKEN INDUSTRY AROUND THE COUNTRY. EVEN NUMERICALLY, THE 9 BILLION CHICKENS SLAUGHTERED EVERY 45 DAYS DOESN’T TELL THE WHOLE STORY BECAUSE THAT NUMBER DOESN’T ACCOUNT FOR THE 250 MILLION MALE CHICKS BORN IN THE EGG INDUSTRY THAT ARE GROUND UP ALIVE MINUTES AFTER THEY WERE BORN, NOT FOR SALE TO SLAUGHTER BUT BECAUSE IT COSTS MORE MONEY TO KEEP THEM ALIVE AND SELL THEM FOR THEIR ‘MEAT’ THAN TO EXTERMINATE THEM.</strong><br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Extend Walker – our interpretation is debate is literary; a good or bad story is evaluated according to the experience it writes into narrative. Our story writes emodiment into narrative while their neutral, abstract interpretation excludes it. </span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Alienated Knowledge – Walker argues debate as literary transforms debate into sphere that teaches students to abandon their perspectives or be cst out of the activity creating alienation rel. to knowledge that drives debates from the activity.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ethics – Extend Davis; the experience and perspective of the broiler chicken cannot be expressed through their interpretation because it’s evaluated from the top down perspective of the mountain that silences individual voices and perspectives behind large abstract identities of meat or humanity that must be addressed by larger abstract entitites. Davis says this allows us to sacrifice or otherwise discount the ind. Lives that make up larger abstract notion of life. When we hear how 250 million baby chicks every 45 days are stomped and ground to death in a meat grinder it sounds unfortunate but only when we open our perspective to that o fthe broiler chicken we can see not just the physical by emotion and psychological damage that occurs as a result of separation from ones family, being oppressed by a knowledge structure they had no part in creating and sitting in a cage that’s so cramped you can’t even turn around for your short miserable life. This lack of ethics outweighs death since without the possibility of individuals to achieve meaning they can’t even explain why death is undesirable. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Apathy – extend Weiland and Adam; our aff is a prerequisite to answering the question of the rez. Subs make dom certain identities of broiler chickens that overwhelm all possibility for emotive or ethical relationships by taking away an individuals ability to define for themselves what is ethical production. Skipping our affirmative project trains debaters to be ethically numbed because our sense of self is completely autonomous and isolated from the world, only through the abstract entity known as the fed gov’t could ethical agency be achieved. This takes out any benefit to their form of debate because any education or intelligence students gain will be paralyzed by learned powerlessness. </span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This is the biggest internal ink to debatility – debate as literature is the only way to truly actual debate because it opens all aspects of debate to debate. Their notion that we need limits and preparation for clash intellectually cripples debaters.<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1.) The insistence that the aff have a plan that can be compaed to and rationally evaluated against competing alternatives endorses an ethic of dominance that positions debate as a neutral abstract sphere able to evalue two textual advocacies that can be added and subtracted from and based on calculation of abstract impact calculus. This ethic of dominance is designed to separate ourselves from our embodied experiences and is implicitly anthropocentric and oppressive.<br />
Birkeland, 1991, (Janis, An ecofeminist critique of Manstream Planning, Trumpeter 8:2 (spring) pg. 71-72<br />
“Traditionally Planning has generally been conceived …. It is ultimately conflict generating.”</span><br />

3.) new plan text moots strategic benefits and are worse cause have to take prep time to determine strategy after cross-x<br />
4.) locating advocacy exclusively in text privileges abstract linear coding that shuns the openness and balance of the advocacy as a speech act in favor of an oppressive and patriarchal form of debate<br />
Shlain, 1998, (Dr. Leonard Shlain is a neurosurgeon at California-Pacific Medical Center and contributor to “The Encyclopedia of Creativity, The Alphabet Versus The Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image”, 1998, pg. 44)<br />
“Writing involves the muscles of only one side of the body. …. Patriarchy and misogyny have been the inevitable result.”<br />
Concerns of predictability echo the dom form of masculinity that needs clearly defined, ridged forms of knowledge production. Under this view, education is only gained by reordering the same forms of thinking and locks out alternative perspectives<br />
Rose, 2003, (Gillian, A body of questions, “Using Social Theory”, pgs. 58-59)<br />
“Irigaray’s reconfiguring of the female body …. Solids is both bodily and conceptual.”<br />
Advancing framework is enough to just an aff ballot – independ of the desirability of the aff, forcing feminists to constantly justify their educational worth is a politically and psychologically motivated act that excludes the voice of the voiceless. Our long Davis evidence proves arguments like these are intimidation tactics.<br />
Cuomo, 2002, (Chris, Professor of Philosophy and Women’s Studies, and Director of the Institute for Women’s Studies at the University of Georgie, “On Ecofeminist Philosophy” Published in Ethics and the Environment 7.2, (2002):1-11<br />
“As in most male-dominated fields, ….. but politically and psychologically motivated?”<br />
Forcing rhe aff to speak the language of policy professionals anesthetizes ind and moral feeling behind the objective ideal of policy<br />
Torgerson, 1997, (Douglas, Policy Professionalism and Voices of Dissent: The Case of Environmentalism”, Polity, Vol. 29, No. 3 (Spring) Pgs. 345-374)<br />
“Government confidently portrayed new rules and agencies …. Problems and speaking its language.”<br />
The negatives notion of gov’t fiat relies on a techno-optimist fantasy who’s goal is to bracket political and cultural reflection behind the band-aid of imagined change.<br />
Plumwood, 2002, (Val, “Environmental Culture: The ecologist crisis of reason”)<br />
“In an alternative version of the techno-optimist …. Its own role in the crisis.”<br />
