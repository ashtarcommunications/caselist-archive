Congress will amend the 2007 Farm Bill by enacting a payment cap of $250,000 per farm for &lt;Insert&gt; subsidies. These payments will be de-coupled from the volume and yield of agricultural produce of the farm receiving the subsidy.<br />

AFP, 9/26/03<br />

When you're working a small and marginally viable family farm in the US Midwest, the prospects of losing federal subsidies or having to compete with a flood of cheap imports are not appealing ones. <br />

The United States Federal Government should offer the </u>_ industry a buyout in exchange for accepting the elimination of nearly all domestic subsidies. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation One : Theory<br />
<br />
Conditional cuts are a key source of negative ground on this topic. Voluntary buyouts are analogous to unilateral versus negotiated cuts. These counterplans are crucial given the one sided nature of the subsidies literature. <br />
<br />
Observation Two : Net Benefits<br />
A voluntary buyout solves the case, avoids political backlash and rural economic collapse<br />

The United States federal Government should eliminate the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit for conventional biofuel. The United States Federal Government should offer to eliminate the Ethanol Import Tariff is Brazil agrees to make concessions over Tariffs on Manufactured goods. The United States Federal Government should no longer require compliance with mandates that can be met with conventional biofuel.<br />

The Counterplan solves the case and garners concessions from Brazil on tariffs over manufactured goods. This is key to locking in US access to the Brazilian market.<br />

We also read a couple of cards from Kappeler in 95 which say its bad to externalize violence<br />
<br />
We live in a world which is increasingly globalized—ours is now a global village whose problems demand solutions of an equally broad scope. The affirmative’s project is emblematic of this approach to the political which can only see the earth as a game board upon which to enact new fantasies of control, all in the name of an abstract common good. Despite their good intentions, this project of ordering authorizes colonial violence in order to remake the world in our image. Their methodology is one which can only alienate us from others, destroying the local concern necessary to effectively respond to oppression.<br />

<br />
It has become a convenience… now plainly visible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nowhere is this tendency towards ordering more pronounced than in our interactions with the earth itself. Their call for a global shift in our agricultural practices is delusional and counterproductive—recreating a relationship with nature where we forsake equal partnership for technological mastery. It is this impulse towards control which is responsible for their harms and makes environmental devastation inevitable. Only a refusal of their politics of domination in favor of a more modest, local, form of care can make possible real sustainability.<br />
