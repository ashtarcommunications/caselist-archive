<strong>Round 1 V Gonzaga BC</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Kritik</strong><br />
<strong>The aff’s attempt to change the way we relate to nature and move away from technology gives conservatives the opportunity to backlash, makes reunion with nature impossible, and prevents <u>effective</u> action needed to save the planet-technology and progress should be embraced.</strong><br />

&quot;If you bleed green...waiting for anybody&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>The alternative is to embrace the bright green paradigm-this approach is a commitment to upgrading civilization and using technology and market forces to solve the problems of the status quo. Only the alternative can stave off extinction.</strong><br />

<strong>Our tactic of embracing high technology and utilizing market forces is the only hope for survival-the break from the old narrative must be COMPLETE. This dooms the permutation.</strong><br />

<strong>Round 5 v Fullerton BG</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Kritik</strong><br />
<strong>The aff’s labeling of <em>Tropic of Orange</em> as “magic realism” reentrenches the colonialist structures that it seeks to dismantle-it imposes meaning on a work of fiction in the same way that a colonial power imposes order, and setting up the Other as “magical” recreates binaries</strong><br />
<strong>Litvack 99</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Dr. Leon, MA candidate in Modern Literary Studies in the School of English at the Queen’s University in Belfast, 6/23, “Magic Realism: A Problem”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/india/Magic.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/india/Magic.htm</a>, AVLB] </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Magic Realism</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; is </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">a term</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span>....before realizing his/her hand is being deeply cut&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Magical realism replicates Orientalism-much like European readers were able to formulate Orientalist views of Africa and Asia through literature grounded in exoticism, current readers of magical realism lock in stereotypes of the Other. The neg opens up space for different forms of authentic art to reach the aff’s goals.</strong> <strong>This means you vote negative-their framework is liberation of the oppressed-if we win that they create hierarchies and binaries as a result of their advocacy, it proves the aff is a bad methodology for liberation.</strong><br />

Ending dumping solves for Mexican maize producers-comparatively better than ending subsidies<br />
