<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Performance Pedagogy</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Fuck Up White Supremacy to create a new reality</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our prerequisite to politics rejects personal and political regimes and is key to a liberatory framework</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Referencing culture doesn’t count</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Resolution is steeped in a culture of blame</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">White power structures crush other voices and are guilty of destruction</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Their epistemology is fucked up</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">LINKS</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Overview</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">- Started Lauren Hills Fugees song saying “Father freed me from this gondage. Your resolution is no type of solution”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">- Culture is a way we refer to ourselves. We challenge the assault on African humanity. We humanize language by looking at producers of our wealth.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A2:Plan is good</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">They don’t talk about cultural resources. Their relationship to slavery is still hegemonic. Warner evidence from the 1nc-unmarked cultural spaces are the way they reinforce themselves and pertetuate white dominance. It is not the plan our argument attacks, it is the speech act of the 1ac that unmarks whiteness and allwows it to engage itself</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A2:We resist slavery, complex issue, we speak from linguistic perspective, Sullivan card</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">- Extend Rodriguez, it’s not a root cause, we address how white supremacy organizes the world politics</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">- Whiteness is the power structure. Recognizing this, we need strategies that work through this lens. Aff is an unmarked cultural space</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">- Spanos from 1nc-they produce a neoconserative agenda in this room and in policy spheres. Our action is an internal link to their impacts. They do not have the necessary alternate pedagocial or methodological analysis. Their policy focus does not necessitate the voices of the enslaved their evidence mentions</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">- Thus we better engage the state, we affect the way politics are formulated both here and outside the activity. Their knowledge not being centered on whiteness reinforces the invisibility of whiteness</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">a2: Speaking here reorients the resolution</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">- the embrace of the resolution is the embrace of the dominat relationship of the discourse of the resolution</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">a2: sanitization</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">- they sanitize by isolating one instance and saying, “everything’s okay now!”. They still leave the fundamental structure intact and justify aggression elsewhere. Thus the speech act is an olive branch. The plan may not actually enforce aggression, but it justifies future actions.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PERMUTATION</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-we are a policy</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-1nc whinters evidence – bodies of color are reintegrated. The perm reinforces antagonism and is a diversionary smokescreen designed to perpetuate their institutions</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-Rap leads into argument about how the perm is an act of white privlege that subsumes culture, then becomes oblivious to it</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-Perm is a policing mechanism, maximum order with minimum change is its goal, as is commodifying blackness – BELLS NOVO 96</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-Their permutation allows for a fill-in where we don’t recognize culture</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">ALT</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A2: policy analysis key</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-Policy analysis is important, but we need a different type of policy analysis. They do not differentiate from 1nc shaw evidence. Policy structures do not necessitate exploited voices</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-Our affirmation of humanity allows us to understand the world</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-Mills evidence – inverted epistemology is how we are hurt. The plan has no bearing to real life people . Debate is a fantasy land where the aff pretend that it can help African farmers. Advocating this strategy exports more whiteness into society</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-Look at the wiki. They changed their aff just to fight us. This is the disinterested argument that spanos is talking about</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-We need coalitions that can create a collective identity for culture and resist their oppressive pathology. ALCOE 2006</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-More ev on this topic. They serve as agents of discrimination that subsumes critical analysis. Uncritical examination brought by the 1ac causes more power. Their affirmation of “higher education” perpetuates more whiteness. Thus they cannot result in a new epistemology.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A2: Lutz-Ignoring politics causes more totalitarianism</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-We engage on our own terms, this policy solves totalitarianism.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A2: Jensen – personal change can’t change institutions</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-We have a clear sencario for materialization of our impacts. They do not</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-Their pathology has an effect on the community. PICs, condo Cps, perms, etc, all these come from the white methodology. Our performance changes the way we participate in the activity. We maximize participation by talking about our relationship to state structures.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A2: excluding whites bad</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-Whiteness created by landowners that wanted to stop the revolutions that creates separation. It’s not a culture, it masks its strategy as a culture. This exclusion shows that we can draw from cultural resources separate from whiteness.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A2: homogenization-exclude others from the project causes worse social domination</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-Race is key to understand material ways all black people are affected by white supremacy separate from class. Everyone can use our advocacy as a resource the challenge.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">FRAMEWORK</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-We are a policy option, doesn’t apply</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>CROSS-X OF THE 2NC</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">MW-how do we know if someone relates to their language?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">T-The Morrison evidence says whiteness is the dominant one</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">MW-But we have this Sullivan evidence-langauge of policies important. Doesn’t that address that?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">T-Irrelevant. Its’ relationship to language</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">MW-But we do that.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">T-That’s situated in dominant western paridigm.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">MW-Aren’t we a linguistic cultural practice?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">T-You have a relation to lagnguage, dominated by western cultural paradigms</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">MW-Then where do we start? We’ve reearched cotton all year about slavery. Why is that whiteness?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">T-It’s an unmarked cultural space.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">MW-But why is MY CULTURE, not just white culture in general, bad?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">T-Our warner facet evidence. When you have discourse that don’t marke themselves culturally, it’s how whiteness reproduces itself.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">MW-How do we legit the state if we don’t endorse oppression?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">T-Your response in a debate round to end subsidies</span><br />
<br />
<u><strong>Round Six</strong></u><br />

2NC<br />
Similar overview to other rounds, however:<br />
a2: perms<br />
1. Colonial--trying to reap the benefits of our advocacy without actually performing it means we can never be prioritized or recognized.<br />
2. Opression they talk about is rooted in specific linguistic stance<br />
2nr went for case turn and alt solves opression in case. </span><br />

<u>Round 4 - additional scouting info</u><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Round 4- Kansas BJ v. Towson CL<br />
Michelle Kesling- Wayne State<br />
<strong><u>1AC- Kansas- full cites sent in by another observer from Northwestern</u></strong><br />
Biofuel subsidies increase food prices- Lewis in 08<br />
US biofuels are morally bankrupt and leads to humanitarian disaster- Carlson 08<br />
Biofuels are leading to nationalistic environmentalism- leads to racism and hides the true oppressor<br />
Aff is a criticism of imperialist oppression- direct cause of rising food prices<br />
Imperative to speak out against biofuels- public debate is key<br />
Plan- should not institue biofuels- topographical analysis<br />
Key to creating solidarity- Katz 01<br />
Topographical refrence key- Gibson and graham<br />
Intersectionality is key to address inequality to overcome discrimination- butler? 04<br />
Global focus is key- only the aff operates outside the border<br />
Rich and textured analysis of the aff is key to analysis priviledge-<br />
Presentation of the 1AC is key to narrative- derow<br />
<strong><u>1NC- Towson- same as case book plus one additional card</u></strong><br />
<strong>additional card-</strong> The voices of the oppressed need to be heard from their social location the revolutionary aesthetic makes more spaces to narrate other’s oppression- Bove, A. Paul, 2000, an educator on globalization, emergence, intellectuals, and problems of truth in relation to literature, criticism and philosophy, Edward Said and the work of the critic: Speaking Truth to Power<br />
“So powerful does Said… relation to those very formations”<br />
In this activity the white man acts as a maybe. Subsidies are not the problem<br />
Debate policymaking is the same as white supremacy- sean 04<br />
Link- use of culture as a reference and not a resource<br />
Resolution = white linguistic framing<br />
Debating itself is the link to bad practices<br />
Don’t change the position of whiteness<br />
F/W- should be about liberation of the oppression<br />
Language stunts growth-<br />
Orientation towards the world makes it real<br />
Fuck up whiteys order<br />
Johnston 06- performance as resistance<br />
Aff acts as a delusional fantasy<br />
Neg access’ the public debate argument<br />
Neg is a prereq- engagement for the politics of the 1AC<br />
<strong><u>2AC</u></strong><br />
FW- best strategy to solve oppression<br />
Net-benefit bc address other cultures<br />
Justifies perm<br />
Biofuels are another part of oppression<br />
Topography arguments<br />
Intersectionality is part of the solution<br />
Globalization does not affect everyone- topography key Katz 03<br />
Imperialist oppression- open borders<br />
Solidarity with other movements<br />
Speech act<br />
Major double bind don’t meet fw or they don’t access the rest of the adv<br />
1AC directly confronts white supremacy- subsumed by global capital drive<br />
links to intersectionality argument<br />
policymaking doesn’t link to 1ac<br />
culture works together<br />
whiteness reifies whiteness- ahmed in 04<br />
don’t use resolution<br />
doesn’t use traditional debate<br />
do aff and use NOMO in cultural- card<br />
perm utilize both the aff and neg<br />
perm do the aff</span><br />
<ol><ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">topography Katz 01</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">NOMO focus fails- clark 04</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Perm allows use to incorporate identity- </span></li></ol></ol><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><u>2NC</u></strong><br />
Play music- Lauren Hill<br />
Coaches and collective NOMO is a collective experience to challenge linguistic domination<br />
Culture as a resource to challenge dominant ideologies<br />
Agreement different then perform politics- this is the distinction between frameworks- not just methodology<br />
Language is a way in which to situate resistance<br />
Their arguments for intersectionality ignore agency and subjectivity<br />
Lauren Hill as an example<br />
Neg is a pre-req to any policy analysis- people need to engage in local resistance before global resistance<br />
Debaters should change their local spaces- this is what particular pedagogical practices within the activity should change<br />
They don’t make a root cause argument for white supremacy- the countries that they outline as being bad are majority white- this proves they are the normal power brokers. Patriarchy example<br />
People can self determine their own cultural identity and then create coalitions<br />
Fluidity of identity but recognizes it as a site of resistance.<br />
NOMO is an example of performance of humanity- culture and subjectivity<br />
Key to challenge these pedagogical practices in this way<br />
NOMO key to challenge<br />
PERMS- group them<br />
Incorporation of black bodies- this keeps the same antagonisms at bay<br />
1st perm- allows people to not confront antagonisms- DA to the perm. Methodology<br />
their arguments don’t apply when you recognize fluidity<br />
allow other cultures to engage in things other then NOMO</span><br />
