<strong><em>Off Case Args:</em></strong> Dadaism CP: Fullerton offers the following counter-plan to be textually defended in the most dada sense- least soybeans, subsidies, and/or<br />
reduce its least domestic Concentrated<br />
fisheries, domestic Feeding rice<br />
USFG support, domestic Operations, dairy,<br />
agricultural eliminating biofuels, corn, dairy,<br />
domestic cotton, Concentrated the dada<br />
<br />
I'm reading this counter-plan to show that you can perform contrary actions at the same time, in one single, fresh breath; I am against action; as for continual contradiction, and affirmation too, I am neither for nor against them, and i won't explain myself because i hate common sense.<br />
<br />
Dadaists demolish values and traditions. Demolish-Negate-Negatives-Opposition? To what? we refuse to say. question all traditions, all artistic forms and forumlas, including even the language on which all literature and all thought were based; no new canons, new formulas or new truisms to tkae the place of the old.<br />
<br />
we are the anti-theory, the anti-movement, the anti-aff, the anti-anti-anti-double bind double turn. we would quadruple dog dare you but then you may shoot your eye out and blame us. instead we will just have to doubt you.<br />
<br />
every man must shout: there is great destructive, negative work to be done. to sweep to clean. the cleanliness of the individual materialises after we've gone through folly, the aggressive complete folly of a world left in the hands of bandits who have demolished and destroyed the centuries. with neither aim nor plan, without organisation: uncontrollable folly, decomposition. those who are strong in word or in strength will survive, because they are quick to defend themselves; the agility of their limbs and feelings flames on their faceted flanks. why vote negative? the answer is obviously 42!<br />
<br />
I assure you: there is no beginning, and we are not afraid; we aren't sentimental. I destroy the drawers of the brain, and those of social organisation: to sow demoralistation everywhere, and throw heaven's hand into hell, hell's eyes into heaven, to reinstate the fertile wheel of a universal curcus in the POwers of reality, and the fantasy of every individual. A philisophical question: from which angle to start looking at life, god, ideas, or anything else. Everything we look at is false. I don't think the relative result is any more important than the choice of patisserie or cherries for dessert. The way people have of looking hurriedly at things from the opposite point of view, so as to impose their opinions indirectly, is called dialectic in other words, heads i wind and tails you lose, dressed up to look scholarly.<br />
<br />
if i shout:<br />
ideal, ideal, ideal<br />
knowledge, knowledge, knowledge<br />
<br />
If all of them are right, and if all pills are only pink, let's try for once not to be right.<br />

ROLE OF THE BALLOT<br />
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding! What to do? What to Do? Why has the negative made this so hard??? Ha-ha Life is Hard.<br />

LINK DEBATE<br />
1. The affirmative keeps trying to make sens - Language and Text everywhere, but Not An Intelligent Thought To Be Had. Everything we look at is false. The World is relative - we will all see it differently. The belief that we can make sense is the fantasy of every individual.<br />
2. Truth - the aff evidence is based on attempts at shreds of truth - the K shreds truth. If there's no truth statement in the aff then vote neg on presumption. That there's no harm and the world is radically disconnected so there is no solvency.<br />
3. Anxiety - The aff makes eating a problem and the plan produces self-control. No Self or Control in DADA. Pleasures aren't anxieties<br />

ANSWER TO PERM<br />
Counterperm: of the not to the both all of the double plan a enough status can perm of the perm double both non-competitive double critique links perm all critique perm is dada<br />
<br />
Dada doubts your permutation because it exists in langauage and text - and everyone knows we can't know either<br />
