Support for corn based ethanol is based on a false consciousness created by environmental ideology – the insistence that natural means of energy production are benign leads to unethical policy making<br />

“ an ideological distortion…an ideological distortion<br />

Subsidies only exist because of dangerous political maneuvering – there is no evidence ethanol can transition away from oil – making decisions based on the political maneauvering of the ethanol lobby assures mass starvation – we must be willing to call Ethanol out and reject the method of politics which supports continued subsidies<br />
