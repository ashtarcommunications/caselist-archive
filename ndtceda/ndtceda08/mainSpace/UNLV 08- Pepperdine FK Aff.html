<strong>Griswold in 6</strong> <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Daniel, Director of Cato Institute’s Center for Trade Policy Studies, “Grain Drain: the Hidden Cost of U.S. Rice Subsidies.” Executive Summary.

The US works in a double standard, the US taxpayer pays 2/3 the price of production for rice so that the subsidized company can dump the product at less than its market price<br />

<span style="font-size: 14pt">Observation Two: Impacts </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt">First is the destruction of women: </span><br />
