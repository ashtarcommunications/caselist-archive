Their project of furthering gender equality in debate is done a disservice by their connection of this goal to the ballot. IN order to tie their argument to the ballot they must establish a framework in which debaters are judged for their own position vis a vis gender in debate. This moral judgment is not the way to create alliance or community. Ethical reflection is sustained not by the combative and competitive framework of the debate round itself, but through genuine reflection and conversation.<br />
Judith Butler, Diacritics 31.4/ p. 30-31<br />
“In this sense, recognition could not be reduced to making” “destroy lives with impunity”<br />
<br />
Their demand forces us to have coherent narratives of our own emergence as subjects in debate- the self is never coherent and knowable in the way that a discussion of our own relationship to debate would presume<br />
Butler – same cite<br />
“It may be that a certain ability to affirm” “conditions of recognition itself”<br />
Introducing new sources of knowledge [like personal experience or narrative] is coopted by approaching the court, they will be redirected through the legalist aesthetic and incorporated in ways that never threaten lwa’s hegemony<br />
Pierre Schlag, 1997 [feb, 110 harv l. Rev 877]<br />
„this process by which the stamp of langdellian“ „are all utterly improbable“<br />
<br />
Injecting narratives into the law causes events importance to be played up and seized for purposes beyond its original intent – scrutinize the materials used to make your decision relying on story causes apocalyptic conflict and destruction – so reject them<br />
Mark j. osiel, December 95 144 u pa l rev 463<br />
“this is an inherent danger” “debate of current policy”<br />
In the context of law, personal narratives are a dangerous double-bind: either a they’re read too broadly and used to unfairly claim everyone’s experience should be the same or b. its read narrowly and no one can learn anything from it<br />
Osiel 9above)<br />
‘these are highly sensitive” “confrontation with the historical”<br />

The plan is the OPPOSITE of what’s needed to revitalize politics – the logic of marketizing every aspect of life makes national-level politics and exercise in domination and futility. Rejecting marketized ‘politics as usual’ is the only way to TRULY revitalize the political sphere. This evidence starts with the paragraph after their Boggs card and concludes neg.<br />

CLS/Collective Memory<br />
<br />
The operation of law is steeped in violence, but the aff sanitizes it by using the law as a tool of redemption. Taking the role of law-giver ignores that legal protections carry the underside of punishment, which can reduce any of us to bare life.<br />
Ariella Azoulay – February 2005. 26 Cardozo L. Rev. 1005 “The Future of a Past: The Loss of Critique and the Critique of Violence.”<br />
“When Benjamin presents the rule of law… undermine its exclusive rule:”<br />
[gendered language said in context]<br />
<br />
Moreover, the aff narrative of law purging itself of past mistakes is an illusion, the vision of a redeemed Constitution just over the horizon allows anything in the name of a shining future that will never arrive.<br />
Amy Kapczynski - February 2005. 26 Cardozo L. Rev. 1041. “The Future of a Past: Historicism, Progrerss, and the Redemptive Constitution.”<br />
“Benjamin’s historical project went… past have really been overcome.”<br />
[gendered language said in context]<br />
<br />
This is particularly true in the context of overruling Morrison- trying to step into a world where domestic violence justified national attention glosses over the historical exclusion of women from the political process, and the skewed sense of national priorities that resulted, legitimating the forms of domination they aim to criticize.<br />
Amy Kapczynski - February 2005. 26 Cardozo L. Rev. 1041. “The Future of a Past: Historicism, Progrerss, and the Redemptive Constitution.”<br />
“The objection that Benjamin…the pas procedurally illegitimate.”<br />
<br />
History is a fractured field of causes and effects all tangled together, but their attempts at interpretation impose a linear narrative. This is hostile to alternative perspectives, forcing all subjects into adherence with a dominant image of social progress and collective identity.<br />
Joseph Jenkins – Summer 2005. 17 Cardozo Stud. L. &amp; Lit. 249. “Heavy Law/Light Law: Walter Benjamin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Robert Bork, Duncan Kennedy.”<br />
“Nietzsche’s idea of der Wille… crucial protection against tyranny.”<br />
<br />
This vision of Constitutional redemption is the basis of global militarism, our capacity for mass destructiton marks the boundaries of a community defined be an overarching notion of progress, which can destroy the planet to protect that sacred heritage.<br />
Paul W. Kahn, Spring 2000. Chicago Journal of International Law, 1 Chi. J. Int’l L. 1. p 4-9<br />
“The rule of law, for us…equality under the rule of law.”<br />
The alt is what we’re doing now. Criticism scrambles the progress narrative and reveals alternate meanings contained withint he past. Exposing historical constructions as fabrication defuses law’s justification for violence.<br />
John Lardas Modern – 2006, “Walter Benjamin’s 115th Dream.”<br />
“’language could serve as a system of control… traces that continue to haunt the day.”<br />
<br />
Note: when pressed, neg says they’ll defend status quo grassroots social movements as their alternative.<br />
