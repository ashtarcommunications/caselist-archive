You have no conclusive solvency- ran since swings, no impact, vote neg on presumption<br />
You only read the argument half the time, competition just as important<br />
Vote sexism to expose the sexist system, this is more transformative<br />
Tatchell 1990 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.petertatchell.net/direct+action/civil+disobedience.htm" rel="nofollow">__www.petertatchell.net/direct %20action/civil%20disobedience .htm__</a><br />
The new lesbian… put on the defensive.<br />
Sexism has to be overt<br />

When most people think... aspect of their lives.<br />
Activism is irresponsible<br />

Let us take Ranciere’s central… of omnipotence?<br />

<strong>Framework/Topicality</strong><br />

Must support rez<br />
Not defend implementation<br />
Prefer-<br />
Predictability<br />
Prerequisite for debate<br />
Shively 2000 Political Theory and Partisan Politics pg 181-82<br />
The requirements given… order to subvert<br />
Extra topical to defend this- IV<br />
Kills agency for negative and topic committee<br />
Topicality is a voter<br />
<strong>Kritik</strong><br />
Violence is everywhere, must accept this<br />
Difference is illusory,<br />
Badiou 2002<br />
Ethics defines as victims, no value to life<br />

<h3 id="toc7"><a name="Doubles-Wichita State CS Neg-Block Strategy:"></a><strong><em>Block Strategy:</em></strong></h3>
<strong>2NC- Topicality/Case</strong><br />
<strong>Case</strong><br />
Must have quantitative data, no reason the aff DOES something, default negative on the question, reason to prefer<br />
No theoretical reason they could solve internal links better<br />
Take over the 2nc decision; read this on the negative<br />
“not competitive”- you would find ways to MAKE it competitive<br />
You still leave people low on pref b/c Kathleen thinks you have to be topical<br />
NOTHING has changed as a result<br />
Teshla ev- arg is NOT sexism good, but why it should be discussed, no change with the aff up until this point<br />
Not causing women to change in debate, using the ballot is a punishment, this is preferable, they have to lose rounds to further the movement<br />
Use Ballot in the debate round to advance Wichita State, everyone would talk about why KU JL lost, the way they view debate<br />
Moulton 83 Janice, Discovering Reality<br />
In general the inability… agree with you<br />
Aff not a type of change, don’t get punished if you don’t vote against them<br />
Vote for overt sexism, we should punish those who do this b/c it creates a better question, cites specific examples<br />
Civil Rights Movement<br />
The History Learning Site, No Date <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/birmingham.htm" rel="nofollow">__www.historylearningsite.co.uk /birmingham.htm__</a><br />
In 1963, Birmingham… its greatest boost.<br />
When people think of sexism they see it as an obvious act; you cannot create change by voting for KU JL<br />
You win, sent back to the community, community will crush the movement<br />
You are not a true activist, would read it on the neg as well<br />
<strong>Topicality</strong><br />
Topical version, read the Morrison case, internal link is gender, this proves<br />
Question of the negative advantage, no choice, they won the flip and forced us talk about this, this internal link turns because they chose to take away our agency for the debate<br />
Don’t get any of arguments b/c of this<br />
They gave up the entirety of the resolution<br />
Topicality is not silencing, still question oppression in debate, still gives us adequate access in debate.<br />
Some defense to your impact calc<br />
Rules are inevitable<br />
No alt to state centric language<br />
Frost U Kent 1996 Ethics in International relations: a constitutive theory, p 89-90<br />
Donelan purports to… must be confronted.<br />
CI- they unlimit the entirety of the topic, people come from different backgrounds, always a risk of our agency<br />
Not going for extra topicality<br />
You are not a fair interpretation of debate, still ask questions of solvency within questions of personnel narratives<br />
<strong>1NR- Topicality/Case/Kritik</strong><br />
<strong>Topicality</strong><br />
Only way to educate<br />
Ross 96<br />
We’re educational, vital for debate<br />
Switch side debate<br />
Hays 2005<br />
You moot the negative team’s agency<br />
Rules are inevitable<br />
<strong>Case</strong><br />
Extend Cho evidence- you don’t have a criticism to this, 1ac is a call to go ahead with lives, this creates a false sense of security white washing fails- ignore structural problems<br />
Impacted with Baudrillard- 1ac solves nothing, 100% solvency takeout, result in the replication of oppression, not okay to forget, we should call attention net benefits to our interpretation<br />
You don’t solve structural problems- larger issues then individual and self in debate true- other economic and cultural issues<br />
Must do on aff is indicted by Laclau evidence<br />
1989 evidence not working- your discussion has not worked, no solvency<br />
Group spillover- we’ll overcome structural<br />
<strong>Kritik</strong><br />
Alt- repudiate social norms causes us to think this through<br />
You assume we are a victimization K but we are questioning ethical relationships to the other, conceded from the 1nc<br />
Eliminates difference, we are not a blanket evil<br />
We are a link turn, situate in ethical, cultural biases exist, interact with gender issues, would have to look to this, oppressions come to a head, you can’t resolve this issue<br />
Perm- still links, still based on ethics<br />
Badiou 2002<br />
Affirmative devalues life by saying this; hope is a non-starter<br />
Ballot- Cho is an answer to this; we solve back, alternative changes the notions of multiple forms of oppression in debate.<br />
