Subpoint A is Central Asia<br />
<br />
Afghani stability is a prerequisite for Central Asian stability<br />

<br />
South and Central Asia… representing a gain for all concerned.<br />

Subpoint B is Pakistan<br />
<br />
Afghanistan instability spills over into Pakistan where hardliners will take over<br />

Afghanistan is a more… humanitarian conflict resolution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Extremist takeover is the most likely scenario for the end of the world. The removal of Musharraf makes this even more likely<br />
Rosen 10/19/2007 (Jack, Chairman of American Jewish Congress, writer for Jerusalem Post “In praise of Pakistani Pres. Pervez Musharraf” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=2&amp;cid=1192380572861&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull" rel="nofollow">http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=2&amp;cid=1192380572861&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull</a>)<br />

<br />
The party of a major… to Pakistan itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan:<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan by offering a substantial increase in foreign assistance in the form of increased training personnel for the Afghan National Police on the condition that the Afghan government replaces corrupt government and police officials. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 3 is Solvency<br />
<br />
Training the National Police solves the situation in Afghanistan—hundreds of millions have been already been spent but more is necessary<br />
BBC 10/6/07 (BBC Worldwide Monitoring “Afghan paper slams NATO for not empowering national forces” Lexis)<br />
After the fall of Taleban… defend the whole country.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bush just ordered 1000 police trainers but more are needed<br />

<br />
&quot;Had we invested more… and 1,000 to train police.<br />
<br />
<br />
Training is key to the police<br />
CSM 10/23/07 (Christian Science Monitor, “U.S. prods NATO over Afghan security” Lexis)<br />
The Afghan police and Army… program to 100 training teams.<br />
<br />
<br />
Effective policing operations are essential to counterinsurgency operations—current engagement is not enough<br />
Corum, 06 (Retired Lt. Colonel, Army Center for Strategic Studies “Training Indigenous Forces for Counterinsurgency: A Tale of Two Insurgencies” avail. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=648" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=648</a>)<br />
Counterinsurgency is… government in the eyes of the population.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
US engagement is key – only it has the influence and power to stabilize Afghanistan<br />
Cronin, 02 (Richard P., Specialist in Asian Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, “Afghanistan: Challenges and Options for Reconstructing a Stable and Moderate Afghan State,” CRS RL31389, April 24)<br />
<br />
Many other countries and international… without strong U.S. engagement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Police are key to rebuilding Afghanistan; only the US can train them in the appropriate manner<br />
International Crisis Group Report, February 2008 (Afghanistan: The Need for international Resolve, Crisis Group Asia Report 145, 2/6/2008)<br />
There was some sequencing… alone resources and personnel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Strong police force can make up for lack of troops<br />
BBC 7 (“paper highlights role of Afghan army and police in security” Sept 20, Lexis)<br />
It seems that such a process… national army and police.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conditioning future assistance on these reforms is critical to ensuring that resources are being effectively used<br />
Wilder, 7/2007 (Andrew, Research Director for Politics and Policy at Tufts University, Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit, “Cops or Robbers, the Struggle to Reform the Afghan National Police” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.areu.org.af/" rel="nofollow">http://www.areu.org.af/</a>)<br />
• The Ministry of Interior… international community.<br />
<br />
We must condition aid to ensure problems don’t continue<br />
International Crisis Group Report, February 2008 (Afghanistan: The Need for international Resolve, Crisis Group Asia Report 145, 2/6/2008)<br />
Similarly, the Afghan… than ticking off a checklist of technicalities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Karzai will accept—he is against corruption<br />
Ackerman and Schweich 7 (Gary, House Representative D-NY and Thomas, Ambassador, assistant Sec. of State for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, Federal News Service, October 4, 2007 CAPITOL HILL HEARING: COUNTERNARCOTICS STRATEGY AND POLICE TRAINING IN AFGHANISTAN, Lexis)<br />
REP. ACKERMAN: And for all these… be more aggressive on drugs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And Afghanistan has empirically responded to conditional troop deployments<br />
Goodhand and Sedra, 1/2007 (Jonathan and Mark, Senior Lecturer in Development Practice, University of London, Research Associate at the Bonn International Center for Conversion, International Peacekeeping, Vol.14, No.1, “Bribes or Bargains? Peace Conditionalities and<br />

US engagement with Afghanistan high and inevitable<br />

NEW DISTRICTS AFF--PRISONS<br />
The Supreme Court rulings on Guantanamo did not put an end to America’s practice of indefinite detention—prisons in Afghanistan now operate as legal blackholes where torture, muder, and unimaginable violence reign <br />
Smith and Ratner, Human Rights Lawyer and President of the Center for Constitutional Rights, 2006 (2/27, Democracy Now, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2006/2/27/worse_than_guantanamo_u_s_expands" rel="nofollow">http://www.democracynow.org/2006/2/27/worse_than_guantanamo_u_s_expands</a>)<br />
Well, both Clive ...Are they going to vanish forever?<br />
<br />
Prisons in Afghanistan have become some of the worst in the world.  Alongside brutal physical violence, inmates are psychologically tortured.  Worst of all, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.   <br />
Goodman and Smith 2006 (Democracy Now Correspondent and Human Rights Lawer, 2/27, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2006/2/27/worse_than_guantanamo_u_s_expands" rel="nofollow">http://www.democracynow.org/2006/2/27/worse_than_guantanamo_u_s_expands</a>)) <br />
AMY GOODMAN: Clive Stafford Smith, I wanted going to be out fully.<br />
<br />
<br />
The US has succeeded in keeping prisons in Afghanistan completely closed to human rights organization allowing for abuse above and beyond anything in Iraq or Abu Grahib.   <br />
Dwyer 2004 (ISR, “War Without End,” Sept/Oct, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Central_Asia_watch/WarWithoutEnd_Afghan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Central_Asia_watch/WarWithoutEnd_Afghan.html</a>)<br />
In open letter from the...outside the rule of law.&quot; <br />

<br />
Our future is one of prisons and punishment, violence and torture without end or limit.  We have to inject ourselves into the formations of the penal society and make nameable and grievable those lives who have disappeared into the black of holes of America’s extra judicial war prisons<br />
Brown, Professor of Crimonolgy and Sociology at Ohio State, 2005 (American Quarterly, 57:3, 973-977, MUSE)<br />
Abu Ghraib, like Guantánamo ...what will our futures be?67<br />
<br />
<br />
And, dehumanization is not some amorphous impact: it is the critical internal link to violent racism and torture, seen again and again throughout time<br />

The abuse documented at ...occupation.&quot; (Mroue 2004:A13)<br />

<strong><u>Observation 1: Mounting Death Tolls</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world; new landmines planted by the Taliban have claimed nearly a thousand lives since January</strong><br />
<strong>Moahid 9/7/2007</strong> (Ahmad Khalid, reporter for Pajhwok Afghan News, “AFGHANISTAN: Taliban Mines Take Toll on Civilian, Coalition Lives”)<br />
<u>New landmines planted since the Taliban returned…</u> by rival mujahiddin factions in the 1990s.<br />

<strong>Afghanistan remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world with thousands dying annually</strong><br />
<strong>US Foreign Policy Agenda 2004</strong> (January, “Afghanistan: A Model  for Humanitarian Mine Action”)<br />
<u>Afghanistan remains one of the most heavily… <strong>landmines are estimated at 150 per month.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>And, Landmines kill 12 people a day in Afghanistan</strong><br />

Afghanistan has suffered greatly from war… of landmine victims die due to lack of medical facilities.<br />
<br />
<br />

<strong>The problem will only get worse—landmines promise continued instability the persistent risk of death for civilians. Landmine clearance is the most pressing priority</strong><br />

<br />
The strange toy Rahmatullah's brother…. programs back in full swing by mid-January.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Observation Two: Beyond Death Tolls</u></strong><br />
<strong>Thinking of landmine casualties in purely statistical terms is misleading: the mere threat of landmines makes daily life an exercise in paralyzing fear. It renders land, roads, and public buildings useless.</strong><br />
<strong>Njeri, PHD University of Bradford, 2003</strong> (Sarah, “The Impact of Explosive Remnants of War (ERW): Especially Landmines on Post-Conflict Reconstruction” google it)<br />
<u>The actual number of mines in the ground… <strong>And yet what a wealth of misery it can cover.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Our affirmative is a conduit to finally confront the reality of the landmine and clusterbomb crisis in Afghanistan and particularly our own complicity in perpetuating it. Coming to terms with the devastating effects on people’s daily lives can challenge brutal colonialism and indiscriminate killing that will spiral into extinction.</strong><br />
<strong>Jensen, Professor of Journalism at University of Texas, 2002</strong> (March 21, Robert, “The Future of Empathy,” google it)<br />
I<u>n most situations, people tend to seek pleasure… we will choose to know, to feel, and to act.</u><br />

<u>HSTAMIDS performed equally well in Afghanistan… which projects <strong>to a 645% increase in productivity</strong></u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Only the US army has the HSTAMIDS system; it has not been permanently shared with civilian deminers who do the brunt of the work in Afghanistan</strong><br />
<strong>Skillings, Staff Writer for CNET, 2006</strong> (Jonathan, “High Tech’s Slow march in Landmine Campaign,” google it)<br />

<u>HSTAMIDS is a combined metal-detector… <strong>technology</strong> designed primarily for military use.</u><br />

<strong>The US has pledged lots of money for demining for fiscal year 2008</strong><br />
<strong>FCNL 2007</strong> (6/25, “Humanitarian Demining Budget memo for FY 2008&lt; google it)<br />
