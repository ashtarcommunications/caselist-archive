special note - we do not read a plan. there is no plan in the 1ac. there is no text to the plan, cause there is no plan. no plan, no plan, no plan.*<br />

The process of subduing nature has its roots in agriculture. Although food should be something that allows us to feel connected with and a part of nature, agriculture has alienated us and locked us into death spiral of civilization. Half the planet is starving, the other half suffers from diseases of affluence, the biosphere is shot, and extinction is inevitable. There should be no federal support for agriculture because both life and liberty are predicated on its dissolution.<br />
Zerzan 1998 (John, “Agriculture: Demon Engine of Civilization” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt" rel="nofollow">http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt</a>)<br />
<br />
Food has been one of our most direct contacts with the natural environment … Liberation is impossible without its dissolution.<br />
<br />
In particular, the modern American agricultural system is indefensible – it cannot be corrected and should not be supported, because it epitomizes every reason that civilization is a crime against nature.<br />
<br />
Zerzan 1998 (John, “Agriculture: Demon Engine of Civilization” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt" rel="nofollow">http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt</a>)<br />
<br />
Today the organic, what is left of it, is fully mechanized under the aegis … spiralling application of more synthetic fertilizers, and weed and pest killers, accelerating the crime against nature.<br />
<br />
Civilization only exists because we have come to believe in its inevitability—this is tragic because civilization was a mistake. It is bound to collapse, and our criticism is necessary to begin readapting to the way that humans lived for 99% of their existence—we may not be able to turn back the clock, but we must at least try!<br />
<br />
Heinberg 1995 (Richard, “The Primitivist Critique of Civilization, presented at the 24th annual meeting of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations at Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/civilization.htm" rel="nofollow">http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/civilization.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
Isn't civilization simply the inevitable expression of the evolutionary urge as it is translated through human society … we should think of this process as &quot;getting back on track.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let us be clear about what won’t get us anywhere—the reformism that embodies status quo politics never challenges the roots of civilization itself—the problems of civilization cannot be incrementally reformed away<br />
<br />
Landstreicher in 2005 (Wolfi, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/politicstolife.htm" rel="nofollow">http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/politicstolife.htm</a>)<br />
The attempt to win adherents requires the appeal to the lowest common denominator ... the increasing impoverishment of existence, and this cannot be reformed away.<br />
<br />
Reformism fails because progress itself is a myth, promulgated in the interest of maintaining the hegemony of civilization—The Beatles were wrong, and its not really getting better all the time<br />
<br />
Mcquinn 2005 (Jason, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/notaprimitivist.htm" rel="nofollow">http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/notaprimitivist.htm</a>)<br />
Additionally, the cumulative failures of both the revolutionary social movements … determine at what point we will finally lose all trace of our humanity.<br />
<br />
What is essential, however, is looking at the world through Pleistocene eyes—a reading of history not from the perspective of the conquerors but the conquered<br />
<br />
Watson 1991 (David, “Civilization in Bulk”, Fifth Estate, Summer)<br />
But now that several generations have been raised on monoculture’s gruel … vernacular communities that resist conquest and control in creative, if idiosyncratic ways.)<br />
<br />
This affirmation is a necessity: we need to take back things in our everyday lives—this debate included—and try to find accomplices, which is what the ballot symbolizes<br />
<br />
Landstreicher 2005 (Wolfi, “Barbaric Thoughts” , <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://insurgentdesire.org.uk</a> barbaricthoughts.htm)<br />
But then what of the consciously developed revolutionary critique of civilization … will separate as our methods and aims become incompatible.<br />
<br />
Civilized life is meaningless. It is based on the twin pillars of individual alienation and planetary rape—The only way out of this debacle is radical critique of civilization and the refusal to participate in structural reform<br />
<br />
Zerzan 2005 (John, Primitivist Activist, MA SFSU, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/feral.htm" rel="nofollow">http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/feral.htm</a>)<br />
We exist in a landscape of absence wherein real life is steadily being drained out by debased work … Can we justify our lives by anything less than such a politics of rage and dreams?<br />
<br />
The dominant historical narrative has taught us that civilization is the natural outcome of humanity—this is far from the truth and is ultimately a crazy rationalization for a system that has been imposed upon us via coercion and will ultimately result in planetary extinction<br />
<br />
Watson 1991 (David, “Civilization in Bulk”, Fifth Estate, Summer)<br />
According to official history, this grid is the natural outcome of an inevitable evolution … Can a world worth inhabiting survive the ruin that will be left?
