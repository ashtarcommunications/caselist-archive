Case Debate<br />
The aff’s animal welfarism legitimizes and strengthens the system of cruelty they criticize – their objection to ‘inhumane’ slaughter does nothing to affirm the inherent value of non-human life, staving off real change in favor of reforms which only benefits human oppressors<br />

Kritik<br />
1.  Aff posits change in the realm of current political institutions the activism of the 1ac acts as an end rather thasn a beginning because we are only able to effectuate positi9ve c hange insofar as the 1ac gives us permission the 1ac’s attempt to beat the system at its own game result ina colonizing collective consciousness and obfuscates alternative ways of thinking and knowing the world around us. Reclaiming ability to ethically realte to individuals is anecessary pre-cursor to chang eneg conditioncited in 1ac<br />

2. Logic of aff’s ethical appeal treates future as plannable event that can be known and mastered this move decopuples ethics from its messianic poetential an culm inates in catastrophe<br />

i. It is clear to anyone with a Jewish ear….property of some chosen people<br />
3. Our arg engages aff decision to calcualate their action within dominant ways of knowing and acting. Our alt conceptin of the ballot locates ethical justification for the plan as a leap of faith which represent the condition for possibility of ethics itself.<br />
<br />
Our alt capture all plan an dits pragmatic effects and competes by critiquing their decision to link the justificaitno of the plan to a claim to knowledge<br />
<br />
We must bring into question discourse and the language of representation. Oru alt is an act which responds without knowing, putting undecidability and impossibility of signification intouch with political responsiveness<br />

Only the neg conception of ballot can give ethical con3ent to decision to act. Aff strips action of its calim to ethics and responsibility it is irresponsible and anti-ethical to the core<br />
Derrida d1995 gift of death<br />
To subordinat eresponsiblity to thte objectivity 9of knowledge…for freedom nd for decision<br />
4. The Link – aff frames ethical decision making as the concern of the soverign political instiutiuon by framing ethicas as the conjunition of practical action and the political and theoretical justicatino fo the plan, the aff fdivest the ballot of any notion of responisblity. The claim athat the judge has an ethical responsibility to vote aff is mired ina fundamental paradozx. The more ethics is subordinatied to knowledge theorie and rules the eless the individual agent appears a s aresponsible actor.<br />

Antibiotics<br />
Fears of superbugs coming from farms are not backed by science. There’s no proof that superbugs come from Farms, and there is widespread consensus that they come from human medicine. Ending antibiotic use in Factory Farming is worthless while Doctors hand out antibiotics like candy.<br />

Apocalypse Reps K<br />
First, invoking the threat of apocalypse legitimates any use of force not short of annihilation- in other words, the only way we get to the impact is by tying it to the affirmative policy-<br />
Coviello, PhD in English From Cornell, Queer Frontiers, 2K p. 40-41<br />
Perhaps. But to claim that American culture is at present decisively postnuclear is not to say that the world we inhabit is in any way post-apocalyptic. Apocalypse, as I began by saying<br />
<br />
Secondly, the paranoia of inevitable annihilation associated with superpower syndrome – legitimizes violence under the mask of “security”.<br />
Robert Jay Lifton, American psychiatrist and author, chiefly known for his studies of the psychological causes and effects of war and political violence and for his theory of thought reform. He was an early proponent of the techniques of psychohistory, 2003, Superpower Syndrom: America’s Violent Confrontation with the World, book ocr.<br />
<br />
And, this apocalyptic rhetoric lays the groundwork for genocidal violence, giving leaders free reign to do anything necessary to stave off the “end of the world.” This framework makes real solutions to environmental problems impossible as people become so convinced that the earth is beyond saving that they give up even trying.<br />
Buell, Professor of English at Cornell 2003 (Frederick, From Apocalypse to Way of Life) HCM<br />
Elaborating crisis is thus not only hard to do but can also perhap<br />
Inseparable from this grandiosity<br />
<br />
Pan/China K<br />
States who face the prospect of US engagement have 2 choices—assimilate to the global liberal order or face annihilation—doesn’t matter that the plan warms relations or provides concessions—bringing them into the fold today paves the way for war against “our” remaining enemies tomorrow, the impact is perpetual war on a global scale<br />

Joxe works out the spatial logic of historical imperial<br />
<br />
First, the 1ac Illustrations of China’s mounting threat to US security are not based upon any geopolitical reality but are instead the result of the identity we have constructed of ourselves.<br />
Pan 4 (Chengxin, Department of Political Science and International Relations, Faculty of Arts, Australian National University, “The &quot;China threat&quot; in American self-imagination: the discursive construction of other as power politics”, Alternatives)<br />
At first glance, as the &quot;China threat<br />
<br />
Second, attempts to protect ourselves from the looming Chinese threat create the tension and escalation towards war that they tried to prevent in the first place.<br />
Pan 4<br />
For instance, as the United States<br />
<br />
Finally, the alt is to vote negative to reject these attempts to construct China as a know-able threat and instead question the scholarship we use to inform the way we approach China.<br />

Terror/Knowledge K<br />
Using terrorism as a floating signifier is essential to militantly enforcing neoliberal hegemony- presupposes the legitimacy of the war on terror and leads to the devaluation of populations -Gorelick in 2008.<br />
[Nathan. “Imagining Extraordinary Renditions: Terror, Torture, and the Possibility of an Excessive Ethics in Literature.” Theory &amp; Event Vol. 11:2]<br />
The problem with legal confrontations, though,<br />
<br />
The drive for security necessitates the extermination of difference-Gorelick in 2008.<br />
Aimé Césaire noted this phenomenon in his articulation<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the desire for order is the foundation of relations of violence- representations of terror are self fulfilling -Gorelick in 2008.<br />
Extraordinary rendition contains all of these<br />
<br />
The alt is to question the will to knowledge- abandon commitment to intelligibility and affirm opacity-Gorelick in 2008.<br />
Because the current world crisis testifies to the legacy… reliance upon language itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Athanasiou K<br />
The alternative is to refuse the affirmative<br />
Our refusal occurs at the limits of representation- this is the only response capable of disrupting the force of modern biopolitics, exceeding the constructs of humanity and presence that the affirmative endorses<br />
This is not a neutral or nihilistic rejection, but a rejection which takes a stance against the systems of intelligibility we indict- endorsement of the negative is endorsement of a different kind of politics- Athanasiou in 2003<br />
