Metaphysics operates according to a binary logic that sets two terms of reality: a something and a nothing. The bountiful field is the something of agriculture (the identity which land must conform to) whereas the desert is the nothing of the resolution and agriculture. metaphysics informs the agricultural policy of subsidies and thus makes it complicit with the civilizing mission to master the continent and make it productive. because the desert does not concede to the demand to be productive (it is unable to be accommodated). American policy responds by banishing the desert (evidence indicates this is why we respond so acceptingly to test weapons in the desert). The affirmative undertakes what is called a de-structive genealogy of the term &quot;agriculture&quot; agri - from agrios (the wild or savage) and culture - from cultivate/acculturation (a cognate of colonus).<br />
<br />
the response to this metaphysical inquiry is to think the (trope of the desert as vast unproductive nothingness) positively by affirming the topical exile (which in the context of agriculture is the desert). This response subverts metaphysical imperialism by de-sedimenting its hold on how reality ought function.<br />
<br />
often times this team reads cards at the bottom of their affirmative that explain/defend their over-determination of ontology because it has been ignored in contemporary politics. or they prepare a defense of their theoretical legitimacy by indicting certain naturalized domination attempts by comparing some forms of debate to the roman paideia (a form of academics intended to make the young immature citizen into a productive patriot).<br />

<strong><u><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Affirmatives for UCO Casey/Henry and Spomer/Spurlock </span></u></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Our teams have read the following two 1ac’s this year. </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1st is the land affirmative: </span></u></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">1ac begins with an introduction about agriculture<br />
Herbert Hillbig<br />
A Modern and Moral Worldview: A Mind-Liberating Explanation of the Universe and the Human Condition Enables a Personal Best-Life Philosophy and a Folly-Free Ultimate Belief, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.modern-worldview.org/6.7e_enslave_colonize_christ.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.modern-worldview.org/6.7e_enslave_colonize_christ.htm</a><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">For the last….order of things<br />
<br />
The desire to conquer and tame land is abundant throughout western disciplines. Land is represented as an adversary, a volatile entity to be subordinated and cultivated by the West. This desire has manifested itself into a syndrome that paves the way for colonial domination. Thus, the conquering of land involves multiple levels of enclosures of the land that classify the land into territory, field, and landscape. This places a narrative of control that alters the essence of the land. The land is merely a subject to the imperial state: deprived of its foundational offering it becomes placed on a grid of violent oppositions. This is Marzec in 2001, 2001 –Enclosures, colonization, and the robinson crusoe syndrome: a genealogy of land in a global context<br />
“The references to land…nation against nation<br />
<br />
Subsequently, the hand of domination has been extended to control any land that has not been subjected to commodification and control: order only becomes possible with the subduing of all land and all of its threats. The indigenous peoples become the biggest stumbling block toward a greater polity. Homogenization of the world’s people through capitalistic exploitation becomes necessary: this makes possible destruction of all marginal peoples. The heart of all this violence is the relationship to land that constitutes the self as being over the land. This is Marzec in 2001. 2001 –Enclosures, colonization, and the robinson crusoe syndrome: a genealogy of land in a global context<br />
“The pervasive lack of…Late twentieth century”<br />

Western thought has a historical tendency of refusing to question its own interpretation of reality. Affirmations of the topic have traditionally responded to the topical hail by affirming an instrumental change in policy. Traditional views of the topic attempt uniformity in the meanings of resolutions. Every word is set to have a specific usage that makes clear the meaning behind the resolution. This interpretation is set to exclude alternative ways of viewing the topic and reality.<br />
However, there is meaning behind the words that cannot be interpreted solely by the writers of the topic. Each word cannot be isolated from the rest of the group. They are all connected to each other to form meaning. Each person has a different meaning that the resolution speaks to and it comes to them in different ways whether they are literal, figurative, historical, and a host of others. Our affirmation of the resolution is not a minor repair to the usual system: rather, we affirm an entirely different interpretation of reality. This is Vine Deloria Jr. in 1999<br />
“But this replacement…applications for admissions” p 101-107?<br />
Countless affirmatives will affirm the resolution this year without ever questioning the presupposition underlying the removal of subsidies and the consequent relationship to land. These approaches are in line with the expectations and disciplines of Western Modern Thought.<br />
The topic, however, did not speak to us from the voice of western epistemology. The topic spoke to us through the writings and orations of those from the borders: Those who have been pushed to the margins of Western thought…People who, Walter Mignolo says, speak from the Colonial Difference.<br />
<br />
We read three quotes:<br />
Chet Bowers in collaboration with Four Arrows writes [Chet Bowers, Unlearning the language of conquest, page 182-3] “indigenous wisdom honors… by modern enclosures”<br />
<br />
<br />
Emily Cousins also notes:<br />
“Mountains made alive: native American relationships with sacred land” Cross currents, winter 96/97 vol 46 issue 4<br />
“how can you…without your spirituality”<br />
<br />
finally, Vine Deloria Jr. elaborates:<br />
Vine Deloria Jr. For this land: writings on religion in America, page 251<br />
“lands somehow call…life can mean”<br />
<br />
<br />
In response to western thought’s enframing of the world, we embrace the vision spoken to us by the topic “Resolved: that the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies, for biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat.” This is a different vision of reality than the one that dominates the status quo: we are a fundamental re-orientation of our relationship with the world. Specifically, we affirm a vision of a different relationship to land. We affirm a vision of interconnectedness with the land. Our vision challenges the idea that we are separate from the land. This vision disrupts the dominant view of reality and makes possible a new relationship with the world. Our interruption of the western view of land as an adversary marks a path that makes liberation possible. This is Vine Deloria Jr in 1999<br />
