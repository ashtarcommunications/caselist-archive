Text: The United States Executive should offer all sugar exporting countries, including all African nations, annual financial compensation corresponding to the estimated losses suffered from the United States sugar subsidies, as calculated by the welfare based model as per Trachtman<br />
The United States federal government should offer all necessary financial incentives for advanced conservation measures including precision and variable rate application of fertilizers, interseeding with cover crops, inclusion of buffers or riparian filter strips, yearly crop rotation, and reductions in sugar acreage<br />
The United States federal government should substantially expand direct green payments to sugar farmers. These payments should be made relative to a standard minimum environmental performance level on a measurable index as determined by the natural resources conservation service. Funding and enforcement guaranteed, we will clarify<br />
The United States federal government should ensure domestic prices for sugar capture the full cost of production, including the cost of marketing and a reasonable profit by establishing a price support supply management program including increased incentives for participation in conservation land programs and flexible government purchase and storage of supply surplus, for domestic sugar producer.<br />
