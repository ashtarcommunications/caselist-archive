Act 1<br />
The expansion of powers has legal grounding in the Quirin decision. This power creates a liminal zone, both in and outside the law, eliminating all rights of the individual.<br />

Naked life is a product of the machine, the only wat to dismantle the machine is to think the end of history with the end of state. If Quirin is overruled the contradictions of the sovereign become apparent. The state can not stand inside or outside the law, or dictate what is law and isn’t, eliminating powers of exception.<br />

Delay CP (after midterms): waiting is not doing everything in your power to fight racism – my ballot must be for that; perm pass but wait to enforce<br />
Hollow Hope: overview – this is all discourse, Milliken doesn’t get overturned, so these DAs won’t happen. Not trying to solve for all racism, just start something with the ballot (one brick, one stone); this is just a slap in the face to all the victims of racism; Rosenberg is an idiot<br />

<br />
Act one – the end of history<br />
<br />
In 1942 Chief Justice Stone of the Supreme Court delivered the decision regarding Ex parte Quirin, stating “that petitioners are held in lawful custody, for trial before the military commission, and have not shown cause for being discharged by writ of habeas corpus. The motions for leave to file petitions for writs of habeas corpus are denied. The orders of the District Court are affirmed.<br />
<br />
1. This ruling set the precedent which, 64 years later has given President Bush an expansion of powers and authority to declare the law silent<br />
<br />
Hasian 2003 [Marouf Arif, “Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wartime Anxieties and the Saboteurs’ Case” Rhetoric and Public Affairs – Vol 6 Number 2 Summer. Pp223-235<br />
<br />
When American presidents, legislators,…World War II saboteurs.” 4<br />
<br />
<br />
Act Two: The end of the state<br />
1. This expansion of powers has legal grounding in the Quirin decision. This power creates a liminal zone, both in and outside the law, eliminating al rights of the individual.<br />
<br />
McClintock 2004 (Scott, “The Penal Colony: Inscription of the Subject in Literature and Law, and Detainees as legal Non-Persons at Camp X-ray” Comparative Literature Studies – vol 41 number 1 p157-8<br />
<br />
The emerging counter-terrorism apparatus… rights of U.S. criminal defendants.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. This zone goes unchecked in the status quo, protected by Quirin, as the state of emergency becomes the rule and the sovereign can detain people labeled enemy combatants indefinitely.<br />
<br />
Siddharth Varadarajan – deputy editor of the Hindu 2005 “Polics State in America: Now Bush can lock up anyone forever without change.” www.globalreserarch.ca/index.php/context=viewarticles&amp;code=var20050910&amp;ArticleID=918, DOA 9/10<br />
<br />
What this means is that unless… Padilla should be allowed to have his day in court.<br />
<br />
<br />
Resolved: that the United States Supreme Court should grant cert to the next available test case and overrule Ex parte Quirin [317 U.S. 1] (1942).<br />
<br />
The Finale: Emergence of the Camp<br />
1. The existence of Guantanamo Bay has blurred threshold o the law, transforming the world into a state of exception<br />
<br />
Kaplan 2005 (Amy, Prof of English and the humanities at the Univerrsity of Pennsylvania “Where is Guantanamo? American Quarterly 57.3)<br />
<br />
By understanding the long imperial history… in which Guantanamo is everywhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
The state of exception exists outside of the juridical order<br />
<br />
Agamben 2005 State of Exception pp23-24<br />
<br />
The simple topographical opposition… dispute over its proper locus.<br />
<br />

3 The birth of the camp inscribes naked life within everyone, making biopolitics ther paradigm of the planet<br />
<br />
Agamben Means without end 42-45<br />
<br />
From this perspective, the birth… biopolitical nomos of the planet.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Within the camp totalitarian domination is achieved and anything is possible<br />
<br />
Agamben 2000. Giorgio, Prof of Aesthetics at the Univ of Verona Means Without End: Notes on Politics pp40-41<br />
<br />
One ought to reflect on the paradoxical… anything had become possible).<br />

<br />
Agamben 2005 State of Exception pp23-24<br />

<br />
5. The purpose of the totalitarian camps is extermination<br />
<br />
Arendt 1951 (Hannah PhD philosophy, Univ of Chicago “Total Domination”<br />
<br />
Total domination, which strives… was a perverted animal.<br />
<br />
<br />
6. The only possibility of unmasking the sovereign violence and opening a path to justice is to engage in studious play where law is not practiced but studied instead<br />
<br />
Agamben 2005 State of Exception<br />
<br />
It is from this perspective that we must read… or made judicial (Benjamin 1992, 41).<br />
<br />
7. Naked life is a product of the machine, the only way to dismantle the machine is to think the end of history with the end o the state, if Quirin is overruled the contradictions of the soverign become apparent. The state can not stand inside and outside of the law, or dictate what is law and isn’t, eliminating the powers of exception<br />

The United States Supreme Court should grant writ of certiorari to a relevant test case overruling Milliken v. Bradley deciding that the Federal District Courts do have broad remedial power to desegregate, including desegregation across district lines. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
Segregation trends are accelerated super quick<br />

<br />
Milliken is responsible for these continueing segregation trends<br />
Chemerinsky 2003<br />

Segregation directly effects education<br />

Many intangible factors also undermine segregated education<br />
Michelson 2k3<br />

Biegel 2k3<br />

Milliken’s faulty application makes it appear to be a punishment and stigmatizes minority students<br />
