<br />
OBSERVATION 2: RAPE AS AN ULTIMATE EVIL<br />
<br />
<br />
A) Civil rights remedies for rape are a fundamental right for citizens – the act or threat of the act colors the ability of women to act in the world<br />
Lombardi, 2006. [Kristen, “Rape: Now a Matter of Civil Rights - A crime against gender is a crime against freedom,” Village Voice, January 17, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0603,lombardi,71765,5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0603,lombardi,71765,5.html</a>]<br />

Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) on the rationale of the 14th Amendment.<br />
<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION 3: SOLVENCY<br />
<br />

Johnson 2003 (Jennifer R., Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review, “Comment: Privileged Justice Under Law: Reinforcement Of Male Privilege By The Federal Judiciary Through The Lens Of The Violence Against Women Act And U.S. V. Morrison” Santa Clara Law Review, Lexis)<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
c) VAWA's civil rights remedy emphasized that gender-motivated violence is a systemic, political problem and therefore requires a systemic, political solution.<br />

JCCC OT -- Milliken<br />
AFF<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION 1: INHERENCY<br />
<br />
a) Brown v. Board of Education is all but dead –The Supreme Court’s decision in Milliken v. Bradley made forcing busing illegal. Since then, desegregation efforts have had minimal success.<br />
Duffus and Isaacs, 2004 [Lee R., Madelyn L, 5/21, “Busing for Desegregation: A Marketing Dilemma,” University of South Florida at Fort Myers]<br />
<br />
A month ahead …………………….Milliken was &quot;a giant step backwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
B) Segregation is as bad now as it was in the 1960’s, due to private schools and voluntary busing systems.<br />
Duffus and Isaacs again in ‘04[Lee R., Madelyn L, 5/21, “Busing for Desegregation: A Marketing Dilemma,” University of South Florida at Fort Myers]<br />
<br />
There are other factors mitigating…………… and responsive strategies.<br />
<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION 2: THE ADVANTAGE<br />
<br />
Segregation affects the quality of education – minorities receive inferior educational opportunities – this spills over and increases inequalities after school.<br />
Chemerinsky 04 [Erwin, Law Professor at USC, “Article: Lost Opportunity: The Burger Court and the Failure to Achieve E Observation 1 is inherency<br />
Competing appellate court decisions are at odds with Commerce Clause applications to the Endangered Species Act (ESA)<br />
<br />
Adler 05 (Jonathan Adler, Associate Profesor of Law and Associate Director of the Center for Business Law &amp; Regulation, Case Western Reserve University School of Law, &quot;Judicial Federalism and the Future of Federal Environmental Legislation&quot;, 90 Iowa L. Rev. 377, January 2005, LN)<br />
<br />
While there is no doubt that the... exception for environmental concerns.<br />
Roberts is ready to gut the ESA<br />
<br />
Fortenberry and Beck 05<br />
qual Education Opportunity” Mercer Law Review, 45 Mercer L. Rev. 999, Pg. l/n]<br />
<br />
Although expenditure levels …………….suffers enormously as a result.<br />
<br />
<br />
B) “Racializing” our schools creates an “us-them” dichotomy – kids will see each other in terms of their skin colors, and will make negative judgments based on school segregation.<br />
Mickelson ‘03, [52 Am. U.L. Rev. 1477, ESSAY: ACHIEVING EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE WAKE OF JUDICIAL RETREAT FROM RACE SENSITIVE REMEDIES: LESSONS FROM NORTH CAROLINA, Roslyn Arlin, Professor, Department of Sociology, pg. ln]<br />
<br />
Steele argues that achievement-oriented …………..blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans.<br />
<br />
<br />
C) The Holocaust is going to happen again –Genocide is inevitable in the United States because of racism.<br />
Scales-Trent, 2001[Judy, Professor of Law at the University of Buffalo, Racial Purity Laws in the United States and Nazi Germany, Human Rights Quarterly 23.2, Project Muse]<br />
<br />
&quot;Concentrating group members into ……………abandon the destruction process now underway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Individual liberty is the supreme impact- it outweighs all other consequences.<br />
Callahan, 1973 (Daniel, Fellow at the Institute of Society and Ethics, The Tyranny of Survival, Pages 91-93)<br />
<br />
The value of survival could not be …………victory to end all Pyrrhic victories.<br />
<br />
<br />
We must reject every instance of racism.<br />
Barndt 1991 (Joseph Barndt, co-director of Crossroads, a ministry to dismantle racism, 1991, &quot;Dismantling Racism: The Continuing challenge to White America,&quot; p. 155-6.)<br />
<br />
To study racism is………………. allow it to continue.<br />
<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should grant writ of certiorari to American Civil Rights Foundation v. LAUSD. The Supreme Court should rule on said test case that the Federal District Courts do have broad remedial power to desegregate, including desegregation across district lines. We’ll Clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION 3: SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
A) Increasing contact between races is key to ending prejudice. The plan solves for societal-wide discrimination.<br />
Armor, 1995 [David J., Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law, Oxford University Press]<br />
<br />
The best-known progenitor ………………….education, employment, and income.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
B) Overruling Milliken is key.<br />
Rahdert, 2004[Mark. Professor of Law at Temple, “Symposium: Vision and Revision: Exploring the History, Evolution, and Future of the Fourteenth Amendment: Obstacles and Wrong Turns on the Road From Brown: Milliken v. Bradley and the Quest for Racial Diversity” Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review, Spring, 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 785, Pg. l/n]<br />
<br />
In the five decades since Brown v. Board of Education…… the Supreme Court's school desegregation endgame.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
C) Judiciary action is crucial – An intervention by the Courts exposes the racial “we-they” thinking in the government’s educational policies.<br />
Oh 04, (Reginald, Associate Professor, Appalachian School of Law “CRITICAL RACE THEORY: HISTORY, EVOLUTION, AND NEW FRONTIERS: ARTICLE: RE-MAPPING EQUAL PROTECTION JURISPRUDENCE: A LEGAL GEOGRAPHY OF RACE AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION*,” American University Law Review, l/n)<br />
<br />
Under political process theory,…………. workplace, and/or in housing.
