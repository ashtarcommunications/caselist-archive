Heidegger K<br />
The affirmative confronts ecological crisis from within the same framework it orginiated from. This response, which searches for ever-more ways to &quot;manage&quot; the event of crisis with quick technological solutions, and new recourse management techniques can never escape the consequences of technology has in store for us, because it is part of the problem. Only thinking alone can put us on the way<br />
McWhorter 92 (Ladelle, Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at Richmond, <u>Heidegger and the earth: Essays in the environmental philosophy,</u> Thomas Jefferson University, p. 2)<br />
Thinking today must...allowed to dissipate.<br />
<br />
Cutting ourselves off from the ability to think and dwell is in a sense to lose our minds--it is that which results in our loss of kinship with nature, the reduction of all worldy things to the level of less than object, mass violence, brutality, and the inability to escape the total destruction of the earth itself due to our compulsive desire to control everything.<br />
Stenstad '6 (Gail, Professor in the Dept of Philosophy and Humanities @ E Tenn State U, editor of Heidegger Studies, board member of IAEP, &quot;Transformations Thinking After Heidegger,&quot; U of Wisconsin, pgs 100-101)<br />
The first step...to control everything.<br />
