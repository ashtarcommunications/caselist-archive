<strong>Democary is best for combating heteronormativity</strong><br />

“Political Origins of intolerance. One of…political tolerance of homosexuals.”<br />
<strong>The gay rights movement is focusing its energy on overturning “don’t ask, don’t tell” in congress-this is critical to breaking stereotypes based on orientation</strong><br />

 <strong>School Lunches are key- props up dairy market</strong><br />
<strong>Barnard and Fischlowitz 2k</strong><br />
In addition, the federal government uses the…always a forefront at those ages<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention One- Digest This</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Dairy subsidies create a form of economic racism that forces minorities who are lactose intolerant to consume dairy products- this affects 50 million people and won’t stop- the USDA is using financial incentives to encourage MORE milk in schools</strong><br />
<strong>Green 2</strong><br />
Another assertion of the suit brought by the PCRM…disproportionately intolerant of or allergic to<br />
<br />
<strong>Dairy industry uses a dangerous dumping technique with its subsidies to mandate milk being served in school lunches- school become helpless and the worst forms of doublespeak are used to legitimize a mask for racism that disproportionately affects minority students</strong><br />
<strong>White 4</strong><br />
<br />
At the heart of the debate…long past time we put a stop to it<br />
<br />
<strong>Even if we cannot overcome racism entirely- we are still a means of reducing it- the logic of your defense justifies extermination</strong><br />
<strong>Barndt 91</strong><br />
The study racism is to study… dare not allow it to continue<br />
<br />
<strong>Milk normalizes and valorizes whiteness. Specifically, Federal Glorification of milk and dairy through the NSLP, make White consumptive practices the unquestioned norm. This discrimination lies at the very foundation of white supremacy; milk is thus constructed as the perfect food for the perfect people to the detriment of all those who cannot digest lactose</strong><br />
<strong>Harriet 8</strong><br />
As sociologist E. Melanie Dupuis… conveys a white supremacist paradigm<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention two is Obesity</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>USDA has conflict of interests- tied to both Farm Bill and promoting good health in schools- children will accept healthy foods- only a question of access</strong><br />
<strong>Dillard 8</strong><br />
Cooper knows that, under her… good health of American schoolchildren<br />
<br />
<strong>Big agribusiness has taken advantage of this conflict- they sit back and gain profits as the subsidized commodities are turning children obese- two thirds of these commodities are dairy</strong><br />
<strong>Dillard 8</strong><br />
Commodities processing intensifies the conflict…NSLP that are making schoolchildren Obese<br />
<strong>Scenario one: Childhood</strong><br />
<strong>First- the school lunch program creates lifelong health problems- what children eat at school determines what they eat at home</strong><br />
<strong>Dillard 8</strong><br />
From the food industry perspective…low-cost foods are usually the least healthy<br />
<br />
<strong>And we have a moral obligation to reform the program- children are our best chance for future social change</strong><br />
<strong>Salisbury 4</strong><br />
Our generation is now responsible… to date, that has not been the case<br />
<br />
<strong>As a result of the status quo, childhood obesity is becoming a pandemic- school lunches are the key intersection</strong><br />
<strong>Corbett 5</strong><br />
Meanwhile, the American Obesity Association… vegetable being offered with the full meal<br />
<br />
<strong>Poor diets in school are the root cause of obesity. This type of malnourishment gives rise to chronic diseases that impair overall development and lead to underdevelopment of motor skills</strong><br />
<strong>Dillard 8</strong><br />
In the past twenty-five years, medical… addressing the health concerns of overeating<br />
<strong>Scenario Two: adulthood</strong><br />
<strong>Diets learned at school shapes lifelong eating patterns</strong><br />
<strong>Roberts 7</strong><br />
Congress supported the USDA by passing…had been telling us for years<br />
<br />
<strong>And, Obesity decreases life expectancy- the impact is greater than pandemics or war</strong><br />
<strong>Lalasz 5</strong><br />
A new study contends that rising…smoked suddenly decided to smoke<br />
<br />
<strong>Independantly, Obesity causes 300 thousand deaths a year</strong><br />
<strong>Besharov 3</strong><br />
Being overweight is not a simple matter…estimated to be 300,000 death per year<br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, the NSLP’s policies lay the framework for structural obesity ensuring premature death and a dissatisfaction with life</strong><br />
<strong>Salisbury 4</strong><br />
Obesity runs rampant among our…adolescents the percentage has tripled<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 3 What are the Chances</strong><br />
<strong>Our interpretation of this debate is that only high probability calculations should come into consideration</strong><br />
<strong>2 net benefits</strong><br />
<strong>1.</strong> <strong>Predictive Scenario planning ultimately fails- calculative measurements of the limelight are extremely overblown and more inaccurate than dart- throwing monkeys</strong><br />
<strong>Menard 5</strong><br />
Tetlock got a statistical handle on…who eked out existences far from the limelight<br />
<strong>2. Predictions and obsessions with future politics justify violence- we become so obsessed with pure future policies that we are willing to commit violence to get there- in order to have true hospitality we mustn’t taint the ethics with futuristic scenarios- such will bring conservative politics into future stifling any real chance at a new politics and unconditional ethics</strong><br />
<strong>Reynolds 6</strong><br />
Arguably John Rawls and Jacques…Derridean focus upon the incalculable<br />
