Love fails –emprically<br />
Bell hooks 2000 (All about Love, p 107)<br />
That vision was diminished….and love were assassinated.<br />
Love is patriarchal<br />
Alex Moseley “Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/I/love.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.iep.utm.edu/I/love .htm__</a><br />
In the area of political….classes, sexes, and races<br />
Love can never be understood, incpable of solving<br />
Moseley 1 (above)<br />
The epistemology of love asks….logic and reason unveil or disclose.<br />
Language of love evokes hierarchal structures and is exclusionary<br />
Moseley 1<br />
Another view, again derived….nature of romantic love<br />
Unconditional love is bad – it condems atrocity and cheapens love<br />

K – Death of the Public<br />
The aff is part of a modern project that encourages us to find political refuge in reflections of our private lives. This self-absorption makes it impossible for us to establish guiding principles for our interactions with the world. Their demand that we negotiate the public sphere through our intimate relations cannot serve as a vehicle for liberation.<br />
Richard Sennett <u>The Fall of Public Man</u> pg 3-5 1974<br />
Today, public life has also become….be stale and empty<br />
Their connection of political engagement as self-centered and autonomous act is a fundamental premise of the neoliberal pedagogy. It chokes off the development of collective social agents and galvanizes an authoritarian politics that makes us complicitous with the brutalizing logic of the market<br />
Giroux 5 “Cultural Studies in Dark Times: Public Pedagogy and the Challenge of Neoliberalism” <u>Fast Capitalism</u> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.henryagiroux.com/online_articles/DarkTimes.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.henryagiroux.com /online_articles/DarkTimes.htm__</a><br />
Neoliberalism as public pedagogy….brutalizing logic of the market<br />
This self centeredness will unleash the most brutalizing forces of capitalism. We must resist their pedagogy of narcissism because it will dismantle the state’s ability resist authoritarianism and fascism<br />
Giroux 4 – “Public Pedagogy and the Politics of Neoliberalism: Making the political more pedagogical” <u>Policy Futures in education</u> Volume 2, numbers 3&amp; 4 2004<br />
In its capacity to dehistoricize….the possibility of democracy itself.<br />
The divestiture of the state reduces it to a replica of the market. The result is a moral Darwinism where our personal preservation can only be secured by actively persuing the destruction of all others.<br />
Giroux 01 “Mis/Education and Zero Tolerance: Disposable Youth and the Politics of Domestic Militarization” boundary 2 28:3 2001<br />
These articles reflect and perpetuate in….the messages of popular culture are becoming more brutally competitive<br />
Additionally, the reign of neoliberalism sets the stage for the militarization of every aspect of our lives. Shared responsibility is abandoned for an ever expanding war of all against all<br />
Giroux 5 (above)<br />
We live at a time….a war of all against all over even the most limited notions of solidarity and collective struggle.<br />
Their pedagogy lacks the moral vision and vocabulary needed to establish a pedagogical praxis and collective resistance. A pedagogy of intervention would reject the notion that we can understand social problems without investing ourselves in collective political action while simultaneously opposing neoliberal attempts to supplant an open society with a fundamentalist authoritarian social order that will leave a legacy of war, torture, poverty and violence across the globe<br />
Giroux 5 (above)<br />
From a pedagogy of understand to a pedagogy of intervention….and collective resistance<br />
We must recognize the role pedagogy palys in influencing the knowledge and identities we produce. You must privilege our call for an intellectual interrogation of their pedagogy because your responsibility as educators cannot be separated from the consequences of the knowledge we produce. The pedagogical undegrirding of the 1ac will directly inform the way we engage other members of the polis.<br />
Giroux 4 (above)<br />
Pedagogy looms large in all of these….whenever and wherever possible<br />

The Court should use the precedent created by the counterplan as the controlling precedent for future cases concerning [enemy combatants].<br />

CERD CP<br />
Text: The United States Congress should implement the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination by legislating a prohibition of educational tracking and requiring interdistrict remedies, when needed to remedy de jure and/or de facto school segregation. The Department of Education should cease federal educational assistance to districts refusing to comply. School district compliance should be monitored and enforced by the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights. The Office of Civil rights should submit an annual report on United States’ compliance to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.<br />
CERD prohibits both de jure and de facto school segregation. It can easily be applied to remedy inadequate educational opportunities<br />
Mathews, 1997 (The Inoculation of the Eternal Spirit into International Law: How the United States Must Save Itself and the World”, Howard Law Journal, Spring)<br />
The CP internationalizes the struggle against racial injustice. This is a critical first step to abolishing racial hierarchies and discrimination.<br />
Jennings, 1997 (James, “The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination: Implications for Challenging Racial Hierarchy, Howard Law Journal, Spring 1997)<br />
The Court will not invalidate our implementation legislation. 200 years of precedence is on our side<br />
