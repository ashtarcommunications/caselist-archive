 <span style="mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>(Andre, Surrealist,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Manifesto of Surrealism, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.screensite.org/courses/Jbutler/T340/SurManifesto/ManifestoOfSurrealism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.screensite.org/courses/Jbutler/T340/SurManifesto/ManifestoOfSurrealism.htm</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">) </span><br />
</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We are still living under the reign of logic: this, of course, is what I have been driving at. But in this day and age logical methods are applicable only to solving problems of secondary interest. The absolute rationalism that is still in vogue allows us to consider only facts relating directly to our experience. Logical ends, on the contrary, escape us. It is pointless to add that experience itself has found itself increasingly circumscribed. It paces back and forth in a cage from which it is more and more difficult to make it emerge. It too leans for support on what is most immediately expedient, and it is protected by the sentinels of common sense. Under the pretense of civilization and progress, we have managed to banish from the mind everything that may rightly or wrongly be termed superstition, or fancy; forbidden is any kind of search for truth which is not in conformance with accepted practices. It was, apparently, by pure chance that a part of our mental world which we pretended not to be concerned with any longer -- and, in my opinion by far the most important part -- has been brought back to light. For this we must give thanks to the discoveries of Sigmund Freud. On the basis of these discoveries a current of opinion is finally forming by means of which the human explorer will be able to carry his investigation much further, authorized as he will henceforth be not to confine himself solely to the most summary realities. The imagination is perhaps on the point of reasserting itself, of reclaiming its rights. If the depths of our mind contain within it strange forces capable of augmenting those on the surface, or of waging a victorious battle against them, there is every reason to seize them -- first to seize them, then, if need be, to submit them to the control of our reason. The analysts themselves have everything to gain by it. But it is worth noting that no means has been designated a priori for carrying out this undertaking, that until further notice it can be construed to be the province of poets as well as scholars, and that its success is not dependent upon the more or less capricious paths that will be followed. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Freud very rightly brought his critical faculties to bear upon the dream. It is, in fact, inadmissible that this considerable portion of psychic activity (since, at least from man's birth until his death, thought offers no solution of continuity, the sum of the moments of the dream, from the point of view of time, and taking into consideration only the time of pure dreaming, that is the dreams of sleep, is not inferior to the sum of the moments of reality, or, to be more precisely limiting, the moments of waking) has still today been so grossly neglected. I have always been amazed at the way an ordinary observer lends so much more credence and attaches so much more importance to waking events than to those occurring in dreams. It is because man, when he ceases to sleep, is above all the plaything of his memory, and in its normal state memory takes pleasure in weakly retracing for him the circumstances of the dream, in stripping it of any real importance, and in dismissing the only <em>determinant</em> from the point where he thinks he has left it a few hours before: this firm hope, this concern. He is under the impression of continuing something that is worthwhile. Thus the dream finds itself reduced to a mere parenthesis, as is the night. And, like the night, dreams generally contribute little to furthering our understanding. This curious state of affairs seems to me to call for certain reflections:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>1) Within the limits where they operate (or are thought to operate) dreams give every evidence of being continuous and show signs of organization. Memory alone arrogates to itself the right to excerpt from dreams, to ignore the transitions, and to depict for us rather a series of dreams than the <em>dream itself.</em> By the same token, at any given moment we have only a distinct notion of realities, the coordination of which is a question of will.* (Account must be taken of the <em>depth</em> of the dream. For the most part I retain only what I can glean from its most superficial layers. What I most enjoy contemplating about a dream is everything that sinks back below the surface in a waking state, everything I have forgotten about my activities in the course of the preceding day, dark foliage, stupid branches. In &quot;reality,&quot; likewise, I prefer to <em>fall.</em>) What is worth noting is that nothing allows us to presuppose a greater dissipation of the elements of which the dream is constituted. I am sorry to have to speak about it according to a formula which in principle excludes the dream. When will we have sleeping logicians, sleeping philosophers? I would like to sleep, in order to surrender myself to the dreamers, the way I surrender myself to those who read me with eyes wide open; in order to stop imposing, in this realm, the conscious rhythm of my thought. Perhaps my dream last night follows that of the night before, and will be continued the next night, with an exemplary strictness. <em>It's quite possible,</em> as the saying goes. And since it has not been proved in the slightest that, in doing so, the &quot;reality&quot; with which I am kept busy continues to exist in the state of dream, that it does not sink back down into the immemorial, why should I not grant to dreams what I occasionally refuse reality, that is, this value of certainty in itself which, in its own time, is not open to my repudiation? Why should I not expect from the sign of the dream more than I expect from a degree of consciousness which is daily more acute? Can't the dream also be used in solving the fundamental questions of life? Are these questions the same in one case as in the other and, in the dream, do these questions already exist? Is the dream any less restrictive or punitive than the rest? I am growing old and, more than that reality to which I believe I subject myself, it is perhaps the dream, the difference with which I treat the dream, which makes me grow old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>2) Let me come back again to the waking state. I have no choice but to consider it a phenomenon of interference. Not only does the mind display, in this state, a strange tendency to lose its bearings (as evidenced by the slips and mistakes the secrets of which are just beginning to be revealed to us), but, what is more, it does not appear that, when the mind is functioning normally, it really responds to anything but the suggestions which come to it from the depths of that dark night to which I commend it. However conditioned it may be, its balance is relative. It scarcely dares express itself and, if it does, it confines itself to verifying that such and such an idea, or such and such a woman, has made an impression on it. What impression it would be hard pressed to say, by which it reveals the degree of its subjectivity, and nothing more. This idea, this woman, disturb it, they tend to make it less severe. What they do is isolate the mind for a second from its solvent and spirit it to heaven, as the beautiful precipitate it can be, that it is. When all else fails, it then calls upon chance, a divinity even more obscure than the others to whom it ascribes all its aberrations. Who can say to me that the angle by which that idea which affects it is offered, that what it likes in the eye of that woman is not precisely what links it to its dream, binds it to those fundamental facts which, through its own fault, it has lost? And if things were different, what might it be capable of? I would like to provide it with the key to this corridor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>3) The mind of the man who dreams is fully satisfied by what happens to him. The agonizing question of possibility is no longer pertinent. Kill, fly faster, love to your heart's content. And if you should die, are you not certain of reawaking among the dead? Let yourself be carried along, events will not tolerate your interference. You are nameless. The ease of everything is priceless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>What reason, I ask, a reason so much vaster than the other, makes dreams seem so natural and allows me to welcome unreservedly a welter of episodes so strange that they could confound me now as I write? And yet I can believe my eyes, my ears; this great day has arrived, this beast has spoken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>If man's awaking is harder, if it breaks the spell too abruptly, it is because he has been led to make for himself too impoverished a notion of atonement.4) From the moment when it is subjected to a methodical examination, when, by means yet to be determined, we succeed in recording the contents of dreams in their entirety (and that presupposes a discipline of memory spanning generations; but let us nonetheless begin by noting the most salient facts), when its graph will expand with unparalleled volume and regularity, we may hope that the mysteries which really are not will give way to the great Mystery. I believe in the future resolution of these two states, dream and reality, which are seemingly so contradictory, into a kind of absolute reality, a <em>surreality,</em> if one may so speak. It is in quest of this surreality that I am going, certain not to find it but too unmindful of my death not to calculate to some slight degree the joys of its possession. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>A story is told according to which Saint-Pol-Roux, in times gone by, used to have a notice posted on the door of his manor house in Camaret, every evening before he went to sleep, which read: THE POET IS WORKING.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; msospacerun: yes; msobidifontsize: 10.0pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">A great deal more could be said, but in passing I merely wanted to touch upon a subject which in itself would require a very long and much more detailed discussion; I shall come back to it. At this juncture, my intention was merely to mark a point by noting the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">hate of the marvelous</span> which rages in certain men, this absurdity beneath which they try to bury it. Let us not mince words: the marvelous is always beautiful, anything marvelous is beautiful, in fact only the marvelous is beautiful. </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; msospacerun: yes; msobidifontsize: 10.0pt;"> </span><span style="mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"> </span><br />

</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So strong is the belief in life, in what is most fragile in life <em>real</em> life, I mean<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>that in the end this belief is lost. Man, that inveterate dreamer, daily more discontent with his destiny, has trouble assessing the objects he has been led to use, objects that his nonchalance has brought his way, or that he has earned through his own efforts, almost always through his own efforts, for he has agreed to work, at least he has not refused to try his luck (or what he calls his luck!). At this point he feels extremely modest: he knows what women he has had, what silly affairs he has been involved in; he is unimpressed by his wealth or his poverty, in this respect he is still a newborn babe and, as for the approval of his conscience, I confess that he does very nicely without it. If he still retains a certain lucidity, all he can do is turn back toward his childhood which, however his guides and mentors may have botched it, still strikes him as somehow charming. There, the absence of any known restrictions allows him the perspective of several lives lived at once; this illusion becomes firmly rooted within him; now he is only interested in the fleeting, the extreme facility of everything. Children set off each day without a worry in the world. Everything is near at hand, the worst material conditions are fine. The woods are white or black, one will never sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>But it is true that we would not dare venture so far, it is not merely a question of distance. Threat is piled upon threat, one yields, abandons a portion of the terrain to be conquered. This imagination which knows no bounds is henceforth allowed to be exercised only in strict accordance with the laws of an arbitrary utility; it is incapable of assuming this inferior role for very long and, in the vicinity of the twentieth year, generally prefers to abandon man to his lusterless fate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Though he may later try to pull himself together on occasion, having felt that he is losing by slow degrees all reason for living, incapable as he has become of being able to rise to some exceptional situation such as love, he will hardly succeed. This is because he henceforth belongs body and soul to an imperative practical necessity which demands his constant attention. None of his gestures will be expansive, none of his ideas generous or far-reaching. In his minds eye, events real or imagined will be seen only as they relate to a welter of similar events, events in which he has not participated, <em>abortive</em> events. What am I saying: he will judge them in relationship to one of these events whose consequences are more reassuring than the others. On no account will he view them as his salvation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Beloved imagination, what I most like in you is your unsparing quality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>There remains madness, &quot;the madness that one locks up,&quot; as it has aptly been described. That madness or another. We all know, in fact, that the insane owe their incarceration to a tiny number of legally reprehensible acts and that, were it not for these acts their freedom (or what we see as their freedom) would not be threatened. I am willing to admit that they are, to some degree, victims of their imagination, in that it induces them not to pay attention to certain rules<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>outside of which the species feels threatened<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>which we are all supposed to know and respect. But their profound indifference to the way in which we judge them, and even to the various punishments meted out to them, allows us to suppose that they derive a great deal of comfort and consolation from their imagination, that they enjoy their madness sufficiently to endure the thought that its validity does not extend beyond themselves. And, indeed, hallucinations, illusions, etc., are not a source of trifling pleasure. The best controlled sensuality partakes of it, and I know that there are many evenings when I would gladly that pretty hand which, during the last pages of Taines <em>L</em></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Intelligence,</span></em><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> indulges in some curious misdeeds. I could spend my whole life prying loose the secrets of the insane. These people are honest to a fault, and their naiveté has no peer but my own. Christopher Columbus should have set out to discover America with a boatload of madmen. And note how this madness has taken shape, and endured. </span><span style="mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"> </span><br />

</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Language has been given to man so that he may make Surrealist use of it. To the extent that he is required to make himself understood, he manages more or less to express himself, and by so doing to fulfill certain functions culled from among the most vulgar. Speaking, reading a letter, present no real problem for him, provided that, in so doing, he does not set himself a goal above the mean, that is, provided he confines himself to carrying on a conversation (for the pleasure of conversing) with someone. He is not worried about the words that are going to come, nor about the sentence which will follow after the sentence he is just completing. To a very simple question, he will be capable of making a lightning-like reply. In the absence of minor tics acquired through contact with others, he can without any ado offer an opinion on a limited number of subjects; for that he does not need to &quot;count up to ten&quot; before speaking or to formulate anything whatever ahead of time. Who has been able to convince him that this faculty of the first draft will only do him a disservice when he makes up his mind to establish more delicate relationships? There is no subject about which he should refuse to talk, to write about prolifically. <span style="color: navy;">All that results from listening to oneself, from reading what one has written, is the suspension of the occult, that admirable help.</span> I am in no hurry to understand myself (basta! I shall always understand myself). If such and such a sentence of mine turns out to be somewhat disappointing, at least momentarily, I place my trust in the following sentence to redeem its sins; I carefully refrain from starting it over again or polishing it. The only thing that might prove fatal to me would be the slightest loss of impetus. Words, groups of words <em>which follow one another,</em> manifest among themselves the greatest solidarity. It is not up to me to favor one group over the other. It is up to a miraculous equivalent to intervene -- and intervene it does.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Not only does this unrestricted language, which I am trying to render forever valid, which seems to me to adapt itself to all of life's circumstances, not only does this language not deprive me of any of my means, on the contrary it lends me an extraordinary lucidity, and it does so in an area where I least expected it. I shall even go so far as to maintain that it instructs me and, indeed, I have had occasion to use <em>surreally</em> words whose meaning I have forgotten. I was subsequently able to verify that the way in which I had used them corresponded perfectly with their definition. This would leave one to believe that we do not &quot;learn,&quot; that all we ever do is &quot;relearn.&quot; There are felicitous turns of speech that I have thus familiarized myself with. And I am not talking about the <em>poetic consciousness of objects</em> which I have been able to acquire only after a spiritual contact with them repeated a thousand times over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The forms of Surrealist language adapt themselves best to dialogue. Here, two thoughts confront each other; while one is being delivered, the other is busy with it; but how is it busy with it? To assume that it incorporates it within itself would be tantamount to admitting that there is a time during which it is possible for it to live completely off that other thought, which is highly unlikely. And, in fact, the attention it pays is completely exterior; it has only time enough to approve or reject -- generally reject -- with all the consideration of which man is capable. This mode of language, moreover, does not allow the heart of the matter to be plumbed. My attention, prey to an entreaty which it cannot in all decency reject, treats the opposing thought as an enemy; in ordinary conversation, it &quot;takes it up&quot; almost always on the words, the figures of speech, it employs; it puts me in a position to turn it to good advantage in my reply by distorting them. This is true to such a degree that in certain pathological states of mind, where the sensorial disorders occupy the patient's complete attention, he limits himself, while continuing to answer the questions, to seizing the last word spoken in his presence or the last portion of the Surrealist sentence some trace of which he finds in his mind.<span style="mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"> </span><br />
Q. &quot;How old are you?&quot; A. &quot;You.&quot; <em>(Echolalia.)</em><br />
Q. &quot;What is your name?&quot; A. &quot;Forty-five houses.&quot; <em>(Ganser syndrome, or beside-the-point replies.)</em><br />
There is no conversation in which some trace of this disorder does not occur. The effort to be social which dictates it and the considerable practice we have at it are the only things which enable us to conceal it temporarily. It is also the great weakness of the book that it is in constant conflict with its best, by which I mean the most demanding, readers. In the very short dialogue that I concocted above between the doctor and the madman, it was in fact the madman who got the better of the exchange. Because, through his replies, he obtrudes upon the attention of the doctor examining him -- and because he is not the person asking the questions. Does this mean that his thought at this point is stronger? Perhaps. He is free not to care any longer about his age or name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Poetic Surrealism, which is the subject of this study, has focused its efforts up to this point on reestablishing dialogue in its absolute truth, by freeing both interlocutors from any obligations and politeness. Each of them simply pursues his soliloquy without trying to derive any special dialectical pleasure from it and without trying to impose anything whatsoever upon his neighbor. The remarks exchanged are not, as is generally the case, meant to develop some thesis, however unimportant it may be; they are as disaffected as possible. As for the reply that they elicit, it is, in principle, totally indifferent to the personal pride of the person speaking. The words, the images are only so many springboards for the mind of the listener. In <em>Les Champs magnétiques,</em> the first purely Surrealist work, this is the way in which the pages grouped together under the title <em>Barrières</em> must be conceived of -- pages wherein Soupault and I show ourselves to be impartial interlocutors. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The first surrealists in Europe, South America and Japan were poets who became revolutionists—without, of course, ceasing to be poets. For the Chicago surrealists—in vehement opposition to the dominant literary cliques and ideologies—poetry and revolution have always been inseparable. Dialectically developing Marx's insight that capitalism is inherently hostile to poetry, surrealism demonstrates that authentic poetry is inherently hostile to capitalism. Indeed, it is poetry, more than anything else—&quot;the supreme <em>disalienation</em> of humanity with its language,&quot; as Philip Lamantia has put it—that prepares the climate of expectation and readiness for the actualization of the Marvelous without which revolutionary change is unthinkable. Poetry is erotic affirmation, the call of the wild, analogical thought at its most uncompromising, the refusal to submit, the antithesis of Literature. It ignites desire, affirms negation, expands the possible, advances freedom, foments rebellion, provokes action as well as dreaming, and brings us closer to a life in which action and dream are no longer regarded as being in irreconcilable conflict. For us, poetry is itself <em>revolutionary praxis,</em> and revolution is the process by which poetry is realized in everyday life. </span><br />

<span style="mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(Paul, Franklin, and Penelope : Surrealists &amp; Scholars, “Revolt and Revolution,” </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.surrealistmovement-usa.org/pages/forecast02.html#revolution" rel="nofollow">http://www.surrealistmovement-usa.org/pages/forecast02.html#revolution</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">) </span><br />
</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In a country where the great majority of artists, writers and even self-styled &quot;radicals&quot; have always identified themselves with &quot;liberal&quot; (<em>i.e.,</em> bourgeois) political traditions, or their pseudo-Marxist equivalents (social-democracy and the many variants of Stalinism), surrealists in the U.S. from the start were grounded in the theory and practice of working class self-emancipation. What Rosa Luxemburg called &quot;the inner wretchedness of bourgeois liberalism, as well as its intimate connection with Reaction,&quot; was obvious to us then, and seem so excruciatingly obvious now that it is hard to understand how anyone could possibly deny it. For us, surrealism was—and still is—the most thoroughgoing expression of individual revolt and social/cultural revolution. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">We recognize capitalism—wage-slavery—as a <em>global system,</em> rotten to the core and utterly destructive to humankind and the planet<span style="color: black;">. The countless and multiplying horrors perpetrated by this system (from homelessness and war to an out-of-control technology and the devastation of the natural world) can not be cured by piecemeal reforms, or even by large-scale reforms within the framework of capitalist exploitation. Nothing less than social revolution—a radical break with all stultifying and life-denying forms of social organization—can put an end to capitalism's cataclysmic reign of violence, liberate the Earth and its inhabitants from oppression, and bring about a truly <em>free</em> society.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><span style="color: black;">Clearly freedom and equality cannot be realized by a revolution hostile to poetry. As the myth of the &quot;vanguard party&quot; and other authoritarian illusions recede, new emancipatory models of revolution are emerging. Surrealism itself is an active factor here, helping to <em>revolutionize the idea of revolution.</em> What is needed is a revolution that is unafraid of poetry, a revolution determined from the very beginning to lessen the gap between poetry and &quot;reality.&quot;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><span style="color: black;">Social revolution of course is only the beginning of the realization of the surrealist project. The Surrealist Movement remains &quot;at the service of the revolution,&quot; but it is important to recognize that, for us, revolution is also in the service of surrealism. </span></span></span><span style="mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"><br />
