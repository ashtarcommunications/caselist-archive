Contention One—The Illegitimate Warrior<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court ruled legal rights apply to unlawful combatants in military tribunals, but these protections are significantly less than those accorded other defendants and are basically meaningless.<br />
Paye, Belgian Sociologist, 2005, Guantánamo and the New Legal Order, Monthly Review Volume 57, Number 1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.monthlyreview.org/0505paye.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.monthlyreview.org/0505paye.htm</a><br />
On August 24, 2004, … organizations or persons.”14<br />
<br />
The government is cynically twisting the Geneva Conventions to suit their purposes, ignoring applicability to actors deemed illegitimate.<br />
Judith Butler, Professor of Rhetoric at UC Berkeley, 2002, Guantanamo Limbo, The Nation, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020401/butler" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020401/butler</a><br />
To its credit….competent tribunal.<br />
<br />
The crux of the Government’s argument lies in Ex Parte Quirin, drawing heavily on Roosevelt’s actions in World War II to justify its treatment of Unlawful combatants<br />
Bryant and Tobias 2003—Associate Professor at UNLV School of Law, Professor at UNLV School of Law<br />
(SYMPOSIUM ISSUE: CIVIL LIBERTIES IN A TIME OF TERROR: ARTICLE: QUIRIN REVISITED, 2003 Wis. L. Rev. 309)<br />
On November 13, 2001, President Bush …for such a detention.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reliance on events of World War II erases deaths of the racialized enemy from our consciousness, allowing cycles of killing to continue indefinitely.<br />
Marianna Torgovnick, Professor of English at Duke, 2005, The War Complex: World War II in Our Time, p. xi-i<br />
War time consciousness… brought those patterns at home.<br />
<br />
The government draws the terms of the debate on the basis from allegiance to nation-states.<br />
Judith Butler, Professor of Rhetoric at UC Berkeley, 2002, Guantanamo Limbo, The Nation, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020401/butler" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020401/butler</a><br />
On January 22 Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld explained why …. allow repatriation to nations such as Britain.<br />
<br />
Additionally, Bush’s Military Order uses state citizenship as the basis for the application of due process protections, assigning lower legal status to non-state actors.<br />
Neal K. Katyal and Laurence H. Tribe, Visiting Professor @ Yale Law School and Professor @ Georgetown Law Center, April, 2002, “Waging War, Deciding Guilt: Trying the Military Tribunals,” Yale Law Journal, 111 Yale L.J. 1259, ln<br />
Unlike Quirin….that such circumstances are present today.<br />
<br />
Alien-ness and due process rights are inextricably tied in the war on terror, allowing the non-state “enemy combatant” to be treated as a sub-human threat.<br />
Peter Nyers, Political Science, McMaster Univeristy, 2006, The Accidental Citizen, Economy and Society v. 35 n. 1, 22-41<br />
In his influential writings ….’ (Seelye 2002: A15).3<br />
<br />
This assigns legitimacy solely to the realm of the nation-state actors, using a notion of “Just War” to excuse our conduct and simultaneously condemn our enemies.<br />
Derek Summerfield, honorary senior lecturer—Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College, 2003, Torture is a form of terrorism: there are no justifications for it, BMJ 2003; 326: 773-774<br />
In the middle ages ….. therefore ignorable.8<br />
<br />
And, it is the detainees statelessness which allows them to be excluded from humanity—lack of compliance with the Geneva Convention allows the state to murder with impunity<br />
Donald E. Pease, Avalon Foundation Chair of the Humanities @ Dartmouth College, Fall 2003, The Global Homeland State: Bush’s Biopolitical settlement, Boundary 2 30:3, Project Muse<br />
“The detention camps were in a realm beyond good and evil…kill without being accused of murder.”<br />

<strong>Lower courts counterplan</strong><br />
Underruling spillsover – the counterplan causes abuse of the doctrine<br />
Caminker, 1994, 46 Stan. L. R. 817<br />
“Second, even assuming a category of rare cases… better than the alternative.”<br />
<br />
Impact destroys the judicial system<br />
Caminker, 1994<br />
“Paulsen acknowledges that “were judges to…by hierarchical precedent.”<br />
<br />
Threatens survival<br />
Henkin, 1988, Atlantic Comm Qtly, Spring<br />
“Lawyers, even constitutional lawyers, argue “technically,”…committed to human survival.”<br />
<br />
Underruling risks system-wide legitimacy<br />
Brannon and Reynolds 2003, 55 AR LR 1253, Rulings and resistance<br />
“In the pages that follow, we will support these general statements….not that it will fearlessly fail to do so.”<br />
<br />
Non unique and no internal link – supreme court isolated from lower courts due to structural causes<br />
Bhagwat, 2000, 80 BU law review, 967<br />
“The concept of “percolation” provides another example of the…Supreme Court from the rest of the judiciary.”<br />

Biodiversity not only provides direct benefits like food, medicine, and energy; it also affords us a &quot;life support system.&quot; Biodiversity is required for the recycling of essential elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. It is also responsible for mitigating pollution, protecting watersheds, and combating soil erosion. Because biodiversity acts as a buffer against excessive variations in weather and climate, it protects us from catastrophic events beyond human control. The importance of biodiversity to a healthy environment has become increasingly clear. We have learned that the future well-being of all humanity depends on our stewardship of the Earth. When we overexploit living resources, we threaten our own survival.<br />

<strong>Contention One : Gender Violence<br />

Violence Against Women in the United States<br />
MURDER. Every day four … common than they were prior to 1988.<br />
<br />
The result is a system that renders gender violence both private and invisible. Silence in the face of this ongoing war is passive acceptance and complicity in the most brutal form of violence.<br />

<strong>The USSC should rule that 42 USC 13981 constitutes an appropriate exercise<br />
of congressional power to enforce the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth<br />
Amendment.<br />
Contention Two : Citizenship<br />
<br />
The jurisdictional analysis in Morrison is an explicit denial of equal citizenship. This precedent serves to naturalize a specific national identity that confines gender subordination to the private sphere.<br />
Judith Resnik, Professor of Law - Yale Law School, 2002 (“Feminist Justice, at Home and Abroad,” 14 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism 393)<br />
In this volume dedicated to Women, Justice, and Authority … pitchers, and mirrors have retreated from view.<br />
<br />
<br />
Confinement of gender violence to the private sphere contributes to and legitimates a militarized form of citizenship. Challenging this relationship is the first step in productive attempts to<br />
redefine our understandings of violence and security.<br />
Tickner-Associate Professor of Political Science at the College of the Holy Cross-92<br />

The pervasiveness of internal conflict within states in the latter part of the twentieth century and the threats that … these reconstructed visions of citizenship come about.<br />

<br />
Failure to confront this specific form of militarized citizenship makes domination and violence inevitable. Only by interrogating the relationship between gender inequality and other forms of<br />
insecurity can we create more sustainable forms of politics.<br />

The United States Supreme Court should rule 42 U.S.C. §13981 constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.<br />
<br />
Contention Three : Solvency<br />
<br />
The Morrison Court’s interpretation of the 14th Amendment recreates a public-private dichotomy, whereby violence can continue with impunity. The Supreme Court’s position directly fuels inequality and domination. Only the plan can solve.<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law - University of Michigan Law School, 2000 (“Disputing Male Sovereignty,” 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135)<br />
3. Theory. - The controversy over the scope of the 5 power … sphere in which it is socially exercised.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only a Supreme Court overrule of US v. Morrison can de-legitimate gender-based violence, and spark necessary changes in the legal system<br />
Deborah M. Weissman, Associate Professor of Law/Director of Clinical Programs - University North Carolina, Chapel Hill School of Law, 2001 (“Gender-Based Violence as Judicial Anomaly,” 42 B.C. L. Rev 1081)<br />

<strong>CONTENTION ONE: WAR PRISON<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court and Congress have given Bush a blank check to prosecute terrorist suspects by any means necessary. The Court ruled legal rights apply to unlawful combatants in military tribunals only if it doesn’t interfere with national security.<br />
Paye, Belgian Sociologist, 2005, Guantánamo and the New Legal Order, Monthly Review Volume 57, Number 1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.monthlyreview.org/0505paye.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.monthlyreview.org/0505paye.htm</a><br />
<br />
Additionally, the Executive branch relies heavily on Ex Parte Quirin for their claims of legality over enemy combatants.<br />
Bryant and Tobias 03—Associate Professor at UNLV School of Law, Professor at UNLV School of Law<br />
<br />
Bush’s Military Order uses citizenship as the basis for the application of due process claims, creating a citizen/alien distinction which equates the foreign with the inferior.<br />
Neal K. Katyal and Laurence H. Tribe, Visiting Professor @ Yale Law School and Professor @ Georgetown Law Center, April, 2002, “Waging War, Deciding Guilt: Trying the Military Tribunals,” Yale Law Journal, 111 Yale L.J. 1259, ln<br />
<br />
Alien-ness and due process rights are inextricably tied in the war on terror allowing the non-citizen to be treated as a sub-human threat.<br />
Peter Nyers, Political Science, McMaster Univeristy, 2006, The Accidental Citizen, Economy and Society v. 35 n. 1, 22-41<br />
<br />
The Executive Branch has been given unilateral judgment on who is dangerous and thus not deserving of rights. The policy of indefinite detention is the most insidious form of governmentality, allowing the executive to eliminate threats to the state.<br />
Judith Butler, Professor of Rhetoric at UC Berkeley, 2004, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, pg 56-59<br />
<br />
Particularly egregious is the indefinite nature of the detentions at Guantanamo—the administration has purposefully deprived the prisoners of any means by which to determine when their abuse will end in order to crush any hope they might have left.<br />
Melissa Jamison, University of California, 2005<br />
<br />
Furthermore, indefinite detention relies on a normative conception of the human that reduce any potential risk as an “unlivable life” and thus outside of the human community.<br />
Judith Butler, Professor of Rhetoric at UC Berkeley, 2004, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, pg xv-xvi<br />
<br />
This violence is not only carried out by the sovereign sword but begins with our assumptions about the human community. The politics of indefinite detention rest on a violent ontology resulting in a permanent state of war and the eradication of being.<br />
Judith Butler, Professor of Rhetoric at UC Berkeley, 2004, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, pg 31-34<br />
<br />
Our policy of indefinite detention at Guanatanamo is at the heart of a new mode of politics which is consumed with risk that in the name of protecting the homeland engages in an unending series of violent acts which only recreate the problem which the war on terrorism purports to combat.<br />
Keith Spence, Professor of Criminology at the University of Leicester, June 2005, “World Risk Society and War Against Terror,” Political Studies, Vol. 53<br />
<br />
And, the burden of proof has shifted to the accused—ensuring that their can be no end insight to the violence.<br />
Claudia Aradau and Rens Van Munster, Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Southern Denmark, 2005, “Governing Terrorism and the (Non-) Politics of Risk,” Political Science Publications No. 11, pg 11-13<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should rule unconstitutional on due process grounds the military tribunals for the purposes of trial of unlawful belligerents.<br />
<br />
Contention Three: Solvency<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court should overrule Quirin—the decision was made in the heat of World War II and should not be used to fuel another wave of war time hysteria.<br />
Neal K. Katyal and Laurence H. Tribe, Visiting Professor @ Yale Law School and Professor @ Georgetown Law Center, April, 2002, “Waging War, Deciding Guilt: Trying the Military Tribunals,” Yale Law Journal, 111 Yale L.J. 1259, ln<br />
<br />
Court action is key—overruling the Quirin precedent key to prevent future tribunals to try whatever new threats the executive decides to conjure in the future.<br />
Neal K. Katyal and Laurence H. Tribe, Visiting Professor @ Yale Law School and Professor @ Georgetown Law Center, April, 2002, “Waging War, Deciding Guilt: Trying the Military Tribunals,” Yale Law Journal, 111 Yale L.J. 1259, ln<br />
<br />
Our relationship to terrorism has been one which disavows mourning in the name of moral clarity. This obsession with our own strength has forced us to turn away from alterity and towards endless cycles of violence—only voting affirmative can reframe the debate and allow us to use institutions productively.<br />
Judith Butler, Professor of Rhetoric at UC Berkeley, 2004, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, pg 148-151<br />
<br />
Consequential ethical decisions founded on knowledge reduce the other to an object of exploitation and domination – responding to the call of the Other must be a first step in ethical decision-making<br />
Roger Gottlieb, Professor of Humanities @ Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 44 Cross Currents 2, 1994 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.crosscurrents.org/feministecology.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.crosscurrents.org/feministecology.htm</a><br />
<br />
The existence of infinite detention policies in places like Guantanamo Bay is emblematic of the pervasive and inevitable roll of sovereignty—sovereignty would be exercised in alleviating the injustices prevalent in the status quo. Instead of looking for a way out, sovereignty must be torqued against itself—only our reworking of law can even attempt to work towards justice.<br />
Michaelsen, Co-Editor of the Centennial Review, and Shershow, Associate Professor of English at Miami University, 2004, Beyond and Before the Law at Guantánamo, Peace Review 16:3<br />
<br />
Hope is within reach by taking small steps in alternative directions. We must demonstrate empathetic contact with human suffering and we must bear compassionate witness to the destruction of our era. This empathetic imagination can transform our collective consciousness away from homicidal drives.<br />

“Unlike progressives the conservative…be imperiled in the future”<br />

2. n/u- rolling back environmental law now<br />
3. courts not minimalist now<br />
4. overruling Morrison increases legitimacy<br />
5. Morrison was maximalist<br />
6. case turns advantage- U Law Review says we advance progressive politics<br />
7. durability of fiat solves our advantage<br />
8. minimalism should be hard and factual<br />
9. No internal link- Roberts is not minimalist<br />
10. minimalism ignores the substance of the constitution<br />
11. Impacts are inevitable- Holman 1996<br />
12. SQ=extinction X 89<br />
13. Case O/Ws- violence /extinction inevitable<br />
<br />
<br />
CP<br />
1. Perm Do CP- not mutually exclusive<br />
2. x 2000<br />
<br />
Normal means- court doesn't have to rule on issue on a whole<br />
<br />
Turns gender jurisdiction<br />
That's key- X 2002<br />
<br />
Perm Have congress …intrinsic permutation<br />
<br />
PICS BAD<br />
-strategy skew<br />
-education<br />
-impossible to predict<br />
<br />

<br />
Only a few losses to change culture<br />
<br />
The impact is systemic-attorney costs not that high<br />
<br />
Justice Advantage<br />
<br />
Aggressive judicial review allows courts to ignore the will of the people, this type of legislation is key, making all of their other disad impacts inevitable<br />

Biodiversity not only provides direct benefits like food, medicine, and energy; it also affords us a &quot;life support system.&quot; Biodiversity is required for the recycling of essential elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. It is also responsible for mitigating pollution, protecting watersheds, and combating soil erosion. Because biodiversity acts as a buffer against excessive variations in weather and climate, it protects us from catastrophic events beyond human control. The importance of biodiversity to a healthy environment has become increasingly clear. We have learned that the future well-being of all humanity depends on our stewardship of the Earth. When we overexploit living resources, we threaten our own survival.<br />

Contention 1: Gender Violence<br />
<br />
Precedent established in Morrison creates a major obstacle to transforming the way gender violence is conceptualized in both the law and society – Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor, Rutgers University School of Law, Camden, 2000 (“No Civilized System of Justice, 102 W. Va. L. Rev. 499)<br />
<br />
Alternative Fed. Legislation is Insufficient – VAWA was designed to close the loophole – Angie Perone, J.D., Candidate, University of California, Hastings College of the Law, 1006, “Unchain My Heart”, 17 Hastings Women’s L.J. 115<br />
<br />
Similarly antiquated legal doctrines, system bias, and failure to account for discriminatory aspects makes justice at the state level an empty promise – Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor, Rutgers University School of Law-Camden, 2000, “No Civilized System of Justice: 102 W. Va. L. Rev. 499<br />
<br />
Result is a system that renders gender violence both private and invisible. Silence in the face of this ongoing war is passive acceptance and complicity in the most brutal form of violence – Rumna Chowdhury, J.D. University of Minnesota, 2002 “Kadic v Karadzic – Rape as a Crime Against Women as a Class” 20 Laq &amp; Ineq.J. 91<br />
<br />
Contention 2: Citizenship<br />
<br />
The jurisdictional analysis in Morrison is an explicit denial of equal citizenship. This precedent serves to naturalize a specific national identity that confines gender subordination to the private sphere – Judith Resnik, Professor Law – Yale Law School, 2002 “Feminist Justice, at Home and Abroad” 14 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism 393<br />
<br />
Confinement of gender violence to the private sphere contributes to and legitimates a militarized form of citizenship. Challenging this relationship is the first step in productive attempts to redefine our understandings of violence and security – Tickner, Associate Professor of Political Science at the College of the Holy Cross, 1992, “Gender in International Relations” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner12.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner12.html</a><br />
<br />
Failure to confront this specific form of militarized citizen ship makes domination and violence inevitable. Only by interrogating the relationship between gender inequality and other forms of insecurity can we create more sustainable forms of politics - Tickner, Associate Professor of Political Science at the College of the Holy Cross, 1992, “Gender in International Relations” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner12.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner12.html</a><br />
<br />
Plan: The USSC should rule 42 U.S.C 13981 constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment<br />
<br />
Contention 3: Solvency<br />
<br />
The Morrison court’s interpretation of the 14th Amendment recreates a public-private dichotomy, whereby violence can continue with impunity. The Supreme Court’s position directly fuels inequality and domination. Only the plan can solve – Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law – University of Michigan Law School, 2000 “Disputing Male Sovereignty” 114 Har. L. Rev. 135<br />
<br />
Only a Supreme Court overrule of US v Morrison can de-legitimate gender-based violence and spark necessary changes in the legal system – Deborah M. Weissman, Associate Professor of Law/Director of Clinical Programs – University North Carolina, Chapel High School of Law, 2001 “Gender-Based Violence as Judicial Anomaly” 42 B.C. L. Rev. 1081<br />
<br />
Criminal Justice System is disempowering, deters reporting, and requires overly restrictive evidence standards. A federal civil remedy provides a crucial alternative – Hallock – student note – 1993, 68 Ind. L.J. 577<br />
<br />
The Animus requirement is not a barrier. The history of VAWA cases disproves difficulty of proving gender motivation – Goldfarb, associate professor Law at Rutgers 2003, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Policy &amp; L. 251<br />
<br />
Our approach does not privilege gender – Title III is consistent with the project of intersectional analysis - Goldfarb, associate professor Law at Rutgers 2003, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Policy &amp; L. 251<br />
<br />
Arguments about the number of cases brought ignore the empirical and potential benefits of the civil remedy – Martha F. Davis, Counsel for Brzonkala in US v Morrison + Visiting Professor at Albany Law School, 2001, “A Proper Subject of National Legislation” 47 Loy. L. Rev. 535<br />
<br />
The Affirmative’s framing of gender violence as an issue of systemic discrimination is a prerequisite to changing legal and social behavior. Our call for the VAWA civil remedy is part of a larger transformative struggle to end gender violence - Goldfarb, associate professor Law at Rutgers 2003, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Policy &amp; L. 251<br />
<br />
Lawmaking is step one in achieving social change – give a name and visibility to the harm – Elizabeth Schneider, Professor of Law – Brooklyn Law School, 2000 Battered Women &amp; Feminist Lawmaking, 4-5<br />
<br />
Court’s are the venue for the remedy – Only SC can initiate the necessary change – Jennifer R. Johnson, Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review, 2003, “Privileged Justice Under Law” 43 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399<br />
