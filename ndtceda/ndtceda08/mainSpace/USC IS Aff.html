A. Criminalization –<br />
The invalidation of the Civil Rights Remedy turns VAWA into an issue of criminalization<br />
Bumiller, Prof of Political Science and Gender Studies @ Amherst, 2005<br />
(Kristin, Freedom from Gender Violence as a Human Right: Feminism and Federalism in a Global Perspective, 5th Annual Women and the Law Conference, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The invalidation of the civil rights … primarily on volunteers and soft money.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The current criminalization approach to sexual violence reproduces violence – criminalization strategies give the state and law enforcement too much power – the result is series of mandatory arrest laws and no drop policies that harm the very women they are intended to protect<br />

(Kristin, Freedom from Gender Violence as a Human Right: Feminism and Federalism in a Global Perspective, 5th Annual Women and the Law Conference, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Thus it becomes imperative to ask …circumstances for state intrusion into private lives.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The civil remedy is an important break from the criminalization approach that victimizes women – civil litigation gives women the power over the legal process which dramatically reduces the powers vested in the state<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, The University of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
[Catherine, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, November, p. 137-138]<br />
The Morrison majority did not contest what Congress … behavior and to value and restore survivors.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Framing the Issue<br />
The Civil Remedy approach is a powerful medium for communicating equality and shifting social norms of individual and officials – it will change the cultural frame of reference and it will allow women to assert their cause in a collective fashion<br />
Goldfarb, Associate Professor, Rutgers University School of Law, 2003<br />
(Sally F., American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 251)<br />
<br />
Civil rights claims are intrinsically assertive … charged with the task of responding to such violence.<br />
<br />
The civil remedy creates an explicit framework of gender equality that gives women the power over the legal process – it is a productive way to engage the state that frames the issue<br />
Schneider, Professor of Law, George Mason, 2000<br />
[Liz, Battered Women &amp; Feminist Lawmaking, p. 196-198]<br />
What are the implications …state on domestic violence continue.<br />

<br />
<br />
C. The localization of violence<br />
The Morrison decision unites the private and the local, treating violence within the home as outside of its power – the focus on violence against women as a local problem allows gender violence to continue unimpeded.<br />
MacKinnon, Professor of Law at Michigan Law, 2000<br />

The arbitrary boundary-drawing of what is worth the Federal Government’s time and resources absolves political accountability and justifies patriarchal control<br />

Violence against women is a systemic impact – it is a mass atrocity that takes thousands of lives – it is an urgent policy consideration<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School, and Fellow, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, “Women's September 11th: Rethinking the International Law of Conflict,” 47 Harvard International Law Journal 1. Winter, 2006<br />

Morrison’s Commerce Clause definition precludes integration between the federal and state actors<br />
Brook, 2005<br />

Contention 3 – Wetlands<br />
<br />
Reversing the current commerce clause precedent is key to protect wetlands – already the Supreme Court has used the Lopez and Morrison precedent to curtail wetlands enforcement in the SWANCC decision<br />
Carroll 2005 [C. Ronald, University of Georgia-River Basin Center, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sinauer.com/groom/article.php?id=15" rel="nofollow">http://www.sinauer.com/groom/article.php?id=15</a>]<br />

<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey on the grounds that abortion counseling is a form of speech that is protected by the First Amendment.<br />
<br />
We’ll Clarify.<br />
Advantage One: Irrational Women<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court decision in Casey treats women as irrational and in need of government assistance – this paternalistic attitude is inconsistent with the stance the Supreme Court has taken towards every other group of individuals<br />
Berg, 1998 [Paula E., Associate Professor of Law, “Lost in a Doctrinal Wasteland,” 8 Health Matrix 153]<br />
<br />
Since Rust and Casey…learning their infant's HIV status.<br />
<br />
The logic of paternalism surrounding the treatment of women as irrational is the root of the patriarchal structure in law – women are not given equal rights because of their irrational and inferior nature – the aff is a critical internal link to solve patriarchy<br />
Abrams, 1995 [Paula, Associate Professor of Law, Northwestern School of Law, “The Tradition of Reproduction,” Arizona Law Review, 37 Ariz. L. Rev. 453]<br />

<br />
In an article entitled &quot;Naming the Cultural … the major rifts in world politics. (Shelly 1983)<br />
Advantage Two: Eugenics<br />
<br />
Casey allows the state to determine medical truth and falsity – it gives the state full control over doctors coercing individuals<br />
Berg, 1994 [Paula, Visiting Assistant Prof, City University of New York Law, “Toward a First Amendment Theory of Doctor-Patient Discourse,” 74 B.U.L. Rev. 201]<br />
<br />
The Court's standards for judging the … within the structure of the doctor-patient relationship. 121<br />
<br />
<br />
Casey has allowed the government to politicize the practice of medicine – the synthesis of medicine and state power has led to the mass atrocities of Soviet gulags and Nazi Germany<br />
Berg, 1994 [Paula, Visiting Assistant Prof, City University of New York Law, “Toward a First Amendment Theory of Doctor-Patient Discourse,” 74 B.U.L. Rev. 201]<br />
<br />
The practice of medicine invariably reflects … biasing the medical information available to patients. 26<br />
<br />
Eugenics is not solely a Nazi problem – it is the result of medicine coming too close to the state – eugenics is very possible in the US<br />
Boisaubin, 1998 [Eugene V., MD, “In the Shadow of the Reich: Nazi Medicine,” JAMA 1998;279:18 pp.1496]<br />
<br />
American understanding of the events … of the nation usurped the needs of the individual.<br />
<br />
<br />
The marriage of medicine and doctors with state bureaucracy makes mass genocide inevitable – the bureaucratization of medicine prevents our ability to understand violence in human terms – it desensitizes us and makes mass atrocity inevitable<br />
Lifton, 1986 [Robert Jay, Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology, The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide, pg. 14-5 and 495-7]<br />
<br />

Berg, 1994 [Paula, Visiting Assistant Prof, City University of New York Law, “Toward a First Amendment Theory of Doctor-Patient Discourse,” 74 B.U.L. Rev. 201]<br />

Blasi, 1985 [Vincent, “The Pathological Perspective and the First Amendment,” 85 Colum. L. Rev. 449]<br />

Contention Four: Solvency<br />
<br />
<br />
The action/speech distinction in Casey is the reason informed consent provision in Casey wasn’t struck down on first amendment grounds – this proves we solve and that we are topical<br />
Wells, 1995 [Christina E., Associate Professor, University of Missouri School of Law, “Abortion Counseling as Vice Activity,” 95 Colum. L. Rev. 1724]<br />
<br />
The joint opinion's real flaw came in … those medical procedures primarily involved speech. 83<br />
