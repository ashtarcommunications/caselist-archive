<br />
The share of energy consumption accounted for by the different stages of livestock production … fossil fuel for machinery generally exceeds that for fertilizer production.<br />
<br />
<br />
This reliance of fossil fuels makes the collapse of agriculture inevitable and will lead to extinction.<br />

The coming end of the petroleum age involves much more than the question … The coming collapse of the petroleum economy endangers us all – even the heads of the oligarchs are on the block.<br />
<br />
Alone these effects are devastating, but combined they constitute another degree of magnitude that must be considered on par with nuclear war &amp; global warming.<br />

The predominant land ethic operative in our nation at this time … task before us is awesome, promising, and transforming.<br />

Alternatives to confinement reduce water pollution and soil damage.<br />

<br />
Cattle are capable of receiving all or most of their dietary requirements from pasture … productivity was about 3 percent below that of conventional animal operations.<br />

Subsidies to CAFOs are responsible for the industrial consolidation of animal farming – elimination subsides is key.<br />

FACTORY FARMING Factory farms are growing … It should require transparency and make polluters accountable for the harm they cause.<br />
<br />
CAFOs are at a unique economic climate – high grain prices have virtually eliminated indirect subsidies exposing the artificial supports that prop up animal confinement operations.<br />
Starmer &amp; Wise, ‘7<br />
[Elanor &amp; Timothy, Research Fellow and Deputy Director of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts UniversityConfined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), sometimes called factory farms or industrial animal operations, are defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as livestock operations that do not sustain their own crops or other animal feed and that, “Living High on the Hog: factory farms, Federal Policy and the Structural Transformation of Swine Production, Global Development and Environmental Institute, Working Paper No. 07-04 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/07-04LivingHighOnHog.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/07-04LivingHighOnHog.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
We conclude that in an economic climate of full-cost feed … favored large-scale industrial animal production.<br />
<br />
<br />
High grain prices support a shift to diversified animal operations but ending EQIP subsidies and loopholes is the only way to reverse the economic slide of small farmers.<br />

<br />
The corporations that dominate the industrial livestock sector … might begin to reverse their downward economic slide (NFFC 2005).<br />
<br />
EQIP subsidies uniquely impact small farms – the new language is designed to support industrial operations.<br />

<br />
EQIP originated as part of the 1985 farm bill and was renewed … Most EQIP applications therefore remain unfunded.<br />
<br />
The NEG will say we should more strictly enforce new pollution controls – but absent the plan new regulations will favor large operation and increase consolidation.<br />

<br />
The animal feeding industry is actively seeking new technologies … then acquired by larger firms, increasing industry concentration.
