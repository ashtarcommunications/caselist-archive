<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We begin with advice from Cicero in 42 BC </span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Roman Orator [Marcus Tullius]</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“A nation can survive its fools, and even the…murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The 1AC functions as a criticism of the status quo US policy creating a rhethoric that risks unraveling the current unipolar world. Each criticism contributes to neo-isolationist tendencies that create a potential foil to American Predominance. </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“A grand strategy based on American primacy means…equivalent of a Blitzkrieg”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even if the current world sucks – the alternative is worse – the collapse of US heg causes a multipolar vacuum leading to multiple scenarios for extinction </span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ferguson, 2004</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“So what is left? Waning empires. Religious revivals. Incipient…a not-so-new world disorder.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Alternative is to reject the aff as a signal of commitment to US imperial resolve. It is necessary to maintain support for US hegemony because our academic discourse actually effects foreign policy </span></strong><br />

The United States Federal Government should offer to expand programs to share technology, arms and training with the Australian military to aid in Australia’s defense transformation. The Department of Defense should engage private contractors to acquire substantial quantities of sugar on an annual ongoing basis at double current market prices from South Africa and Caribbean nations through split contracts of less than $50 million dollars each. The government of the State of Florida should make necessary monetary concessions to ensure successful purchase of land owned by U.S. Sugar and should ensure sugar production does not occur on land purchased as part of that agreement. The government of the State of Florida should enact a moratorium on further development of the Everglades.<br />
