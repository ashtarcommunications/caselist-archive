<br />
QPQ<br />
<br />
We meet<br />
<br />
c/i- must be unconditional<br />
<br />
ce is to remove pressure<br />
<br />
bidirectionality<br />
<br />
conditional cp is critical ground<br />
<br />
limits out SG<br />
<br />
we are predictable<br />
<br />
competing interps bad<br />
<br />
reasonability good<br />
<br />
<br />
Kritik-biopwerish/threat construction with no alt<br />
<br />
Framework<br />
<br />
Squo or competitive policy option<br />
<br />

Cant solve the case<br />
<br />
Perm do both<br />
<br />
Non unique<br />
<br />
Need state to prevent nuclear war<br />
<br />
They link to threats also<br />
<br />
Realism inevitable<br />
<br />
<br />
Consult<br />
<br />
Perm do both<br />
<br />
Europe would say no<br />
<br />
France would say no<br />
<br />
Perm do both and consult them<br />
<br />
Textually competive<br />
<br />
If cp solves, it hurts relations<br />
<br />
Consultations cause delay<br />
<br />
One shot consult fails<br />
<br />
Multiple conditional cps bad<br />
<br />
Consult counterplanns bad<br />
<br />
<br />
Covert CP<br />
<br />
Perm do both<br />

Global oil decline will inevitable drop prices<br />
<br />
Price changes will inevitable go down<br />
<br />
Low prices inevitable<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Strikes are inevitable<br />
<br />
Containment makes confrontation inevitable<br />
<br />
We control Uniquness<br />

Kentucky GG v Mary Washington KS<br />
<br />
Kentucky 1AC – Iran Sanctions Aff<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 – Iran Strikes/Miscalc/War<br />
<br />
6 reasons strikes will happen now<br />
<br />
Terry Atlas, 2008 (“6 Signs the US may be headed for War in Iran” US News and World Report”<br />
<br />
The resignation of…might not be designated in the near term.<br />
<br />
Cheney’s visit to the mE and Fallon’s resignation proves a high risk of strikes now<br />
<br />
Michael Klare, 2008 (“Architect of War(s)” The Nation)<br />
<br />
Ostensibly, Cheney’s visit…adventure in the Persian Gulf.<br />
<br />
And – Bush’s containment of Iran ensures high risk of miscalc now<br />
<br />
NY Times, 2008 (“A Dangerous game in the Strait”)<br />
<br />
Iran played a reckless…talks on conduct in the strait.<br />
<br />
Bush is using the Nuclear issue to delay diplomatic solution and buy time for conflict<br />
<br />
Amirahmadi, 2008 (Nuclear Geopolitics in US-Iran Relations: The Case for a big push toward confidence building” American Iranian Council”)<br />
<br />
Iran’s nuclear crisis…“moderate” Arab states.<br />
<br />
US-Iran war b4 2009<br />
<br />
Scott MacLeod, 3/19/08 (Centrists could derail Ahmadinejad” Time Magazine)<br />
<br />
Certainly, 2009 is…producing nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Miscalc escalates<br />
<br />
USA Today, 2007 (“US-Iran Tensions could trigger War”)<br />
<br />
AS the rhetoric grows…escalate into a large confrontation.<br />
<br />
Russia and Pakistan escalate into global nuclear war<br />
<br />
Gaffney, 2003 (Will Iran Be Next?)<br />
<br />
It could trigger another Middle East war…events could spin out of control.<br />
<br />
Russia = extinction<br />
<br />
Bostrom, 02<br />
<br />
Existential risks are distinct…potential permanently.<br />
<br />
US-Iran war in weeks<br />
<br />
Bhadrakumar, 3/27<br />
<br />
The coming weeks…region’s dominant power.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 – Oil Stability<br />
<br />
Sanctions put Iranian infrastructure on the brink<br />
<br />
Samuel Ciszuk, 3/4/2008 (“UN Security Council Tightens Iran Sanctions, Complicating Oil and Gas Developments and Trad” Global Insights)<br />
<br />
The new sanctions…commit funds just yet.<br />
<br />
Lack of investment ensures a supply collapse – Iran says yes<br />
<br />
Karel Beckman, 3/17/08 (“Time to Engage with Iran”)<br />
<br />
It does not take much expertise…would be greatly enhanced.<br />
<br />
Iran oil is key to global supply<br />
<br />
Michael Klare, 2005 (“Oil, Geopolitics, and the Coming War with Iran” Common Dreams)<br />
<br />
One further caveat…(a major contributor to the greenhouse effect).<br />
<br />
Oil supply shocks cause extinction<br />
<br />
Paul Roberts, 2004 (“The End of oil: on the edge of a perilous world” p 93-4)<br />
<br />
The obsessive focus…terrorism or even war.<br />
<br />
Impact is nuclear annihilation<br />
<br />
Indymedia, 2004 (“Australia: Peak oil – a Perfect Storm” Energy Bulletin)<br />
<br />
In the coming energy…success or annihilation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 3 – Hegemony/SCO-Iran Balancing<br />
<br />
Continued Iran-China-Russian coop culminates in Iranian membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and permanent Chinese military bases in Iran<br />
<br />
Afrasiabi, 2008 (“A China Base in Iran?” Asia Times)<br />
<br />
In the aftermath of…Persian Gulf islands.<br />
<br />
Rise of SCO via Iran’s membership triggers global transition to multipolarity<br />
<br />
Nazemroaya, 2007 (“The Sino-Russian Alliance: Challenging America’s Ambitions in Eurasia” Global Research)<br />
<br />

<br />
Multipolarity leads to Nuclear War<br />
<br />
Ferguson 2004<br />
<br />
Plan: USFG should constructively engage the Islamic Republic of Iran by removing economic sanctions that preclude investment in Iran’s energy sector and offering Iran economic incentives to stimulate American investment in the Iranian energy sector.<br />
<br />
Solvency<br />
<br />
Unconditional direct talks with iran is critical to normalize relations<br />
<br />
Leverett, 2008 (“MEI Conference” “Iran on the Horizon” Panel IV, Iran: What does the US do Now?, “MEI Transcript” 2/1)<br />
<br />
I think the key starting point…on the merits.<br />
<br />
Removing Sanctions moderates the Iranian Regime and prevents a US-Iran Nuclear War<br />
<br />
Beckman, 2008 (“Time to engage with Iran” European Energy Review”)<br />
<br />
The current conflict…with more oil and gas to boot.<br />
<br />
Only by de-prioritizing the nuclear issue within the US-Iran relationship by unconditionally removing sanctions can constructively engagement be possible<br />
<br />
Amirahmadi, 2008 (Nuclear Geopolitics in US-Iran Relations: The Case for a big push toward confidence building” American Iranian Council”)<br />
<br />
Originally, in the late 1980s…US policy toward Iran.<br />
<br />
Russia-China Counterbalancing Scenario<br />
<br />
US containment of Iran à Russia-China-Iran alliance to CB US Hege<br />
<br />
Leverett, 2006 (“The race for Iran” New York Times)<br />
