Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its constructive engagement with the government of Iran by offering it a security guarantee protecting it from a preemptive attack by the United States.<br />
<br />
Observation one: War with Iran<br />
First, a security engagement is not foreseeable because of Iran's past associations with terrorism<br />
The Associated Press 2006 (Sunday, May 21, 2006)<br />
(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/21/AR2006052100369_pf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/21/AR2006052100369_pf.html</a>)<br />
And, without the guarantee of safety from the United States Iran will continue its uranium enriching programs-Associated Press 2007 (Offer Iran security guarantee to end nuclear impasse: former UN weapons chief Blix, August 31, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/31/asia/AS-GEN-New-Zealand-Iran-Nuclear.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/31/asia/AS-GEN-New-Zealand-Iran-Nuclear.php</a>)<br />
Unfortunately, if Iran continues this trend the United States will respond militarily. Strike plans are already in place for next year. The Guardian 2007 (Target Iran: US able to strike in the spring,February 10, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.campaigniran.org/casmii/index.php?q=node/1361" rel="nofollow">http://www.campaigniran.org/casmii/index.php?q=node/1361</a>)<br />
These strikes would devastate the world. We isolate three scenarios<br />
First is Iran retaliation- Strikes would cause Iran to develop the bomb and draw Russia and China into the fight ending in nuclear world war 3<br />

Scenario two: Turkish relations<br />
First- Strikes collapse Turkish Relations<br />

And, Turkish relations are key to central Asian stability<br />

<br />
Finally, Central Asian war escalates globally<br />

Scenario three: Oil shocks<br />
First, strikes on Iran would cause Iran to retaliate with oil, causing oil shocks all over the world<br />
KRAUTHAMER, PULITZER PRIZE RECIPIENT AND WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST, JANUARY 18<br />
[2006, CHARLES, THE IRAN CHARADE PART II, WASHINGTON POST, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/17/AR2006011700893.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/17/AR2006011700893.html</a>]<br />
<br />
And, these oil shocks would throw the world into a global recession<br />

<br />
The impact:<br />
Economic collapse causes nuclear war<br />

<br />
<br />
Finally, Iran has no intentions of making nuclear weapons now. Only strikes would cause them to produce the bomb<br />

<br />
Observation two is framework:<br />
A. Our interpretation is that the 1AC is a governmental action that defends the implications of USFG action; the negative must defend the status quo or a competing policy option that employs the use of fiat.<br />
<br />
B. Reasons to prefer<br />
1. Aff choice- We selected the aff so we should get to select the framework in which it is evaluated. This is the only way to preserve the 1AC and 2AC ground.<br />
2. Focusing on implementation and policy action is best for education regarding switch sides debate<br />
Muir 1993 (Star A. Philosophy and Rhetoric, “a Defense of the Ethics of Contemporary Debate,” v26, n4, p 288)<br />
<br />
3. We give most predictable ground- their criticisms can vary wildly and not have stable textual alternatives. Our ground and the negative ground would be ground in the literature of the resolution ensuring predictable ground.<br />
<br />
4. Policy making is even more important for non-policy advocates<br />
Keller in 2001 (Thomas, prof. social work education, Journal of Social Work Education, Spring/Summer 2001)<br />
5. Finally- utilitarianism is the only framework you can evaluate in. All other frameworks fail<br />
Goodin 1995 (Robert, E., Professor of Philosophy at the University of Australia, “Utilitarianism as Public Philosophy,” p. 26)<br />
