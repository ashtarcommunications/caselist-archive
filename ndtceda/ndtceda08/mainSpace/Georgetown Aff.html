Although Quirin was out of date and not applicable, recent supreme court rulings for detention use quirin as the precedent<br />
Jane Mayer, New Yorker, 7/3, v82 i20, 2006<br />
“Moreover, in December 2001, the Department…rendered Quirin out of date”<br />
<br />
Exact Plan Text: The Unites(sic) States Supreme Court should grant a writ of certiorari to Boumedine v. Bush and overrule Ex Parte Quirin (317 U.S. 1) because it violates Article I Section 9 of the United States Constitution. We’ll Clarify<br />

“Military tribunals were used…World War II for these tribunals”<br />

The belief that freedom and security trade off is misleading, because we must not simply decide on a balance for ourselves as Americans—instead we must do what justice requires for other people, including residents and foreign aliens.<br />
Dworkin, professor at NYU and University College London, 2002<br />
[Ronald, NYRB, 49(3), Feb. 28]<br />
The objection that it is legitimate in some circumstances for a government to inflict grave injuries of some people to lessen the risk of harm to others does not justify a disregard for the principle of shared humanity that is present even in the punishment of criminals and the aw of war. We cannot at as though the lives of criminals and POWs are worth noting.<br />
Dworkin 2003<br />

Ex Parte Quirin was decided wrongly and is bad precedent—it is unduly deferential to the executive and is a legal embarrassment.<br />

[Ronald, NYRB, 49(3), Feb. 28]<br />
Habeas corpus is fundamental to Western law and its suspension is a step toward fascism. Quirin must not be allowed to become anything more than a historical aberration.<br />
Wher, professor of Sociology at Cal. State Sac 2004<br />
[Bad issues, December, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2004/71/wehr.html" rel="nofollow">http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2004/71/wehr.html</a>]<br />
The dangers of terrorism do not justify extreme injustice—any curtailment of rights necessary to combat terrorism must be as limited as possible. Those who may be treated unfairly must not be defined very broadly, and the executive branch alone may not be allowed to decide when traditional rights must be bypassed.<br />

The Geneva Convention may not itself be hegemonic but it should nonetheless be used to provide as many good resources as possible.<br />

[Judith, The Nation, April 1, pp 21-2]<br />
The First Protocol to the Geneva Convention is in large part customary international law, binding on the United States<br />
Neier, president of the Open Society Institute, 2002<br />
[Aryeh, NYRB, Feb 14]<br />
International law is the lynchpin to solve. It is the only way to subordinate violence and aggression to peace and rights. Ruling on the Geneva convention would open up a new space of politics free of dehumanization and cultural impositions caused by status quo arrogance.<br />
Butler and Stauffer, Berkeley professor and Fellow at Haverford College, 2003<br />

Goals are non-individuated political aims while rights are individuated—collective goals encourage trade offs and benefits and burdens.<br />
Dworkin, prof. at Oxford, 1977.<br />
[Ronald, Taking Rights Seriously, Harvard UP, 90-1]<br />
Rights matter: rights are necessary not only for national unity and for equality but also to establish the rule of law and preserve dignity.<br />

Individual rights are political trumps held by individuals. Individuals have rights when a collective goal is not a sufficient reason for denying them what the wish.<br />

Critical theory and local action have hit a wall—we must look for fractures within the inevitable system to assert a progressive politics of compassion. The risk of cooption pales in comparison to the risk of fragmentation and defeat.<br />
