The United States federal government should amend the Renewable Fuel Standard to allow its mandates to be met by cellulosic ethanol produced exclusively from woody biomass which is certified as having been produced in an environmentally sustainable fashion.<br />
CP is mutually exclusive: it allows for ethanol mandates that the aff eliminates to be met with cellulosic biofuels<br />

Text: The United States federal government should:<br />
-provide all necessary financial support of Zoellick’s 1.2 billion plan to provide grants and loans to support agricultural development in countries affected most by the increase in world food prices<br />
-repeal requirements that US food aid be purchased domestically<br />
-increase international cash food aid for local food in, but not necessarily limited to, North Korea &amp; Yemen<br />
-commit to provide cash food aid if prices rise rapidly, in, but not necessarily limited to North Korea &amp; Yemen<br />
-establish a strategic grain reserve and reinstate the Farmer-Owned Reserve<br />
The Secretary of State of the United States in consultation with other Executive Agencies should develop a strategy, utilizing focus groups, surveys and polling data, to better assess the impact of the United States’ marketing and publicity programs and establish interagency agreements for marketing and publicizing all foreign assistance. The Secretary of State should apply this strategy in implementing a high-profile food diplomacy initiative in at least, but not necessarily limited to Egypt, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, and China<br />
