L NEW LAW: LAW MUST BE OVERTURNED AND THE MEANINGLESS OF LAW RESTORED – THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE THROUGH A NEW LAW, THE OVERTURNING OF THE MEANING OF ALL LAW. <br />
MILLS 2004. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/contretemps/5december2004/mills.pdf" rel="nofollow">__www.usyd.edu.au/contretemps /5december2004/mills.pdf__</a><br />
“The question of overturning…reading of the parable.”<br />
LINK INCLUSION:<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE’S DESIRE TO BE ‘INCLUDED’ IN THE DEBATE COMMUNITY IS ALSO THE TOOL USED BY THE SOVEREIGN TO EXCLUDE THEM FROM THE SAME COMMUNITY. THE VERY IDEA THAT THERE IS AN INSIDE IS WHAT CREATES AN OUTSIDE. WE SHOULD STILL DESIRE INCLUSION, BUT IN A WAY THAT ASSIGNS NO PARTICULAR GROUND UPON WHICH WE ARE INCLUDED. IN THE CASE OF DEBATE, WE SHOULD WANT TO BE IN THE COMMUNITY, BUT WE SHOULD NOT BASE OUR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION IN THAT COMMUNITY. <br />

“ELSEWHERE I’VE SUGGESTED….EMPHASIS IN ORGINAL.”<br />
LINK REVOLUTIONARY AESTHETIC:<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE ATTEMPTS TO REPLACE THE CURRENT JURIDICIAL ORDER WITH A NEW JURIDICAL ORDER IN THE REVOLUTIONARY AESTHETIC. THIS NEW LAW WOULD BE JUST SEEN A NEW MANIFESTATION OF THE APORIA EXCLUSION AND ABANDONMENT. THIS CAN BE SEEN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE’S ATTEMPT TO DEFINE A REVOLUTIONARY AESTHETIC THAT SHOULD BE PERMITTED WHILE EXCLUDING WHAT IS OUTSIDE OF THAT. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE NEED TO EMBRACE WHITE SUPREMACY, OR EVEN WELCOME IT, BUT INSTEAD, THE STRUCTURE OF EXCLUSION WILL ALWAYS MANIFEST IN AN EXPULSIONARY OF ALTERITY, SO THE AFFIRMATIVE IS NOT REALLY A REVOLUTIONARY AESTHETIC. <br />

“GIVEN THAT THE …POTENTIALITY OF BEING-THUS.”<br />
<br />
<br />
WHATEVER BEING IS A FORM OF LIFE THAT LACKS THE FEATURES NEEDED BY THE SOVERIEGN TO CONTROL LIFE. THE RADICAL REJECTION OF SOVEREIGN POWER ENABLES THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE TEAM TO CONDUCT THEIR LIVES WITHOUT A REFERENT TO THE LAW. THIS IS NOT AN UNKNOWABLE OR FUTURE LIFE, BUT A CONDITION THAT IS POSSIBLE FOR EACH OF US EACH TIME WE REJECT THAT URGE TO GIVE SOVEREIGN POWER THE ABILITY TO VALUE LIFE<br />
CALDWELL 2004. “BIO-SOVEREIGNTY AND THE EMERGENCY OF HUMANITY. <br />
“CAN WE IMAGINE…WHATEVER LIFE, APPEARS.”<br />
ALT: <br />
OUR ALTERNATIVE IS “WHATEVER BEING” THE SINGULAR BEING – AN APPRECIATION OF FORMS OF LIFE WITHOUT REFERENT TO AN ENDS.<br />
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THISD DEBATE, THIS MEANS THAT THE DEBATERS SHOULD NOT JUDGE THEIR INCLUSION OR EXCLUSION BASED ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY WIN OR LOSE A ROUND.<br />
THIS REMOVES THE POWER OF THE SOVEREIGN, IN THIS CASE THE JUDGE AND THE STRUCUTRES OF COMMUNITY. INSTEAD OF FIGHTING FOR CONOTRL OF THE DEBATE APPARATUS, WE ADVOCATE THAT TEAMS SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE WAY THAT THEY WOULD LIKE WITHOUT AN APPEAL FOR INCLUSION. THIS WILL CREATE THE POLITICS OF RADICAL INCLUSION OF ALL FORMS OF DEBATE<br />

Round 4<br />
<br />
<strong>Team Name Neg SMS OW</strong><br />
<strong><em>Round # 4</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Vs Team: Fullerton GM</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Judge: Davis, Feldman, Shook</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Case Args:</em></strong><br />
1. Sumud inextricably ties Palestinian identities to the land and to national “heroic” narratives. Teefelen ’05 (Toine van, December, <u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.palestine-family.net/" rel="nofollow">www.palestine-family.net</a></u>. “The national story runs….(colonialism, occupation).”)<br />
2. Palestinian nationalist narrative isi a gendered image of the masculine protecting the motherland. Amireh ’03 (Amal, The South Atlantic Quarterly 102.4, “Between Complicity and Subversion: Body Politics in Palestinian National Narrative.” “Generally speaking, the Palestinian….inscribed as Palestinian defeat.”)<br />
3. Territorializing identity = attack on identity. It attempts to create a static identity tied to a particular history which formulates an “other” that can be pushed out of the territory. Bishai ’04 (Forgetting Ourselves, Chapter 6. “The problem of secession….call for self-cleansing.”)<br />
4. Only by abandoning the home &amp; recognizing the contingency of identity can we avoid the cataclysmic violence of secessionism. Bishai ’04 (same cite as above. “Political theorist Bonnie….for it is never sated.”)<br />
5. Secessionist histories are used to territorialize history – lead to a repeat of violence of history. Bishai ’99 (Linda S, March. “Tales of difference and Self-determination: Narratives of Secession.” “Any examination of secessionist…worthiness of the past.’)<br />
6. The enforcement of identity attempts to flag those outside of the dominant order as abnormal—causes an encounter with difference that seeks to eradicate it. Connoly ’02 (William, Identity/Differnce expanded edition. “But while these standards…the other, “is yours.”” P 22-23)<br />
7. Modern attempts to organize coherent identity ignore inevitability of violent fragmentation within attempts to order the world. This process is legitimated by the ability of the system to cast aside discourse outside the realm of already established boundaries. Connoly 02 (Same cite as above but p 24, “Each possible scenario…cannot be ignored.”)<br />
