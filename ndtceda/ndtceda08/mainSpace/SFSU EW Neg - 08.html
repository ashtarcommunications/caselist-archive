SFSU EW Off-Case:<br />
<br />
<u>CAMP WILDE</u><br />
<br />
1NC -<br />
We start with an introduction to Camp Wilde, and then in the spirit of Camp Wilde, hold a trial for the affirmative. We charge the affirmative of proliferating heteronormativity and creating ignorance in environmental education. Some of our impacts include biopower and technoscience, and we call on witnesses in order to prove the case. We defend the 1NC as an embodiment of Camp that enriches environmental education and research and argue that education is the most important aspect in the round.<br />
<br />
Some of the evidence we read and discuss in the 1NC are:<br />
- Noel &amp; Annette Gough '03 &quot;Tales from Camp Wilde: Queer(y)ing Environmental Education Research&quot; <em>Canadian Journal of Environmental Education, Spring, Issue 8,</em> the entire article<br />
- Judith Butler 1990 <u>Gender Trouble</u>, pg. xxv &amp; pg. xxiii<br />
- Donna Haraway 1996 <u>The Disunity of Science</u>, pg 430-432 &amp; pg 435-437
