The United States federal government should enter into negotiations with member nations of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and offer to, through all necessary means, reduce to the point of elimination nearly all its domestic subsidies for biofuels. The United States federal government should at least substantially reduce the renewable fuel standard in exchange for their agreement to vote against upcoming measures that relax restrictions on whaling. The plan will be enacted immediately after a majority of member nations of the IWC agree.<br />
The US can use concessions on subsidies to garner votes in the IWC<br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Derrida k<br />
the aff's impact claims are based upon appeals to certainty, as though their impacts had always already been weighed in advance, by god or by history - this makes their action not something they take responsibility for, but instead something that must be done, that is out of their hands - even if they actualized their dream of a world where our decisions are merely spit out by ethical calculators the result would not be peace, but an absolute violence that would preclude any possibility of interpretation<br />
Martin Hagglund 04 - diacritics 34.1, 40-71, The Necessity of Discrimination, MUST<br />
the aff's mechanism rule-based ethics cast off responsiblilty - the moment of uncertanty in every decision - have discoverd truth according to which the world operates - these caluclations inevitably have remainders - in a world of their ethics these become invisible - only a form of decision that sees the world as to-come and affirms moments of aporia can have ethical responsibility for the creation of others like the refugee - you should evaluate this first b/c it begs the question of the ethics of thier mpx calculus<br />
Dillon 99 Another Justice &quot;Political Theory&quot; Vol. 27 no. 2 april 1999<br />
kw - in the realm of undecidability, decision is precisely --&gt; that strangeness to the lapse of Time itself.<br />
Rather than passing our decisions off onto metaphysical rules, we should take radical responisbility for the moment of interpretation required in those decisionzillingness to simultaneously realize that justice is not being done and that a perfect justice is always impossible can allow us to probelmatize those others that are excluded by our decisions<br />
Derrid 04 - Rogues, p. 84 - 91<br />
kw - To this I would oppose, in the first place, all the figures --&gt; indeed of substantial or subjective substance.<br />
Our fwork interp is that the judge should suspend their faith in metaphysical basis for making decisions and take responsibility for the very act of decision itself -<br />
Every aff is simultaneoously a decision and an affirmation of a particular interp of what it means to decide - their attempt to elevate their particular method of decision to the status of metaphysics links to all our offense and begs the question of their justificaiton for exclusion<br />
Michael Dillon 99 - Political Theory Vol 27. no 2, april 1999 &quot;Another Justice&quot; p. 155-175<br />
i wish to argue, in addition, that the condition of being-in-between --&gt; the ontological in continental thought<br />
The aff’s obsession with creating an ethical machine that could smoothly distribute justice creates complacency in the face of atrocity and removes responsibility for decision making- makes sacrifice of whole populations inevitable.<br />
Derrida 95<br />
“This applies all the more to political or legal…part nothing more than a murderer?”<br />
The location of the lack as stemming from the psyche itself proves our metaphysics argument- aporia solves<br />
