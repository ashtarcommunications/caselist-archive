T-Explicit Overrule<br />
<u>Vouchers DA</u><br />
The aff underestimates the ability of conservatives to control the educational terrain. In the last two decades conservatives have been busy slowly building support for the marketization of education through choice and voucher programs. The aff provides conservatives with the perfect opportunity to further cement the notion that school choice is an example of what democracy looks like within schools. Vouchers will become the savior of educational segregation and the remedy of choice<br />
Michael W. Apple, Educational Review, Volume 57, Number 3, August, 2005<br />
“Such quasimarket solutions are among the most…can the poor succeed”<br />
Minorities will push for vouchers<br />
Davies and Guppy, Comparative Education Review v41 n4 november 1997 pp. 435<br />
“Further, choice finds support among racial…lauded by diverse advocates”<br />
The school choice movement will turn students into consumers where education is just another product to be bought, turning democracy into consumption. Deracing, declassing individuals and shifting the blame onto individuals creating notions of the undeserving poor, minority-conservative alliances, more social divisions around class and race, fake equality and more educational apartheid<br />

Text: The United States Supreme Court should rule that the Thirteenth Amendment sustains a federal civil rights remedy for gender-motivated violence. The Supreme Court should rule that <em>United States v. Morrison</em>, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), and <em>United States v. Lopez</em>, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), only have precedential value in the area of federal preemption of state climate regulations. The Supreme Court should explicitly state that <em>Morrison</em> and <em>Lopez</em> lack precedential value and do not constrain Congressional action in all other areas of Commerce Clause jurisprudence. The Supreme Court should create a clear bright-line ruling that in all cases other than federal preemption, <em>Gonzales v. Raich</em> is to be used as standing precedent for commerce clause jurisprudence, and that lower courts are to use the rational basis test and the definition of “economic” as used in <em>Gozalez v. Raich</em>. The Supreme Court will explicitly apply the <em>Raich</em> precedent to the Family Medical Leave Act and non-preemptory portions of federal environmental legislation.<br />

Text: The United State Supreme Court should rule that the Thirteenth Amendment sustains a federal civil remedy for gender-based violence. The Supreme Court should further rule that in all cases other than terrorism and disaster preparedness legislation, Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), is to be used as standing precedent for commerce clause jurisprudence, and that lower courts are to use the rational basis test and the definition of “economic” as used in Gonzales v. Raich. The Supreme Court will explicitly extend the Raich precedent to environmental protection legislation<br />

Housing CP<br />
<br />
The legislatures of the fifty states, territories, and district of Columbia of the United States should implement the following mandates as per the Orfield evidence: prohibit exclusionary zoning, require comprehensive planning and provide for dedicated enforcement of land use policy, use urban growth boundaries to reduce sprawl and promote infill, adopt proactive policies to prevent displacement, link affordable housing with public transportation, implement dispersed inclusionary housing policies, promote positive integration measures, effectively site subsidized housing, and enforce and strengthen laws prohibiting discrimination in housing markets. Funding and enforcement guaranteed.<br />
<br />
The CP also had the supreme court ban tracking. Can’t find the exact wording, but it wasn’t anything special.<br />
<br />
Solvency for tracking:<br />
The Supreme Court can rule tracking unconstitutional based on a series of precedents, and past cases prove that courts will go along with this precedent<br />
Dickens, 1996 [Angelia, Writing &amp; Research Editor, Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs, “Revisiting Brown v. Board of Education: How Tracking Has Resegregated America's Public Schools” 29 Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs. 469]<br />
<br />
Applying the analysis of Brown…determined that the education their African [*490] American classmates were receiving was unconstitutionally inferior. 140<br />
<br />
<br />
The CP results in housing integration<br />
Orfield, 2006 [Associate professor law at Minnesota, 33 Fordham Urb. L.J. 877]<br />
<br />
Land use and housing policies should be marshaled…government agencies or by nonprofit fair housing organizations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Housing integration results in functional school desegregation – post-Brown desegregation programs wouldn’t have been necessary if housing was integrated<br />
Orfield, 2006 [Associate professor law at Minnesota, 33 Fordham Urb. L.J. 877]<br />
<br />
The way in which government agencies have located … difficult for teachers to do their jobs in public schools. 30<br />

ACHEIVING FULL DESEGREGATION IN HOUSING IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THAT BOTH MANDATES AND ENFORCES DESEGRETATION POLICIES.<br />

IMMEDIATE CONCERNS WITH DESEGREGATION IN EDUCATION IGNORES THE MORE PREVALENT AREAS OF RACIAL INEQUALITY THAT OCCURS IN HOUSING – THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE SUCESSFUL DESEGREGATION IN SCHOOLS IS TO BEGIN WITH HOUSING<br />

<br />
If Thomas genuinely wants to … glossing over the inferior minority public educational experience.<br />
<br />
(2) HOUSING SEGREGATION IS THE LYNCHPIN OF RACIAL INEQUALITY – LIVING IN IMPOVERISHED SOCIETIES CREATES LABELS OF POWERLESSNESS FOR BLACKS THAT DENIES THEM ACCESS TO ALL OTHER SOCIETAL OPPORTUNITIES<br />
Kenn 2001 [Deborah, Associate Professor of Law and Director, Community Development Law Clinic, Syracuse U. College of Law, The Boston Public Interest Law Journal, 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35, Fall, p. 43-45. Lexis]<br />
<br />
The systemic effects of racism have caused … &quot;those&quot; people are the criminal element in society!<br />
<br />
<br />
(3) HOUSING SEGREGATION HAS NORMALIZED RACIAL DISCRIMINATION: WHERE ONE LIVES DETERMINES THEIR STATUS IN CULTURE AND THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS RESOURCES. THIS ISOLATION HAS BEEN UNCHALLENGED FOR DECADES AND WILL CONTINUE UNLESS CONFRONTED WITH INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE<br />
Kenn 2001 [Deborah, Associate Professor of Law and Director, Community Development Law Clinic, Syracuse U. College of Law, The Boston Public Interest Law Journal, 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35, Fall, p. 43-45. Lexis]<br />
<br />
Even racial discrimination becomes normalized…see the consequences of their actions.<br />

UNTIL HOUSING POLICIES ARE FIXED, EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR BLACKS WILL REMAIN DISCRIMINATORY<br />

In addition to community … of these approaches needs further explanation.<br />

The United States Supreme Court should rule that United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), and United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), lack precedential value because they only apply narrowly to the facts of the cases. The Supreme Court should further clarify that Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), is to be used as standing precedent for commerce clause jurisprudence, and that lower courts are to use the rational basis test and the definition of “economic” as used in Gonzales v. Raich.<br />
<br />
The United States Congress should pass a resolution stating that violence against women is intricately tied to gender animus within our communities, and that violence against women should be treated as a civil rights issue because it discriminates against women as a class of individuals.<br />
<br />
The legislatures of the 50 states and all territories should pass legislation institutionalizing restorative justice as a solution to gendered violence including, but not limited to, family group conferences, sentencing circles, and victim-offender mediation. Victims will be given the choice to use these methods of restorative justice instead of or in addition to traditional legal means.<br />

Applying Raich means zero judicial restraint on Congress’ commerce clause powers – Raich would return Commerce Clause jurisprudence to the rational basis test, and would solve all of their Commerce Clause advantages<br />

Overall, Raich’s evisceration … water until Raich is either limited or overruled.<br />

Overruling a decision is a clear violation of stare decisis – only distinguishing allows the Court to sidestep precedent without violating the stare decisis doctrine<br />

<br />

Torts Bad<br />
<br />
The civil remedy is anti-therapeutic – they are worse than the criminal process itself – torts are based on a notion of “comparative fault” which stipulates that damages are awarded in accordance with how much a particular party is at fault – more often than not, civil trials will find victims partially responsible for their own rape. Civil trials re-victimize women<br />
And don’t provide enough compensation.<br />
Koss, 2000 [Mary P., Public Health, Family and Community Medicine Psychiatry, and Psychology University of Arizona, “Blame, Shame, and Community: Justice Responses to Violence Against Women,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/koss/koss.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/koss/koss.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Because an attorney retained by the survivor … make the rapist's act 'her fault&quot;' ( Bublick, 1999, p. 1476 ).<br />
<br />
<br />
Victim fault turns the case –<br />
<br />
A) It makes women responsible – civil trials treat gender violence as a common occurrence that women are themselves responsible for protecting against – if they haven’t taken a reasonable amount of care to prevent against violence, it is partially their fault that it happened.<br />
Bublick, 1999 [Ellen M., Assistant Prof of Law, University of Arizona, “CITIZEN NO-DUTY RULES: RAPE VICTIMS AND COMPARATIVE FAULT,” 99 Colum. L. Rev. 1413<br />
<br />
The central problem with current comparative fault defenses…design of broader institutional protections.<br />
<br />
<br />
B) Tort law puts women back in their place – it is based on notions of what a reasonable women is expected to do – this reinscribes static notions of appropriate sexual behavior – it forces women back into homes and motherly roles and turns their public/private argument<br />
Bublick, 1999 [Ellen M., Assistant Prof of Law, University of Arizona, “CITIZEN NO-DUTY RULES: RAPE VICTIMS AND COMPARATIVE FAULT,” 99 Colum. L. Rev. 1413<br />
<br />
As in the context of criminal rape cases… not women who are agents as well as victims.<br />
<br />
<br />
C) Tort law turns the symbol – civil trial send the message that women are responsible for the crimes against them – it teaches women that gender violence is a normal part of the environment – women are forced t olive in fear of violence and rape<br />
Bublick, 1999 [Ellen M., Assistant Prof of Law, University of Arizona, “CITIZEN NO-DUTY RULES: RAPE VICTIMS AND COMPARATIVE FAULT,” 99 Colum. L. Rev. 1413<br />
<br />
2. Equality Norms Inside and Outside the Courtroom… exercised in the face of constant risks of rape.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
D) The normalization of violence – tort law treats violence as a legally accepted reality that women have the obligation to protect themselves against – this naturalizes gender violence as an acceptable part of society<br />

<br />
1. Their interpretation is an antiquated theory of law that no longer applies – it assumes that when courts strike down a law, they render it out of existence – this is false; when a court overrules, it can only render a law unenforceable, it immediately comes back into existence when the previous decision is overruled<br />
Plave, 1990 [Erica Frohman, “THE PHENOMENON OF ANTIQUE LAWS: CAN A STATE REVIVE OLD ABORTION LAWS IN A NEW ERA?,” 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 111]<br />
<br />
More recently, however, one court construed the void ab initio doctrine…overruling the prior holding would reinstate the statute. 51<br />
<br />
<br />
2. This is proven by the fact that section 13981 is still part of the U.S. Code – the minute Morrison is overruled, victims can file civil cases under the VAWA section – here it is US Code, updated through 2005<br />

CASEY NEGATIVE<br />

We haven’t debated a Casey Aff, other than Oklahomas Edelman aff, since we debated Missouri State MM at Harvard. We went for T in that debate, but this is the stuff we read on Abortion:<br />

Abortion Good Evidence<br />
a. granting rights to a fetus under any circumstance perverts THE MOST BASIC OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTES COERCION AT ITS WORST<br />

B. INVASIONS AGAINST LIBERTY MUST BE REJECTED<br />

<br />
this becomes a framing issue: we can endorse the practical effects of the policy but reject the coercive elements of the plan. the affirmative must win that coercion is good to win this debate<br />

WE SOLVE ALL OF THE AFFIRMATIVES OFFENSE – ABORTION MAY BE ETHICALLY WRONG, BUT THAT DOES NOT PERMIT STATE DEFINITIONS OF RIGHTS OR LIFE.<br />

Even if there…constrains the state.<br />

and, our internal link to this argument is bigger than any of their arguments -- empirics prove that regulating abortion spills over into other regulations of the private life and unfettered state power<br />

ETHICAL NEGLIGENCE: THIS ARGUMENT ALSO SOLVES ALL YOUR OFFENSE BECAUSE IT PROVES THAT MORAL DECISION MAKING IS INAPPROPRIATE IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE.<br />

Individual rights ….rights to animals. <br />
<br />
4. EVEN IF THEY WIN THEIR ARGUMENT: IT IS IMMORAL FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO DENY THE RIGHTS OF ONE TO SECURE OTHER RIGHTS. THIS PROVES THAT OUR CONCEPTION OF WHEN LIFE BEGINS IS MORE ACCURATE BECAUSE IT PREVENTS THE GOVERNMENT FROM FORCING DECISIONS ABOUT WHEN LIFE DOES AND DOES NOT BEGIN AND THE PRIVILEGING OF CERTAIN RIGHTS OVER OTHERS. THE DISAD TO THEIR INTERPRETATION IS UNCHECKED TYRANNY<br />
