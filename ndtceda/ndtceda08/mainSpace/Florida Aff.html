Contention 1: Status Quo<br />
<br />
Environmental laws are subject to limitation or invalidation under current commerce clause jurisprudence established in the Morrison decision<br />

<br />
Contention 2- Species Loss<br />
Continuation of the Lopez-Morrison framework of categorical limitations based on economic/non-economic distinctions inhibits congress essential protection of entire ecosystems and biodiversity through the Endangered Species Act<br />

Second-Coral Reefs<br />
Recognition of coral reefs on the Endangered Species Act list is key to protecting elkhorn and staghorn from extinction<br />

<br />
Thus, we offer the following plan-<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in U.S. v. Morrison (529 U.S. 598) by replacing the substantial effects test with the structural necessity test when reviewing federal legislation under the Commerce Clause. We reserve the right to clarify intent.<br />
<br />
Contention Three-Solvency<br />
The Court should use the structural necessity test to determine the validity of legislation passed under the commerce clause- This test recognizes the infeasibility of states responding to the environment<br />
Harsch 2001 [Bradley A., Associate, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, New York City; Clerk, Hon. David D. Dowd, Jr., United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, 1999-2000 31 Seton Hall L. Rev. 983, Finding a Sound Commerce Clause Doctrine: Time to Evaluate the Structural Necessity of Federal Legislation]<br />
Put simply, it is …area ripe for federal regulation. 83<br />
<br />
The Structural necessity test would offer a functional rather than a formalistic approach to the Commerce Clause doctrine<br />

Observation four- Survivability<br />
Nuclear war is survivable – the impacts of nuclear winter and fallout are exaggerated and incorrect<br />
Nyquist, Contributing Editor and a Renowned Expert in Geopolitics and International Relations, 1999<br />
[J.R., “Is Nuclear War Survivable?” 5/20, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=19722" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=19722</a>]<br />

. MacKinnon takes an essentialist perspective that obscures differences among women and factors other than gender that victimize women and reinforces other forms of oppression<br />
Bartlett, 1990<br />
Bartlett, Professor of law at Duke University, 1990. [Katherine T., Feminist Legal Methods, Harvard Law Review 103, Lexis].<br />
<br />
Despite the valuable insights<br />
<br />
MacKinnon’s alternative quells freedom – her attempt to protect people from discrimination results in expression being policed<br />
Weiss and Young 1996 (Michael, Adjunct Professor of Law at the University of Houston, Cathy, Associate Policy Analyst of the CATO Institute, &quot;Feminist Jurisprudence: Equal Rights or Neo-Paternalism?&quot;, CATO Policy Analysis no. 256, June 19, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=1115&amp;full=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=1115&amp;full=1</a>)<br />

<br />
Victim ideology diverts<br />

Permutation is only hope of solvency—rejection is simply a strategy for maintaining the system of dominance—the permutation offers a confrontational engagement with the existing legal institution.<br />

Contention One- Commerce Confusion<br />
The Morrison decision left Congress in a vaccum without power to enact civil rights legislation-The Fourteenth amendment provides a solution of federal rights that would be enforceable by congress<br />
Zietlow 2003 [Rebecca E. Professor of Law, University of Toledo College of Law, 36 Akron Law Review 7, SYMPOSIUM ARTICLE: &quot;JOHN BINGHAM AND THE MEANING OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT&quot;: Congressional Enforcement of Civil Rights and John Bingham's Theory of Citizenship]<br />
<br />
Utilization of the Commerce Clause as the exclusive determinant of federal power leads to confusion and divisiveness<br />

Southern University Law Review 187, THE MISUNDERSTANDING AND MISUSE OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE]<br />
<br />
The Court’s decision in Morrison was flawed due to the court’s consideration of “interstate commerce:” “commerce among the states” spans a spectrum of activities<br />

<br />
Thus, we offer the following plan: Thus, we offer the following plan: The United States Supreme Court should grant a writ of certiorari to an appropriate test case to overrule U.S. v. Morrison holding that the substantial effects test is the appropriate test commerce clause jurisprudence.<br />
<br />
Contention 2: Advantages<br />
Advantage 1- The Endangered Species Act<br />
Current Commerce Clause jurisprudence cannot effectively regulate legislation that regulates what can be classified as both economic and non-economic activity such as the Endangered Species Act. This leads to inconsistent decisions from lower courts<br />
Scopp 2005 David W. Class of 2006; B.A., Middlebury College, 1998. Editor-in-Chief, U.S.F. Law Review 39 U.S.F. L. Rev. 789 Spring 2005. Commerce Clause Challenges to the Endangered Species Act: The Rehnquist Court's Web of Confusion Traps More Than the Fly.<br />
<br />
The Lopez-Morrison framework of categorical limitations on congressional authority prevents the perseveration of entire ecosystems, endangering the preservation of biodiversity<br />
Scopp 2005 David W. Class of 2006; B.A., Middlebury College, 1998. Editor-in-Chief, U.S.F. Law Review 39 U.S.F. L. Rev. 789 Spring 2005. Commerce Clause Challenges to the Endangered Species Act: The Rehnquist Court's Web of Confusion Traps More Than the Fly.<br />
<br />
Protection of individual species is key to preserving biodiversity: each species performs an ecological niche. Loss of a single species leads to the destruction of the delicate ecological balance<br />
Scopp 2005 David W. Class of 2006; B.A., Middlebury College, 1998. Editor-in-Chief, U.S.F. Law Review 39 U.S.F. L. Rev. 789 Spring 2005. Commerce Clause Challenges to the Endangered Species Act: The Rehnquist Court's Web of Confusion Traps More Than the Fly.<br />
<br />
Insert impact to Biodiversity loss<br />
Diner 94<br />
<br />
And, The ESAs Preservation biodiversity is key to the economy two reasons: 1) preserves a species genetic heritage, species and biological communities providing our economy with food, energy, raw materials and medicines 2) Ecotourism generates billions of dollars worldwide.<br />

Advantage Two: Terrorism<br />
A terrorist attack in the status quo is inevitable<br />
