Judge: Kall, Koehle, Stanley<br />
<br />
Case Args:<br />
On environment:<br />
Humans destroying the world’s oceans<br />
<br />
On gender violence:<br />
-Silence bad solved by the CP<br />
-Civil remedies can’t be accessed by majority of women (Regan 99, 75 Notre Dame L. Rev. 797)<br />
“There are no CRR plaintiffs. . . against a solvent wrongdoer”<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
Test Case<br />
A. Supreme court cannot reach out for a case people must come to them—aff must cite a case<br />
Baum, 95, The Supreme Court p. 83-84<br />
“The second category. . . range of options in a case”<br />
B. Violation—doesn’t grant cert to a case on the docket<br />
C. Bad<br />

3. Multiple and private actor fiat<br />
D. Voter for fairness and education<br />

<br />
CP—The United States Congress should provide funding for state programs that: enhance judicial education regarding the harms of gendered violence, create state domestic violence task forces, create transitional houses for victims of gendered violence, create shelters for victims of gendered violence, and create victim advocate programs. The United States Congress should condition receipt of the federal funds on the implementation of these programs.<br />
Financial incentives explode the distinction between public and gendered violence—every state will respond<br />
Hagan 2001, 50 Depaul L. Rev. 919, l/n<br />
“The states’ legislative response to the problem. . . . if he violates the order”<br />
Federal funding for state initiatives is substantially more effective than the civil remedy<br />
Regan 99, 75 Notre Dame L. Rev. 797, l/n<br />
“Programs that require the arrest and detention. . . are not the answer”<br />
<br />
<br />
Bobertz K<br />
Environmental crisis strikes at the heart of American consumer society—environmental legislation releases us from our guilty consciences, displacing blame and focus away from consumption—the result is a system that fails to confront the root causes of degradation<br />
Bobertz, 1995, 73 Te. L. Rev. 711<br />
“In contrast to other areas. . . appearance of reforming it<br />
Failure to confront individuals’ denial of their role in ecological harm results in mass environmental destruction and extinction<br />
George S. Howard, 1997, Ecological Psychology, p. 11-12<br />

Distinguish CP: The United States Supreme Court, Using the Same Procedure and Test Case as the Affirmative Plan, Will Distinguish U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) By Limiting the Decision to the Facts of the Case<br />
Lacan<br />
Links (1NC):<br />
Lacanian theory posits that we all feel incomplete as subjects, and that to fill this lack, we create desire for objects that we can never obtain. It is this desire the drives us and fills us with meaning. The problem with this desire is that it is infinite and that the object of this desire can never be obtained. Instead our response to our inability to obtain the object of our desire is not to problematize our relationship to the object but rather to create scapegoats who we deem responsible for our inability to complete our desire. This creates the conditions of violence and ultimately destroys not only those who are purified so that we can obtain this infinite object. The plan represents the material accomplishment of the fantasy, the final step before we are purified of the scenarios of the 1ac, the final moment before we are finally fulfilled. The truth is that is yet another step in the process of various attempts to create and fulfill these fantasies. Our link arguments represent our identification of specific fantasies the aff attempts to fulfill<br />

Alternative:<br />
Our alternative is to act radically in the face of these fantasies constructions. This entails voting negative as a method of encountering the desire of the affirmative, and refusing to allow it to control your actions. The 1ac functions as a method of blackmail whereby your fantasy for purification holds your decisionmakin hostage. Our argument is that instead you should know that it is inevitable that these fantasies cannot be fulfilled, that we can never achieve democracy and Constitutional rectitude and to instead accept this despair. In refusing to allow it to control your actions, you open up the possibility for new possibilities.<br />

Revolution at the Gates<br />
<br />
Actomania forces us to look to the government and act within the hegemonic ideological coordinate Zizek 03<br />
(“Revolution at the Gates.”)<br />
<br />
Aff is an opportunistic deployment of the state apparatus. We must revolt now for revolution’s sake. Zizek 02<br />
<br />
Endorsement of the capitalist mechanism allows capitalism to redeploy itselg and amend its transgressions zizek 03<br />
(“Revolution at the Gates.” Verso pg. 277-278)<br />
<br />
Neg ballot throws ourselves into a new constellation pretending the revolution is here Zizek 02 (Revolution at the gates.” P. 10-11)<br />
<br />
Capitalism’s antagonisms will lead to its collapse Zizek<br />
<br />
The end point of these antagonisms is genocidal violence Internationalist perspective 2000 (“Capitalism and Genocide.”#36, Spring. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.geocities.com/wageslavex/capandgen.html" rel="nofollow">www.geocities.com/wageslavex/capandgen.html</a>)<br />

Capitalist militarism leads to extinction Meszaros 03 (“The American Century to the crossroads, Militarism and the Coming Wars.” Monthly Review pr. 17-19 June)<br />

Universal opposition is key to rupture capitalist hegemony Zizek 2000 (Contingency, Hegemony, Universality. Pg. 224-229)<br />
<br />
This is not an issue of future success, we must act as if the revolution is here now Zizek 02 (Revolution at the Gates pg. 259-260)<br />

Alternative is to vote negative to trash the legal system. This is the only way to create true social change and step outside the liberal paradigm. Hutchinson and Monahan 84<br />

Affs logic assigns to the other something we cannot access or understand, which is the basis for racism and results in annihilation Zizek 95 (“Ideology between Fiction and Fantasy,” 16 Cardozo L. rev. 1511)<br />
<br />
Alternative is to reject the idea that we must identify within the boundaries of the system, and instead make the impossible choice to act, which re-organizes the co-ordinates of the world Zizek 00 (“Class struggle or Postmodernism? Yes, please!” Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Contemporary Dialogues on the Left, NYC, Verso)<br />
<br />
Alt solves- The act is its own immediate realization, not a process which reaches a distant goal. Only radical criticism caring not for success by the standards of the system can reach outside the boundaries it already accommodates Zizek 02 (Critical inquiry, Winter 02. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/zizek/zizek-a-plea-for-leninist-intolerance.html" rel="nofollow">www.egs.edu/faculty/zizek/zizek-a-plea-for-leninist-intolerance.html</a>)<br />

Our interpretation is the aff has 3 burdens, they must prove they are ethically<br />
justified that's the K, then if they win their methadology is good we can<br />
challenge the theoretical backing hence the T argument lastly we'll win we can<br />
access that methadology better if you win it is good via the counterplan. This<br />
is key to neg flex and is still predictable.<br />

A. Supreme Court Can't Reach out for cases, affs must cite a case<br />

B. violation - the plan fiats a supreme court test case<br />
c. standards<br />
1. utopian - they can fiat a utopian test case to get out of our legitimacy and<br />
activism d/a's, they are all dependant on the relationship of the test case to<br />
teh decision, i.e. whether a decision was activist is a relationship between how<br />
far form the test case the court provided<br />
2. void for vagueness - the plan not citing a case means the aff does nothing<br />
3. object fiat - they have to fiat a victim of gender violence (or whatever the<br />
aff is), filing suit and the lower courts, expands aff fiat, extra topical and<br />
