Northwestern GR – Berkeley Tournament<br />
I. Status quo<br />
US has had multiple overtures with Iran concerning Iraq but actions don't match the rhetoric—Iran keeps going back on their promises in hopes to undermine US success<br />
CNN, 2007 [US, Iran, Iraq to form group to address Iraq's securityproblems, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/07/24/iraq.main/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/07/24/iraq.main/index.html</a>]<br />
<br />
The NIE did NOTHING to reduce the risk of strikes—Iranian incursions on the Iraqi border will be the justification<br />
Global Research, 2007 [December 8, No Iran attack? Don't be so sure,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=7567" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=7567</a>]<br />
<br />
Iran attack ensures global nuclear war<br />
Mark Gaffney, 2003 [May 8, Researcher, anti-nuclear activist, principle organizer of first earth day,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3288.htm" rel="nofollow">www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3288.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
<br />
II. Iraq Stability<br />
<br />
Iran's al-Quds Force provides weapons and training to Shi'ite fighters and use their political clout to create splinters within insurgent groups—results in in-fighting and increased instability<br />
James Phillips, 2007 [Research Fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, Iran's hostile policies in Iraq,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/MiddleEast/BG2030.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/Research/MiddleEast/BG2030.cfm</a>]<br />
<br />
Though the surge might be successful in terms of reducing total casualties, the opposite occurs in the Shi'te slums of<br />
Baghdad—military strategies have no hope of solving, only Iran has control and misperceptions ignite war<br />
Amir Soltani Sheikholeslami, 2007 [March 31, Middle East and Islam editor at New America Media, Sadr City: Tripwire to the Iraq Inferno,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=240f1a5a6cfdd344cac536697fd442fa" rel="nofollow">http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=240f1a5a6cfdd344cac536697fd442fa</a>]<br />
<br />
Iraqi civil war collapses the government and draws in the entire Middle East—leads to state collapse and regional war<br />
Ian Bremmer, 2006 [President of Eurasia consultant group (a political risk consulting group), What would civil war in Iraq look like?,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/03/what_would_civil_war_in_iraq_l.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/03/what_would_civil_war_in_iraq_l.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Regional instability culminates in nuclear war John Steinbach, 2002 [Center for Research on Globalization, Israeli<br />

<br />
<br />
Iranian involvement in the withdrawal process is key—absent removal of the threat of regime change, Iran will continue to support Shi'ite militias that destabilize the entire country<br />
PINR, 2007 [The Power and Interest News Report, March 5, Intelligence brief: Iran's covert operations in Iraq,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=625&amp;language_id=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=625&amp;language_id=1</a>]<br />
<br />
<br />
III. The PJAK<br />
Iranian attacks on the PJAK at an all time high and will only increase because of fears of US support for Kurdish offensives against Iran—results in boarder-fighting and instability in northern Iraq<br />
World Tribune, 2007 [October 5, Iranian artillery drives thousands of<br />
Kurds from Iraq villages,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2007/me_iran_10_05.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2007/me_iran_10_05.asp</a>]<br />
<br />
Iranian violence directed toward the PJAK is a direct response to the possibility of US strikes—their attempts to de-stabilize Iraq will result in widespread violence and would force destructive withdrawal<br />
Bernd Kaussler, 2007 [The Jamestown Foundation, September 18,<br />
Terrorism Focus, Iran Moves against PJAK in northern Iraq,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2373658" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2373658</a>]<br />
<br />
Iran won't go at it alone—because of anti-American fervor in Iran, Iran has made an alliance with Turkey to invade Northern Iraq<br />
Ken Timmerman, 2007 [Author, former GOP candidate for the US Senate in Maryland, investigative reporter, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://newsmax.com/" rel="nofollow">Newsmax.com</a> Turkey for alliance with Iraq against Kurds, October 15,<br />

<br />
Any Turkish involvement in an Iraqi Kurdistan invasion would gut<br />
US-Turkey relations<br />
Peter Brookes, 2007 [Heritage Foundation senior fellow and former deputy assistant secretary of defense, A Turkey-Iraq war?,<br />

<br />
<br />
US-Turkey relations key to solve terrorism—Turkish invasion of Iraq is the DEATH BLOW to the alliance<br />
Rajan Menon and S. Enders Wimbush, 2007 [March 25, Monroe J. Rathbone<br />

<br />
The impact is extinction<br />
Yonah Alexander, 2003 [Director of the Inter-University for Terrorism Studies, &quot;Terrorism Myths and Realities,&quot; Washington Times, 8/28, p.<br />
lexis)<br />
<br />
IV. Leadership<br />
First, the NIE report undermined US credibility—not because of intelligence failures but because of US response to the report—failure to reconcile our policies towards Iran with the recent information devastates leadership<br />
Dan Diker, 2007 [December 9, Officer of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, The NIE under Middle Eastern eyes,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2007/12/019230.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2007/12/019230.php</a>]<br />
<br />
<br />
The surge in Iraq has been successful, but now is a crucial test to US leadership—failure to withdraw successfully undermines US credibility and results in isolationism<br />
The Business, 2007 [December 12,Why 2008 will be the end of the beginning for global geopolitics,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thebusiness.co.uk/the-magazine/editorial/399266/why-2008-will-be-the-end-of-the-beginning-for-global-geopolitics.thtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebusiness.co.uk/the-magazine/editorial/399266/why-2008-will-be-the-end-of-the-beginning-for-global-geopolitics.thtml</a>]<br />
<br />
US leadership solves global nuclear war by deterring potential threats<br />
Khalilzad, 1995 [Rand Corporation, Zalmay, &quot;Losing the Moment?&quot; The<br />
Washington Quarterly, Vol. 18, No. 2, pg. 84, Spring, Lexis]<br />
<br />
There is no alternative to US power—if the US were to recede as the world's hegemon, the result would be a global power vacuum and nuclear war<br />
Ferguson, 2004 (Niall, Professor of History at NYU, &quot;A World Without<br />
Power,&quot; Foreign Policy, July 1)<br />
<br />
PLAN: The United States federal government should offer to not promote<br />
forcible regime change in Iran if Iran agrees to negotiate over its<br />
involvement in Iraq.<br />
<br />
V. Solvency<br />
Only taking regime change off the table in exchange for Iranian cooperation can solve—maintaining the possibility creates hostility and ensures Iran will incite more violence<br />
Tony Karon, 2007 [senior editor for <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://time.com/" rel="nofollow">Time.com</a>, previously deputy editor<br />
of <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://foxnews.com/" rel="nofollow">foxnews.com</a>, September 17, Only Iran can end US nightmare,<br />

<br />
<br />
Iran supports cooperation on Iraq and stability concerning an exit-plan<br />
Reuters, 2007 [Iran offers US cooperation on Iraq exit,<br />

<br />
Iran says yes—want successful American exit-strategy<br />
Suzanne Maloney and Ray Takehy, 2007 [Senior Fellow, Foreign Policy, Saban Center for Middle East Policy, Brookings Institution and Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council of Foreign Relations, &quot;Engage Iran&quot;, Fall,<br />

<br />
NIE supercharges our say yes arguments—makes intentions clear on both sides and prompts Iran cooperation<br />
