<strong>The Abattoir is a state of exception in which humans and animals enter into a zone of indistinction as tasks and bodies are mechanized.  Animals that enter the factory farm are already dead – its value is only as “meat” for our consumption.  Workers are already alien – useful only insofar as s/he takes on the ethical aporia of our world insulating society from the ethical implications of the factory farm itself.</strong><br />

But inside the perimeter fences...a self-identity — a removed self<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Exporting the question of the relationship between human and animal to a zone of indistinction is indicative of the anthropological machine which makes the conditions of genocidal biopolitics possible.  We must interrogate this aporia if we are ever to stop the machine and open space for a new community.<br />

<strong>Biopolitics justifies nuclear extermination.</strong><br />

Perhaps. But to claim that American culture...initiative that can scarcely be done without.<br />
<br />
<strong>Constructed identities like those between humans and animals are responded to with the reification of subjectivity within the political, restricting any movement outside the traditionally accepted role.<br />

The claim that the concept of societal security...absolute decision in conditions of emergency.<br />

<strong>The Self/Other binary allows for ontological totalitarianism which made the Holocaust possible and is at the root of all violence.<br />

In this contemporary milieu...the other man, for sociality itself.<br />

<br />
<strong>Thus, we affirm that the United States Federal Government should not subsidize Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations in the United States.  We affirm this as an ethical imagining in order to unleash and confront the aporias of our time, so that we may bear witness to the impossibility of bearing witness to our current horror.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Despite the ontological closure and securitization of all possibility in our world, the voice breaks through.  Responding to this call is an ethical act.<br />

<br />
The purpose of moral regulation is to maintain...this carnivorous culture to continue. <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The subsidies that constitute the material support for the existence of Factory Farms are directly produced by the anthropological machine insofar as they represent the nexus between what we have constituted as the human—the political state—and the natural—the free market.  We must break with the suffocating closure of the Factory Farm supported by subsidies to allow a confrontation with the aporias which call into question our very sense of humanness.</strong><br />

A second problem. In his book...politics that shakes the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Confronting the horrors of our current reality is an act of vulnerability.  In remembering and accepting how we have come to our current world without privileging desires to secure ourselves against the risk is necessary to open space for politics of potentiality.<br />
