Just because sometimes truth claims are wrong doesn’t mean we should reject truth. Doing so inhibits our ability to make coherent assertions about the world. Make the negative prove why our specific claims about the world are specifically constructed. </span><br />

The fundamental decision facing human civilization is non-zero-sumness… so long as we are beholden to notion that our well being is inversely related to that of the beings around us… ECONOMIC COLLAPSE/ WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION/ DISEASE/ TERRORISM/ DISSOLUTION OF THE NATION STATE/ DESTRUCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT/<br />

Q: How Does your Framework work?<br />
A: We think debate’s focus on the “short-term” is destructive. We want old school fiat so that plan passes.<br />
A break from the system needs to happen because short-term problems are gonna happen.</span><br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I. A2: Butler kritik<br />
1. By omitting sexuality they cannot solve alternative.<br />
2. Omitting sexuality decreases options because they change “or” of gender into “and”<br />
3. We are the radical change in policy making </span><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">à</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> Carlson<br />
4. The negative creates a false link to create a zero sum power of us.<br />
5. Disads to alt: no mechanisms to do alternative. The agent is an individual AN IVI because individual action is not reciprocal, nor predictable, and it’s vague.<br />
II. WTO CP<br />
1. P do both<br />
2. They have a disad to cp, they calculate.<br />
3. Sustainability is not a reoccurring<br />
4. Hansen answers their impact to the net benefit.<br />
5. PICS are bad.<br />
III. China CP</span><br />
<ol><ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">P do both</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Their commitment is conditional.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">China might not do plan. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Plan is a prerequisite to the impact because post plan we see things such as genocide as bad for the globe. </span></li></ol></ol><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">GMOs<br />
1. Concede that disease are happening now.<br />
2. No internal link between GM and subsidies.<br />
3. Use of GM kills sustainable development. Wachai </span><br />

 <br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Advantage Two: </span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Role of Ballot: Is about You should value. It ruptures us from the status quo of short term calculations. The topic is one good idea amongst other idea. </span></li></ol><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Solvency Extension – We endorse a good policy to change the zero sum decisions of the status quo. Biodiversity loss is that policy. The environment helps Americans release their selfish grasp. </span></li></ol><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Any Risk of Affirmative Solvency means that you don’t vote for the neg no matter how probable their disads. </span></li></ol><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Extend Welch evidence that says subsidies are self-serving in the short term but do nothing in long term. </span></li></ol><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We don’t need an impact because of Eschaton. Their arguments with impacts are time frame calculations. </span></li></ol><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our authors are more recent and more qualified. </span></li></ol><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Predictions are inevitable in status quo. </span></li></ol><h3 id="toc10"><a name="x-Aff-1ar Strategy Notes"></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><em>1ar Strategy Notes</em></strong></span></h3>
 <br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Solvency. </span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Biosphere – reading most qualified author. Make environment obsolete. If we don’t deal with environment first then they don’t solve. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our evidence is comparative about cooperation. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even if we lose disads they don’t have an impact.</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Pinchback: </span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We do not advocate his alternative. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We do not link to the concept of his actions. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our Wright evidence is phenomenal no matter what he says. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We don’t link to psychadelic suicide factor argument. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It’s okay if extinction. Delineation is how you weigh the extinction, short term vs. long term. Predictions are good, but we win that our long term calculations are better. </span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">GMOs</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We eat all your impact because plan is prereq to long term stability. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We win link turn – China and the U.S. have reached the pinnacle. Solves the north South dichotomy. </span></li></ol><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">WTO CP Theory</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Multiple Permutations are Good. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Most real world – Klinn ev ext.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Not a moving target. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Resolution’s purpose is literature – we have lit to back our perms.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Plan and CP are not mutually exclusive. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">They still have disadvantage to CP alone: it’a a bad calculation for debate to allow china to decide our affirmative. </span></li></ul><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">WTO CP: </span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">not severance. His own evidence says you need to talk about opportunity cost .The permutation is the only way to go beyond bad opportunity cost calc’s</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We solve for genocide in Africa </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And Solvency deficit. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Zero Sum is a disad to the counterplan within itself. </span></li></ul><h3 id="toc11"><a name="x-Aff-2ar Strategy Notes"></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><em>2ar Strategy Notes</em></strong></span></h3>
