<strong><u>Round One Towson CL vs Trininty BE</u></strong><br />
Cites by Amos Waranch, North Texas<br />
<br />
Trinity’s 1NC was only 1 off. They read:<br />
Cone 2000. Cross Currents, Spring/Summer. Environmental destruction turns and outweighs oppression.<br />
Boutler ’02. “Extinction: Evolution and the End of Man”.<br />
Embracing evolution key to preventing extinction.<br />
Arnhart 2008. “Krannawitter on Lincoln, Darwin, and Biblical Historicism<br />
”.<br />
Evolutionary understanding of humans proves that all people should be treated equally. Therefore we need to debate science.<br />
All of the following cards are from one citation:<br />
Pinker ’02 “The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature”<br />
Racial differences are climate control. Boundaries between races are highly permeable and don’t determine significant traits. p 143<br />
Race isn’t entirely arbitrary and the biological possibility of racial differences exists. Evolutionary theory is necessary to prove it’s impossible. p 79<br />
Alternative is consillience – advocate the 1AC but start with evolution. 69-72<br />
Any philosophy that contradicts science will inevitably be destroyed. 1AC’s ethics won’t survive the ethical transition. 30-31<br />
Language doesn’t shape reality. Language is interpreted according to existing concepts. p 210-211<br />
The blank slate doctrine is nonsense. Nothing comes from nothing. p 34-35<br />
<br />
In the block they read a few more cards from Pinker<br />
<br />
Neural nets can’t explain the function of the human mind. 79-80<br />
Discrimination is necessary to make any prediction – tradeoffs 147-148<br />
Variation amongst cultures inevitable. 88
