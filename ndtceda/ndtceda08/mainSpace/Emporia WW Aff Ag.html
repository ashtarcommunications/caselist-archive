We ran a new version of this affirmative at KCKCC that did not include the 3-tiered methodology.<br />
<br />
This claim, that the emancipation proclamation ended racism, is clearly absurd, but no more absurd than a lot of claims debaters make in rounds – that the Mead card clearly means nuclear war will happen, that Biopower can end, or that capitalism will kill us all sometime in the next week. The problem with all of these claims is that they are grounded in traditional styles of argument and grounded ONLY in the writings of traditional intellectuals. Thus, we begin by investigating what was happening in America around the time of the emancipation proclamation.<br />
The emancipation proclamation was actually emancipation with strings attached – Howard Zinn writes:“With slavery abolished by order of the government…its end could be orchestrated so as to set limits to emancipation. Liberation from the top would go only so far as the interests of the dominant groups permitted. If carried further by the momentum of war, the rhetoric of a crusade, it could be pulled back to a safer position. Thus, while the ending of slavery led to a reconstruction of national politics and economics, it was not a radical reconstruction, but a safe one- in fact, a profitable one.” <br />
Thus, the government began the subtle act of “pulling back” the revolutionary impetus of emancipation. One way it did this was the creation of the USDA in 1862. Although publicly Lincoln insisted it existed for other reasons, its true function was as a guarantor of privilege for white farmers, a bulwark against the influx of freed slaves who became land-owners. Subsidies, loans, and economic support curtailed the power of the emancipation proclamation, ensuring that although its rhetoric was powerful, that whites would not lose their dominant position.<br />
Since its creation, the USDA has a history of discriminatory practices in giving out benefits that can only be described as racist. Rosalind Gray describes8 how these norms and practices are internalized throughout the institution, down to the lunch room and hallways of the building. Every subtlety of the USDA’s norms and practices reflect a systematic form of white privilege. It may seem more understandable if Rosalind Gray was writing this of the USDA in 1900. Shockingly, her statement was instead issued in 2002.<br />
In 1998, Gray took over as the director of the Office of Civil Rights at the USDA. She understood that her challenge was a large one, knowing that the agency had a hundred-year-long history of discrimination that had in large part contributed to the decline of minority farms – Randi Roth writes that “In 1920, there were approximately 925,000 African-American farms in the United States. Now, fewer than 18,000 are left.”9 <br />
Gray was ostracized by staffers because she was committed to fixing a defunct complaint settlement process that had been turning away minority farmers for benefits throughout the 20th century. Discrimination never happened through overt rejection – Lincoln did away with that overt subjugation long ago. Instead, the USDA concealed racism in its practices through more subtle methods – it would lose paperwork, under-fund loans, fail to process complaints, make decisions about credit lines too late, applying ridiculous interest rates to loans, and other bureaucratically sanitized tactics of racial discrimination.<br />
Gray importantly notes in her declaration that racial discrimination was not just a feature of how the USDA related to the outside world but also how it functioned internally. She writes: <br />
“When I arrived at the Jamie Whiten Building, USDA’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., the atmosphere resembled that of a recently desegregated institution. Minority men, whether farmers or employees, were greeted with suspicion. Minority females were largely hired in support or administrative positions.”…”Almost forty years after the civil rights acts, black employees were still reluctant to frequent the cafeteria in the Whiten Building. Long-term black employees remembered when it had been segregated and still did not feel welcome. In fact, they did not feel comfortable in the building at all and came to the building as little as possible.”…”Minority employees complained frequently of promotion denials. Senior minority employees struggled to maintain authority in their areas of management. White career employees used different standards of evaluation for minority managers and attempted to rate them unsatisfactorily for performances that earned their white counterparts outstanding ratings. Senior white career managers resisted integration of employment at higher grades.”10 <br />
Racism, although dulled by the bureaucratic practices of the USDA, was ubiquitous and apparent in every aspect of the Department’s functioning.<br />
Much like the build-up to the Emancipation Proclamation, political opposition to USDA discrimination culminated it legal action in favor of reparation – in response to a class action lawsuit, The Pigford v. Glickman Consent Decree mandated reparations be paid and 13 million acres of land be returned to minority owners. <br />
The decree was thought to be a windfall success but proved only to be a pyrrhic victory. The <em>5th National Black Land Loss Summit</em>11 points out and Gray gives examples of how many complaints were simply thrown-out because of technicalities – a mis-spelled name, an incorrect date, or filling out a form incorrectly became reasons not to address or even talk about the racism that Pigford was meant to correct.<br />
The problem with current debate lies within the method. It is constructed in a so called traditional manner.  We write plans, cut cards to support them, cut cards to negate them, and rely on ridiculous logic to justify our positions. Then we read evidence and argument so fast that we can’t understand each other unless we read the arguments and evidence off of a sheet of paper during or after the debate.<br />
Time Wise says that this approach makes debate is a white centered activity. Personal principles don’t matter because Winning is all that matters, and debaters play with life-and-death issues as if it’s just a game. This is a big turn-off to minorities. ““ I learned a lot about lot of issues, but almost entirely in spite of the activity itself. If one learns anything from debate it is almost only in the research phase of the operation, because the actual debating itself is pretty much hour after hour of high-speed masturbation—mutual masturbation to be sure, which is almost always better—but masturbation nonetheless.” I say that this process is white because in my experience it appeals to the way white folks…. View the world, and equally seems repugnant to people of color…. White folks have the luxury of looking at life or death issues of war, peace, famine, unemployment, or criminal justice as a game.”<br />
A lack of diversity in debate hurts everyone, no matter if your black or white, rich or poor, male or female.  Debate is good – it is a opportunity for students to voice their opinions for public reflection and deliberation. Debate is an extraordinary privilege and a forum that is uniquely suited to discussion about contemporary notions of race and discrimination. <br />
However, Tim Wise’s criticism demonstrates how this opportunity is necessarily limited by the failure to address the problem as one of method. The traditional method turns-off under-privileged people to the activity. Thus, what we advocate is a change of method.<br />
Voting affirmative is a way of historicizing race – too often, students dis-associate themselves from the history of this country by assuming that race is some innate, ahistorical feature of ourselves – the danger of this perspective is that it denies accountability and allows the norms and practices that affirm white privilege to continue – our affirmative is a way of “eavesdropping” on history, or, putting ourselves in a position to listen to alternative stories, even if they make us uncomfortable – AnaLouise Keating, a teacher, talks about her experiences with this technique in the classroom:<br />

The version with 3 tier just subs an explanation of that method in for the Keating evidence.<br />

<br />
Passing of the <span class="yshortcuts">emancipation proclamation</span> Creation of the USDA discriminatory practices are still embedded with the institution and replicates in debate. We advocate the 3-tiered methodology as a way to historize racism and challenged exclusionary norms within debate.<br />
