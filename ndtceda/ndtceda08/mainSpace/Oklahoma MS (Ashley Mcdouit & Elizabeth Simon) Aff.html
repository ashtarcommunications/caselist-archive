 TERRORIST LIST AFFIRMATIVE AS RUN AT MISSOURI STATE<br />
<br />
The “arab” and muslim word has become the next frontier for the conquering of savagery and barbarism for the sanctity of civilization. The propogation of the “war on terror” functions to help further the manifest destiny of old world empire over indigenous peoples. This is not innocent act, but as a racist act of rhetorical utternace that severes to help normalize the acceptance of the colonialist views that we must eliminate the savage that treatens civilization.<br />

this labeling process must be questioned in relation to how current policies created the cycle of violence that is occuring around the globe. We must end our quest for the “real” and the “unreal”<br />

Official terrorists discourse utilizes the media to build support for state action in a time of crisis<br />

Public frustrations with terrorism...dealing with terrorism?<br />
Official terrorists discourse functions to dismiss entire cultural histories by using discourse that imposes conceptual reification of a taboo'd context.<br />
Joseba Zulaika and William Douglas, Terror and Taboo, 1996<br />
John ke Carre's words....within a tabooed context.<br />
The paramount expression found in “terrorists” discourse is the ideology and demonization it imposes.<br />
Joseba Zulaika and William Douglas, Terror and Taboo, 1996<br />
This chapter presents....agency and subjectivication<br />
Removal of the official “terrorists” label takes away the witches and forces a justification of the international agenda to be defended on political terms rather that “terrorists” discourse.<br />
