<strong>1AC: Syria – Golan War + Hezbollah Adv</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>1NC:</strong> <br />
<strong>Qualifications K/Fw</strong> <br />
<strong>Fear K</strong> <br />
<strong>Exceptions K/”spooky K”</strong> <br />
<strong>Case: Fiat is an illusion/FW, Nuclearism, discourse shapes reality</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>2NC: went through cards in 1ac and said they were fear mongering, constructed, etc.</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>2AR: perm + fw</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>RFD: voted aff on the perm --- do the plan and deconstruct w/ the alt</strong> <br />
<strong>“neg wins links to 1ac – 2ar perm doesn’t defend all of 1ac – best option is to defend serious questioning of IR and engaging syria”</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>“I don’t understand the aff choice argument”</strong>  <br />
<br />
<strong>“Neg should say, if perm is just the plan and avoiding the advantages, then don’t vote for the plan b/c there’s no advantage to it/severance”</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>“Take salhani card out of 1ac --- says summer war/September”</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>“make more perms --- I don’t understand “reject the aff” alternatives”: timeframe, intrinsicness, severance</strong> <br />
<br />

GSU Round 1<br />
Neg vs. Syria - Golan<br />
<br />
Off-Case:<br />
1. Fear K - AFF war/extinction advantages &quot;normalize&quot; fear. Policy calculations that begin with fear of crisis create<br />
2. &quot;Framework&quot; - Ev read w/o quals. Not reading quals ignores where people work and how that affects their arguments; hurts competitive equity (speech time, prep time) b/c Towson does not read quals.<br />
3. &quot;Spooky&quot; K - American exceptionalism bad. AFF assumes US is key, which fuels imperialism. Dillon and Cuomo impacts.<br />
