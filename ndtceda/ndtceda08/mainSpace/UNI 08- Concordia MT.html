<strong>Observation 1: Property and Rationality</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A. Western conceptions of property have devolved into a rationalized process of transaction and production. What was once a moral bond among community members has been reduced to a logic of “use value,” stripped of its former ethic.</strong><br />
<strong>Bryan</strong><strong>, 2000</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [Bradley, Property as Ontology: On Aboriginal and English Understandings of Ownership, The Canadian Journal of Law &amp; Jurisprudence - 13 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Can.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> J.L. &amp; Juris. 3, Lexis] </span><br />
<br />
<strong>B. This rationalistic understanding of property excludes all other views. The language of transaction can only comprehend truth claims that fit its model. Thus, it requires all assertions be couched in its language the language of transaction.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>C. Our conception of property signifies our ontology – it organizes the way that we relate to each other and the world.</strong><br />
<strong>Bryan</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2000</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [Bradley, Property as Ontology: On Aboriginal and English Understandings of Ownership, The Canadian Journal of Law &amp; Jurisprudence - 13 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Can.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> J.L. &amp; Juris. 3, Lexis] </span><br />
<br />
<strong>D. This language of rationalization that forms the foundation of Western property is the</strong><br />
<strong>essence of technology. It enframes the world and humanity in the form of standing reserve,</strong><br />
<strong>inventory to be stored for later use and transaction.</strong><br />
<strong>Bryan</strong><strong>, 2000</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [Bradley, Property as Ontology: On Aboriginal and English Understandings of Ownership, The Canadian Journal of Law &amp; </span><br />

<br />
<strong>E. The enframing of being is more dangerous than the complete annihilation of the earth. Even if we survive a nuclear war there will be no ontological clearing for us to exist in.</strong><br />
<strong>Zimmerman, 1994</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Michael E. Zimmerman, Chair of Philosophy at </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Tulane</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">University</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Contesting earth’s future : radical ecology and postmodernity, 1994 pps. 119-20] </span><br />
<br />
<strong>Advocacy: Thus, we advocate the use of poetics to reject the essence of technology present in Western property law.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Observation 2: A New Ontology</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A. Poetics can reconfigure existing language and go beyond the status quo enframing of being. Poets and philosophers are the unrecognized legislators of the world.</strong><br />
<span class="cite">Jenkins</span> <strong>6</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Martin Pathways School of Philosophy, “Heidegger, Technology, and Our Future,” <em>Philosophy Pathways,</em> Issue 123, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.philosophos.com/philosophy_article_137.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.philosophos.com/philosophy_article_137.html</a>) </span><br />
<br />
<strong>B. The dominance of technology can easily co-opt any attempt to stand outside the system. The poetic is the only way to resist technological thought.</strong><br />
<strong>Foltz 95</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Bruce V. Foltz, Inhabiting the Earth: Heidegger, Environmental Ethics, and the </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Metaphysics of Nature, 1995, p. 166.) </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>C. Ontology is the ground of all human understanding. The question of being is essential to real practical and political thought, in addition to authentic freedom.</strong><br />
<strong>Cropsey 87</strong> (Josepth, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Chicago, “History of Political Philosophy,” 891)<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation 3: Debate as Technology</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>We are guilty of two bad assumptions about the nature of language.</strong> First, that its only purpose is to communicate facts, and second that our use of technical prosaic language is the norm and that poetry and metaphor are abnormal.<br />
<strong>Polt, 1998</strong> [Richard, Heidegger: An Introduction, Routledge, 1998]<br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, our argument is that we should apply Heidegger’s critique of technological thinking to debate itself.</strong> In the face of topicality, in the face of framework, we ask you to do nothing. It is only when we have reached the paradox of understanding that it is our systems that have created the problems they were designed to solve that we can begin to open up new possibilities. We do not have a succinct alternative to the status quo interpretation of debate, and that is our point. The better interpretation can only be dreamed after we have rejected technology’s grip on our language and thinking.<br />

Finally, this relationship has evolved beyond traditional power relations. It is now a relationship of violence which creates and administrates bare life to be killed at a moments notice.<br />

<br />
In this section… power relations irrelevant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus we Affirm that<br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies, for biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat.<br />
<br />
Next is Our Method<br />
<br />
Famine, trade, food security, sovereignty, colonialism and economics are all present in this resolution. Our task as critical scholars is to interrogate these meanings, challenging ways of knowing the world in order to provide our political decisions with some ethical content. Our method is simple; we must evaluate the meanings of these concepts, their interaction with policy and use this interrogation to inform our affirmation of the resolution.<br />
<br />
The resolution is not a vacuous statement, but one caught up in various power relations. Our method is to analyze certain points of power and meaning present in the meaning of the resolution through a semiological investigation.<br />

Because we engage in an act of breaking out of current paradigms of thought we can’t know the complete end result of our actions. Therefore, our affirmation is an act of undecidability<br />

<br />
The existence of… be denounced.<br />

This act brings into light questions of language and representation- an affirmative ballot responds without knowing, putting the undecidability and impossibility of signification from within this modern episteme in touch with political responsiveness.<br />

The tool of science is the paradigm, or initial premises to formulate answers. These are created through consensus to make science seem neutral and objective.<br />

<br />
By shifting ..Now I wish to display a sense in which they are constitutive of nature as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Modern agricultural practices of science are based in objectivity. Science presents technical advances that are necessary for our survival, and any disturbances are externalized from the scientific process, depoliticizing the approach.<br />
<br />
Levidow in 95<br />
(Les, “Scientizing Security: Agricultural Biotechnology as Clean Surgical Strike” Social Text 44 13:3 hcm)<br />
<br />
The agricultural biotechnology …1). For example, risk debate on biotechnology expresses contending ways of diagnosing the limits of chemical-intensive agriculture and thus contending remedies (Levidow 1991 a).<br />

<br />
Biotechnology is the paramount example of this scientific drive. Inherent in it is the ideology of salvation, manipulating nature and social engineering to fix and improve weak parts of nature. Because of the scientific paradigm of objectivity, these acts are not seen as violent because the objects are not life.<br />

<br />
The social construct of … and reconstruction?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This process is supported by the government—while being the recipient of large agricultural subsidies, the biotech industry tries to solve problems that there are already natural answers to. The only reason for its existence is to profit the shareholders<br />
<br />

<br />
The only response … shareholders in the seed giants.<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, biotechnologies monocultural approach doesn’t exist solely in the fields— it forms a cognitive cultural framework, requiring an endless move forward, suppressing any dissent or the process.<br />
<br />
Kneen in 99<br />
(Brewster, food system extraordinaire and publisher of The Rams Horn, Farmageddon: Food and the Culture of Biotechnology, pp. 155-6 &lt;hcm&gt;)<br />
<br />
The social construct … heard or recognized.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This paradigm pre-determines the questions we ask, and how we answer them, killing any semblance of diversity in all of its forms.<br />
<br />
Shiva 2<br />
[Vandana,“Monocultures of the Mind”, Fatal Harvest, (Pg. 67)]<br />
<br />
Clearly monocultures are the antithesis of sustainability. Sustainability requires the protection of all species and all people and the recognition that diverse species and diverse … must come to an end.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, this paradigm is a reflection of the sovereign control of the lines of exclusion, every subject under its purview becomes standing-reserve, always already in danger of being pushed over the line into a zone of extermination.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus we demand that the United States federal government should abandon its agricultural support for biofuels, dairy, corn, cotton, rice, and soybeans<br />
<br />
We support this system through tax dollars. However, we are unknowingly kept in the dark about our support of industrial biotechnology. To preserve objectivity, this system skews data and hides damning data, tainting education and awareness. Our demand serves as a catalyst for action.<br />
