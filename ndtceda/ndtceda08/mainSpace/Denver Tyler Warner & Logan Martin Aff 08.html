<br />
With full U.S. backing Israel has engaged in genocide against the Palestinians in order to prevent a unified Hamas government while issuing impossible demands that it can’t meet—while this hypocrisy has been suppressed in order to conform to the West’s self-imagination the worst case scenario is likely to occur—this is not inexorable, however, because everything depends on human will and choice <br />

The ideological framework for Bush’s middle east strategy forces objects of U.S. imperialism into Manichean dichotomies to justify uncritical support for Israeli occupation and the elimination of any resistence to U.S. hegemony <br />

America’s pro-Israel policy is based on dispensationalism—the goal is to keep Israelis alive just long enough to provoke the rapture, where 2/3 of them will be eternally destroyed along with the rest of the world—the end ain’t looking good  <br />
North 2k (Gary, PhD University California Riverside “The Unannounced Reason Behind American Fundamentalism's Support for the State of Israel” July 19 2000 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/north7.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/north7.html</a> du-lrm) <br />
<br />
Hence the Plan <br />
<br />
The United States federal government should offer to lift all sanctions currently placed on the entire Palestinian Authority and substantially increase foreign assistance to the Palestinian Authority, recognizing that the January 2006 Palestinian legislative council elections established Hamas as the elected ruling party in the Palestinian territories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <br />
<br />
Observation 2: Instead of Shit say Poo <br />
<br />
First, sanctions have a constitutive dimension that must be evaluated prior to their functional effects—the attempt to dissociate ourselves from “evil” while denying our own complicity in the identities we create always creates more evil <br />

Luckily our aff is an example of a true political act – by reversing the idea that hamas is a terrorist organization we begin to talk with real partners – it changes of the ideological coordinates rendering the unthinkable thinkable <br />

Addtionally—the aff is an act of metaphysical rebellion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Even if its limited instrumental goals fail it still serves as a point of outrage against Christian ideology, which justifies perpetual murder in the name of perpetually unfulfilled promise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We allow for a human transcendence and reclaim agency in a way that gives the only true meaning to existence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <br />

The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Iran . This constructive engagement should take the form of a grand bargain where the United States offers security guarantees including the renunciation of the goal of regime change and a promise not to attack Iran. The United States should request that Iran end its nuclear weapons programs and submit to inspections to verify that any nuclear development is peaceful. The United States should offer normalized economic and political relations, in exchange for Iran’s renunciation of its nuclear program. Any questions please ask.<br />
