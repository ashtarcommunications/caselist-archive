Plan<br />
The United States federal government should offer a substantial increase in economic assistance to the government of Afghanistan by offering an aid package including the provision of legal standing to Afghan citizens who seek to impose liability for any environmental degradation on any agents of the United States on the condition that the government of Afghanistan commits to increase governmental accountability for environmental protection through a smart aid model and popular access to the judiciary.<br />

 The scene is Afghanistan—women are barred from Public Political action, radical feminists hide out in Pakistan for fear of being executed by Northern Alliance members, commit sucidie as a form of protest, 7000 at least have suffered death from forced migration and subsequent starvation, drought, a civil war between the Taliban and the northern alliance rages, endemic poverty, poor health care are conditions of life while American bombs rain overhead-this is not the post soviet Afghanistan though it sounds like it – it is the scene of American enduring freedom – the obscene underside of a US imposed “peace”<br />
Kevin J. Ayotte, Assistant Professor in the Department of Comm @ Cal State University, Fresno, and Mary E. Husain, Lecturer in the Depart of Comm at CSU, Fresno, 2005, (NWSA Journal 17.3, “Neocolonialism, Epistemic Violence, and the Rhetoric of the Veil”)<br />
<br />
“In addition to the vilification of al Qaeda, Laura Bush also sought to justify…wreaked physical violence on the bodies of Afgan women as well. [End Page 125].”<br />
<br />
Status quo “engagement” in Afghanistan neither constructive nor engagement but nation building lite – afghan women have not been freed, they have been included enough to be forgotten<br />
Sippi Azarbaijani-Moghaddam, independent consultant who has worked in Afghanistan for eleven years, 2003, (Donini, Antonio (Editor). <em>Nation-Building Unraveled : Aid, Peace and Justice in Afghanistan</em>. P. 106-110)<br />
<br />
“Regardless of women?s enormous contribution to the war against…punished, women will always live in fear and never find an effective voice.”<br />
<br />
Continually instrumentalized and included only insofar as they are objects of aid, the figure of the Damsel in Distress has been a key mobilizing trope for war—U.S. led intervention in Afghanistan operates to both include women on a Rhetorical level and exclude them on a substance level as Afghan women are subject to continual aggression from Western Feminism, U.S. allies and U.S. Bombing<br />
Mary Anne Franks, Winter 2003, (Hypatia, Obscene undersides: women and evil between the Taliban and the United States, 18.1)<br />
<br />
“One might be led to think that it is in this…that allowed the West to disregard them once again when its aims have been achieved.”<br />
<br />
Failure to politicize U.S. intervention in Afghanistan with a focus on the Politics of the everyday maintains aggression that denies value to life and sustains like for like violence<br />
Vaheed Ramazani, associate professor of French at Tulane University, 2002, (“Masculinity, Justice, and the Politics of Empathy,” Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, 21.1-2, Project Muse)<br />
<br />
“The point here is not that Bush is…not know if it will have been “worth” it”<br />
<br />
This model of depoliticized humanitarianism to “save” the Afghan woman brackets politics-reducing decision-making to short term crisis control affirms an emergency mentality that normalized the U.S. Driven neoliberal order which produces violence<br />
Calhoun, Professor of Social @ NYU, 2004, (Craig, “A world of emergencies: fear, intervention, and the limits of cosmopolitan order,” The Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology, 41.4 November)<br />
<br />
“The imaginary construct of “emergencies” organized attention to social life and indeed…the impact, efficacy, and efficiency of humanitarian assistance.”<br />
<br />
This narrative of victimhood underwrites perpetual unrestrained violence – status quo and future interventions are mobilized around the illusion of the US as a “neutral” arbiter and Afghan women as victims – this exclusion of Afghan women from the political creates a model of aid where recipients are nothing other than bare life<br />
Alina Sajed, PhD candidate McMaster University, 2005, (YCISS Working Paper Number 31, Between Syclla and Charybdis: The Ethical and Moral Dilemmas of Humanitarian Action, January)<br />
<br />
“As Brauman (1998) aptly remarks, “to do good is accompanied by a feeling of…example of humanitarian action in Ethiopia during the 1980s serves to illustrate this point.”<br />
<br />
The “security” promised by the masculine protection model in Afghanistan is in reality depoliticized crisis control that sanitizes global aggression and eviscerates political change<br />
Giorgio Agamben, 2002, “Security and terror,” Theory and Event<br />
<br />
“ “Nothing is therefore more important than a revision of the concept of security as the basic principle of state…reduce itself to attempts to control them once they occur.”<br />

<br />
<strong>The United States Federal Government should offer a substantial increase in financial assistance to the government of Afghanistan on the condition of the meaningful inclusion and influence of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan in government processes.</strong><br />

<strong><u>CONTENTION 2: RE-POLITICIZING INTERVENTION</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>THE PLAN TRAVERSES THE FANTASY OF WOMEN AS A PERPETUAL VICTIM BY DEMANDING THEIR INCLUSION INTO THE POLITICAL- THE INCLUSION OF THE NECESSARILY EXCLUDED OTHER CREATES A REAL POLITICAL ACT THAT CHANGES THE IDEOLOGICAL COORDINATES BY WHICH GOVERNANCE OCCURS</u></strong><br />

Kolhatkar knows.. <u>effective for that</u><br />
<br />
<strong>CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE SHORT CIRCUITS THE VICTIM/SAVIOR NARRATIVE- ABSENT A U.S. COMMITMENT TO DEMANDING RAWA INCLUSION THE FIGURE OF THE WOMEN WILL BE MANIPULATED TO JUSTIFY GLOBAL VIOLENCE</strong><br />

It has become… <strong><u>enduring American freedom.</u></strong><br />

<strong>WE SHOULD REFUSE THE NEUTRAL FAÇADE OF CURRENT AID- CONDITIONING INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE ON RAWA INCLUSION IMMERSES AFGHAN WOMEN INTO THE QUESTION OF THE POLITICAL INSTEAD OF BEING VEILED FIGURES OF AID</strong><br />

<strong>DEMANDING RAWAS POLITICIZATION CREATES AN IMPOSSIBLE DEMAND THAT DISRUPTS CURRENT MODELS OF DEPOLITICIZED MANEGERIALISM- IT EXPOSES THE FOUNDATIONAL VIOLENCE OF U.S. INTERVENTION AND BREAKS WITH THE MYTH OF NEUTRALITY CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR ONGOING CONTESTATION</strong><br />

<strong><u>DEMANDING THE INCLUSION OF RAWA IN THE FORCE OF POLITICS CREATES A MODEL FOR RADICAL POLITICAL CHANGE THAT RETROACTIVELY CHANGES THE IDEOLOGICAL COORDINATES OF THE EXISTING SOCIO-SYMBOLIC ORDER- attempts to avoid crisis and administer risk free options forcloses the political and antagonism</u></strong><br />
