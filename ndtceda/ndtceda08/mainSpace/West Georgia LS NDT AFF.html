Bush administration has pursued strategies that empower the Taliban militias; in response to the Senlis licensing proposal, they have released an idealogical hack-job via the State department—they mislabel the proposal as “legalization” to distort the motivations and intentions of the Senlis council, Rosenberg ’07.<br />
<br />
Millions die because the necessary medicine is not distributed, Spivack 5<br />
<br />
Lack of opiates leads to unnecessary suffering for millions of people INCB Press Release ‘05<br />

Plan facilitates a second tier distribution system guaranteeing equal access without competing with the current structures, Senlis ’07.<br />
<br />
UN agencies and NGO’s offer a stable market, Senlis Council ‘07<br />
<br />
Plan is the best available option, and all of the negatives solvency arguments are undermined by local production mandates, Applebaum ‘07<br />
<br />
Local medicine production raises poppy value to compete with illicit opium—plan utililizes current community strengths to maximize poppy value, Senlis Council ‘07<br />

Compulsory economic diversification in p4m ensures communities break free from the need to rely on illegal poppy cultivation, Senlis ‘07<br />
