The United States Federal Government should offer to expand programs to share technology, arms and training with the Australian military to aid in Australia’s defense transformation. The Department of Defense should engage private contractors to acquire substantial quantities of sugar on an annual ongoing basis at double current market prices from South Africa and Caribbean nations through split contracts of less than $50 million dollars each. The government of the State of Florida should make necessary monetary concessions to ensure successful purchase of land owned by U.S. Sugar and should ensure sugar production does not occur on land purchased as part of that agreement. The government of the State of Florida should enact a moratorium on further development of the Everglades.<br />
