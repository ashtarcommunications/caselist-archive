1ac w/ cites<br />
<br />
contention 1 is the trope of the hostage.<br />
in the wake of iranian revolution, the hostage crisis of 1979 created a vision of iran that still informs american foreign policy today. not only is it impossible to see iran outside of its hostage-taking context, we continue to enact policies that reflect this deep-seeded mistrust.<br />
in fact, the trope of the hostage actively constitutes american reality. the trope is a figurative device which frames our worldview by structuring our subject relations with self and others. with the hostage, it posits a connection between iran and irrationality.<br />
perhaps it is george w. bush who articulates it best: “we can’t allow the world’s worst leaders to blackmail, threaten, hold freedom-loving nations hostage with the world’s worst weapons.”<br />
it is this constant perception of the hostage that perpetuates a series of foundation myths that have and continue to drive our antagonistic relationship with iran.<br />
ansari 2006.<br />
Ansari 2006—Ali, Professor at the University of St. Andrews, Director of the Institute for Iranian Studies, Confronting Iran, p. 89-<br />
however, the trope is not purely literary—it has a very strategic political purpose. It serves to paint a picture of an irrational iran that cannot exist outside of “otherness”<br />
Roushanzamir 2004—Elli, associate professor in the Department of Advertising and Public Relations at the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Georgia, Chimera Veil of “Iranian Woman” and Processes of U.S. Textual Commodification: How U.S. Print Media Represent Iran, Journal of Communication Inquiry 2004; 28; 9<br />
“But it does….social formations.”<br />
the trope directly constrains the latitude of our political decisions by constructing a specific worldview.<br />
with iran, the trope of the hostage constructs iran as an aggressive and irrational captor. how, historically, have we reacted to these feelings of vulnerability? The wars in iraq and vietnam should come to mind as examples of how we defer to violence to secure ourselves<br />
Ankersmit 1994—Frank, Professor for Intellectual History and Historical Theory at the University of Groningen, History and Tropology: The Rise and Fall of Metaphor, p. 13<br />
“When focusing…heart of metaphor.”<br />
however, our argument is much more sophisticated than discourse shapes reality.<br />
tropes are directly linked to the practice of warmaking—they inject historical and emotional context into our discussions about iran. the history of war in the middle east demonstrates that tropes are hardwired into the national consciousness<br />
Ronell 1993—Avital, professor (teacher) of theory at UC Berkeley, Rhetorical Republic, Support Our Tropes, p. 13-15<br />
.01 Going Down in History<br />
“According to one version…Gray.”<br />
in combination with the rhetoric of safety and freedom, the trope of the hostage becomes a very powerful device.<br />
bush says: “For too long, the citizens of the Middle East have lived in the midst of death and fear. The hatred of a few holds the hopes of many hostage. The forces of extremism and terror are attempting to kill progress and peace by killing the innocent. And this casts a dark shadow over an entire region. For the sake of all humanity, things must change in the Middle East.”<br />
what can we possibly expect other than violence within this framework of hatred? by producing knowledge that sees iran as an irrational outlaw, we transform nations into replaceable variables that must be manipulated and contained. the violent underside to this posturing is strikes, war, and genocide<br />

“Abu Nasr…of mankind.”<br />
contention 2 is doing tropology.<br />
vote aff to affirm the resolution towards iran as an explosion of the trope of the hostage.<br />
this act is the ultimate guarantee of security as both the united states and iran are forced to recognize each others mutual vulnerabilities. it is by simultaneously taking the seemingly contradictory positions of host and hostage that allows for a radical transformation of the political into a space of ethical engagement.<br />
Bernard-Donals 2005—Michael, professor of English and Jewish studies, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Difficult Freedom: Levinas, Language, and Politics, Diacritics<br />
”Is a politics founded…and guests.”<br />
with any given trope there exists a plurality of interpretations—however, tropes like the hostage become hegemonic. in re-reading the text that posits iran as other, we can assign new meaning that doesn’t construct iran as an agent of violence<br />
Boly 1988—John R. Boly, modern literary theory and contemporary British literature at Marquette University 1988<br />
“Deconstruction as a General System: Tropes, Disciplines, Politics.” Cultural Critique, No. 11. (Winter, 1988-1989), pp. 175-201.)<br />
“My main assumption….its meaning.”<br />
we have a political responsibility to read the past as a text. the tropes employed in our various discussions and activities posit images that shape the way we see and think about iran. through tropological criticism, we can begin to understand how particular emotions and sentiments towards iran become naturalized<br />
Ankersmit 1994—Frank, Professor for Intellectual History and Historical Theory at the University of Groningen, History and Tropology: The Rise and Fall of Metaphor, p. 64-66<br />
“Thus linguistic…positivism.”<br />
deconstructing these foundational myths is a pre-requisite to any possible meaningful engagement with iran—our tropology actively challenges the way that western knowledge about iran is produced and used to rationalize banal, beaurocratic rationality in our political discussions about iran<br />

Their elevation of speech over the written words of the plan is mired in a violent metaphysics of presence-their call for clarification presumes that writing itself is unable to communicate the complete meaning of the plan, thus imposing rigid stability on the text which precludes the ability of difference to manifest itself-this approach is unethical and must be put into question.<br />
