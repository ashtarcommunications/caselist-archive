Round 2 Shirley<br />
<br />
Plan Text<br />
On the next available test case, the United States Supreme Court should restore the remedy provided by section 13981 of the Violence Against Women Act by overruling the decision in U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000)<br />
<br />
<br />
1AC w/cites<br />
Observation one is Inherency<br />
First, The Rhenquist Court planted precedent for the overturn of Morrison on Federalism grounds.<br />
Johnson in 2003 (Jennifer R. [Editor in chief, Santa Clara Law Review, Vol. 43. J. D. Candidate, Santa Clara University School of Law] “Privileged Justice Under Law: Reinforcement of Male Privilege by the Federal Judiciary Through the Lens of the Violence Against Women Act and U.S. v. Morrison” Santa Clara Law Review 2003)<br />
<br />
Today’s VAWA isn’t working, statistics show<br />
NOW in 2006 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.now.org/issues/violence/stats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.now.org/issues/violence/stats.html</a>)<br />
<br />
Observation two is Harms<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision denies equal citizenship and creates a natural identity that relegates gender subordination to the private sphere<br />
Resnik in 2002 (Judith, Yale Law School, “Feminist Justice, at Home and Abroad,” 14 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminsim)<br />
In this volume dedicated … have retreated from view<br />
<br />
Relegating gender violence to the private sphere leads to and lends credibility to a more militarized type of citizenship. Fighting this relegation is the critical step in changing the understandings of violence and security<br />
Tickner in 1992 (Associate Prof. of Political Science and the College of the Holy Cross, Gender in International Relations, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner13.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner13.html</a><br />
The pervasiveness of internal … traditional view of patriotism<br />
<br />
Allowing the miltitarization of citizenship invites domination of violence. But, through analysis of the relations of gender inequality and different forms of insecurity we can build a more sustainable form of politics<br />
Tickner in 1992 (Associate Prof. of Political Science and the College of the Holy Cross, Gender in International Relations, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner13.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner13.html</a><br />
In previous chapters I have argued … outside our own state<br />
<br />
Rape is an attack against women as a class, it isn’t a private matter<br />
Chowdhury in 2002 (Rumna, J.D. University of Minnesota, “Kadic v. Karadzic – Rape as a crime against Women as a class. 20 Law &amp; Ineq. J. 91)<br />
The repercussions of rape … deserves public attention<br />
<br />
Observation 3 is Solvency<br />
<br />
Only overruling Morrison gets rid of gender based violence and initiates the changes needed in our legal system<br />
Weissman in 2001 (Deborah M., Associate Prof. of Law/Director of Clinical Programs – University North Carolina, Chapel Hill School of Law, 2001, “Gender-Based Violence as Judicial Anomaly,” 42 B.C. L. Rev. 1081)<br />
Any issue is considered … values and legal concerns<br />
<br />
Court decisions do alter social beliefs<br />
Chowdhury in 2002 (Rumna, J.D. University of Minnesota, “Kadic v. Karadzic – Rape as a crime against Women as a class. 20 Law &amp; Ineq. J. 91)<br />
The judgment against Karadzic … never a private matter<br />
<br />
<br />
Answers to off case<br />
<br />
Hate Crimes D/A<br />
<ol><li>The standing precedent set by Morrison prevents any federal hate crimes legislation. <strong>Wethington in 2001</strong> (Jennifer L. [J.D. expected May 2002; B.A. in politics, minor in German, Hendrix College, 1997] “NOTE: CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-COMMERCE CLAUSE-Violence Against Women Act's Civil Rights Remedy Exceeds Congress's Powers to Regulate Interstate Commerce. United States v. Morrison, 120 S. Ct. 1740 (2000)” University of Arkansas Little Rock Law Review Winter, 2001 LN) Finally the most basic impact … standard under the commerce clause</li><li>Morrison is holding up hate crime legislation in Congress, leaving the state free to discriminate at will. <strong>Lopez in 2001</strong> (Alberto B. [J.S.D. Candidate, Stanford Law School, J.S.M., Stanford Law School, J.D., Indiana University School of Law – Indianapolis, M.S., University of Notre Dame, B.S., Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology] “Forty Yeas and Five Nays – The Nays Have It: Morrison’s Blurred Political Accountability and the Defeat of the Civil Rights Provision of the Violence Against Women Act” The George Washington Law Review 69 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 251, February, 2001) Not only does Morrison … redress for discriminatory acts</li></ol><br />
C/P Distinguish<br />
<ol><li>Solvency Deficit, by distinguishing simply to the facts of Morrison they lose most solvency. They solve only for those cases involving a young woman going to VA Polytechnic Univ. who’s raped by two male football players on campus. Then, who goes to the college and has one of the two men expelled for the duration of her schooling. But then, the college goes behind her back and allows their star quarterback or whatever back into school without informing her, so she sues under the Civil Rights Remedy of VAWA. Wow, that’s just so many situations.</li></ol><br />
<ol><li>There are other examples of women being beaten, raped, or otherwise attacked based solely upon their sex, like this one: <strong>Jenness in 2003</strong> (Dr. Valerie, [Chair and Professor of Criminology, Law and Society at the University of California, Irvine] <em>Engendering Hate Crime Policy: Gender, the “Dilemma of Difference,”</em> <em>and the Creation of Legal Subjects</em>. Journal of Hate Studies. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web02.gonzaga.edu/againsthate/Journal2/GHS101.PDF.%20Accessed%2007%20Aug%202006" rel="nofollow">http://web02.gonzaga.edu/againsthate/Journal2/GHS101.PDF. Accessed 07 Aug 2006</a>) Justifying the invocation … hate crime policy including law</li></ol><br />
<ol><li>Perm: Do both. Distinguish to the facts and overturn Morrison. Carve out a special situation like the one presented by Brzonkala and overturn Morrison to solve for the other situations.</li><li>Perm: Do plan then do counterplan. Garner full solvency through case and then reinforce Brzonkala’s case through the counterplan.</li><li>Perm: Do counterplan then do plan. We gain the net benefits of plan and once that happens we do plan to gain full solvency.</li><li>Perm: Do plan and all non-exclusive parts of counterplan. We have more benefits to doing this then to just do counterplan, because we still get all solvency.</li><li>Severance and intrinsicness perms are justified by pics. It is uniquely abusive because these make the affirmative argue against their own case in order to prove that the counterplan shouldn’t be passed.</li><li>This is a pic because they take one of the actions that would probably occur with plan and use as their entire position.</li><li>Pics bad<ol><li>Creates abuse within the round, allowing the negative to take affirmative ground leaves the aff no topical areas on which to argue.</li><li>Justifies the use of non-topical advantages to spike out of neg ground on the D/A’s.</li><li>Makes the affirmative debate against their own plan of action.</li><li>Destroys education, we did our research and came up with something at least somewhat original, now make the neg do the same thing.</li><li>Creates an unfair neg advantage, diminishes the amount of research the neg must do in order to compete, they get the block, we are supposed to have unlimited prep, but when they get to steal our plan they skew our prep and don’t need very much research.</li><li>Justifies severance and intrinsicness perms, if we are forced to debate against our own plan then we are fully justified in being equally abusive to them.</li></ol></li></ol><br />
Legitimacy D/A<br />
<ol><li>The Court’s Legitimacy was decreased when they made the wrong decision in Morrison. Morrison was even founded in research. <strong>Renshaw in 1998</strong> (Melinda M.
