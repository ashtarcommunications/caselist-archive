Heteronormativity K<br />
<br />
Focus on production in agriculture is the same as the focus on procreation that devalues the queer and forces us to obey the call of the dominant paradigm of heteronormativity<br />
Jagose '96 (Annamarie Jagose <u>Queer Theory</u>)<br />
<br />
They exclude queer modes of thought (specifically queer time), leads to no value to life<br />
Straub 99<br />
<br />
the state = root of heteronormativity and structures categories to exclude the queer<br />
<br />
heteronormative thought leads to marginalization and forms the bedrock of modern society - it's a violent form of socialization<br />

<br />
to challenge this we should give attention to a queer counterpublicpublic. The public of agriculture is one of reproductive futurism<br />
Warner '5 (Michael Warner <u>Publics and Counter-Publics)</u><br />
<br />
our advocacy is a queer counterpublic in debate and agriculture - no heteronormativity solves queer identieis and redefines rationality<br />
Warner '5<br />
<br />
the ballot is action - we must escape discrimination<br />

Criticizing CAFO's is ineffective because doublespeak – this reinforces nature as a commodity<br />
