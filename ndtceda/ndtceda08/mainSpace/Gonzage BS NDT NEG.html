LIKE EVERY GOOD WESTERN MOVIE, THE 1AC IS BUILT AROUND A DEEPLY SOMBOLIC OCONFLCIT BETWEEN THE FORCES OF EVIL, THE “BAD GUYS,” IN THIS CASE THE TALIBAN, AFGHAN WARLORDS, DRUG PUSHERS, ETC, AND A VALIANT SHERIFF, PLAYED BY THE US, WHO RIDES INTO THE LAWLESS BADLANDS TO HEROICALLY RESTORE ORDER AND PROSPERITY. BUT JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIES, AFTER THE CREDITS ROLE TODAY, THERE’S AWAYS A NEW CRISIS REQUIRING OUR ‘BENEVOLENT’ ENGAGMEENT TOMORROW.<br />
WE CALL THIS ‘SAVIOR SYNDROME’ – THE PLAN’S DRIVE TO ‘AID’ AND ‘FIX’ AFGTHANISTAN IS FOUNDED ON THE MYTH OF THE WEST AS THE PRIVILEGED SAVIOR OF THE GLOBE – US GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT RELIES ON CONSTANTLY RECREATING CRISES TO ‘SOLVE’, PERPETUATING US GLOBAL CONTROL AND UNDERMINING TRUE SECURITY FOR AFGHANISTAN AND ANY OTHER STATE SO ‘LUCKY’ TO BE ‘SAVED’<br />

“the ‘heroism’ narrative…and the crackdown”<br />
NARRATIVE LINK – THE 1AC IS DEEPLY INVESTED IN ACOLONIAL NARRATIVE OF AMEIRCAN INVOLVEMENT BRINGING PROGRESS TO AFGHANISTAN, EVER-MOVING-FORWARD SO LONG AS OUR BENEFICENT INFLUENCT IS FELT, BUT THREATENING TO BACKSLIDE INTO CHAOS AT THE FIRST SIGN OF US DISENGAGEMENT. THIS PROGRSS NARRATIVE SANITIZES COLONIAL VIOLENCE IN THE NAME OF A SHINING TOMORROW, WHILE PROFOUNDLY UNDERMINING TRUE DEVELOPMENT AND SECURITY FOR THE AFHGAN PEOPLE<br />

SPILLOVER FRAMING LINK - THE 1AC FRAMES AFGHANISTAN AS A FRAGILE CONTAINER FOR POTENTIALLY VIOLENT FORCES OF TERROR AN DEXTREMISM BURSTING AT THE SEAMS, READY TO ‘SPILL OVER,’ THREATENINT THE WEST – THIS FRAMING OF THREAT IS WRONG, THE DEVELOPING WORLD POSES ZERO SECURITY THREAT OT THE DEVELOPED. BUTH, THEIR FRAMING MASKS BOTH THE WAYS TH EWEST CONTRIBUTES TO INSTABILITY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND THE INHERENTLY FLUID AND SHFITING NATUR EOF AMERICAN ALLIANCES<br />
COOPER 06 [Neil, “Chimeric governance and the extension of resource Regulation”, <em>Conflict, Security, Development,</em> vol 6 no 3, p. 320-325]<br />
“second in much…regulation is one”<br />
AFGHAN STABILITY LINK – DIPICTION OF AFGHANISTAN AS “:KEY TO STABILITY” IN THE REGOIN TRANSOFRMS IT INOT AN EMPTY SPACE WITH NO VALUE ABSENT AMERICA’S GEO-STRATEGIC INTERSTS – ALL FORMS OF LOCLIZED VIOLENCE ARE PERMITTED AND ENCOURAGED IF THEY’LL TAKE HEAT OFF THE KARAI PUPPET REGIME, MAKES SUFFERING OF LOCAL PEOPLE INVISIBLE<br />
HEROLD 06 [online]<br />
“the only real…everyday suffering”<br />
<br />
IMPACT – EVERY CENTRLA THESIS OF THE 1AC IS AN IMPERIAL LIE – THE BELIEF THAT THE SOLUTION TO CONFLICT IN AFGHANSITAN LIES IN EVERINCREASING WESTERN AID AND MILITARY PRSENCE NOT ONLY LOCKS IN WAR AND CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN, IT PERVERSELY LEGITIMIZES A MUCH BROADER MILITARISTIC FO PO – OUR INTERROGATINO OF THE MYTHS AND NARRATIVES SUPPORTING THE 1AC IS CRITICAL TO BREAK DOWN ONGOING CYCLES OF MILITARISM<br />
CROWE 07 [Lore, “the ‘Fuzzy dream”: Discourse, historical myths, and Militarized (in)security – interrogating dangerous myths of Afghanistan and the ‘West’”, p. 21-24]<br />
“the militarization narrative…potentially destructive mechanism”<br />
ALT – VOTE NEGATIVE TO ADOPT THE POSITION OF AN INTELLECTUAL-IN-EXILE, THROUGH CRITICISM AND REJECTION O FTHE 1AC.<br />
THE STANCE OF AN INTELLECTUAL IN EXCILE REFERS NOT JUST TO A SIMPLE REJECTION OF THE TRUTH – CLAIMS THAT MKE UP THE 1AC BUT AN ENTIRE SCHOLARLY ORIENTATION, ONE THAT REJECTES FACILE CALLS TO IMPERIAL ENGAGMENT AND THAT REMAINS RESOLUTELY OUTSIDE THE DOMINANT POLICYMAKING STRUCTURES OF BOTH THE STATE AND THE ACADEMY. ADOPTING THIS STANCE OPENS ONTO A WORLD OF POLITICAL POSSIBILITIES MADEPOSSIBLE BY FRAMING OUR CRITICISM OF THE 1AC AS AN ONGOING, THOROUGHLY POLITICAL INTERVENTION<br />
BISWAS 07 [Shampa, “empiere and global public intellectuals: reading Edward said as an international relations theorist,” <em>Millenium: journal of international studies</em> vol 36 no 1, p. 124-127]<br />
“said has written…in this regard”<br />
<br />
OUR ALTERNATIVE IS PARTICULARLY VITAL AND EMANCIPATORY IN THE CONTEXT OF AFGHANSITAN – ONLY KING THE 1AC’S INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY AND REALITY IN FAVOR OF A CAREFUL SUSPICIOUS DECODING OF IMPERIAL NARRATIVES CAN SUCCESSFULLY ARREST CYCLES OF FAILED IMPERIAL POLICY AND BEGIN TO RECONSTRUCT THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR GLOBAL PEACE<br />

Aff ‘s approach to middle east studies is culture-blind- the idea that the west can neutrally gather data and interpret the societies of the middle east is founded on the false universalization of western ways of knowing that actively writes culture out of our field of view<br />
<br />
Andrea Teti 07 “Bridging the Gap: IR, Middle East Studies and Disciplinary Politics of the Area Studies Controversy” European Journal of International Relations Vol 13, no 1, p 121-122<br />
<br />
“the language of …..20th century”<br />
<br />
realist, rationalist explanation of US-Syrian relations are wrong, in the Syrian context empirics, logic, rationality are less important than ideology, which for Syria necessitates resistance against what they see as exceptionalist and orientalist US diplomacy<br />
<br />
Jasmine Gani 3/26/08 “Syria, the United States and the Role of Ideology”, International Studies Association Conference, All Academic<br />
<br />
“The middle east… ideological considerations”<br />
<br />
the 1ac presents fragmented pictures of Syria based on snippets from newspapers and think-tanks, assuming it represents an objective view of the middle east, assembling fragments of information into a seemingly coherent conception of the Other is their ultimate reduction to the same. In light of these perils of knowledge production, the question of this debate must be recast, accepting teir starting point always requires either the converstion of destruction of the other<br />
<br />
Dutta 04, “Interventions: The international Journal of Postcolonial Studies vol 6 no 3<br />
<br />
“the implicit ethical…out of it”<br />
<br />
Instrumental knowledge designed to ratify the omnipresence of the US guarantees global destruction- this strategic worldview can only conceive others as targets for American bombs, making it the logic of perpetual war<br />

Chow 06, “the age of the world target: self-referentiality in war, theory and comparative work” p 40-42<br />
<br />
“a largely administrative…its construction”<br />
<br />
epistemological questioning comes prior to weighing the case<br />

<br />
<br />
Alternative<br />
<br />
Vote negative to adopt the position of an intellectual-in-exile, through criticism and rejection of the 1ac<br />
<br />
The stance of an intellectual in exile refers to an entire scholarly orientation, one that rejects facile calls to imperial engagement and that remains resolutely outside the dominant policymaking structure of both the state and the academy. Adopting this stance opens onto a world of political possibilities made possible by framing our criticism as an ongoing political intervention<br />

<br />
lockman 05, CR: the new centennial review vol 5 no 1, p 75-76<br />
<br />
“if the preceding… as policymakers”<br />
<br />
policymakers only accept research that confirms what they already believe, offering advice does nothing, we must challenge assumptions,<br />
<br />
smith 97, review of international studies vol 23 p 512<br />
<br />
“second, Wallace…with scholarship”<br />
<br />
academic debate in the college setting should be a space of critical reflection to produce good civil society<br />
<br />
smith 97, same cite as above, p 509-510<br />
<br />
“Wallace writes… future officials”<br />
<br />
epistemology comes first,<br />
<br />
giving advice is counter-productive if the assumptions behind it are faulty, scholarship needs an accurate background picture or the case may only seem like a good idea because its constructed by a bad method<br />
