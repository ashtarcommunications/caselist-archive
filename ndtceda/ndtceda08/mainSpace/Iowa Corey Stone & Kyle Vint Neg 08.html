<br />
<strong>The aim of political power today is the preclusion of every possible disruptive event – under the sign of security, the New World Order disseminates terror into the smallest cracks of social life. It is a universalized Cold War that internalizes terror to ensure planetary stasis.</strong><br />
<strong>Baudrillard, Professor of Sociology, 2007</strong> [Jean, <em>In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities</em>, p.114-5]<br />
﻿STEVEN <strong><u>SPIELBERG'S Minority Report …. social and political life.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The crucial stake for the New World Order is the domestication of the symbolic danger represented by Islam – constructive engagement is the attempt to consensually assimilate the Middle East to the global order</strong><br />
﻿<strong>Baudrillard, Professor of Sociology, 1995</strong> [Jean, <em>The Gulf War Did Not Take Place</em>, p.85-7]<br />
<strong><u>The crucial stake</u></strong>, … <strong><u>of its collapse.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>This attempt to extend the hegemony of the Western global order is doomed to failure – its implosion is inevitable and will only become more catastrophic as it expands to encompass more and more of the planet</strong><br />
<strong>Baudrillard, Professor of Sociology, 2007</strong> [Jean, <em>In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities</em>, p.73-5]<br />
﻿﻿In their triangular affinity, … an implosion in slow motion.<br />

<strong>War today is a simulacrum, a place where the “real” and the “virtual” merge into a third order of reality – it spreads the terror of deterrence solely through its speculative unfolding in an abstract, electronic, and informational space</strong><br />
<strong>Patton, Lecturer in Philosophy, 1995</strong> [Paul, “Introduction,” in Jean Baudrillard, <em>The Gulf War Did Not Take Place</em>, p.7-9]<br />
Rhetoric aside, Baudrillard's …<strong><u>third order of reality.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The threat of nuclear war is no more than a pretext designed to hold the world hostage to prevent the possibility of any real event – it is the greatest system of control that has ever existed.</strong><br />
<strong>Baudrillard, Professor of Sociology, 1994</strong> [Jean, <em>Simulacra and Simulation</em>, p.32-3]<br />
The apotheosis of simulation: … <strong><u>because it risks annihilation.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The affirmative’s attempt to speculate about war is the product of mass media stupidity, a proliferation of phony and unaccountable commentary and information</strong><br />
﻿<strong>Baudrillard, Professor of Sociology, 1995</strong> [Jean, <em>The Gulf War Did Not Take Place</em>, p.51]<br />
By the force of the media, … <strong><u>insignificance of the images.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>To be for or against war is pointless and only falls prey to the mental deterrence that holds us hostage – we must instead deny its reality. This is the only way to open the possibility for symbolic resistance.</strong><br />
﻿<strong>Baudrillard, Professor of Sociology, 1995</strong> [Jean, <em>The Gulf War Did Not Take Place</em>, p.58-9, 66-8]<br />
<strong><u>While one fraction</u></strong> <strong><u>of the …</u></strong>, the senses and in discourse.<br />

<strong>The biological definition of death treats life as a process of accumulation and extends social jurisdiction over life and death</strong><br />
<strong>Baudrillard, Professor of Sociology, 1993</strong> [Jean, <em>Symbolic Exchange and Death</em>, p.162-3]<br />
An ideal or standard form of death, … democracy and the law of equivalences.<br />
<br />
<strong>This view of life holds us hostage to death – as long as death is split off from life, it comes to dominate the living</strong><br />
<strong>Baudrillard, Professor of Sociology, 1993</strong> [Jean, <em>Symbolic Exchange and Death</em>, p.166]<br />
<strong><u>We are all hostages</u></strong>… <strong><u>biological simulacrum of our own body.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>There is no value to death in the affirmative’s framework – this inevitably produces a passion for catastrophe where sacrificial violence seems to be the only way to inject death with meaning</strong><br />
<strong>Baudrillard, Professor of Sociology, 1993</strong> [Jean, <em>Symbolic Exchange and Death</em>, p.164-5]<br />
﻿﻿ Why on the other hand is … <strong><u>the highest importance</u></strong>, as sacrifices.<br />
<br />
<strong>Terrorism is a symbolic challenge that strikes at the heart of globalization – its effectivity cannot be measured by its so-called “objective” consequences because it has no meaning. The symbolic gift of death becomes an ultimate weapon</strong><br />
<strong>Baudrillard, Professor of Sociology, 2003</strong> [Jean, <em>The Spirit of Terrorism</em>, p.54-9]<br />
Here again, this is to … we can only, despairingly, find our own image.<br />
<br />
<strong>The act of giving one’s death is the ultimate subversion of a system that operates on the basis of the exclusion of death – such symbolic exchange is the only way to challenge the New World Order</strong><br />
