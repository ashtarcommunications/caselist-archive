Badiou K<br />
<br />
The 1AC’s description of ethics is strikingly narrow. There are only three roles that one could possibly play in this world. That of the Savior, a Supreme Court justice, who, through its legal means, reduces suffering in the world. There is also the role of the citizen, the concerned and engaged intellectual who determines what the most ethical form of law is: that’s you, of course. Then there is the last character: the suffering victim, the innocent bystanders, the cause of this entire enterprise and deliberation.<br />
<br />
<br />
But this is a conservative form of ethics. By preordaining that responsibility lies with aiding the downtrodden, ethics is reduced simply to the identification and elimination of pre-existing Evil, leaving no room for the celebration of the Good.<br />
<u>Badiou 2001</u><br />
[Alain, Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil, Pages 8-9]<br />
<u>What essentially is retained</u>...<u>of minorities, etc.</u><br />
<br />
Reductive interpretations of “justice” and “freedom” make it impossible to realize the utopia.<br />
<u>Badiou 2001</u><br />
[Alain, Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil, Pages 13-14]<br />
This is sophistry at its...humanity as such.<br />
<br />
A negative conception of ethics is ontologically bankrupt--- their justifications for the plan are too pessimistic for you to endorse.<br />
<u>Badiou 2001</u><br />
[Alain, Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil, Pages 10-12]<br />
We have seen that...at its own subhumanity.<br />
<br />
<u>The alternative is to become a disciple of Paul</u>---<br />
Paul was the most radical of Jesus’ disciples because he took the Bible as guiding principles, but not authoritative stamps on ethical questions. Rather than inventing a universal language for evil, we will remain open to the singularity of the situation. In order to address oppression, we must deal with it on a case-by-case basis that allows us to see each victim for their unique essence.<br />
<strong>Ingram 2005</strong><br />
[James D., Can Universalism Still Be Radical? Alain Badiou’s Politics of Truth,<br />
Review Essay, Constellations, Volume 12, Number 4, Blackwell Synergy,<br />
Accessed 12/4/2006, Google Scholar]<br />
Paul may seem an odd hero...process it unleashed.<br />
<br />
Voting Negative mandates a re-conceptualization of ethics – our purpose in the world isn’t to banish evil, we should instead cause the good to proliferate. History is a series of events, not a collection of truths. The way ethics is framed is important because it determines our relationship with one another, and to the meaning of our own lives. Degraded conceptions of humanity destroy the value to life. Existence is only what you make of it.<br />
