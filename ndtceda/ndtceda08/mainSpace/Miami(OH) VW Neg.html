Round 7, scouted by Malani from Georgetown<br />
neg vs KSU<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Courts CP – Same as Wiki</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Offsets CP – </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The United States federal government should eliminate nearly all domestic subsidies for dairy</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Competition – Competes textually and functionally b/c the text includes the words “substantially reduce agricultural support” and functionally because the cp maintains the same level of ag support</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Our job to negate – the rez says reduce so the negative can do the opposite; the cp proves why we don’t need, or shouldn’t have a reduction in ag support; our cp requires an offset with an existing ag support. Any perm is negation of the rez because reduce means to lessen in amount</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources 8</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Reduce: to lessen in amount, number or other quantity</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Reciprocal – they can use reduce to answer rollback and T arguments – our cp tests that aspect of the plan and we should be able to take the fundamental opposite stance</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Not topical – the CP is anti-topical, all the aff has to do is defend the rez</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Net Benefit – The CP solves the aff harms while avoiding all d/as because the counterplan does not result in an increase of ag support because a reduction in dairy subsidies would mean an increase in other subsidies</span><br />
