TEXT: The United States federal government should offer the People’s Republic of China that the United States will retain the &lt;subsidies for cotton which were deemed to “cause significant price suppression on world market” by the World Trade Organization’s Report of the Appellate Body&gt;* only so long as the People’s Republic of China fails to substantially increase enforcement of relevant Chinese intellectual property rights statues and to comply with obligations established by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.<br />

<strong>T</strong><br />
Eliminate is a present participle- means aff must immediate reduce (Chapman 5)<br />
2NC said aff plan text doesn’t say “reduce to point of elimination” so subsidies are never removed.<br />
<strong>CP</strong><br />
The United States Federal Government should eliminate its tariff rate quota system for Latin America sugar producers.<br />
The United States Federal Government should enter into negotiations with the European Union and offer to negotiate a binding agreement whereby the United States will retain &lt;plan&gt; only so long as the European Union fails to completely implement reforms of its agricultural support for sugar necessary to comply with the World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Body’s ruling on the European Community’s subsidies for sugar, including the sugar policy reforms proposed in June 2004, and the “Action Plan on accompanying measures for Sugar Protocol countries affected by the EU sugar reform.”<br />
Sovlency: the counterplan’s QPQ only requires that the EU approve a binding agreemtn to implement reorms they already announced in order to comply with the WTO<br />
Serrano 7<br />
By reason of … one-off payment<br />
Offering U.S. sugar subsidies as a bargaining chip to the EU for mutual elimination solves- generates global momentum for liberalization, boosts US leadership and independently solves global stability<br />
LeBlanc 7<br />
Sugar is not…seeks substantive change.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Production Net benefit<br />
1. Only the CP causes decreased European production- their farmers will not stop producing until a binding agreement solidifies the status of EU cuts<br />
Agra Europe 6<br />
Prevarication over the…accord he claimed<br />
Sugar production in the EU’s uniquely environmentally harmful- causes pesticide overuse, soild erosion,, and species loss in wetlands<br />
