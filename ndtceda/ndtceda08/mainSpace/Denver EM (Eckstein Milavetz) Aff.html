<strong>1AC:</strong><br />
Nietzsche Aff from the case list, ends with the following card:<br />
Has less to do with controlling the real world. Attempts to prevent extinction are meaningless and impossible—the goal is an impossible control. (Crawford, 85)<br />
<br />
<strong>2AC:</strong><br />
<strong>Counter-warrants:</strong><br />
Group it<br />
Winning uniqueness—were all going to die anyways—Crawford<br />
b) No value to life in the status quo—always in the dominant control of some kind of interpretation<br />
Desire to justify suffering bad is really an attempt to justify suffering (Thomas 89)<br />
This world they are describing is not the real world but communal interpretations<br />
<strong>Framework:</strong><br />
Their cheap shot arguments are predicated on their ability to win the framework debate<br />
Assumes affirmation, we change and create new form of affirmation. Saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to res depends on communal interp of resolution. More evidence (Huwayne 05)<br />
Assume a stable notion of language they cant defend—language is always changing.<br />
Affirmation and politics of ressentiment are bad, provides a view of affirmation. Search for true meaning is false.<br />
Have to prove a single reading of the rez is possible before any truth can be evaluated (Thomas 99)<br />
Single dogmatic interps are bad—not consistent. Notion of what is fair are based on notions of death—this is historically not the case. Claims of fairness are rooted in transcendent values of what is fair (Nietzsche 87)<br />
Accesses individual interpreation—affirming reso as an aphorism is key (Thomas 89)<br />
No intrinsic reason why you vote for fairness/edu, example of metaphorization of Clark evidence—way of raising ourselves above reality, ignorant beasts.<br />
Neg could get up and read multiple different types of frameworks—flips presumption aff.<br />
Their prescription of the world proves the objective truth is impossible.<br />
Individual voters are bag out of the debate.<br />
Attempts to know the world in this way separates us from the real world, no meaning to life (x 94)<br />
World is inherently chaotic—whenever we attempt to know using interps, creates a world B, its chaotic, attempt to create value systems is an attempt to rationlize this, separate us within animals, make us clever-er beasts.<br />
<br />
<br />
2AR:<br />
Extinction inevitable—no reason its worse now than later.<br />
No value to life in this framework.<br />
Only understand world through metaphors—sight, sense, and sound.<br />

<br />
Interpretation is the name of the game. Morality, justice, the law, the state, bio-political control; all of these are just interpretations. No shit you might say, but what of this. If this is so obvious, then why be enslaved by the will to power? Utility is deployed as a Smoke Screen—if we understand the utility of a thing (i.e.—morality keeps us from killing, the state keeps us from slipping into chaos or worse anarchy) then we certainly understand the origin. Confusing the utility of a thing with the origin is exactly what allows us to be enslaved by interpretation and proves nothing except the power of interpretation.<br />
Nietzsche 1887<br />
(Friedrich, On the Genealogy of Morality, M. Clark &amp; A.J. Swense Trans) P. 50-52<br />
“Yet a word on…a matter of more than just ‘administering’”<br />
<br />
There is no value to life in a world where interpretation is King. A society of interpretation is one that trains and domesticates and enslaves people. Affirming the resolution as an aphorism, as something that is free from interpretation is to affirm the becoming and chance of the resolution and break free from the training ground of society.<br />
Hoy 2005<br />
(David C. [Professor and Presidential Chair of Philosophy UC Santa Cruz] Critical Resistance: From Poststructuralism to Post-critique ) p. 25-26<br />
“Anticipating both…of these forces dominate others”<br />
<br />
A politics of Ressentiment as opposed to a noble morality is defined by its oppositional stance. Noble morality defines its conception of the good in that which is enjoyable whereas slave revolt morality is rooted oppositionally ( i.e. that which other find to be good that I do not have is bad) politics of Ressentiment or oppositional politics ensures the constant creation of an enemy other and is a poison that is impossible to purge.<br />
Nietzsche 1887<br />
(Friedrich, On the Genealogy of Morality, M. Clark &amp; A.J. Swense Trans) p 19-21<br />
“The slave revolt…a ‘good one’—himself!”<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc32"><a name="Nietzsche Aff-The Plan:"></a>The Plan:</h2>
<br />
The United States Supreme Court Should overrule one or more of the following decisions: Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992); Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942); U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974).<br />
<br />
You should affirm the resolution as an aphorism—the meaning of an aphorism is not static of fixed but rather varies over time and dependant on the context in which it is understood.<br />
Hoy 2005<br />
(David C. [Professor and Presidential Chair of Philosophy UC Santa Cruz] Critical Resistance: From Poststructuralism to Post-critique ) p. 20-23<br />
“If pressed to say…under the changed circumstances.”<br />
<br />
Affirming the resolution as an aphorism will allow us to set free what lives in the resolution as opposed to sticking a meaning with it—affirming the resolution in this way constitutes a revelation of affirmation in the general sense—instead of looking for the truth or falseness of the resolution affirmation of the aphorism of the resolution transcends the tradition “to put up with” associated with affirmation and makes room for an understanding of interpretation<br />
Hoy 2005<br />
(David C. [Professor and Presidential Chair of Philosophy UC Santa Cruz] Critical Resistance: From Poststructuralism to Post-critique ) p 23-24<br />
“The issue is therefore….free what lives”<br />
<br />
There is no truth in the resolution—the resolution or rather meaning that is found in the resolution is just another interpretation—understanding reality based on the search for truth inside the resolution keeps us trapped in a real world that is not all that real—affirm the resolution as an aphorism to revalue valuation<br />
Hoy 2005<br />
(David C. [Professor and Presidential Chair of Philosophy UC Santa Cruz] Critical Resistance: From Poststructuralism to Post-critique ) pg 27-28<br />
“Philosophy has thus….and the real”<br />
<br />
Put away your co-optation dis ad—the point of affirming the resolution as an aphorism is that it transcends the ability of society to codify it—the meaning of an aphorism is not only polysemic in any given context but also shifts over time and over context—this is its nature and sole value.<br />
Hoy 2005<br />
(David C. [Professor and Presidential Chair of Philosophy UC Santa Cruz] Critical Resistance: From Poststructuralism to Post-critique ) pg 29-30<br />
“Methodologically Nietzsche…extrinsic nomadic unit”<br />
<br />
Here is a brief preview of our T answers—single dogmatic readings or interpretations are bad-ish—there are tons of possible readings of texts and each is as “true” or valuable as the next—promoting single dogmatic readings is nonsense<br />

<br />
First - Morrison was wrongly decided and should be overruled. The Court should abandon its categorical approach and return to the rational basis test, which gives proper deference to Congress<br />

The resolution is a theater that presents a fork in the round asking the debaters each to recommend a particular path that will result in a general well being, because as we know doing the plan or not doing the plan will result in nuclear war. However, a prior question before determining where we should go is where we are. It’s the same as trying to get directions to the bar, you first must figure out your starting location before deciding the best route to take.<br />

Even the smallest sentence represents a narrative. Narratives are lazy machines, they really have no intrinsic meaning, and they attempt to provide a structure and a map but they are filled with different holes that it invites the reader to fill with their own experiences.<br />

The current paradigm for understanding the text is through one of two lenses. First is the clinical view which views the text as something to be diagnosed. Like a doctor examining a patient, we look for symptoms (indicators) as evidence for our conclusions. In literature, the clinical frame means that we take specific words of a text from those, deduce their meaning in terms of the larger narrative in place. For example we would look at the term supreme court and determine that we are discussing legal concepts and ideas. In contrast, the critical view attempts to determine the underlying meanings of a text. For example, one would evaluate the term &quot;man,&quot; in terms of how identity is portrayed in a text. These divergent views of the text limits our own understanding of the text, because there is an undisclosed “truth” in the words, this objectifies the text into something that can be consumed by the market.<br />

<br />
The method of imposing formalistic constraints on the texts traces its origins to a scientific paradigm in which sentences represent logic and rationality. This scientific scandal is a product of a Cartesian tradition that encases the reader in ideology, hoodwinking them into believing they discovered the “Truth.” We become trapped in a tautology which stifles intellectual thought and desire.<br />

The classical structure imparted onto texts makes it impossible for the subject to explore other ontological planes creating a Cartesian subjectivity which is the root cause of violence<br />

<br />
It is in this entrapped world that we see only a singular, correct meaning to the resolution. Debaters have become repeating machines, constantly using the same rhetoric and language to describe the resolution, the text, and the world around us, we trick our selves into believing in the singular truth in any given situation. The repeated espousal of structure, style and rhetoric represents the impulse towards what Barthes describes as the “New” and risks the destruction of language, only by realizing the bliss inherent in text can we combat this trend<br />

Our understanding of the world correlates with our understanding of text. Thus, we affirm the resolution as a writable text. When given a writeable text, the subject is no longer a repeating machine regurgitating dominant thought; rather they interact with the lazy machine by inserting their own personal narrative into the text. In order to do understand the writeable text the subject must re-evaluate their pre-established ideas of the text, as well as reconsider the conventions of their own mindset. No longer is a meaning or idealism imparted onto the subject, rather they are becoming subject. Entering into a pleasure of the texts liberates the reader from dominant social codes and ideological repression. It is in this space that the production of meaning can occur and that the reader/writer can take a stand against ideological and libidinal alienation.<br />

<br />
When reading a writable text the reader is faced with two divergent interpretations: the phenotext, which is the reductionist logic of linguistic structure and rationalism and the genotext which acts to deconstruct the positivist reading paradigm. Affirming represents the fleeing from the phenotext and embracing the subject enters a state of becoming<br />

<br />
The writable text sits betwixt and between the common methods for analyzing text. By inserting our selves into the text we are no longer part of a larger group, we are only ourselves. The interplay between the dominant paradigm and individuality occurs allows the reader to confront their own individuality. The reader realizes that their body is separate from others, and it is in this moment of bliss that historical subject is born.<br />
