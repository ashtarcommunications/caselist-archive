 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The tree was the only citrus tree in the garden that had a fruit on it. Gabriel had taken some paind to plant the tree to make the tropic of cancer. A line. An imaginary line girdling the globe separating north from south at the northernmost latitude reached be the overhead sun. Rafaela didn’t think much about Gabriel’s fascination with an imaginary line, but she knew instinctively the importance of the surviving orange. In the days when it was a blossom of soft petals, she noticed a line—finer than the thread of a spider web—pulled with the delicate tautness. Perhaps it was something like a laser bean or light passing through an optic fiber. When the baby orange appeared, it seemed to grasp that the line as its parent, if a line could be a parent. And when the salty wind blew west from the sea rocking it back and forth like a small cradle, the curious line—now running through the meters, rolling down a small slope to a neutral place between the ownership and the highway. An old man carrying his suitcase along the highway toward the bus stop came upon the orange. He stopped, opened his suitcase, and put the orange in one corner. As he boarded the bus, the strands of the line extended from the orange, reaching out of the suitcase and slipping across the bus, through the windows and across the land. The border.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Guatemalans loading trucks with crates of bananas and corn,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Indians who mined tin in the cerro rico</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Chewing cocoa to dull the pain of their labor.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He saw the mother in Idaho peeling a banana for her child,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Lines of laborers gripping soiled paychecks at the local bank.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Everybody’s labor got occupied in the industry of draining their homeland of its natural wealth.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In exchange they got progress,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Technology, loans, and loaded guns.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Trade balances and stock market figures.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Negatives and positives.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A 28 billion dollar trade deficit?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Devaluate the peso.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A miricale!</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">No more debt for the country. Instead personal debt for all its people.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This exploitation depends on the naturalized divide between the global north and the global south. The north continually protects its own position, claiming that these trade protections benefit everyone. This dynamic epitomized in the relationship between the US and Mexico, in which an interlocking system of free trade and corn subsidies enables American agribusiness to flood mexico with underpriced corn. Stripped of their livlyhood and forced off their land, millions of displaced Mexican farmers migrate to the US, where they are further exploited as day laborers. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Michael Pollan 2004</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“One of the ballyhooed… can be defaced and exterminated.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When the old man finally opened his eyes he could see</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">All 1950 miles of the frontier stretched across from Tijuana on the Pacific</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To the end of its tail on the gulf of mexico.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It waited with seismic sensors and thermal imaging,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">With colonies of desitut skirmishing at its hard line</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">With steel structures, barbed wire, infrared binoculars,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">INS detention centers, border patrols, rape,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Robbery, and death.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It waited with its great history of migrations back and forth—</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The deportation of 4000000 Mexican citizens in 1932</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Coaxing back 2.2million wetbacks in 1953.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">They held the border to his throat like a great knife: What is your name? How old are you? Where were you born? Where is your visa? Your passport? Are you carrying any fruit or vegetables?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The old man tried to respond, but his voice was swallowed up by the waves of floating paper money: a graceful movement of free capital carried across by hidden and cheap labor. Hundreds of thousands unemployed surged forward.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We believe debate should be about the methodologies of the oppressed, forming a new consciousness that realizes our ability to shape reality. We ask you to utilize your ballot as a means of advocating the magical realism of the tropic of orange as a tactic to transgress the static boundaries that corn subsidies are built upon. This is a necessary confrontation of the singular, hegemonic view of reality in favor of a view that embraces fluidity and agency.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The affirmation of magical realism in this round counters the exile of the unreal, activating this new potential for agency</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Sanchez 2k2</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“All the authors studied employ…the staples of realism.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Specifically, Tropic of orange demystifies the violent exclusion carried out by free trade by linking history of colonialism to the politics of Tran nationalism, inserting a discussion of migrants into a discourse that normally erases them</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Wallace 2k1</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Discovering the world in magical ways facilitates the transcendence of the limits imposed by a singular understanding of reality. This Mythic pedagogy fosters dialogic relations and a critical understanding of reality</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Aceves 2k4</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Childhood, more than any…critically analyze reality.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our Framework allows for a methodology of the oppressed. This produces a new consciousness, a new way to understand the world that counters the privileging of one hegemonic form by engaging in fluid identity and positing the subject as capable of transforming reality.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Rodriguez 2k4</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“In the late 1980’s…than achieving a fixed self.”</span><br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2AC on environment</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">the 1ac attempts to integrate the horror of ecological crisis seeking to eliminate catastrophe through their ideological vision.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Stavrakakis 97</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Instead of recognizing… on this point we agree entirely with zizek”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Framework</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1. Debate should be about methodology of the oppressed - the border is in our backyard - its not govt policy that must change first its us</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2. The domestic is accounted for while the foreign is written off - that’s the thinking that makes extinction impossible</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3. Magical realism challenges this - we change co</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">4. Rodriquez - me must affirm in place of colonialism</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">5. Oppressed must create their own strategies</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">6. Debate is about agency - you force us to externalize - that ='s interpassivity</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">7. need to advocate and use that for change –</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">8. Roleplaying leads to us to accept oppression - means illegal aliens cant act</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">9. Get educational gains</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">10. Perm - can't access predetermined resolution - we get to define the resolution</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">11. Their framework excludes all those that fallout outside the world of politics</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">12. Agency is not defined by USFG</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">13. C-def -- USFG is us – agamben</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">14. Living outside these boxes kills debate without any utility</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">15. they get lots of topic arguments –</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">16. deference to grammar in a singular sense is the way the govt protects its own view that is racist and privileged</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2AC High Yield DA</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1. Problem solution approach to the environment only causes problems - our predictions about the environment are already flawed - ev</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2. We create the most ethical relationship to the environment – strauv</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3. Tropic of orange finds the best relationship to nature - it transcends the binary</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">4. Low yield agriculture is key to solve domination</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2AC Protectionism DA </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1. not a link - no lobby backlash - obama won't be blamed, nothing will happen\</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2. we can challenge protectionism through our daily practices</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3. Molly evidence says that we can challenge the ways that free trade is used - this solves back the violence that they say will happened</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">4. No risk of overproducation if there is no export market</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">5. 70% of subsidies go to big business right now</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2AC Cap K</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1. Structure and pedagogy uphold capitalism -- ev</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2. 1AC says exploitation is only possible b/c there is no contact - we destroy isolation and force ppl to confront</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3. Capitalism solved by our aff - need contact – bay</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">4. capitalism is not the root cause - removal cant solve all oppression –</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">5. Perm - need multiplicity of strategies</span><br />
