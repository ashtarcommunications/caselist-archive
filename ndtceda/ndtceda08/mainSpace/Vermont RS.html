Post-Swing: Aquaculture Aff<br />
<br />
Contention One – Offshore Aquaculture –<br />
Aquaculture is the fastest growing animal-food industry – federal incentives mean open ocean aquaculture will be set up in the EEZ in the immediate future.<br />
Anderman-Hahn ‘6 [Jansen; “NET PENS WITH ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT: HOW TO MANAGE THE EXPANSION OF AQUACULTURE USING THE CLEAN WATER ACT”; Vermont Law Review; 30 Vt. L. Rev. 1007; l/n <em>nick]<br />
The great potential … environmental effects from these net pens.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Federal subsidies are critical to offshore aquaculture development – it’s not commercially viable without them. Even industry experts agree that without subsidies, the industry won’t survive.<br />
Food and Water Watch ‘8 [(tables omitted); “Government Keeps Offshore Aquaculture Afloat”; May 22; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/fish/fish-seafood/fish-farming/problems/offshore-aquaculture-government-funding" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/fish/fish-seafood/fish-farming/problems/offshore-aquaculture-government-funding</a></em>/ nick]<br />
“Seafood contributes over $8 billion to the … balance the nation’s seafood trade deficit.<br />
<br />
Expansion into the EEZ is key to overall aquaculture development – there aren’t enough available sites near shore.<br />
Phillips ‘5 [Stephen; “Marine Aquaculture Issues Paper”; Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission; September; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aquaticnuisance.org/docs/Issue%20--%20Aquaculture%20VI.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticnuisance.org/docs/Issue%20--%20Aquaculture%20VI.pdf</a> <em>nick]</em><br />
<em>One factor … are not jeopardized (Cicin-Sain et al. 2001).<br />
<br />
Offshore aquaculture circumvents state bans and regulations on fish farms and transgenic fish, while spilling over to state waters – it will be totally unregulated.<br />
Mosness ‘5 [Anne (West Coast coordinator of the Marine and Fish Conservation Program, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy); “Feds Plan to Subsidize Fish Farms”; Whatcom Watch; July; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.whatcomwatch.org/php/WW_open.php?id=569" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatcomwatch.org/php/WW_open.php?id=569</a></em> nick]<br />
By locating operations … farming has proven.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – Aquaculture is bad –<br />
<br />
[<u>_] Advantage 1 – Ocean Health –</u><br />
<br />
<u>Offshore aquaculture destroys ocean ecosystems – fish farms discharge chemical and nutrient pollution which cause algae blooms, killing fish and causing sedimentation, and inevitable fish escape crushes genetic diversity – this overwhelms resiliency<br />
Englebrecht ‘2 [Erin R. (J.D., Emory University School of Law); “CAN AQUACULTURE CONTINUE TO CIRCUMVENT THE REGULATORY NET OF THE MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT?”; Emory Law Journal; 51 Emory L.J. 1187; l/n <em>nick]<br />
Aquaculture cages, netpens, and … significant and actual threat to ocean fisheries.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Now is the key time – we’re on the cusp of a wave of marine extinctions.<br />
Eilperin ‘5 [Juliet (Washington Post Staff Writer); “Wave of Marine Species Extinctions Feared”; The Washington Post; August 24; l/n</em> nick]<br />
Gruber's sentiments have become … fish populations to plummet.<br />
<br />
Loss of marine biodiversity renders the oceans defenseless against disasters and climate change ending human survival.<br />
Craig ‘3 [Robin Kundis (Indiana University); 34 McGeorge L. Rev. 155, p. 264-266 <em>nick]</em><br />
<em>Biodiversity and ecosystem function … even if a few fishers go out of business as a result.<br />
<br />
[</em></u><em>_] Advantage 2 – Antibiotic Resistance –<br />
<br />
Antibiotic use in fish farms is the primary cause of antibiotic resistance – use of antibiotics is widespread, both legally and illegally - spread of resistance to humans is inevitable because of evolution, consumption, and proximity.<br />
Wilson ‘4 [Graham (J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law and M.A. in Bioethics at the University of Virginia); “A Day on the Fish Farm: FDA and the Regulation of Aquaculture”; Virginia Environmental Law Journal; 23 Va. Envtl. L.J. 351; l/n</em> nick]<br />
The specific disbursement methods, … considerable medical importance. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.86533.6732206199&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1227419509451&amp;returnToKey=20_T5198641559&amp;parent=docview#n75" rel="nofollow">n75</a><br />
<br />
Effective antibiotics are rapidly running out—soon many diseases will become pandemics<br />
SGM ‘8 [Society for General Microbiology and World Science staff, 3-31-8 “Scientist: “superbugs” resist all drugs, portend pandemic” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.world-science.net/othernews/080331_superbug" rel="nofollow">http://www.world-science.net/othernews/080331_superbug</a> <em>nick]</em><br />
<em>Doc­tors are run­ning out of … a pan­dem­ic.”<br />
<br />
Antibiotic resistance creates multiple extinction-level diseases<br />
Collins ’98 [Sharon, Sunday Mirror, Mirror Group newspapers health editor, formerly trained as a specialized medical correspondent, 4-12-1998 “'Doomsday' fear as we over-use antibiotics” lexis</em> nick]<br />
THE golden age of antibiotics.. resistance is developing.&quot;<br />
<br />
[___] Advantage 3 – Fish Feed –<br />
<br />
Aquaculture requires huge amounts of fishmeal – it’s the greatest user of these products, fueling the overfishing crisis and depleting small fish stocks.<br />
Food and Water Watch ‘7 [“Fishy Farms: The Problems with Open Ocean Aquaculture”; October; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fwwatch.org/fish/fish-seafood/fish-farming/fishy-farms/introduction" rel="nofollow">http://fwwatch.org/fish/fish-seafood/fish-farming/fishy-farms/introduction</a> <em>nick]</em><br />
<em>Raising large amounts …with vegetable ingredients. (See Kona Blue Water Farms – Hawaii.).<br />
<br />
Aquaculture is the key driver of fish meal consumption<br />
NOAA NMFS ‘6 [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Marine Fisheries Service, 2-14-6 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ocs/mafac/meetings/2006_02/docs/0214nmfs.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ocs/mafac/meetings/2006_02/docs/0214nmfs.pdf</a></em> nick]<br />
MS. CHAVES: Linda Chaves. One of the things … I just thought I'd offer that.<br />
<br />
Fish meal is the key driver of overfishing<br />
UN FAO ‘8 [United Nationals Food and Agriculture Organization, 5-14-8 “&quot;Trash fish&quot; catches” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/ad514e/ad514e08.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/ad514e/ad514e08.htm</a> <em>nick]</em><br />
<em>The issues relating to these types of &quot;trash fish&quot; … it will be difficult to meet the demand for trash fish.<br />
<br />
Overfishing causes extinction.<br />
Christie ’00 [Andrew, Information Director @ Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, 4-12-2K “How Indian Beat the Bank” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oikos.org/ecology/indiafish.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.oikos.org/ecology/indiafish.htm</a></em> nick]<br />
Overfishing is an environmental …ones as each is depleted in turn.<br />
<br />
Additionally, fish meal demand drives krill takes in excess of the Antarctic Treaty System limits, undermining the ecosystem.<br />
Fogarty ‘8 [David, Reuters, 5-25-8 “Overfishing of krill threatens ocean ecosystem” IHT lexis <em>nick]</em><br />
<em>In the global rush for resources, …that just looks too horrendous to contemplate.&quot;<br />
<br />
That undermines the entire Antarctic Treaty System<br />
ECO ‘1 [newspaper published Twenty-Third Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, 10-22-1 “20 YEARS OF SOUTHERN OCEAN MANAGEMENT – SO WHERE ARE<br />
THE FISH??” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.asoc.org/Portals/0/CCAMLR%20XX%20No.1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.asoc.org/Portals/0/CCAMLR%20XX%20No.1.pdf</a></em> nick]<br />
As long as CCAMLR is unable … CCAMLR cannot afford to fail.<br />

ATS collapse goes nuclear<br />
Shah ’91 [Parakash, head of the UN Legal and Treaties Division, Minisitry of External Affairs, India; In The Antarctic Treaty and World Politics, Ed. Jørgensen-Dahl and Østreng <em>nick]</em><br />
<em>While the context in which … its pristine environment.<br />
<br />
Plan: the United States Federal Government should eliminate at least all of the subsidies for offshore fisheries farms.<br />
Contention Three – Solvency –<br />
<br />
Aquaculture can’t make it without subsidies – the U.S. should eliminate aquaculture subsidies to fall in line with global agricultural subsidies reduction.<br />
Parravano, Mosness and Grader ‘4 [Pietro (President of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations the Institute for Fisheries Resources and former member of the Pew Oceans Commission); Anne (former Food and Society Policy Fellow with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and currently directs the “Go Wild Campaign” with the Institute for Agriculture &amp; Trade Policy); Zeke (Executive Director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations); “Fish Farmers and Fishermen”; The Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations; January; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pcffa.org/fn-jan04.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcffa.org/fn-jan04.htm</a></em> nick]<br />
The last issue to be considered in … stand on its own instead of feeding at the government trough.<br />
