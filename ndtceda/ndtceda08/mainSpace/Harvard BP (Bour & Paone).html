“...THE EYES OF THE WORLD NOW LOOK INTO SPACE, TO THE MOON AND TO THE PLANETS BEYOND, AND WE HAVE VOWED THAT WE SHALL NOT SEE IT GOVERNED BY A HOSTILE FLAG OF CONQUEST, BUT BY A BANNER OF FREEDOM... WE HAVE VOWED THAT WE SHALL NOT SEE SPACE FILLED WITH WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, BUT WITH INSTRUMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE... OUR OBLIGATIONS TO OURSELVES AS WELL AS OTHERS, ALL REQUIRE US TO MAKE THIS EFFORT, TO SOLVE THESE MYSTERIES, TO SOLVE THEM FOR THE GOOD OF ALL MEN”<br />
<br />
IN 1969, AMERICA LAUNCHED A ROCKET TO THE MOON, PROCLAIMING ITSELF TO BE TAKING ONE SMALL STEP FOR AMERICA, AND ONE GIANT LEAP FOR HUMANKIND.  <br />
<br />
NOW, ALMOST FORTY YEARS LATER, ANOTHER NATION.. IN ANOTHER PLACE.. IS SEEKING TO ENACT ITS OWN VISION OF SPACE-FARING MODERNITY.  THIS TIME AROUND THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION’S LANGUAGE WAS NOT SO EXUBERANT: <br />
&quot;IT'S UNFORTUNATE IRAN CONTINUES TO TEST BALLISTIC MISSILES. THIS REGIME CONTINUES TO TAKE STEPS THAT ONLY FURTHER ISOLATE IT AND THE IRANIAN PEOPLE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,&quot; SAYS A CHIEF WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON<br />
<br />
THE ABILITY FOR THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO JUMP FROM AN UNVERIFIED ROCKET LAUNCHING TO THE SPECTER OF IRANIAN MISSILE SHOWERS RELIES UPON A MATRIX OF ORIENTALIST ASSUMPTIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES OF SPEED, WHICH DEPLOY SUPPOSED ‘REAL-TIME’ IMAGES TO CODE ANY IRANIAN DEVELOPMENT AS A STEP TOWARDS GLOBAL WAR, WHILE OBSCURING THE DESTRUCTIVE CAPACITIES OF AMERICA’S ADVANCED ARSENAL OF SPEED. <br />
<br />
THE PRESENT ANXIETY SURROUNDING IRAN’S NUCLEAR CAPACITY SUGGESTS THAT KENNEDY’S CALL FOR AMERICAN GALACTIC SUPREMACY WAS NOT MERELY ABOUT MOON-ROCKS AND KOSMONAUTS, BUT THE DESIRE TO REALIZE AN ABSOLUTE VISUALITY OF THE EARTH - A GLOBAL DOMINATION OF SPACE/TIME BY THE HIGH-SPEED “INSTRUMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE,”  WHICH SEEKS TO CRIPPLE NATIONS LIKE IRAN THROUGH SURVEILLANCE AND THE CONSTANT THREAT OF IMMEDIATE MILITARY INTERVENTION.  <br />

“ The very long period of the supremacy of defence over offence... we have all been more often than not, consenting victims”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
IN THIS SOCIETY OF SPEED COMPLEX, INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS ARE REDUCED INTO EASILY MANAGEABLE CODES OF DATA; THUS, THE RESULT OF THE SPACE RACE HAS BEEN THE RACIALIZATION OF SPACE. <br />
<br />
NOWHERE IS THIS MORE EVIDENT THAN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN MEDIA COVERAGE OF IRAN -- <br />
THE 1979 OVERTHROW OF THE US-INSTALLED SHAH BROUGHT ABOUT A CRISIS IN THE AMERICAN POLITICAL IMAGINARY: HAD THE AMERICAN IMPERIALIST PROJECT FAILED? <br />
<br />
THE REVOLT NECESSITATED AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE, AND THE MEDIA PROVIDED PRECISELY THAT BY DEPICTING THE REVOLUTION  AS AN ERUPTION OF PRE-CODED FUNDAMENTALIST BARBARISM; THE INEVITABLE BACKLASH OF A SAVAGE PEOPLE. <br />
<br />
THIS AFFECTIVE ECONOMY OF REPRESENTATIONS CONTINUES TO MEDIATE BOTH THE GOVERNMENT’S AND OUR PERSONAL UNDERSTANDING OF “IRAN” AS SUCH.  RATHER THAN PROMOTING ENGAGEMENT, DROMOCRATIC MECHANISMS OF VISUALITY PREFIGURE IRAN AS AN EVIL SPECTACLE TO BE DESTROYED AT WILL. <br />

<br />
AND THE CLOCK TICKS FASTER..  <br />
COVERAGE OF IRAN REMAINS SATURATED WITH ANXIETY OVER THEIR SPEED: <br />
<br />
IN JANUARY, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN A NAVAL BATTLESHIP AND A MOTOR BOAT WAS TRANSFORMED INTO THE TREAT OF AN IRANIAN NAVAL PRESENCE. <br />
<br />
TODAY, THE LAUNCH OF A ROCKET ... HAS BECOME A FOCAL POINT FOR AIRING CONCERNS OVER IRANIAN NUCLEAR CAPABILITY. <br />
<br />
WITH EACH OF THESE EVENTS, THE WORLD MOVES CLOSER TO AN ALREADY DETERMINED REALITY. <br />
<br />
IN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY INSTANTIATED BY BUSH, POLITICS HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A COUNT-DOWN; AN AUTOMATED PREPARATION FOR WAR IN WHICH THE PURE SPEED OF EVENTS ERASES ANY MOMENT FOR CRITICAL REFLECTION,  LEAVING INSTEAD THE IMMANENT ARRIVAL OF TOTAL DESTRUCTION. <br />

[Scott , “ Pedagogy in a Time of Terror: Henry Giroux's Beyond the Spectacle of Terrorism.” Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies, 29:1, 111 - 135]<br />
 “Giroux’s central thesis is that the ... exception in which human ‘‘value’’ is largely defined by its degree of disposability.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THUS, TO DISRUPT, RATHER THAN ACCELERATE THE WHEELS OF AUTO-DESTRUCTION: <br />
<br />
THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN.  <br />
<br />
<br />
MORE THAN AN ASSENT TO DIPLOMATIC POLITICS AS USUAL -- THE PLAN DEMANDS A RADICAL RECONSIDERATION OF WHAT HAS COME TO BE AMERICA’S “NORMAL” AND NATURAL RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN.  IN THE FACE OF SO-CALLED EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF IRAN AS A TERRORIST SYMPATHIZING, ANTI-SEMITIC,  STATE OF VIOLENCE -- VOTING AFFIRMATIVE IS VOTING  NOT TO KNOW -- IT IS TO REJECT THE OPPOSITIONAL IMAGE OF IRAN PRODUCED BY CHRONO-POLITICS IN FAVOR OF A NEW SET OF POSSIBILITIES FOR DIALOGUE.  <br />
<br />
VOTING TO RESIST, RATHER THAN ADMONISH, THE TECHNO-STRATEGIC SPEED MACHINE, WHICH HAS DISCOUNTED AND ERASED THE POSSIBILITY FOR CRITICAL RESPONSE SINCE ITS INCEPTION,  ASSERTS DEBATE AS A COUNTER-SPACE FOR SO-CALLED NON-EXPERTS TO REFLECT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPEED, WEAPONS,  LANGUAGE, HISTORY, AND HUMANITY; TO PRODUCE OUR OWN CRITICALLY GROUNDED PROPOSALS, WHICH DEAUTHORIZE THE PARALYZING NARRATIVES DELIVERED TO US FROM THE SATELLITES ON HIGH. <br />
Derrida, did not take  place, 1984 [Jacques, “No Apocalypse, Not Now.” Diacritics 14(2): 20-31] <br />
Reason number two... reinvent invention or conceive of another &quot;pragmatics.&quot; <br />
<br />
THIS REORIENTATION OF OUR RELATIONSHIP TO DROMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND AMERICA’S RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN  IS NOT, AND CANNOT SIMPLY BE ABOUT DEPLOYING THE “TRUTH” AGAINST THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION’S LIES. <br />
<br />
THE FAILURE OF THE NIE TO DISSUADE BUSH AND MUCH OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC FROM THE WAR PATH SUGGEST THAT THIS CALL CANNOT BE GROUNDED PURELY IN INFORMATION, BUT INSTEAD MUST ADDRESS THE TECHNOLOGIES OF SPECTACLE THAT HAVE MADE PERPETUAL WAR AN AFFECTIVELY DESIRED EXPERIENCED.  AGAINST THE CALL TO AESTHETICIZE THE POLITICAL -- VOTING AFFIRMATIVE POLITICIZES BOTH AESTHETICS AND SPEED. <br />

AT: T - Normalization is Not a security guarantee<br />
1.    We Meet - normalization ends regime change, means war requires a formal declaration <br />
2.    Normalizing relations included guaranteeing the regime’s stability -- Here’s historical evidence that this is a security guarantee.   Joshua Spero, 1992,  “The Budapest-Prague-Warsaw triangle: Central European security after the Visegrad sumit, European Security, 1:1, 58-83. “On 21 January, Hungarian Defense Minister Lajos Fur... Western borders necessitated redeployment under both countries’ new defensive doctrines.” <br />
3.    Normalization of relations is a security guarantee to Iran, Flynn Leverett, 2007, testimony before the US house of reps, 11/7. www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/Flynt%20Leverett%20testimonyNovember07.htm “However, given the record of U.S.-Iranian tactical engagement since the late 1980s.... the core of what I describe as a “security guarantee”. <br />
4.    CI: Security guarantee should be defined contextually <br />
5.    Reasons to prefer: a) Context is key - the situation changes daily in the Middle East, and so the need for a security guarantee changes as well, b) Education - forces specific research into US relations with topic countries, leads to more in depth debate <br />
6.    Reasonability  <br />

Mutual understanding of the government and our relation to it is critical to interrogating the way in which essentialist foreign identities become salient in the national imaginary – their purely instrumental vision of policymaking evacuates the ethical leaving a violent will to dominate<br />

In this light, the Eisenhower administration’s decision to forcibly remove Mossadegh, and the current pursuit of preemption are both part of a process of confirming American identity.<br />
First – difference is effaced, demonized, and placed hostage. Then – in the name of completing our predestined goal of bringing “freedom” abroad; all opposition is violently erased.<br />
This totalizing view of the world as comprised of docile or complicit “friends” and “evil, inhuman” enemies provides the political and moral foundations for torture, mass slaughter, and preemptive warfighting.<br />

<strong>Harvard BP</strong> – 1AC outline.<br />
<br />
<strong>In 1978 a massive swell of “religious demonstrators” began turning out in record numbers to protest the oppressive rule of the Iranian Shah. Unlike previous instances the Shah’s secret police were unable to make the <u>multiplicity</u> voices simply “disappear.” The fierce riots came as a shock to the Carter administration, which had only months ago lauded Iran as an “island of stability.”</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The American media and political apparatus presented Iran’s political transition as an eruption of “fundamentalist” barbarism:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First, an ‘anti-American’ ‘religious fanatic,’ Ayatollah Komeini, was brought into power. Then, only months later, a group of extremists stormed the US embassy, taking 63 US diplomats hostage.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>When asked for the White House’s opinion on this situation, a senior administration official remarked: &quot;We're watching an earthquake, and there's nothing we can do about it.&quot;</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The media repeated this depiction of American innocence fallen victim to the natural disaster of political Islam Again and Again. The result an essentialized Iranian subject: heartless, militant, and locked in an eternal struggle with the True, Justice, and the American Way.</strong><br />
<strong>Said</strong>, Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities @ Columbia, 19<strong>97</strong><br />

“Iran continues …. were organizing a patriotic &quot;Unity Day.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>What many Americans may not have known was that the United States had been holding Iran hostage for nearly thirty years.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In 1951, under vague pretenses of oil security and anti-communism, the CIA joined with Great Britain’s secret service to replace Iran’s democratically elected leader, Mossadegh, with a puppet of the imperialist mission.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It’s one thing to dislike what a government is doing, but the drive to regime change represents a will to control – Because the Iranians could not comply with the demands of western driven modernization, the US took it upon itself to bring those values to Iran, with all of the violence and repression they entail.</strong><br />

“To elaborate on this chain of events… was literally unimaginable to most of the United States”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The shock at Iran’s rejection of Western modernization is indicative of the way these values framed the American response to the hostage crisis.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Rather than understanding the events as evidence of the failure of America’s attempt to impose its models upon the Other – the crisis was made to confirm xenophobic beliefs about Iran and the Middle East.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>This externalization of violent and irrationality onto the religious Iranian other is how modern imperialism purifies itself of criticism, concealing its violence.</strong><br />

<strong>First – difference is effaced, demonized and placed hostage to the American trajectory of historical progress</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Then – in the name of completing our predestined goal of bringing “freedom” abroad, difference is violently erased.</strong><br />
<strong>Burke</strong>, lecturer at Adelaide University School of History and Politics, 20<strong>07</strong><br />
[Anthony, <u>Beyond Security, Ethics and Violence:</u> <em>War against the Other</em>. pp.221 – 226]<br />
“It is certainly no accident that… we can be certain the author of freedom is not indifferent to the fate of freedom”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The US has kept Iran hostage to a narrative of imperialist violence for over fifty years. Sanctions, funding of insurgency groups, and inflammatory rhetoric have functioned to produce Iran as a figurative “demon” to many in the United States, while simultaneously creating a state of terror in Iran in which people are made to feel the US gun pointed at them may go off at any second.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>To shatter, rather than reaffirm, these violent attempts to impose the Same upon the Iranian Other:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The United States federal government should offer a guarantee to the government of Iran that the United States will not pursue regime change in Iran.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>More than a normative statement about American foreign policy, the plan represents a crucial act of <em>recognition</em>. By calling the dominant, essentializing narrative of American foreign policy with Iran into question, the plan destabilizes the ideological certitude by which the United States has been able to hold Iran captive to American interests for over half a century. Understanding knowledge about Iran as political, as opposed to scientific, debatable as opposed to set in stone, is critical to opening new modes of relating with Iran – the alternative is to kneel before the binary logic of the status quo where the only options involve the violent recourse to control, instrumentalism, and war.</strong><br />
<strong>Said</strong>, Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities @ Columbia, 19<strong>97</strong><br />
[Edward, Covering Islam: How the Media and Experts Determine how we see the rest of the World, pp. 170-173]<br />
“No one can know everything about the world we live in… By even the most sanguine of standards, this is not a pleasant possibility.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Status Quo depictions of the Middle East rely upon over-simplistic notions of identity, which are incapable of discussing difference except in terms of American self-interest. For this reason, the current approach to foreign policy means Iran can only be a compliant hostage or a necessary casualty.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The plan represents a critical contestation of the history which informs this current antagonism towards Iran – While the prolonged hostage “crisis” during the early 80s framed our understanding of “Iran,” it has functionally effaced the ongoing crisis felt by Iranians under the constant threat of US intervention into their affairs.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It’s time to let the Iranian people go.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>To vote affirmative is not to affirm a new, equally essentializing vision of Iran as our good friends – Rather – to put your ballot behind the 1AC is to acknowledge the need for an ethical relationship with Iran, which precedes a homogenizing, self-interested knowledge of whether or not they are “pro” or “anti” American.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>This affirmation of uncertainty is risky, but essential to demystifying the meta-narratives of order that permeate current discussion of the Middle East in America and prevent any recognition, much less violence, which is continually waged in our name.</strong><br />
<strong>Said</strong>, Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities @ Columbia, 19<strong>94</strong><br />
[Edward, <u>The Politics of Dispossession</u>, p. 353-356]<br />
“Thus terror emanates from any attempt to live beyond… No permission to narrate. Anything further you might wish to say or do is likely to become &quot;terrorism.&quot;
