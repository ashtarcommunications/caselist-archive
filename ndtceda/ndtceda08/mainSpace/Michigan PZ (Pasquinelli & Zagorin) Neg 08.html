<u>Track II CP</u><br />
The Government of Canada will start a track II process inducing and funding a prominent Canadian university to host an academic forum to address preventive military attacks on Iran, including attacks based on non verified allegations of Iranian military attacks. Members of the governments and militaries of the United States and Iran will be invited in unofficial capacity. The United States will use its presence at the conference to make clear an unofficial policy prohibiting the aforementioned attacks. The United States government should ban its nuclear first strike policy.<br />

Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) have menaced mankind…proliferation of WMD.<br />
Kritik<br />
The affirmative’s engagement with the leadership of a nation belies political power; all decisions are already determined as a function of the global standing reserve- anything counter to this will be excoriated to prevere the smooth integration of being.<br />
Andrew Mitchell, 2005, Heidegger and terrorism,, research in phenomenology 35, p. 181<br />
These three points of war…the leaders arc slaves.<br />
The standing reserve guarantees the circulation of raw materials that breaks down the oppoistionality of war and peace. They become simply different masks by which the standing-reserve gorges itself through the consumption beings. Everything is already incorporated as raw materials in this standing-reserve, every death is merely one more act of consumption, every civilian is transformed into a soldier by their consumption and in turn becomes another target to be consumed by terrorist violence<br />
Mitchell, 2005<br />
War and peace come to complete agreement and lose…the nature of being.<br />
The menace of total organization through the conversion of self to production-value renders existence meaningless<br />
Gianni Vattimo, 2004, nihilism and emancipation, p. 9-10<br />
The reasons for this slide…finds themselves occupying.<br />
Coalitions are inevitable – in the status quo the left is doomed precisely because of its reliance on homogenized notions of equality that are metaphysically flawed – only our challenge to current progressive coalitions causes them to reformulate a more successful strategy<br />
Vattimo, 2004<br />
What would the left be like if…too hastily to casting aside.<br />

Mitchell, 2005<br />
Like the atomic bomb…ever could be.<br />
If the affirmative approach to being the root cause, then only the alt can solve, withdrawal of being is what creates the constant threat of being destroyed<br />
Mitchell, 2005<br />
Terrorism will take place…of atomic war.<br />
Ontology outweighs<br />
Zimmerman, 1993<br />
Only the alternative can solve the underlying cause of their harm<br />

<br />
The 1AC is another chapter in the fiction of US engagement with Iran that continues the myth of a substantive relationship between the two nations. The notion of Iran as a threat is a cultural text constructed through symbolic acts of demonization that perpetuates mutual emnity<br />
William O. <strong><u>Beeman</u></strong>, Professor of Linguistic Anthropology at Brown University “Iran and the United States: Postmodern Culture Conflict in Action” <a name="top"></a><em>Anthropological Quarterly</em> 76.4 (200<strong><u>3</u></strong>) 671-691<br />
The affirmative’s attempt to know Iran in relations to US interests is the essence of this discourse of mutual emnity. This discourse permeates the very mechanism of diplomatic negotiations between the US and Iran which are infused with a colonial discourse of Westphalian statecraft. The discrepancies created by these conflicting cultural narratives guarantee diplomatic failure<br />
William O. <strong><u>Beeman</u></strong>, Professor of Linguistic Anthropology at Brown University “Iran and the United States: Postmodern Culture Conflict in Action” <em>Anthropological Quarterly</em> 76.4 (200<strong><u>3</u></strong>) 671-691<br />
Locating Iran within the coordinates of an externalized threat makes aggression a necessary condition of our relationship with them and legitimizes warfare against the omnipresent invisible threat of the Other<br />
Slavoj <strong><u>Žižek</u></strong>, senior researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities, “Give Iranian Nukes a Chance” In These Times, August 11, 200<strong><u>5</u></strong><br />

Case O/W<br />
Their authors are epistemically biased by Western values that seek to define Iran as pursuing similar notions of hegemony as the United States. The reality is that Iran has not started a war in over two centuries- attributing malevolent interests to Iran can only paper over the American imperial role in facilitating terror and instability in the Middle East<br />
