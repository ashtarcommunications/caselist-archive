FRAMEWORK:<br />
Totalizing nature of their Middle East indicts matters – the role of the ballot should be to encourage debate over specific examples [claims of ethnocentrism exaggerated]<br />
Teitelbaum and Litvak 2006 “Students, Teachers, and Edward Said: Taking Stock of Orientalism” Middle East Review of International Affairs <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2493" rel="nofollow">__www.campus-watch.org/article /id/2493__</a><br />
The critics did not deny that Western culture … fearful of developing an opinion of their own.<br />
Reject their authors – they lack empirical rigor and are engaging in intellectual censorship<br />
Warraq 2003 “Orientalism” Wall Street Journal 9/29<br />
Those truths aside, Mr. Said, who died … Western salons, and Western applause.<br />
They can’t indict our authors with charges of Orientalism – Arab critiques prove their K is garbage<br />
Bernard Lewis <em>Islam and the West</em> 1994 pg. 116-117<br />
Some help in answering this question may be found … distorted, that others make of us.<br />
Scholarship should be judged on its academic merit – forgoing empiricism opens us to lazy political manipulation<br />
Jonah Goldberg National Review 2-4-02<br />
In a recent column … bully scholarly dissenters into silence.<br />
Rejecting prediction in decisionmaking in favor of uncertainty will destroy policymaking and increase reliance on preconceived ideologies – like in Iraq<br />
Michael Fitzsimmons 2007 “The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning” Survival Winter 06-07<br />
Finally, the planning for post-war operations … rigidity in planning rather than flexibility.<br />
Orientalism can’t sustain a critique of epistemology – it misses the entire purpose of scholarship<br />
Bernard Lewis 1994 <em>Islam and the West</em> p 108-9<br />
To prove his thesis, Mr. Said rearranges … Chinese, American, or African languages” (p. 98).<br />
Said links to his own criticism<br />
James Cliford 1980 “Review: [Untitled]” History and Theory: Vol 19 No 2<br />
Discourse analysis is always, in a sense, unfair to authors … rejects as an alternative to Orientalism.<br />
Privileging the Orient ignores other oppressed groups<br />
Fred Halliday 1993 British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies 20:2 “Orientalism and its Critics”<br />
Secondly, the category of the ‘Orient’ is rather … and the West find it convenient to sustain.<br />
Even if we can’t make predictions with certainty we can get close and scenario planning is key to responsible choices<br />
Kurasawa 2004 Constellations Volume 11 No 4<br />
A radically postmodern line of thinking, for instance … preventive action on the global stage.<br />

1. Iran will pocket concession –<br />
a. regime ideology means cheating is inevitable<br />
Kurtz 06 (“Doves Fly Toward Iran” 11/13, lexis)<br />
“Increasingly, it looks as though the United… So it behooves us to give some thought to the prospects for a deal.”<br />
<br />
b. its existing approach to EU negotiations proves<br />
Dueck and Takeyh 07 (“Irans Nuclear Challenge,” Political Science Quarterly, Volume 122, pgs. 189 – 206)<br />
“The concept of engagement through integration… well pre-dates the current administration.”<br />
<br />
2. Negotiations overlook the basic character of the Iranian regime – it is hostile and will find ways to ignore US gestures and respond with terrorism<br />
Ledeen 07 (“Talking to Iran,” Wall Street Journal, 8/20)<br />
<br />
3. Factionalism blocks solvency – nobody has the authority to negotiate<br />
Rubin 06 (“The US and Iran – What’s Next?” 4/6, lexis)<br />
“Mr. Cirincione: I think it’s been effective in giving us… within the Iranian government end up blowing up in our face.”<br />
<br />
4. Only hardline factions benefit from engagement<br />
Rubin 06 (The Wall Street Journal, “Nuclear Hostage Crisis,” 4/14)<br />
<br />
5. Turn – delay –<br />
a. further negotiations buy time to complete the nuclear program<br />
Gerecht 07 (“Dangerous Illusions; Peace-processing our way to disaster,” 6/11)<br />
<br />
b. This allows Iran to consolidate a global alliance with North Korea and risks global nuclear war<br />
Darr 06 (American Chronicle, “Setting the Stage for World War III”)<br />
“There are numerous parallels between the now forming… total war or total surrender.”<br />

<strong>Iran moderates</strong><br />
A power struggle is being waged over the nuclear issue – Ahmadinejad will lose standing with Khamenei because he looks unreasonable on the nuclear issue.<br />
Tony Karon. Senior Editor at Time. “Dual Power in Tehran?”. 10/24/2007. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atlanticfreepress.com/content/view/2684/81/" rel="nofollow">__http://www.atlanticfreepress .com/content/view/2684/81/__</a><br />
“The resignation of Ali Larijani…Ahmadinejad to gain greater control of decision-making.”<br />

Washington Post. 1/28/2007. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=17959&amp;prog=zgp,zru&amp;proj=zme" rel="nofollow">__http://www.carnegieendowment .org/publications/index.cfm?fa �14�view&amp;id�15�17959&amp;prog=zgp,zru &amp;proj=zme__</a>.<br />
“On the surface, the regime in Tehran…that confrontational policies reap rewards.”<br />
<br />
<br />
That shores up Ahmadinejad’s standing with Khamenei, boosting his ability to win the direction of Iranian policy.<br />

“ARMAGEDDON Could This Be the Start…yield, triggering a major regional war.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Israel</strong><br />
Israel doesn’t trust diplomacy with Iran but will go along because the US has still left the option of force on the table – giving a security guarantee would trigger Israel to take matters into their own hands and attack – they have the capacity and the willpower.<br />
Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Leslie Sussern. “Iran: Weighing the Options”. 4/21/2006. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ijn.com/archive2006+arch/042106.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.ijn.com/archive2006 %20arch/042106.htm__</a>.<br />
“JERUSALEM – Though hardly unexpected, Iran’s…nuclear weapons’ plans back by several years, he declared.”<br />
That would cause World War 3.<br />
Leonid Ivashov. Analyst at the Strategic Culture Foundation. “Iran: The Threat of a Nuclear War”. 4/21/2007. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.megachip.info/modules.php?name=Sections&amp;op=viewarticle&amp;artid=3871" rel="nofollow">__http://www.megachip.info /modules.php?name=Sections&amp;op �16�viewarticle&amp;artid�17�3871__</a>.<br />
“What might cause the force…much more nightmarish that WWII.”<br />
<strong>CP</strong><br />
Text: the United States federal government should offer the Islamic Republic of Iran a plan to transition responsibility for Camp Ashraf to the International Committee of the Read Cross in exchange for Iran reigning in its support for Sadrist militias in Iraq.<br />
The counterplan solves – removing Camp Ashraf from us control is an incentive to Iran but gives up nothing from the Us side. It creates momentum for negotiation on other issues<br />

Developing a modus … leading Sunni states.<br />
The counterplan creates an incremental approach to engagement –this overrides ideological objections<br />
Ibid.<br />
The centrality of Iran … temptations of ideology.<br />
The counterplan is consistent with Iran’s tit for tat approach to diplomacy.<br />
