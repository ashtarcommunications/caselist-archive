Text: The Executive Branch of the United States should not proceed with plan to lease areas in the Atlantic and Pacific waters for oil and natural gas drilling. The state governments of Alabama, Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington should adopt Coastal Management Plans that prohibit open ocean aquaculture. All relevant courts in the United States should hold that subsidized open ocean aquaculture is in violation of the Coastal Zone Management Act’s Section 307 consistency provision on the basis of all relevant Coastal Management Plans.<br />
<br />
States can de facto ban activities that receive federal subsidies through CZMPs<br />
