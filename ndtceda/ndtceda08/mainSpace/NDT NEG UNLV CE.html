<span style="font-family: Cooper Black;">Tabloid Journalism K</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The 1ac engages in a form of truth-telling similar to tabloid journalism that oversimplifies scenarios of political catastrophes and relies on the rhetoric of security war and terror to justify the continued supremacy of our hegemonic activities<br />
Francois Debrix 2k7 Working Paper Series No. 25 “The Hegemony of Tabloid Geopolitics: How America and the West Cannot Think International Relations beyond Conflict, Identity and Cultural Imposition.”<br />
“For more than a decade now….a new imperative global mission.”<br />
Public Intellectuals engage in tabloid geopolitics by trumping the importance of security and stability – This constrains who is a legitimate actor and speaker in the public sphere and silences voices of dissent, ultimately allowing for their abjection and extermination.<br />

<strong>Your focus on black identity institutionalizes a politics of difference that trades on race, exaggerating the level of racism and contributing to unnecessary racial tension on college campuses. These strategies legitimize the use of race as a source of power. Just another side of the racist coin, your argument encourages everyone to avoid discussions of race altogether.</strong><br />

<strong>The Search for white redemption leads to policies encourages society to find quick-fix solutions that give the appearance of innocence for racism. This tradesoff with programs and policies that actually further community upliftment and development. Making decisions in order to assuage a sense of white guilt ensure that real needs of the community are secondary considerations to the quest for appearance of innocence.</strong><br />

<strong>The Combination of capitalist modes of production and competition with an intensification of informatic stimuli made possible by digital networks has produced a new economic order- semiotic capitalism- that cannot be understood by current theories of economics.
