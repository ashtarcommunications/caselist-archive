CONTENTION ONE: OFF WITH THEIR HEADS<br />
<br />
Quirin considered the 8th amendment and ruled in favor of the death penalty<br />
Suzanne Kelly Babb, J.D. @ University of California Hastings College of the Law, August 2003, Hastings Law Journal, 54 Hastings L.J. 1721<br />
“Yet, crimes committed under… order to impose the death penalty”<br />
<br />
The Bush Administration cites Quirin as the authority for military tribunal sentences – these include the death penalty<br />
Daryl Mundis, Legal Officer of International Law @ the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, April 2002, American Journal of International Law<br />
“Although the evidentiary and procedural… habeas corpus proceeding”<br />
<br />
The possibility that the U.S. could execute terrorist suspects will continue to strain cooperation and undermine the war on terrorism – European allies wouldn’t even extradite Bin Laden if they caught him<br />
Tung Yin Tung, Associate Professor @ the University of Iowa College of Law, Fall 2003, Alabama Law Review<br />
“As hard as this scenario might… United States and its allies will continue”<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE: THE SUM OF ALL FEARS<br />
Retaining the death penalty for terrorism suspects undermines multilateral support for the war on terrorism – this support is to critical to stop terrorist attacks<br />
Thomas McDonnell, Professor of Law @ Pace University School of Law, 2004, 37 Vand. J. Transnat'l L. 353<br />
“September 11 changed the political… not apply even in wartime”<br />
<br />
The death penalty encourages terrorists to die in combat rather than surrender<br />
Thomas McDonnell, Professor of Law @ Pace University School of Law, 2004, 37 Vand. J. Transnat'l L. 353<br />
“If individuals associated with al Qaeda… rather than to go quietly”<br />
<br />
Executing terrorism suspects would trigger escalating cycles of reprisal, alienate allies, inflame Muslim opposition to the U.S., and produces martyrs and public support for Al Qaeda – this makes terrorism inevitable<br />
Thomas McDonnell, Professor of Law @ Pace University School of Law, 2004, 37 Vand. J. Transnat'l L. 353<br />
“The nature of the organization suggests… Muslim world for acts of terrorism”<br />
<br />
The next terrorist attack will be nuclear – this probability outweighs all others<br />
William Perry, Professor in the Department of Management Science and Engineering @ Stanford University &amp; Served as the U.S. Secretary of Defense from 1994 to 1997, Nov/Dec 2001, Foreign Affairs<br />
“Nuclear or biological weapons… killed an estimated 200,000 people”<br />
<br />
A nuclear terrorist attack against the United States would destroy the economy, destroy hegemony, and cause nuclear wars with Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea<br />
Jerome Corsi, Ph.D. in Political Science from Harvard, 2005, Atomic Iran, Pg. 176-178<br />
“In the span of less than one hour… still capable of exacting revenge”<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO: IN THE BELLY OF THE BEAST<br />
The Supreme Court must rule that the death penalty violates the eighth amendment to salvage its constitutional power, preserve separation of powers, retain democracy, and prevent tyranny – any other actor destroys both democracy and the power of the court<br />
Matthew E. Albers, J.D. @ Case Western, Winter 1999, Case Western Reserve University, 50 Case W. Res. 467<br />
&quot;The interpretation of the laws is the proper… authority to decide constitutional issues”<br />
<br />
SOP is key to the economy<br />
Dru Stevenson, Assistant Professor, South Texas College of Law (Houston), March 2005, Cardozo Law Review, 26 Cardozo L. Rev. 1535<br />
“This is similar… checks-and-balances discussions”<br />
<br />
The U.S. economy is key to the world economy<br />
Lawrence H. Summers, President at Harvard University, July 2004, Foreign Policy, America Overdrawn<br />
“Some of what I observed… soon be the world's problem”<br />
<br />
Economy collapse leads to extinction<br />
T.E. Bearden, Lieutenant Corporal in the US Army and Director of the Association of Distinguished Scientists, 6-12-00, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cheniere.org/references/zpepatent.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheniere.org/references/zpepatent.htm</a><br />
“Just prior to the terrible collapse… modified version of it, resulting”<br />
<br />
And, ruling on eighth amendment grounds is critical to end judicial deference over sentencing – the impact is an infinite expansion of federal and state power to inflict unjust criminal sentences including the death penalty<br />
Matthew E. Albers, J.D. @ Case Western, Winter 1999, Case Western Reserve University, 50 Case W. Res. 467<br />
&quot;It is emphatically the province… for first-time narcotics offenses”<br />
<br />
Justice in the death penalty is critical to justice overall – this corruption spread throughout the system<br />
Craig Haney, Professor of Psychology @ UC Santa Cruz, 2005, Death by Design: Capital Punishment as a Social Psychological System, Pg. 241-242<br />
“The death penalty stands as a symbol…will we make elsewhere?”<br />
<br />
Justice outweighs all their disads – this principle cannot be compromised<br />
John Rawls, Philosopher, 1971, A Theory of Justice, Pg. 3-4<br />
“Justice is the first virtue of social…justice are uncompromising”<br />
<br />
PLAN: THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD HOLD THAT MILITARY COMMISSIONS ARE NOT LAWFULLY CONSTITUTED BECAUSE THEIR AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY VIOLATES THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. WE’LL CLARIFY.<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: AMNESTY<br />
Quirin should be overturned – it was a prosecution designed to get the death penalty<br />
Michal R. Belknap et al, 2005, Amici are legal scholars and historians—Michal R. Belknap, David J. Danelski, Peter Irons, and Pierce O’Donnell—each of whom has studied, written, and published on the Court’s decision in Ex parte Quirin, BRIEF OF LEGAL SCHOLARS AND HISTORIANS AS AMICI CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER [Effect of Quirin], www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/nkk/documents/Hamdanv.Rumsfeld.quirinhist.pdf<br />
“C. Quirin is a Poisoned Precedent…constitutional issues presented in this case”<br />
<br />
Only the Supreme Court solves – no other actor can change death penalty jurisprudence and culture as effectively<br />
Craig Haney, Professor of Psychology @ UC Santa Cruz, 2005, Death by Design: Capital Punishment as a Social Psychological System, Pg. 241-242<br />
“To make this nexus a bit clearer…function that it performs nonetheless”<br />
<br />
Just having death penalty laws on the books is enough to undermine extradition<br />
Amnesty International, 11-29-01, “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA No return to execution -The US death penalty as a barrier to extradition,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR511712001" rel="nofollow">http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR511712001</a><br />
“The mere presence of the death penalty… an absolute guarantee be given”
