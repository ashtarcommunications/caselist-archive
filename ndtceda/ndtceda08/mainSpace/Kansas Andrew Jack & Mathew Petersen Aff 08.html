 Contention 1: Inherency <br />
first, the bush administration is pursuing a policy regime change now. <br />
The Bush administration… officials in the murder. <br />
<br />
Israel and Syria are ready to strike a deal over the golan – only u.s. pressure stops it. <br />
Israel has reaffirmed… is stuck for the time being.'&quot; <br />
<br />
Thus the plan: The united states federal government should OFFER AN ASSURANCE TO THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT THAT IT WILL NOT CHALLENGE OR REMOVE THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT’S LEADERSHIP as well as promoting negotiations for the return of the golan heights on the condition that syria moderate Hezbollah by affirming the right of Hezbollah parties to seek office in Lebanon. <br />
<br />
Contention 2 is solvency: <br />
The u.s. should abandon regime change for a policy of engagement that conditions it on syrian moderation of hizbullah. <br />
Colonel Robert Meeks, U.S. Army, and Michael Crutcher, professor U.S. Army College. 2006. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil425.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil425.pdf</a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <br />
Syrian support to the insurgency… further spread of radical Islam and terror. <br />
<br />
Assad wants a deal with the golan in favor of U.s. engagement. the old guard will not block a deal. <br />
Simon and Stevenson 4 [Steven, Senior Analyst at the Rand Corporation, and Jonathan, Senior Fellow for Counterterrorism at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, May-June 2004, Foreign Affairs, Lexis] <br />
During the last round… of Syria's domination of Lebanon. <br />
<br />
The plan is the only way to solve – only a security guarantee that the US will not seek regime change will alter Syria’s actions <br />
Kessler, 2k7. Middle East Policy, Summer, 2007, p. l/n <br />
Finally, I'd like to make a few points.. on the border up until now. <br />
<br />
And, We should engage Syria by ending Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights - Syria would be ACCOMMODATING and lead to Arab-Israeli peace - Only engagement solves <br />
Joshua Landis in ‘6. The United States Engage Syria? A Saban Center Policy Forum Debate,' <br />
Syria's obstructionist behavior… reform and democratization. <br />
<br />
constructive engagement with syria is k—assad is only as bad as we’ve made him <br />

Administration officials insist that engaging… and constructive engagement. <br />
Administration officials are increasingly… behind much of what troubles the region.  <br />
<br />
golan has little strategic importance and water isn’t an issue for israel—no reason to maintian <br />
Cristiani 7,Dario. “The Complexities surrounding Syria-Israel Negotiations” <br />

<br />
Advantage 1 is Russia <br />
RUssia is increasing its allaince with Syria and rebuilding its naval power which crushes the u.s. 6th fleet. <br />

<br />
Failure to engage Syria leads to russia bases. <br />

Ed Blanche, “Back to the Future” The Middle East, Ebsco. October 2007 <br />
That is undoubtedly something… the US-Russian divide&quot;. <br />

ENgagement with syria would end russia’s influence in syria. <br />

In the post-Soviet era… American-led intervention against his regime. <br />

First, U.s. naval supremecy in the meditereanean is critical to stability. <br />

<br />
<br />
Syria will use the new bases to obtain russian iskander missles. <br />

Thirdly, while deploying a naval… against Israel's military superiority <br />
<br />
That will embolden Syria and lead to war with Israel. <br />

<br />
and, arab-israeli war goes nuclear—causes extinction <br />
Adams in 6 “Is Iran Trying To Start World War Three?.” <br />
The focus of the provocations… the associated nuclear holocaust. <br />
<br />
Lastly, RUSSIA IS USING THEIR INFLUENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO generate instability – jacking the us economy and making war inevitable <br />

Iran and Syria may be militarily weak… powers that seek to exploit trouble.  <br />
<br />
Advantage 2 is Lebanon <br />
Lebanon is at a cross-road – now is the time to establish stability. <br />
Khalaf<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>3/7; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=5&amp;article_id=89649" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=5&amp;article_id=89649</a> <br />
We are at a fateful crossroad… can begin to consider negotiation. <br />
<br />
Lebanon is on the brink of instability – us engagement with syria must occur. <br />
