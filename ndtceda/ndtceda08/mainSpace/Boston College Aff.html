Contention 1: Inherency<br />
<br />
First, the majority’s holding in Morrison states that Congress may regulate any act that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce<br />
Vanessa Voltz, UGA Law Student and Editor of the ACS Blog, American Constitution Society for Law and Policy, October 4, 2004, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.acsblog.org/equal-protection-and-due-process-372-in-clarence-thomas-america-civil-rights-legislation-is-in-jeopardy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.acsblog.org/equal-protection-and-due-process-372-in-clarence-thomas-america-civil-rights-legislation-is-in-jeopardy.html</a><br />
“According to” and “Thomas disagrees”<br />
<br />
Despite supposed limits on federal power, the Raich case used the substantial effects test upheld in Morrison to increase federal power under the Commerce Clause<br />
William J. Watkins, Jr., Research Fellow at The Independent Institute, Chronicles Magazine, August 2, 2005, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1545" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1545</a><br />
“In the last ten years” and “without meaningful limitation”<br />
<br />
The Advantage: Federalism<br />
<br />
Morrison did not limit federal power - by upholding the substantial effects test, Morrison allows unchecked federal power – only by scaling back the Commerce Clause can the Court prevent complete federal tyranny<br />

Russian Collapse results in Nuclear war<br />
Steven David, Professor of Political Science at The Johns Hopkins University, Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb, 1999<br />
“Should Russia succumb to internal war” and “a Russian civil war.”<br />
<br />
Ergo the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) by replacing the substantial effects test with the structural necessity test when reviewing federal legislation under the Commerce Clause. We reserve the right to clarify intent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 2: Solvency<br />
<br />
The structural necessity asks if the states can solve the problem on their own – only if they cannot can the federal government act<br />
Bradley A. Harsch, Associate, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Seton Hall Law Review, 31 Seton Hall L. Rev. 983, Finding a Sound Commerce Clause Doctrine: Time to Evaluate the Structural Necessity of Federal Legislation, 2001, p.Lexis<br />
“Put simply, it is the position” and “should be left to the states.”<br />
<br />
Structural necessity test would solve for federalism<br />
Bradley A. Harsch, Associate, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Seton Hall Law Review, 31 Seton Hall L. Rev. 983, Finding a Sound Commerce Clause Doctrine: Time to Evaluate the Structural Necessity of Federal Legislation, 2001, p.Lexis<br />
“A structural necessity inquiry” and “convenient to do so.”<br />
<br />
Rejecting the substantial effects test is critical to restore a stable meaning to the Commerce Clause<br />
Clarence Thomas, US Supreme Court Justice, “Abandoning the Limits of Federal Power”, Cato Policy Report, July 1, 2005, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/research/articles/thomas-050701.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/research/articles/thomas-050701.html</a><br />
“One searches the” and “to regulating interstate commerce.”<br />
<br />
Courts would be best to solve federalism through the structural necessity test – sends a critical signal to Congress<br />
Bradley A. Harsch, Associate, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Seton Hall Law Review, 31 Seton Hall L. Rev. 983, Finding a Sound Commerce Clause Doctrine: Time to Evaluate the Structural Necessity of Federal Legislation, 2001, p.Lexis<br />
“In Lopez, Justices Kennedy and O'Connor” and “perform the difficult analyses.”<br />
<br />
Finally, extending the Court enforcement of federalism is critical to continued consolidation of international federalism<br />
Steven G. Calabresi , Professor of Constitutional Law, Formerly Law Clerk, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Court of Appeals Judge Robert H. Bork, and Ralph K. Winter, and Served in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, December 1995 (&quot;A Government of Limited and Enumerated Powers: In Defense of United States v. Lopez&quot; – Michigan Law Review) p. lexis<br />
“But, it would be a very good” and “importance of what is at stake.”<br />

<br />
Contention I: Inherency<br />
<br />
<br />
In Ex parte Quirin, the Supreme Court ruled that military commissions were legal according to the international laws of war.<br />
<br />
Sarah Cleveland, Yale Journal of International Law, Winter 2006, p. 23<br />
In response to the Supreme Court ruling in Hamdan which invalidated military commissions because they lacked congressional authorization, the US Congress has now acted and passed legislation to allow military trials to go forward which do not comply with the Geneva Convention.<br />
Malcolm Fraser, The Age, October 9, 2006, pfactiva<br />
Thus we offer the following plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex parte Quirin (317 U.S. 1 (1942) on the grounds that military commissions violate the Geneva conventions and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Terrorism<br />
<br />
Using military commissions will undermine cooperation with our allies and incite our enemies, increasing the risk of terrorism<br />
<br />
Jennifer Trahan, Houston Journal of International Law, Spring 2002, p. 494-6<br />
Terrorists are seeking to acquire and use nuclear weapons.<br />
Matthew Morgan, Parameters, Spring 2004, p. 41.<br />
Nuclear terrorism will cause global nuclear war, leading to extinction.<br />
Mohamed Sid-Ahmed, Al-Ahram online, August 26, 2004, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm</a><br />
<br />
Contention Three: US Human Rights Leadership<br />
<br />
<br />
First, by using military commission, the United States will be perceived as a hypocrite when it comes to the observance of human rights norms because it has vehemently criticized other countries for employing the same types of military tribunals.<br />
<br />
Gerard Fogarty, Parameters, October 1, 2005, p. 54factiva<br />
<br />
<br />
Promoting double standards erodes US human rights and soft power leadership.<br />
Harold Hongju Koh, American Exceptionalism and Human Rights, ed. By M. Ignatieff, p. 118.<br />
<br />
US soft power is key to preventing global problems like climate change, infectious diseases, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.<br />
<br />
Joseph Nye, Christian Science Monitor, April 24, 2004, p. 9<br />
<br />
WMD proliferation and global warming risk global extinction.<br />
<br />
J. Martin Rochester, Between Peril and Promise: The Politics of International Law, 2006, p. 7-8<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Violating the Geneva Convention by staging unfair military commission trials will undermine US Democracy promotion.<br />
<br />
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, August 14, 2006, p. A10<br />
<br />
Democracy prevents major wars, terrorism, mass killings, and economic decline.<br />
<br />
John Norton Moore, United States Institute of Peace, Advancing Human Rights and Peace in a Complex World, 2002, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usip.org/pubs/specialreports/sr86.html#pursuing" rel="nofollow">http://www.usip.org/pubs/specialreports/sr86.html#pursuing</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Second, by not incorporating international human rights norms into US domestic laws, the US Supreme Court is undermining its legitimacy as a leader in promoting global human rights protections, which weakens the global human rights regime.<br />
<br />
Josh Hsu, New Mexico Law Review, Winter 2006, p. 97-98<br />
<br />
Weakening international human rights laws will increase genocide and kill millions.<br />
<br />
Paul Hoffman, Human Rights Quarterly, November, p. 933-934<br />
<br />
Contention IV: Solvency<br />
<br />
The Quirin decision is now outdated as it predates the Geneva Convention, the ICCPR, and the evolution of customary international human rights norms requiring that persons receive impartial and fair trials. Military Commissions flagrantly violate existing international human rights laws.<br />
<br />
Laura Dickinson, Southern California Law Review, September, p. 1429-1431<br />
<br />
Trying unlawful combatants in civilian or courts-martial will be perceived as fair and credible justice.<br />
<br />
Harold Koh, American Journal of International Law, April, p. 344<br />
<br />
The supposed practical advantages for using military commissions over civil courts are empirically denied by the successful prosecution of terrorists and organized crime in federal courts.<br />
<br />
Jennifer Trahan, Houston Journal of International Law, Spring 2002, p. 493-4.<br />
<br />
<br />
US Supreme Court incorporation of international human rights law is the key to bolstering the global human rights regime<br />
<br />
