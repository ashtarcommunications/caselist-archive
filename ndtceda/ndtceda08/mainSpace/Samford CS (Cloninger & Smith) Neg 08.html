T Violations:<br />
T—Must be QPQ<br />
Chester A. Crocker Fall 1989, (Former Assistant Secretary for African Affairs at the Department of State, Foreign Affairs, p. 144, “Southern Africa: Eight Years Later”)<br />
Regarding South Africa…fundamental internal change.<br />
Constructive engagement is a conditional reward designed to facilitate specific changes in a country—prefer our evidence it is contextualized to constructive engagement in the Middle East:<br />
Gary C. Gambill, editor - Middle East Intelligence Bulletin, April 2003 (5:4), “The<br />
American-Syrian Crisis and the End of Constructive engagement”<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.meib.org/articles/0304_s1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.meib.org/articles/0304_s1.htm</a><br />
Until last month… historical reasons.<br />
T—Can’t be QPQ<br />
Constructive engagement isn’t a quid pro quo—China proves:<br />
ALLEN KELLER, 1997 (M.D., PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, HEARING BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITEE ON INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, OCTOBER 28, 1997)<br />
Physicians for Human Rights… World Trade Organization.<br />
T-Foreign assistance<br />
A) Negative interpretation: Foreign assistance is economic, military, technical, or financial aid, given with conditions:<br />
Columbia Encyclopedia in 2K7<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/Foreign+assistance" rel="nofollow">http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/Foreign+assistance</a><br />
Foreign aid, economic, military, technical... with the aid from the donor nation.<br />
<br />
T—Government of<br />
A) Negative Interp: Government-to-government assistance is given bilaterally from one diplomatically recognized governing authority to another.<br />
<br />
Plano in 73 (Jack, Professor of Political Science at Western Michigan University, 1973, POLITICAL SCIENCE DICTIONARY, p.174)<br />
Government. The political and administrative hierarchy… recognition by other states.<br />
Cambodia proves that aid to NGOs is different from government-to government assistance.<br />
<br />
Robertson in 97<br />
Phil Robertson, Social Change and Development Program, Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Dec. 97 (Phil, In Focus: Cambodia Volume 2, Number 52. Foreign Policy-In Focus website, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.irc-online.org/" rel="nofollow">www.irc-online.org</a>)<br />
<br />
Foreign aid is one of the few sources of leverage… have been met.<br />
T—Include<br />
1) Constructive engagement goes beyond a simple promised action to a process of dialogue or reciprocal action<br />
Fuqua in 2K5<br />
Jacques Fuqua, East Asian Studies Center, Indiana University, 2005 (EASC Newsletter, May 2005,<br />
Constructive engagement requires some combination… of the Six Party Talks.<br />
2) “Include” means that security guarantee or foreign assistance are only part of constructive engagement.<br />
Oxford English Dictionary in 89 2d edition, 1989 online edition from University database<br />
2. To contain, comprise, embrace…. to comprise; to comprehend<br />
<br />
<br />
T--Its<br />
A) Negative Interpretation: Its means US constructive engagement:<br />
Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, 1993 (pg. 623) its… or object of an action.<br />
T—Offer Only<br />
A) Negative interpretation: An “offer” is a proposal or promise upon which the other party has the power to accept or deny—the target country must be able to say “no thanks”<br />
Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law, 2007<br />
1 : a proposal…see also REVOKE, TENDER OFFER<br />
T-Security Guarantee<br />
A) Negative interpretation: A security guarantee is a commitment not to use force or change the form of government of a nation<br />
Flynt Leverett, 2006 (senior fellow @ New America Foundation Dealing with Tehran: Assessing U.S. Diplomatic Options toward Iran<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tcf.org/publications/internationalaffairs/leverett_diplomatic.pdf%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.tcf.org/publications/internationalaffairs/leverett_diplomatic.pdf)</a><br />
As part of a strategic… of a U.S. security guarantee.27)<br />
T-substantially<br />
A) Negative Interpretation: Substantially means in all essential characteristics:<br />
Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Ed., 89, Vol. 19, 68. “Substantially... to all intent and purposes; in the main.”<br />
B) Violation: Foreign assistance is development, humanitarian and security assistance—they don’t give all three kinds:<br />
Free Dictionary in 2K7<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Foreign+assistance" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Foreign+assistance</a><br />
Foreign assistance…security assistance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kritiks:<br />
Development Discourse<br />
A. Link and Implication:<br />
The discourse of development proposed by the affirmative masks forms of developmental power -- legitimates pushing entire populations to extinction in the name of economic development<br />
Escobar ’95 (Arturo, Professor of Anthropology at UC Berkeley, “Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World”, 1995, pg. 52)<br />
At times…challenged or displaced<br />
B. Alternative<br />
Critical opposition key to unmasking the hegemony of Western development<br />
Robins ’03 (Steven, Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology at the University of Stellenbosch, “Whose Modernity? Indigenous Modernities and Land Claims after Apartheid”, p. 267)<br />
Modernization theorists…regime of truth<br />
Disease Rhetoric K<br />
A. Representations of disease as a threat against life are mobilized to justify the desires of the sovereign—the affirmative’s representations enable biopolitical control<br />
Thacker ’05 [<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://culturemachine.tees.ac.uk/Articles/thacker.htm" rel="nofollow">http://culturemachine.tees.ac.uk/Articles/thacker.htm</a>, Eugene Thacker, Nomos, nosos and bios in the body politic, Last modified 3/7/5]<br />
In a sense, however, this biopolitical situation… sovereignty in the age of biopolitics.<br />
<br />
And, virus narratives stabilize western conceptions of the self by juxtapositioning it with colonialist stereotypes of the unclean, disease ridden other<br />
Schell ’97 [Heather, Outburst! A Chilling Story About Emerging Virus Narratives and Pandemic Social Change Configurations 5.1, pp. 93-133), google cache, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/configurations/v005/5.1schell.html" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/configurations/v005/5.1schell.html</a> ]<br />
The virus narratives react… did not travel in those days. [End Page 115]<br />
B. The Implications<br />
1. The affirmative’s framing of the harms predetermines the evaluations and solutions that will result—our critique functions as a 100% take-out of their epistemology, and therefore their case, which justifies a negative ballot<br />
Bass ’98 [Jeff D., QJS, 84, 430-447, Ebsco, Baylor Department of Communication Studies]<br />
<a name="0.1_graphic06"></a>2. Epistemic violence resulting from 1AC makes racist violence inevitable<br />
Ilter ‘03 [ Arab Studies Quarterly, Winter/Spring; Infotrac; v25 i1-2 p179(18), Tugrul Ilter, Tugrul Ilter is an Assistant Professor in the faculty of Communication and Media Studies at the Eastern Mediterranean University in Cyprus.]<br />
The ontology of the Orient… beget violence on the ground.<br />
3. We must reject racism at every turn<br />
BARDNT ‘91 (JOESEPH, MINISTER, DISMANTLING RACISM)<br />
To study racism is to study walls... the walls of racism.<br />
<br />
Shunning<br />
A) Link {insert specific country link}<br />
B) Constructive engagement with offensive regimes is morally bankrupt:<br />
John Prendergast, The Washington Post, November 19, 2006, B01, “So How Come We<br />
Haven’t Stopped It?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpdyn/content/article/2006/11/17/AR2006111701480.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpdyn/content/article/2006/11/17/AR2006111701480.html</a><br />
Indeed, Washington’s constructive engagement…government want peace in Darfur.&quot;<br />
<br />
C) The Alternative: Intellectuals have a responsibility to speak out against regimes that abuse human rights—failure to do so risks worse atrocities:<br />
VIOLET B. KETELS, 1996 (associate professor of English at Temple University, The Annals of The American Academy of Political and Social Science, November; Lexis)<br />
We stand precisely… But no response at all breeds new catastrophe.<br />
There is an eco-fem K that Samford CS runs that I couldn’t get the server to pull up<br />

Counterplans<br />
Consult Turkey<br />
Observation Two: Solvency:<br />
1. Turkey wants to be consulted over US actions towards the Middle East. Consultation strengthens bilateral relations.<br />
US Dept. of State ’06 [Office of the Spokesman, July 5, “Shared Vision and Structured Dialogue to Advance the Turkish-American Strategic Partnership,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2006/68574.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2006/68574.htm</a>]<br />
The relationship between Turkey and the United States…and public diplomacy efforts and exchanges.<br />
2. US-Turkey relationship is on the brink. Working together in the Middle East is key to reviving cooperation.<br />
Fata ’07, Deputy Assistant Secretary Department of Defense [Daniel, “US-Turkish Relations,” Capitol Hill Hearing Testimony, Committee on House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, L/N]<br />
Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee…more complicated than in the past.<br />
Good US-Turkish relationship is the only way to ensure safe drawdown of US troops in Iraq.<br />
Hastings ’07, Democratic Rep. from Florida [Alcee, CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE, “REP. ALCEE L. HASTINGS HOLDS A BRIEFING ON THE 2007 TURKISH ELECTIONS,” 7/26, L/N]<br />
Furthermore, Turkish cooperation… redeployment of our troops in Iraq.<br />
B. US drawdown risks expanding the war and killing millions.<br />
Rosen ’05 [Nir, december 2005 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200512/iraq-withdrawal" rel="nofollow">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200512/iraq-withdrawal</a>]<br />
If the people the U.S. military… destabilize the region.<br />
Capital Letters PIC<br />
our intent is to abandon the capitalization of letters present in the plan text<br />
counterplan is conditional and competes textually. they should defend all of the plan, including grammatical and linguistic choices<br />
first, the use of capital letters is an ideological practice that reinforces exclusion by promoting the false notion that the capitalized object is monolithic, privileged, and homogeneous<br />
robert john ackermann, heterogeneities: race, gender, class, nation, and state, 1996 p xi<br />
<a name="0.3_graphic1E"></a>this form of exclusionary thought is the root of all violence<br />
diamond, ’92 (the third chimponzee; pg. 298-299)<br />
Today, while we may divde the world’s people… uniquely human ethical code.<br />
<br />
and, abandoning capitalization is an insurgent strategy that challenges hegemonic dominance by recognizing difference, simultaneously striking against systems indentured to the oppressed<br />
kirsten holst petersen, criticism and ideology: second african writers' conference, stockholm, 1986 p 37<br />
<a name="0.3_graphic1F"></a><a name="0.3_graphic20"></a>finally, the affirmative must justify their discursive framing in this round before their specific strategy can be evaluated. Our strategic frames analysis is necessary to deconstruct dominant societal structures and to generate effective social and political solutions.<br />

Strategic frame analysis… public misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Consult Japan<br />
Observation Two: The US-Japan Alliance<br />
A. Prior binding consultation is critical- engaging in symmetrical dialogue will solve the US-Japan alliance, US hegemony, East Asian stability and Japanese nuclearization<br />
Rapp, Lieutenant Col. With a PH.D in IR from Stanford, 2004 (William E., “Paths Diverging?<br />

With regard to the alliance,… most favorable and responsible manner.<br />
<br />
B. Foreign Aid consultation key to alliance<br />
Richard L. Armitage and Joseph S. Nye, February, 2007 (Armitage, 13th United States Deputy Secretary of State, the second-in-command at the State Department; Nye, Dean, Harvard Kennedy School of Government <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonspeakers.com/prod_images/pdfs/ArmitageRichard.U.S.-Japan+Alliance.03.07.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonspeakers.com/prod_images/pdfs/ArmitageRichard.U.S.-Japan%20Alliance.03.07.pdf</a><br />
Japan is ideally suited to be a global leader… as sensible division of labor.<br />
<br />
C. East Asian arms races cause war<br />
Blank, IR analyst, 2003 (Asia Times)<br />
Since the ABM Treaty… defense-dominated world.<br />
D. Hegemony prevents global nuclear war<br />
Zalmay Khalilzad, RAND policy analyst, Spring 1995, The Washington Quarterly, “Losing the Moment? The United States and the World After the Cold War,” Vol. 18, No. 2<br />
Under the third option…multipolar balance of power system.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Shhhhh…Don’t Tell Counterplan”<br />
Text: Bush should issue a secret executive memoranda declaring that the United States will never strike Iran. Questions, ask.<br />
Observation 1: not topical:<br />
It doesn’t constructively engage Iran and it doesn’t “offer” Iran anything…an offer is a proposal or promise upon which the other party has the power to accept or deny—the target country must be able to say “no thanks”<br />
Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law, 2007<br />
Main Entry: of·fer Pronunciation: 'o-f&amp;r Function: noun<br />
1 : a proposal, promise…REVOKE, TENDER OFFER<br />
An offer means to present to sight or notice:<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dictionary.com/" rel="nofollow">Dictionary.com</a> Unabridged, 2007<br />
11. to present to sight or notice.<br />
And the counterplan tests both constructive engagement and offer in the resolution…we don’t actively announce anything to Iran or engage them at all…we make a change in US defense strategy<br />
Observation 2: the net benefits…all of our perception based disads.<br />
Executive memorandums can be done in secret—the Counterplan doesn’t tell Iran or the Congress that we won’t air-strike:<br />
FRANCESCA BIGNAMI, 2007 (Professor, Duke University School of Law, Boston College Law Review, May 2007; Lexis)<br />
Based on what legal authority…critical element of the intelligence community.<br />

Prime Minister Gonzi… stability and peace.<br />
Foreign aid and conflict resolution uniquely take advantage of Europe’s strengths, enhancing its soft power.<br />

According to Joseph Nye…Europe as a global player.<br />
EU soft power is key to solve warming.<br />

However, Europe…in tackling climate change.&quot;<br />
Warming threatens human survival<br />
Milbrath, climatologist, ’94 (The Futurist, May 1994; Lexis)<br />
Extreme weather conditions… gradual changes in climatic patterns.<br />

NATO Do plan CP:<br />
Observation One: Not Topical<br />
Observation Two: Solvency and net benefits.<br />
NATO is in crisis – it must go out of area or out of business. The alliance either becomes active in the Middle East or it will be strategically marginalized when it is needed most to preserve global stability.<br />

<br />
Now is a key time: pro-US sentiments are returning to Europe. Bush must salvage this goodwill now to reinvigorate the trans-Atlantic alliance.<br />
Anne Applebaum, The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey), June 6, 2007 Wednesday LN<br />
It was a sunny day in June…,the damage done in Iraq.<br />
Genuine consultation on the Middle East at such a pivotal time in transatlantic relations dramatically improves transatlantic cooperation on areas of mutual interest.<br />
Brown, Bernard E., American Foreign Policy Interests; Apr2005, Vol. 27 Issue 2, p61-80, 20p<br />

One of the earliest signs… right political strategy.<br />
C) Premature withdrawal triggers a massive Middle Eastern war, hikes oil prices, causes terrorism, emboldens Iran, and devastates US leadership—we can blow up any of these scenarios in the block:<br />
