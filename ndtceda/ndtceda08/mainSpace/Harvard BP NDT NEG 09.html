 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The logic of the 1AC naturalizes the violence of capitalism by forcing the choice between either state intervention in the market or a liberalization which is necessary to stave off the coming catastrophe. The <u>fantasy</u> of the 1AC is a world where capital has no barriers, but the <u>reality</u> is the necessitty of surplus labor, primitive accumulation, and the incessant violence of market corrections.</strong><br />
<strong>these antagonisms cannot be overcome, they are internal to the very fabric of society itself. The purification of the market, its extraction from social structures such as subsidies, is producing new global antagonisms on the horns of which capitalism is crumbling today. in the face of commodified nature, the privitizaiton of the commons, the patenting of thought, and all those thrown out into the slums of global capitalism, the only alternative to implosion is to question the very system of capitalist relations they neutralize</strong><br />

<u>The underlying problem is: how are we to think the singular universality of the emancipatory subject as not purely formal</u>,.. The commons can thus be linked to what Hegel, in his Phenomenology, deployed as <em>die Sache</em>, the shared social thing-cause, &quot;the work of all and everyone,&quot; the substance kept alive by incessant subjective productivity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The aff’s knee-jerk reaction to blame a subject—the U.S. policy on _ subsidies—for violence in turn violently establishes a standard of what a “normal” non-violent situation is – this is the most violent act possible, and predetermines the way we understand all violence and reality</strong><br />

Environment link - The threat to the environment is a confluence of factors that cannot be solved individually – the structural logic of capitalism means that only a revolution can solve inevitable extinction<br />
John Bellamy Foster. Monthly review. February 2007. Google<br />
“In the Oh shit era…and if we are to survive.”<br />
Environment link – the affirmative’s premonitions of ecological Armageddon construct a fantasy of a natural world out of balance. This paranoic projection is only narcissism. The aff is sure that they must do something to save the world. In the meantime, they veil the radical complexity and chaotic processes of the external environment behind a façade of harmonious unity waiting to be realized. These fantasy formations have the deleterious consequence of make environmental politics seem a matter of grandiose political strategies, further distancing us from real changes in the socio political fabric of society.<br />

<strong>The inevitable result of the coming revolt will be a suicidal revolution that bathes the world in rivers of blood</strong><br />

We cannot say that one of these three lines… <strong><u>All the dangers of the other lines pale by comparison</u></strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Currently, those who advocate egalitarianism live in terror of police oppression while the kings of capital are celebrated. This balance of terror should be reversed – those who oppress and exploit should be terrified.</strong><br />
<strong>Seth and I currently act as informers, exposing the capitalist oppression of the 1ac. The role of the judge is to stand above the current order, and with the ballot, violently interrupt the myopic union of “science” and “common sense” the aff’s worldview presents. The aff is, above all, a refusal to believe the everyday flow of capitalist reality can be disrupted in a world-ending catastrophe.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Voting negative accepts the “time of the project.” It conceives our future as doomed, projects ourselves into it, and creates counterfactuals to avoid the coming destruction of the world.</strong><br />
<strong>This time of the project is necessarily mutually exclusive with the 1ac’s historical linear time—voting negative is the radical act which creates the possibility of the future.</strong><br />

A2 framework – sadism turn<br />
Their appeals to framework let them access a sadistic pleasure in the suffering of others – oh, we cannot afford to know the implications of our assumptions, even if that means millions suffer. In reality this move masks a hidden pleasure analogous to the Stalinist who commits purges<br />

“there is an old story about a worker…explosions of subjective violence.”<br />
A2 gibson graham<br />
Rejecting any totality or positing of capitalism as a coherent entity, closes off an understanding of how production orders society. This prevents any coherent understanding of either capitalism or resistance, allowing the system to expand rapidly as philosophy is devoid of meaning and radically localized<br />
