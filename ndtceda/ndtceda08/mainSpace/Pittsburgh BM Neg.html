Global Local<br />
construction of the global<br />
<br />
The rhetoric of the global, exemplified in the plan’s policy of constructive engagement ot create a cooperative foreign policy, underlies a fixation with the ostensible utopian future of the international order<br />
Nayar, Fall, 1999, 9 Transnat’l L &amp; Contemp. Probs, 599, p. lexis<br />
It has become a convenience, even an imperative, it seems to speak…exciting gtimes is the order of the day.<br />
<br />
Projects intended to advance the goals of civilization and humanity order the world through modern-day colonialism<br />
Nayar, 1999<br />
Contemporary world-ordering, consistent with those of the past…as evolutionary structure.<br />
<br />
Security is a guise for ordering the world toward peace for the powerful through violent intervention<br />
Nayar, 1999<br />
“security” is another bulwark of the “new world-order,”…unable to bring to order.<br />
<br />
The ordered world<br />
<br />
Belief in a ‘new beginning,’ revitalizing US realitions with the rest of the world and building a better international future, orders the world through the lens of colonialism<br />
Nayar, 1999<br />
The promise of “new beginnings” has been constant feature…with much frenzied trumpeting.<br />
<br />
Economic assistance and regulation is a form of violent ordering that comples obedience to powerful states<br />
Nayar, 1999<br />
In my identification of what may be regarded of ordering…the focus of critiques of “ordering”<br />
<br />
World ordering demands colonial violence and genocide<br />
Nayar, 1999<br />
Despite the vision of world-order founded on a nation of universal…is now plainly visible.”<br />
<br />
Imagining the future<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to refuse the affirmative’s demand for action and to instead embrace a position of contingency and self-criticism<br />
<br />
The revolution ought not be televised – the refusal to cast an ordering gaze onto libratory movements does not negate their power. Only rejecting the ordered world in favor of contingency and self-reflexive criticism can overcome violence<br />
Nayar 1999<br />
Despite the fixation of the beneficiaries of ordered worlds…following “poem”<br />
<br />
We present Nayar’s poem as a contingent move – we refuse to imagine a future world order and instead seek only to change our personal relationships to the people who suffering is commodified by the affirmative<br />
Nayar 1999<br />
There is so much to read, so impossible it seems to me…in living rather than in acting.<br />

Global/Local and some case args<br />
<br />
This Global local card morphs in to ordering anything bad – i.e. debate bad in the block. They respond to theory arguments with “that’s ordering” (including framework and agent fiat)<br />
