<span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;"><strong>Invisible CP</strong><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;">We are apparatuses living inside apparatuses that have built a universe of illusions for us to inhabit without realizing the basic truth of their invisibility. Consider any institution, human or otherwise, like Kevin Bacon or the Rotary Club. Answer the question: what <em>is</em> Kevin Bacon? One can say that he has a male body, that he has acted in many movies, that there is a game where you can associate him with other actors through the many roles he’s had, but none of those qualities respond to the question, in essence, <strong>what <em>is</em> this thing that we call “Kevin Bacon”?</strong> There is no final answer to this question, which is always and necessarily deferred to secondary signifiers, which are capable describing many things about Kevin Bacon, but are unable to deal with the problematic question posed by the verb “to be”. Therefore, we can say that we have proven that the essence of what it is to be Kevin Bacon, is itself, invisible. This invisibility of being is not a new idea, but has been established in philosophical literature from Socrates interrogation of Euthyphro to G.E. Moore’s insistence that it is impossible to answer the question “what’s good?” to Deleuze emphasis on relations over totalities. Because relations between objects and signifiers are necessarily invisible and produced through evolutions of prior relations which are themselves constantly in flux, any literal attempt to represent relations will also leave out the ineffability of its dynamic, fleeting quality; its necessary context. What Kevin Bacon is to Hollywood or what Kevin Bacon is to the legacy of Richard Nixon are not stable meanings that we can simply search for and hope to discover, but rather always bear a relation whose meaning is partially shifting, indeterminate or otherwise ambiguous-- no representation ever reaches a point of literal completeness. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;">We thus are confronted with the shrouded voids of an empty world, filled with empty things among things. But this is not the world we live in, full of vibrant life! Come with us, we will show you the secret representations of invisibility that abound in our flux-world of relations: </span><br />

Here is our counterplan text.<br />
Our framework is that if the affirmative cannot answer what <em>is</em> Kevin Bacon, they should lose.<br />
The affirmative's search for explanation is fascist<br />
