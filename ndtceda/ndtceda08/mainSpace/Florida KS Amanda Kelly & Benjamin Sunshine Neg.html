- Capitalism K<br />
<br />
While it may seem that removing subs will make the world more fair or stable, the act is actually unethical because it ignores the problems of global capitalism and allow new markets for imperial exploitation, propping up capitalism<br />
Kimberly DeFazio 2003 “the imperialism of eating well”<br />
“Rosenberg addresses on of… cannot sustain them.”<br />
<br />
Capitalism is inevitably going to cause human extinction from a wide variety of practices that destroy the global environment. Reform is not enough. The whole system needs to be radically altered<br />
John Foster 2002 “ecology against capitalism” 66-67<br />
“The consequences of such… and must be superseded.”<br />
<br />
Alt Text: Reject the affirmative as a means of refusing complicity with capitalism Rejecting capitalism is key to opening up new alternative. Only complete refusal not piecemeal reform can prevent otherwise inevitable slavery and extinction<br />
James Herod “getting free” 4th edition<br />
“it is time to… even to extinction.”<br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span>Executive Impoundment CP<br />
<br />
Observation One: The counterplan is non-topical and not an agent counterplan.<br />
<br />
Impoundment doesn't eliminate the subsidy – it just removes its legal effect<br />
Brownell 1 – Attorney at Muldoon Murphy &amp; Faucette LLP and Former<br />
Editor-in-Chief of American University Law Review<br />
[Roy E., II, &quot;THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATUS OF THE PRESIDENT'S IMPOUNDMENT<br />
OF NATIONAL SECURITY FUNDS,&quot; Seton Hall Constitutional Journal, Fall,<br />
12 Seton Hall Const. L.J. 1, Lexis]<br />
Unlike with enhanced rescission…law is being implemented, just not at<br />
the pace intended by Congress.<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Solvency<br />
<br />
Impoundment solves the case – it allows the president to unilaterally<br />
refuse to spend appropriated funds<br />
Wiesner 90 – Practicing Attorney in New York<br />
[Michael J., &quot;BEYOND BOWSHER: A SEPARATION OF POWERS APPROACH TO THE<br />
DELEGATION OF BUDGETARY AUTHORITY,&quot; Brooklyn Law Review, Winter, 55<br />
Brooklyn L. Rev. 1405, Lexis]<br />
Executive impoundment may be defined…was never strongly objected to by<br />
the Congress. n159<br />
<br />
Observation Three: Fiscal Discipline<br />
<br />
Mass impoundment by the president will create a policy showdown with<br />
Congress that is vital to restore a culture of fiscal discipline and<br />
check runaway deficits<br />
Schmitt 00 – Practicing Attorney in Missouri and Candidate for<br />
Missouri State Senate<br />
[Eric Stephen, &quot;THERE IS NO JOY IN D.C., THE MIGHTY COURT STRUCK OUT:<br />
AN ANALYSIS OF CLINTON V. CITY OF NEW YORK, THE LINE ITEM VETO ACT AND<br />
THE COURT'S FAILURE TO UPHOLD CONSTITUTIONALLY LEGITIMATE MEANS TO A<br />
VIABLE END,&quot; Saint Louis University Law Journal, Winter, 44 St. Louis<br />
L.J. 167, Lexis]<br />
The line item veto is a vital piece of the long-term budget…get the<br />
issue back on the legislative table and to the forefront of American<br />
politics.<br />
n247. It should be noted that the Train…and hogtie pork barrel spending.<br />
<br />
Unchecked budget deficits will tank the global economy<br />
Martin 8 – Retired U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander and Former Officer<br />
in the Office of Naval Intelligence<br />
[Al, &quot;Protocols For Economic Collapse In America,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://rense.com" rel="nofollow">rense.com</a>, February<br />
23, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rense.com/general80/protc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rense.com/ general80/protc.htm</a>]<br />
The day of reckoning is now coming…that is effectively what<br />
Comptroller General David Walker is saying.<br />
<br />
Economic collapse will trigger nuclear war<br />
Mead 92 – Senior Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy at Council on Foreign Relations<br />
[Walter Russell, &quot;Depending on the kindness of strangers,&quot; New<br />
Perspectives Quarterly, Summer, p. 28, Academic Search Elite]<br />
