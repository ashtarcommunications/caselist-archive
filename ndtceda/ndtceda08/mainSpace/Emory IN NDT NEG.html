Under their framework of a literary critic they say we should look at the 1AC as a book – one of the things a literary critic looks for is proper citation formatting – they violate MLA in multiple ways – they don’t give a full citation, aren’t formatted, don’t handle omitted words properly, don’t have a works cited page, it isn’t double spaced.<br />
