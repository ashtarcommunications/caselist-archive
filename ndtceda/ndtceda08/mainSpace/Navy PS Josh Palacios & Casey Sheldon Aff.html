<br />
<br />
Observation One is the Status Quo.<br />
<br />
The Federal government provides massive subsidies to the ethanol industry at all levels of ethaol production and consumption.<br />
Koplow in 07 (Douglas, Biofuels – At What Cost? Government support for ethanol and biodiesel in the United States: 2007 update October 2007)<br />
<br />
The subsidies for corn choose a market winner and vastly distort the market. The resulting overproduction makes a collapse of the corn ethanol industry inevitable without liberalization.<br />
Johnson and Runge, 2007<br />

<br />
<br />
Observation 2 is the Advantages<br />
Advantage 1 is Food Prices<br />
Scenario 1 is Starvation<br />
<br />
The diversion of corn to ethanol disrupts food and commodities markets rapidly increasing the price of staple crops across the globe.<br />
RUNGE AND SENAUER 07 (C. Ford Runge and Benjamin Senauer, “How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor,” Foreign Affairs, May/June 2007, C. Ford Runge is Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Applied Economics and Law and Director of the Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Minnesota. Benjamin Senauer is Professor of Applied Economics and Co-director of the Food Industry Center at the University of Minnesota)<br />
<br />
Ethanol production also diverts other staple crops. Even marginal increases in the price of food puts 1.1 billion people at risk.<br />

Complacency in the face of famine is murder, there is more than enough food to feed every hungry person.<br />

Foods security outweighs all other impacts – it makes every impact inevitable<br />
Trudell, J.D. Candidate 2006, 05 (Robert H., Fall, Food Security Emergencies And The Power Of Eminent Domain: A Domestic Legal Tool To Treat A Global Problem, 33 Syracuse J. Int'l L. &amp; Com. 277, Lexis)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario 2 is the Economy<br />
<br />
The tightening of corn supply makes any disruption drive food prices into the stratosphere.<br />

Miller, Colin A. and Carter 2008 professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis and , M.S., M.D., is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution January 2008 .

<br />
Reliance on corn ethanol is driving up world food prices – this ensures a global economic meltdown<br />

<br />
Economic downturn causes nuclear war<br />
Chris Lewis, environmental historian, University of Colorado-Boulder, 1998, The Coming Age of Scarcity, p. 56<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 is the Earth<br />
Scenario 1 is Global Warming<br />
<br />
Continued use of corn-based ethanol will not reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but will actually increase them by 93%, massively speeding the process of global warming.<br />
USA Today, February 8, 2008 (H. Josef Hebert, AP Writer, “Study: Ethanol May Add to Global Warming”, <span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usatoday.com/weather/climate/globalwarming/2008-02-08-ethanol-study_N.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/weather/climate/globalwarming/2008-02-08-ethanol-study_N.htm</a></span>)<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario 2 is Soil Erosion<br />
High prices mean that increasing farmers have no incentive to put land into the Conservation Reserve Program which is necessary to prevent soil erosion and protect fragile habitats.<br />
Richard Conniff, 2007 2007 Guggenheim Fellow. Who's Fueling Whom? Why the biofuels movement could run out of gas * Smithsonian magazine, November 2007 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/presence-biofuel-200711.html?c=y&amp;page=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/presence-biofuel-200711.html?c=y&amp;page=4</a><br />
Soil erosion threatens all life on the planet.<br />
Horne and McDermott 2001 (James E., PhD and Maura, The next green revolution, p 69)<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario Three is Dead Zones<br />
Increased corn production for ethanol increase fertilizer use that creates a dead zone in the gulf of Mexico.<br />
RUNGE AND SENAUER 07 (C. Ford Runge and Benjamin Senauer, “How Ethanol Fuels the Food Crisis,” Foreign Affairs, May/June 2007, C. Ford Runge is Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Applied Economics and Law and Director of the Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Minnesota. Benjamin Senauer is Professor of Applied Economics and Co-director of the Food Industry Center at the University of Minnesota)<br />

<br />
Advantage 3 is Venezuela<br />
<br />
Our ethanol policy enrages Venezuela and tanks relations.<br />
Reuters, April 12, 2007 (“Venezuela’s Chavez slams Bush’s energy plan”, <span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/41347/newsDate/12-Apr-2007/story.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/41347/newsDate/12-Apr-2007/story.htm</a></span>)<br />
Decreased relations with the US have led Venezuela to befriend terrorist organizations and state sponsors of terror.<br />
US Department of State, July 13, 2006 (Venezuela: Terrorism Hub of South America?, Frank C. Urbancic, Principal Deputy Coordinator for Counterterrorism, Statement before the House Committee on International Relations, Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation, <span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/rm/2006/68968.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/rm/2006/68968.htm</a></span>)<br />
<br />
Venezuelan travel documents make it easy for terrorists to enter the US.<br />
US Department of State, July 13, 2006 (Venezuela: Terrorism Hub of South America?, Frank C. Urbancic, Principal Deputy Coordinator for Counterterrorism, Statement before the House Committee on International Relations, Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation, <span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/rm/2006/68968.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/rm/2006/68968.htm</a></span>)<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Hence the plan: The United States Federal Government will eliminate nearly all domestic agricultural subsidies for corn ethanol including but not limited to all tariffs on imported ethanol, the volumetric excise tax credits for blending ethanol, Renewable Fuel Credits and the Renewable Fuel Standard.<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan allows biofuels to compete on the open market increasing the efficiency of ethanol and eliminating incentives to overproduce corn.<br />
Koplow in 07 (Douglas, Biofuels – At What Cost? Government support for ethanol and biodiesel in the United States: 2007 update October 2007)<br />
The plan would massively reduce costs of biofuels and eliminate market distortions.<br />

Ward 2007, Professor and Director, Center for International Trade, Clemson University. 2007 Energy Sector Management Assistance Program Considering Trade Policies for Liquid Biofuels<br />
<br />
Other countries will follow suit.<br />
Timothy Wirth July-August 2003 (“The Future of Energy Policy” – Foreign Affairs) p. LN<br />
<br />
Removing subsidies is key to opening the domestic market to other countries and other types of ethanol.<br />
