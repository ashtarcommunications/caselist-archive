EVEN IN THE WAKE OF THE NIE REPORT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO VIEW IRAN “AS A THREAT TO PEACE” AND SEEKS TO INCREASE ITS PRESSURE ON COUNTRY OVER ITS ALLEGED NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.<br />
<br />
THE PROBLEM WITH NARRATIVES SUCH AS THIS IS THEY FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY IS MEDIATED BY SOMETHING WE CALL THE REAL. THE REAL IS NOT THE REALITY BEHIND EVERY REPRESENTATION BUT INSTEAD AN EXCESS OR LACK INTRODUCED IN THE ACT OF REPRESENTATION. AS A RESULT SOCIETY MOVES FROM CRISIS TO CRISIS EACH TIME BELIEVING THE DISASTER CAN BE SOLVED BY SOME CORRECTIVE COURSE OF ACTION. THIS PERSPECTIVE MISIDENTIFIES THE REAL AS A HISTORICALLY SPECIFIC SITUATION RATHER THAN A FEATURE INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL EDIFICE ITSELF. THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY PROMISE PROSPERITY BY PREVENTING IRANIAN NUCLEARLIZATION BUT LURKING BENEATH EVERY FANTASY OF PEACE, AND STABILITY IS THE THREAT OF DISORDER AND CHAOS. CATASTROPHE ALWAYS HOVERS; SUCH IS THE NATURE OF OUR BEING<br />

“Here I would… inherent, self-blockade”<br />
<br />
IN AN EFFORT SHIELD ITSELF FROM THE TRAUMATIC EFFECTS OF THIS REAL SUBJECTS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LOOK SOMEWHERE FOR GUIDANCE. AS A RESULT SUBJECTS RETREAT INTO THE COMFORT BLANKET OF THE BIG OTHER, THIS FORM OF POLITICS CREATES A VICIOUS CYCLE IN, WHICH SUBJECTS OPERATE IN A STATE OF FRENETIC ACTIVITY, TO ENSURE THE MANDATES OF THE BIG OTHER ARE KEPT. FAR FROM SECURING THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA AND FARTHER STILL FROM PREVENTING CONFLICT---THE ONLY RESULT OF SUCH POLICIES IS THE STRENGTHENING OF THE BIG OTHERS STRANGLEHOLD ON OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY VIA IDEOLOGY.<br />

“Nowhere is this… to secrete jouissance”<br />
<br />
THIS BIG OTHER EXERTS ITS CONTROL VIA IDEOLOGY, SPECIFICALLY BY TRICKING SUBJECTS INTO PURSUING A FANTASY OF SOCIAL HARMONY. WHENEVER SOCIETY BREAKS DOWN BE IT BY WAR, GENOCIDE, OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, IDEOLOGY FANTASIZES THIS BREAKDOWN OCCURRED BECAUSE SOME HISTORICAL ENEMY STOLE OUR ENJOYMENT.<br />
<br />
FOR AMERICA TODAY, WE ARE TOLD WE MUST PREVENT IRAN FROM GAINING NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN ORDER TO PREVENT WORLD WAR THREE. WHAT THIS STORY LEAVES OUT IS THAT NO ONE IN FACT STOLE OUR ENJOYMENT: THE BIG OTHER DOESN’T EXIST AND SOCIAL HARMONY IS IMPOSSIBLE. CONTINUED RELIANCE ON THE IDEOLOGICAL FANTASY OF THE STATUS QUO SUSTAINS THE LOGIC OF SACRIFICIAL VIOLENCE IN WHICH WE ELIMINATE THE ENEMY WHO ROBBED US OF OUR ENJOYMENT.<br />
<br />
DALY, 04 (Glyn, Lecturer @ Essex and Manchester Univ., “Zizek: A Primer”, online lacan.com, ns)<br />
“Zizek has been… things actually are.”<br />
<br />
PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN ANY AND ALL TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPLIES NECESSARY TO MAKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN WILL CONSTRUCT THE WEAPONS.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE JUDGES IS THUS PRESENTED WITH AN IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE – VOTE FOR THE COLLAPSE OF CIVILIZATION OR TAKE REFUGE IN THE COMFORT BLANKET OF THE STATUS QUO. IN THE FACE OF THIS, WE SAY MAKE THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE TO VOTE AFF. GIVE UP ON ALL THE BIG OTHER’S FALSE PROMISES OF SOCIAL HARMONY AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE BIG OTHER, IN FACT, DOES NOT EXIST- THAT NO MATTER WHAT ACTION YOU AS A JUDGE TAKE THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERMONUCLEAR WAR LURKING BEHIND EVERY POSSIBLE ACTION.<br />
<br />
THE 1AC THUS RENDERS INEVITABLE THE DISASTER THAT THE BIG OTHER THREATENS YOU WITH AND THEREOFRE FORCES YOU, THE JUDGE, TO GIVE UP ATTEMTPING TO SUTURE THE STATUS QUO BY ENSLAVING YOURSELF TO THE FALSE PROMISES OF THE IDEOLOGY. A VOTE AFFIRMATIVE IS RECOGNITION THAT TRUE CATASTROPHE IS LIFE LED UNDER THE PERMANENT THREAT OF CATSTROPHE. ONCE YOU HAVE AFFIRMED THE STANDPOINT OF FACING DISASTER DEAD ON YOU CAN RETROACTIVELY RETURN TO THE POINT OF YOUR DECISION AND REALIZE WAYS OF ETHICAL ACTION OUTSIDE THE DICTATES OF THE BIG OTHER.<br />
<br />
ZIZEK, 03 (Slavoj, Prof. of Sociology @ Inst. for Sociology Ljubljana Univ, The Puppet and the Dwarf, p. 159-166)<br />
“This, perhaps, is… the last decades.”<br />
<br />
<br />
THE 1AC REPRESENTS A REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE FORCED CHOICE IDEOLOGY PRESENT US WITH – OUR RECOURSE TO ARM IRAN IS A STRATEGIC INTERVENTION WHICH EXPLODES THE DOMINANT IDEOLOGY AT ITS MOST VULNERABLE POINT - THAT OF OPTING FOR ACTION OUTSIDE OF ANY MEANING PROVIDED BY THE BIG OTHER. FURTHERMORE, THIS DECISION TO GIVE UP ALL HOPE IS CALLED TRAVERSERING THE FANTASY, WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO RECOGNIZE AND ALTER THE WAY YOU RESPOND TO IDEOLOGICAL INFLUENCE. A RECOGNITION THAT THE BIG OTHER DOESN’T EXIST DOES MEAN THAT NO SOCIAL HARMONY WILL EVER SUCCEED, BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS RECOGNITION OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY OF AUTHENTIC POLITICAL ACTION BEYOND THE INFINITELY REGRESSIVE POLITICS OF THE STATUS QUO WHICH ENDLESSLY REHEARSE THE SAME FAILED DEFERRAL OF CONFRONTATION WITH THE REAL.<br />
<br />
MCGOWAN, 07 (Todd, Assoc. Prof of English @ Univ. of Vermont, The Real Gaze: Film Theory After Lacan, p. 175-178)<br />
“THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN… one's symbolic identity.”<br />
<br />
FINALLY, THE SEEMINGLY SUICIDAL GESTURE OF OUR AFFIRMATIVE IS IN FACT WHAT MAKES US REALLY ALIVE – THE BIG OTHER WANTS DESPERATELY TO CONVINCE US THAT WE SHOULD NEVER BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE OUR BIOLOGICAL EXISTENCE, THAT ABOVE ALL WE MUST ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL. IT IS ONLY WHEN WE ARE WILLING TO RISK EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN ESCAPE THE ADMINISTERED AND TRANQUILIZED POLITICS THAT DEFINE OUR CURRENT EXISTENCE.<br />

<br />
Plan:<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should communicate to the government of Iran that the United States federal government will not attempt or support the first-strike of the Islamic Republic of Iran.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE IS REVOLUTION REDUX<br />
<br />
THE IRANIAN REGIME IS SLOWLY COMING APART AT THE SEAMS AND THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION IS GAINING POPULARITY AMONG THE POPULATION THE ONLY REMAINING ROADBLOCK TO REVOLUTION IS THE THREAT OF US MILITARY STRIKES. WE’LL ISOLATE THREE SUBPOINTS:<br />
<br />
FIRST DEMONSTRATIONS PROVE THAT THE REGIMES TIME IS QUICKLY RUNNING OUT<br />
<br />
BACHER, 2K5 (John, Assoc. Editor for Peace Magazine, “The Non-Violent Opposition in Iran”, Apr-Jun)<br />
<br />
“One of the most…. among the Iranians.&quot;”<br />
<br />
SECONDLY ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION ARE PROVING TOO HARD FOR THE REGIME TO KEEP A HOLD ON<br />
<br />
KOLODKO, 2K7 (Grzegorz W., Ph.D. of Warsaw School of Economics (SGH), he is currently Director of TIGER — Transformation, Integration and Globalization Economic Research and professor at the Leon Kozminski Academy of Entrepreneurship and Management in Warsaw, “Triggering the Next Iranian Revolution (Part I)”, The Globalist, Mar 14, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=6041%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=6041)</a><br />
<br />
“But my point… event by years”<br />
<br />
FINALLY RECENT CRACKDOWNS AND JAILINGS PROVE THE REGIME IS ENGAGED IN A LAST DITCH EFFORT TO RETAIN ITS HOLD ON POWER<br />
<br />
MATUSTIK, 2K6 (Martin B., Professor of Philosophy at Purdue University, “Velvet Revolution in Iran?”, Logos 5.3, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_5.3/matustik.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_5.3/matustik.htm)</a><br />
<br />
“Not unlike the Czech… and sacred worlds.”<br />
<br />
FURTHERMORE, OUR PLAN IS KEY TO KICK START THE GATHERING DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION - CONSTRUCTIVELY ENGAGING IRAN BY TAKING STRIKES OFF THE TABLE IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THE SUCCESS OF THE ONCOMING DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION IN IRAN<br />
<br />
CARPENTER, 2K7 (Ted, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, “Don’t Take Covert Action Against Iran”, May 27)<br />
<br />
“Rather than go…. achieve our objectives.”<br />
<br />
NOW FOR THE COOL PART – WE WILL DEFEND OUR PLAN AND ITS CONSEQUENCES WE THINK THAT A DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION IN IRAN WOULD BE A GOOD THING BUT HERES THE CATCH THIS ISNT THE YOUR GRAND-PARENTS DEMOCRACY; THIS VERSION OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORM RECOGNIZES THAT THE SOCIAL ORDER IS STRUCTURED AROUND A VOID, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT IS A FORM OF DEMOCRACY THAT REFUSES TO FILL IN THIS CONSTITUTIVE LACK.<br />
<br />
WE WILL DEFINE OUR PLAN AS A RESPONSE THE UTOPIAN STATUS QUO FOREIGN POLICY TOWARDS IRAN. THE STATUS QUO POLICIES OF STRIKING IRAN ARE UTOPIAN IN SO FAR AS THEY SEEK TO ELIMINATE SOCIAL ANTAGONISM IN THE FORM OF PREVENTING AN IRANIAN NUCLEAR WEAPON BY WHATEVER MEANS NECCESSARY. UTOPIAN STRATEGIES SUCH AS THIS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORST FORMS OF VIOLENCE IN HISTORY FROM THE GULAG TO THE SUDANESE GENOCIDE. THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMBAT POLICIES SUCH AS THIS IS TO CONSTRUCTIVELY ENGAGE THUS REACTIVATING THE RADICAL POTENTIAL OF THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION.<br />
<br />
STAVRAKAKIS, 2K3 (Yannis, department of government at the University of Essex, director of ideology and discourse analysis program, “Re-Activating the Democratic Revolution: The Politics of Transformation Beyond Reoccupation and Conformism”, Parallax, 9:2,)<br />
<br />
“The first response… utopian post-democracy).”<br />
<br />
ADDITIONALLY THERE IS AN INHERENT ETHICAL GESTURE IN THIS DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION – THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS HIGHLIGHTED IRAN AS THE CAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES PROBLEMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE ONLY ETHICAL THING LEFT TO DO IS TO FULLY IDENTIFY WITH THE CAUSE OF THE SUPPOSED SOCIAL ILLS. THIS IS THE GATEWAY TO AN ETHICS OF THE REAL, AN ETHICS THAT CANNOT BE LIMITED TO STANDARD LABELS SUCH AS GOOD OR EVIL. THIS ETHICAL ORIENTATION IS THE MOST APT AT OPERATING WITHING OUR ERA OF LATE CAPITALISM, AND FURTHERMORE IT IS CRUCIAL IN FORESTALLING THE FORCES OF TOTALITARIANISM<br />

“In the first place…. such an attitude?”<br />

Round 4 – Aff vs Gonzaga HM<br />

PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER TO THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN THAT THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ATTEMPT OR SUPPORT THE FIRST STRIKE OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN
