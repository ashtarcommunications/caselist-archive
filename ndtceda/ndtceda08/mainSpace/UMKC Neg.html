<br />
The notion of sameness that universal human rights invoke is a facade, The universal nature of rights is an attempt to assimilate the other by embracing them. Rather than keeping the Other external, society is categorized and ordered internally according to a standard of civilization. A call to universally embrace the other is in the end still posited against the sovereign self.<br />
<strong>Rasch 03</strong> (William, Cultural Critique, spring, <em>Human Rights as Geopolitics</em>, accessed via project muse)<br />
“In his <em>The Conquest of America</em>… uncontested sovereignty of liberalism itself.”<br />
<br />
Modern international law has its roots in Christianity, replacing the authority of the Church with the authority of law. This is part of a continuing process of universalization. While there are no modes of existence outside the community, the Other is still constructed as a moral outlaw within the community, in need of moral and legal correction.<br />
<strong>Rasch 03</strong> (William, Cultural Critique, spring, <em>Human Rights as Geopolitics</em>, accessed via project muse)<br />
“Though he favorably opposes… as an ominous threat”<br />
<br />
The power of sovereignty does not lie in the negative manifestation of rights, but at the point of decision. This is a process of inclusion through exclusion – a space of exception is created, but integrated through the larger process of decisionmaking. This blurs the line between law and life and reifies biopolitical control<br />
<strong>Caldwell</strong> <strong>04</strong> (Anne, <em>Bio-Sovereignty and the Emergence of Humanity Theory &amp; Event</em> – Volume 7, Issue 2)<br />
“Agamben’s ultimate concern… zone of indistinction between outside and inside.’”<br />
<br />
Reforms of modern politics fail to bring the issues of the refugee and sovereignty to the forefront. Rather we must embrace the coming community that can exist without limitation. This allows for a creative response to the aporia’s of security rooted in a rethinking of ourselves and the political<br />
<strong>Burke 02</strong> (Anthony, lecturer in IR @ Univ of Adelaide in Australia, “Prisoners of Paradox: Thinking for the Refugee” <em>Social Alternatives</em> Vol. 21 No. 4 Spring)<br />
“One of the major cultural problems… may free the refugees.”<br />
<br />
Democratic change cannot stop the violence of sovereign power over the law-constituent power attempts to posit what law should do with its violence, which lies within the power of the sovereign<br />
<strong>Neilson 04</strong> (Brett, University of West Sydney, <u>Contretemps</u>, <em>Potenza</em> <em>nuda? Sovereignty, biopolitics, capitalism</em>, ONLINE)<br />
“Signal of the subtlety of Agamben’s… paradoxical situation with the structure of sovereignty itself.”<br />
<br />
Human rights reinscribe the authority of the political order of “right-giver” that prohibits inclusion<br />
<strong>Agamben 96</strong> (Giorgio, Prof. of philosophy @ Padua, “Beyond Human Rights” <u>Radical Thought in Italy</u> edited by Paolo Virno &amp; Michael Hardt)<br />
“This is not the place to retrace… inconceivable in the law of the Nation-State.”<br />
<br />
You fools – your belief that enemy combatants exist outside the law leads you to rush into Guantanamo Bay to fill in for this emptiness. Overturning Quirin would not set the unlawful combatants free but would only grant them the same rights that any citizen of America enjoys in a court of law. This masks the logic of sovereignty that undergrids all legal thinking<br />
<strong>Kohn 06</strong> (Margaret, assistant professor of political science @ University of Florida, “Bare Life and the Limits of the Law” <u>Theory and Event</u> 9:2)<br />
“At this point it should be clear that Agamben… legitimizes marginality and exclusion.”<br />

<br />
The problem of market efficiency is the cornerstone of the neoliberal order this relies on an ontology that translates human interactions into economic gains and declines, allowing domination by the few to be regarded as a natural economic process and stifling resistance<br />
<br />
Murphy 2K4<br />
<br />
This image of an autonomous economy Is epitomized by….there is nothing for sensible persons to do other than try to make this process appear to be more palatable and reasonable<br />
<br />
The Civil society promoted by neoliberalism encourages a form of human rights that encourages exploitation by focusing on the individual. The administrative power relationships of the state are merely transferred to civil society as the state works to protect practices of economic exploitation.<br />
<br />
Evans 00<br />
<br />
How then does the individual claiming universal human rights differ…opens the way for the unfettered materialism of interests<br />
<br />
Human rights associated with civil society function to promote market values via civil and political rights. This prevents citizens from challenging larger structural problems and denies the ability to promote economic and social freedom as integral to society<br />
<br />
Evans 00<br />
<br />
The human rights associated with neoliberal civil society….to the exclusion of the many<br />
<br />
Neoliberalism inherently fuels a collective death drive, It is rooted in the belief that there are no alternatives to present day thinking so we must apply our current thinking to its fullest extebt. The udeal that only a stricter application of market economics can ensure prosperity is the latest and most deadly manifestation of the death drive. It is spiraling us toward a conservative politics that guarantees collective suicide.<br />

Santos 03<br />

Sacrifical genocide arises from a totalitarian illusion…to the concept of collateral damage.<br />

Bottom of K<br />
Allows US liberal order- masks ability to critique racism/sexism/status quo- lose internal link argument to 1AC in the world of the plan cause the US to raise economic awareness- can still criticize economic impact<br />
<br />
No evidence as to why 1NC bans human rights in the squo<br />
<br />
Give civil and political rights- can never fight against system that allows 1ac harms to talk about- if we win- this is the link argument<br />
<br />
Their Colon in 99 evidence- says economic exploitation are inextricably linked<br />
<br />
Try or Die collapse is inevitable<br />
<br />
Rasby 04<br />
Requires regime in the context of the liberal regime<br />
<br />
Forming problems- social and political problems harm<br />
<br />
Terror ev. Doesn't assume criticism- Santos is not about study talking about ideological forces which drive noeliberalism<br />
<br />
Landers 02<br />
Protect naturalized discourse- hereditary model makes life possible<br />
<br />
Closely related to vital global demands- leads to transnational capital<br />
<br />
Concedes link turn- cannot solve econ advantage- rational actors necessary<br />
<br />
Brown 05<br />
<br />
Democratic- ideals of reality assume legitimacy<br />
Freedom of equality never be utilized neoliberalism is different<br />
<br />
Political nihilism<br />
<br />
Brown 05<br />
<br />
Neoliberalism uses a calculating creature confers morality with cost effects deliberation no matter how severe mode of governmentality deals with consequences of choices- neoliberal governments fuse national actions<br />
<br />
Radically transform and narrow criteria<br />
Damning answer- do not allow for valuation of monetary gain-<br />
<br />
Neoliberalism only values your life in terms of money- tells how much dollar value of her pain is in court- a double turn.<br />
<br />
Create wider economic crises-<br />
<br />
If you endorse globalization need to re-orient according to the alternative- fundamental social rights you should get- re-orient politics- all K says is that it gets rid of bad arguments<br />
<br />
Not the idea we should uphold rights-<br />
<br />
Infinitely better evidence- no false dichotomy exists- should view things through our own agency- it would be the world of the alternative-<br />
<br />
Murphy 04<br />
Common destiny- not regulated through practice- plan leads to dualism and social hierarchies- globalization gets better-<br />
<br />
Tolerated dualism- fear of rights-assumes a new meaning guide history in ways the prove humanity<br />

<br />
Complete unlimiting of the topic<br />
<br />
Just overturn impacts- doesn't establish any type of overruling for case- just leads to a war and stale debate- don't learn about any other interpretations- doesn't violate commerce clause- cant meet interpretation- 1NC based on args/resolution/ horrible ground to just overturn a fact of case- especially makes no sense in terms of Quirin- don't show why it exceeds the commerce clause or not<br />

Overrule on separate grounds- new decisions are created all the time<br />

No warrant as to why fiat increases predictability<br />
Critique use of fiat- we are not a leftist criticism- turns back most of their offense<br />
<br />
Perm- risk of link means that they cannot solve- concede that perm severs- perm to the alternative-race and sexist language will punish them<br />
<br />
Representations of the 1AC- conveys a message- they concede that they link say we need to increase US standard of living- their type of human rights strategy prevents people from attaining any social freedoms<br />
<br />
Puts them in a double bind- money is given to deter people from committing crime- globalization has to begin on an ontological level- (04)<br />

Murphy evidence doesn't answer- but we talk about states law- doesn't mean perm will be able to solve the types of problems they say will be happening<br />

<strong>Topicality</strong>- You have to overrule and state which case in the plan text of the 1AC-<br />
a. Predictability<br />
b. Educational transformative value<br />
i. Reidley 02- establish rules and regulations of democracy<br />
ii. Best research- Joinder 99- hypothetical cases- merits of the supreme court solutions<br />
<strong>1st priority</strong>- ‘Indigenous’ rhetoric prioritized over the term Weigar that the 1AC uses<br />
Must discuss things like foreign policy- Winston Salem, NC- local revolution and war was a pre-requisite- handling of judicious problems<br />
<br />
People still exist today<br />
Intolerance of original colony<br />
<br />
Genocide- Tushnett 96- most progressive elements of society not consistent generation after generation- no unusual technique<br />
<br />
Reaffirms the way we deal with things<br />
<br />
Serves the 1st priority<br />
<br />
US perpetuates problems of racism and classism<br />
<br />
Destroy the ability to deal with racism<br />
<br />
Impact- genocide- voting aff leads to all forms of oppression- harm directly to US<br />
<br />
Tushnett 96- orthodox realism- functions as racism/sexism evil occupation – achieving radical change is difficult<br />
<br />
<strong>Language Criticism</strong><br />
Organize population classifications<br />
<br />
Aff rhetoric harms- Weigar assumes a rhetorical identities- employed by the west and government of china as a means of oppression<br />
04- maintain localist identities- no national identities exist<br />
<br />
Issue of social projects like adoption<br />
<br />
Common national identity<br />
<br />
Quisnodoff 02- incorporate vision outside powers- make arguments essential<br />
<br />
Language and rhetoric where police and identity intersect<br />
<br />
Dryer 02- increases dehumanization by increasing classisim- minority harm as part of western culture<br />
<br />
Alternative- embrace eastern methodologies to question Chinese control- transport to Eastern Turkistan<br />

Agamben is our default 1nc neg arg. Sometimes we throw in some normativity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The affirmative plan reinforces the contradictory nature of modern law. The plan is viewed as a radical break from the current juridical order, but the decision is still rooted in the same foundational network of the legal order. This allows the legal system to use this contradiction to reassert sovereign power.<br />
Oscar in 2k6 (Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, School of Law Birkbeck University of London, Law and Critique, Paradise Lost…The Meaning of Modernity and the Antinomy of the Law, Vol 17 No 1)<br />
<br />
Ethnographers have been ...outside the law<br />
<br />
The affirmative ignores the fundamental relationship between sovereignty and life. Before the law can determine what is and is not permissible, it must include life within its sphere. This biopolitical control perpetuates states of exception where life becomes expendable in the name of sovereign power<br />

<br />
The belief that law can represent an orderly vision of justice denies the performative dimension of law, portraying the law as an objective, separate reality while masking its role as a manipulative social force that relies on subjective politics.<br />
Schlag in 91 (Pierre, Professor of Law @ Univ of Colorado, University of Pennsylvania Law Review, Normativity and the Politics of Form, 139 U. Pa. L. Rev. 801, LN)<br />
<br />
These visions of law .... But it's not so.<br />
<br />
Law and violence are inextricably linked-law stands as the limit of violence, basing itself on the promise to quell and prevent violence while at the same time colonizing and subjugating the minds of those it effects. The discourse and thought of law use the metaphor of violence that culminates in physical acts.<br />
