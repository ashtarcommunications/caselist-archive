<br />
Although the conventional wisdom is that small family farms are… scale agriculture devotes itself to feeding car tanks.<br />
<br />
And, small farms are also more economically efficient that CAFO’s – they tend to save more money through buying less pesticides and generate more revenue.<br />

<br />
CAFOs are commonly promoted as the… efficiency; this is economic exploitation.<br />
<br />
The impact – Monoculture risks extinction<br />
Fowler and Mooney 90 – Senior Officer at UN Food and Agriculture Organization; and Staff Member at Rural Advancement Fund International<br />
[Cary and Pat, Shattering: food, politics, and the loss of genetic diversity, p. ix]<br />
<br />
While many may ponder the consequences… and render our own survival more precarious.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, any risk of a monoculture could increase the chances of people being forced into starvation – people will rely on cheap imports and money to feed their families – small farms are more efficient – the risk of food shortages must be adverted<br />
Roset 1999 - Executive Director of Food First<br />

<br />
A penalty is paid for this land concentration… wages and world food prices can drive millions into hunger.<br />
<br />
Any risk of a food shortage will trigger nuclear war<br />
Klare 06 – Professor of peace and world security studies @ Hampshire College<br />
[Michael Klare, “The Coming Resource Wars,” TomPaine.com, Date: March 11, 2006, pg. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.waterconserve.org/shared/reader/welcome.aspx?linkid=53710&amp;keybold=water%20land%20conflict" rel="nofollow">http://www.waterconserve.org/shared/reader/welcome.aspx?linkid=53710&amp;keybold=water%20land%20conflict</a>]<br />
<br />
&quot;As famine, disease, and weather-related disasters… involvement in these forms of conflict.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO: THEY TOOK OUR JOBS<br />
<br />
A massive spike in unemployment is on the horizon. We’re on the verge of a meltdown.<br />
Gannett News Service 10/7/08<br />
(Brian Tumulty, “Job market deteriorating this year”)<br />
<br />
The housing downturn of 2007… moment any specific indicators we will turn the corner soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
The plan decreases unemployment and insulates the agricultural sector against shocks<br />

<br />
In farming communities dominated by large… Recent studies confirm that Goldschmidt’s findings remain true.<br />
<br />
And, CAFOs kill 330 family farms per week, destroying jobs. This is a linear, systemic, ongoing destruction of the national economy.<br />

<br />
Another hidden cost of industrial-farmed food… unemployment and reduced potential for future economic growth.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, high levels of unemployment risk nuclear war<br />

<br />
Okay, well, as I listened to people tal… but to make Yugoslavia, to make the Bosnian mess look like nothing, like an English soccer riot.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE THREE: LOCAL COMMUNITIES<br />
First, CAFOs increase the costs of their surrounding community – they increase healthcare costs, property depreciation costs and pollution costs – this kills local economies<br />
DOWDING 2007 – BA in Environmental Science, Masters of Public Affairs with concentrations in Environmental Policy and Policy Analysis<br />
(Heather, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO), December 16th, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eoearth.org/article/Concentrated_Animal_Feeding_Operation_%28CAFO" rel="nofollow">http://www.eoearth.org/article/Concentrated_Animal_Feeding_Operation_(CAFO</a>))<br />
CAFOs tend to increase the costs of their…multiple owners own shares of the company.<br />
Also, CAFO’s decrease property values in areas near and around the CAFO – both of these factors kill the local economies<br />
PRESERVATION NATION NO DATE<br />
(Factory Farms and America’s Rural Heritage)<br />
Factory farms affect rural historic places in several way… sites are repelled by the smell from factory farms.<br />
<br />
And, local economies are key to the national economy – if local communities do not grow, it is impossible for the national economy to grow<br />

INDIA WILL not be globally competitive if its local… effort to make the local economies competitive.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE FOUR: JAPAN<br />
<br />
First, Japan has reinstated their ban on our beef – this could escalate to a trade war<br />
AFP, 8/8<br />
[Google News, 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jMIjdrQsOg2eoESgDJrEDA6M7lpQ" rel="nofollow">http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jMIjdrQsOg2eoESgDJrEDA6M7lpQ</a>]<br />
<br />
Japan's farm ministry said Friday that… that could cause the disease.<br />
<br />
Second, Factory Farms use hormones – that's why Japan has banned our beef – The shift to traditional Farms solves<br />
Barrow, 2008<br />
[Deborah, Founder of the Daily Green, 2/19, The Daily Green, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/blogs/american/Beef-Recall-Factory-Farm-Animal-Cruelty-491217-clone" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/blogs/american/Beef-Recall-Factory-Farm-Animal-Cruelty-491217-clone</a>]<br />
<br />
Factory farm animals are often raised under inhumane… Japan, Europe and Canada. I interpret that as a sign.<br />
<br />
C) The beef dispute will tank relations<br />
Japan policy and Focus, 2005<br />
[BNET, Business Network, March 21, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2005_March_21/ai_n13458415" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2005_March_21/ai_n13458415</a>]<br />
<br />
Japan and the United States remained split over Japan's ban…problem would not mar Japan-U.S. relations.''<br />
<br />
D) US-Japan alliance is key to prevent war over the Spratly Islands.<br />

<br />
In the 1980s, Japan pledged to develop a defense capacity to protect the… as they pursue their competition<br />
<br />
E) SCS is a tinderbox—Chinese military doctrine ensures conflict will escalate into nuclear war<br />

Jr., “An Evitable War: Engaged Containment and the US-China Balance,” Parameters , Autumn 2001, pp. 92-104// <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/01autumn/Howle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/01autumn/Howle.htm</a>]edlee<br />
<br />
Within the last 30 years, Chinese military doctrine… including oil from the Persian Gulf to Taiwan and Japan<br />
<br />
China’s military posture makes miscalculation a distinct possibility in the South China Sea<br />
