US has habit of assassinating leaders of governments with socialist leanings<br />

Indonesia, Vietnam, Syria, Chile, El Salvador – geopolitics of Aemrican imperialism, but this would be addressing the symptom, but not the cuase of the global disease<br />

Terrorism itself is not violent, it is the spectacle it unleashes that is violent. Terrorism is insoluble equation. Offers a narrative opposing every event said to be real. Everything in terrorism is ambivalent. If the power wins out at the level of the objective, it loses its power on the states. Terrorism must be illogical to give power but logical … we treat them like idiots.<br />

queerness is a prereq for the body to function. Terrorist bodies (typically understood as homophobic, racialized, etc). Terrorist bodies are not heteronormative<br />
