Cards we have read in the 1ac<br />
<br />
Observation One: Inherency:<br />
<br />
There is no chance that the Supreme Court will reconsider their decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey<br />
<br />
FORSYTHE, PRESSER ’06 (Clarke D. Forsythe* &amp; Stephen B. Presser)-Director, Project in Law &amp; Bioethics, Americans United for Life, Raoul Berger Professor of Legal History, Northwestern University School of Law. 10 Tex. Rev. Law &amp; Pol. 301, Restoring Self-Government on Abortion: A Federalism Amendment. Spring, 2006. LEXIS NEXIS.<br />
Sadly, the Court has repeatedly … goes into effect any time soon.<br />
<br />
Observation two: Murder<br />
<br />
Life Begins at Conception--the position of those who support abortion is inconsistent and not in line with scientific or moral reasoning when it comes to this question<br />
<br />
Diamond in 2005 (Eugene, MD, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.culture-of-life.org/?Control=ArticleMaster&amp;aid=1444&amp;c=1&amp;p=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.culture-of-life.org/?Control=ArticleMaster&amp;aid=1444&amp;c=1&amp;p=1</a>)<br />
<br />
The existence of life is intrinsic … Roe v. Wade is on a collision course with itself.<br />
<br />
That translates into a million murders per year…<br />
<br />
<br />
Wardle in 1999 (Lynn, BYU Law, 62 Alb. L. Rev. 853)<br />
<br />
Roe has resulted in a tremendous increase in the … wanes, abortions have modestly fallen.<br />
<br />
<br />
We must adopt a precautionary principle when it comes to the abortion issue—the risks are simply too dire if it turns out that the fetus actually is human<br />
<br />
Oliver in 2005 (Daniel, National Review, 5-9)<br />
If neither tradition nor science can tell us whether the fetus is a person, … knowledge about the humanity of the fetus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Planned Parenthood versus Casey is the decision that Governs modern abortion jurisprudence—In it’s central holding, the court upheld the right to abortion on demand, allowing for the continuation of mass slaughter<br />
<br />
Paulsen in 2003 (Michael Stokes, Minnesota Law, 78 Notre Dame L. Rev. 995)<br />
A tumultuous decade ago, the … the decision would have gone the other way.<br />
<br />
The Court’s refusal to recognize fetuses as alive and human is based upon the same categorical dismissal of humanity that formed the basis for the worst atrocities in history. Abortion is literally the most pernicious expression of democratic rights ever manifested.<br />
Gairdner in 2006 (William, PhD, Stanford, MA, Structural Linguistics, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.williamgairdner.com/abortion-and-slavery/" rel="nofollow">http://www.williamgairdner.com/abortion-and-slavery/</a>)<br />
The importance of such category … work them to death, or simply to liquidate them.<br />
<br />
euphemisms such as “choice” and “rights” are just coping mechanisms in which society ignores the systemic slaughter of abortion.<br />
<br />
Newman. 1994. (Barbara, staff writer for Feminists for Life, “Abortion and War: Euphemism Kills” The American Feminist: Summer 1994. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.feministsforlife.org/taf/1994/summer/euphem.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.feministsforlife.org/taf/1994/summer/euphem.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
American culture, as we all know … has been successfully sold to the public as a solution for it.<br />
<br />
Also, the vast majority of decisions made by policymakers exist in a moral gray area that should be negotiated via things like cost-benefit analysis, but abortion is a special case that we must always have an absolute side constraint against—any moral system that rejects this precept hopelessly devalues life<br />
<br />
Sisk in 2005 ( St Thomas School of Law, 43 Catholic Law. 255)<br />
<br />
Archbishop Charles J. Chaput of Denver has … doctrine and morals to which all faithful Catholics must confess. n100<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular opinion, legalized abortion is highly unsafe. Lightly regulated abortion mills injure thousands of minority women and prey upon their socioeconomic position.<br />
<br />
Crandle 1996 (Candice, Wall Street Journal, http;<em>www.wprc.org/23.52.0.0.1.0.phtml)<br />
<br />
Just how much bad medicine is being glossed over… intimidate doctors and control women’s lives.”<br />
<br />
Even if they win that obligations to the future exist, when balanced against present day suffering, the case outweighs. Their framework is grossly immoral, diverts us from current responsibilities, ignores issues of certainty and is the ultimate in intellectual and ethical arrogance.<br />
<br />
Derr 81 (Thomas Sieger, PhD from Columbia University, Responsibilities to Future Generations: Environmental Ethics Ed. Ernest Partridge, p 42-43)<br />
<br />
This brief review suggests that an obligation to posterity … other people to be martyrs to the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
PLAN: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), on the grounds that Constitutional personhood begins at conception.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 3: Solvency<br />
<br />
The refusal to grant constitutional personhood to the fetus allows for the depersonalization of life, resulting in a culture of death that sanctions mass killing in the name of rights – the supreme court must address this wrong<br />
<br />
Rice in 2005 (Charles, Notre Dame Law, Ave Maria LR, Spring, lexis)<br />
<br />
What is a legal person is for the law … “rights” runs contrary to their own “interests.”<br />
<br />
The supreme court has a moral imperative to declare fetal personhood and prevent the slaughter and enslavement of millions of embryos<br />
<br />
Lugosi in 2005 (St Thomas Law, Issues in Law and Medicine, Spring, Lexis)<br />
<br />
There is a moral imperative to affirm and constitutionally … to abolish the laws that have revived a new form of human slavery in Twenty-first Century America.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Casey must be overturned in order to correct the monstrous injustice of leagalized abortion<br />
Paulsen in 2003 (Michael Stokes, Minnesota Law, 78 Notre Dame L. Rev. 995)<br />
Is it possible for America in the twenty-first century … similar atrocities that we ourselves commit, and tolerate, today.<br />
<br />
legal sanction promotes abortion—a reverse in the court’s direction on abortion would lead to a cultural shift that would never allow for another Roe.<br />
<br />
Robinson in 2005 (Edward,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.unbornperson.org/Displayed%20Responses%202005.htm#January%2017,%202005" rel="nofollow">http://www.unbornperson.org/Displayed%20Responses%202005.htm#January%2017,%202005</a>)<br />
Comment: My first reaction to your … parts for the supposed benefit of others.<br />
Relying on a static conception of personhood is the logic that justified slavery – the fetus must be granted personhood and protected under the 14th amendment<br />
<br />
Aljalian 99 (Natasha, St John’s LR, spring, texas)<br />
<br />
It is commonly argued that one must be born … constitutional protection as a “person” under the Fourteenth Amendment.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Stare Decisis is a terrible way to justify 50 million murders<br />
<br />
Robinson in 2005 (Edward, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.unbornperson.org/Displayed%20Responses%202005.htm#September%2015,%202005" rel="nofollow">http://www.unbornperson.org/Displayed%20Responses%202005.htm#September%2015,%202005</a>)<br />
<br />
Just in passing, it is curious that bad laws … in this case, the ashes of a misguided arm of national justice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Massive systemic harms should take precedence over an ultimately smaller death toll from nuclear war<br />
<br />
Martin 84 (Brian, “Extinction Politics” Scientists Against Nuclear Arms Newsletter, No. 16, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uow.edu/au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/84sana1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uow.edu/au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/84sana1.html</a>)<br />
<br />
A related factor linked with nuclear … other issues are more pressing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other case cards/specific case da ans we have read<br />
<br />
Its absurd for corporations to be legally considered persons under the 14th amendment when the fetus is not – this is ultimately the reason why Casey makes no sense and must be overturned<br />
<br />
Aljalian in 99 (Natasha, St John’s LR,spring, lexis)<br />
<br />
The court in Planned Parenthood … This seems to be, at best, an absurdity.<br />
<br />
Formal equality within equal protection doctrine is itself transformative, even if imperfect – to give up on attempting equality is the wrong strategy for social change<br />
<br />
Simmons 2000 (Boston Law, Boston University Law Review, June)<br />
<br />
The right to equal treatment is a curious principle … conceptual value and transformative power.<br />
<br />
Util causes eugenics<br />
<br />
Smith 2002 Michael G, ‘The Public Policy of Casey V. Planned Parenthood’ <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.leaderu.com/humanities/casey/ch3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.leaderu.com/humanities/casey/ch3.html</a><br />
<br />
Furthermore, abandoning the principle of human equality could lead … all humans must be recognized by the law.<br />
<br />
Our aff is critical to define the bounds of util – our aff establishment of when life begins is a pre-requisite to util<br />
<br />
Rhonheimer, 1998 (Martin, 43 Am. J. Juris. 235)<br />
<br />
The important result of these reflections is that the …. Convergence between moral law and civil law.<br />
<br />
Disad impacts don’t compare with stance against murder of fetuses<br />
<br />
Stith 97 (Richard, Valparaiso Law, Maryland L.R.)<br />
<br />
Consider the recent massacres in Rwanda, … admitting that one has no good theory of it.<br />
<br />
Quality of life arguments that don’t acknowledge the sanctity of life always result in mass killing<br />
<br />
Stith 91 (Richard, Valparaiso Law, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3322" rel="nofollow">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3322</a>)<br />
<br />
Dworkin is too casual in dismissing the secular claims … lacks as reasons to help us rather than to destroy us.<br />
<br />
Compromise impossible with conception<br />
<br />
Sisk 05 (St. Thomas School of Law, 43 Catholic Law. 255)<br />
<br />
In contrast with prudential policy judgments … compromise of an elemental principle.<br />
<br />
Recognizing life begins at conception only way to prevent abortion<br />
<br />
Paulsen 03 (Michael Stokes, Minnesota Law, 78 Notre Dame L. Rev. 995)<br />
<br />
A standard form in which advocates for a right to commit … need not be regarded as such (according to the first)?<br />
<br />
Back alley figures are overstated, small number of deaths hardly justifies mass slaughter of abortion<br />
<br />
Baker 01 (Hunter, 14 Regent U.L. Rev. 35)<br />
<br />
On the Death Toll from Illegal Abortion Let’s … the lives of women who have abortions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Abortion causes suicide and child abuse – only a framework of sanctity of life can preven these actions<br />
<br />
Smith 91 (Michael G. “The Public Policy of Casey v. Planned Parenthood” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.leaderu.com/humanities/casey/ch3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.leaderu.com/humanities/casey/ch3.html</a>)<br />
<br />
Not only does abortion lead to more incidences of child abuse …. Right to live, further violence is the natural result.<br />
<br />
No guarantee embryonic stem cells will produce any results – their impacts are examples of rhetorical distortion designed to deflect the moral questions surrounding abortion<br />
<br />
Lillge 02 (Wolfgang, MD, 21st Century Science and Technology Magazine, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/articles/winter01/stem_cell.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/articles/winter01/stem_cell.html</a>)<br />
<br />
It is remarkable that in the debate – often carried on with little competence … public discussion as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Multiple other sources of stem cells<br />
<br />
Strode 04 (Bob, www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=19741)<br />
<br />
A Toronto, Canada, researcher says stem cells … Parkinson’s disease, according to the report.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stem cells cause diseas – can’t refine cells with enough purity to prevent mutations<br />
<br />
Lillge 02 (Wolfgang, MD, 21st Century Science and Technology Magazine, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/articles/winter01/stem_cell.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/articles/winter01/stem_cell.html</a>)<br />
<br />
In addition to the obvious moral consideration … because of their greater differentiation.<br />
<br />
Genetic research + abortion = eugenic extermination of “disabilities” like homosexuality and obesity<br />
<br />
Cunningham 1997 (Gregg, Director Center for Bioethical Reform, National Review, Nov 10, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n21_v49/ai_19987392/pg_4" rel="nofollow">http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n21_v49/ai_19987392/pg_4</a>)<br />

STARE D<br />

Ensign 06 (Drew C. 81 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1137)<br />
<br />
The Court has made it clear that stare decisis … additional criterion that the Court considered.<br />
<br />
Casey/Roe meet all 4 factors in determining if stare decisis does not apply<br />
<br />
Ensign 06<br />
<br />
The stare decisis factors on which the Court explicitly … plausible reconciliation of the Court’s recent decisions.<br />
<br />
STD totally random – court can’t agree on boundaries<br />
<br />
Dunn 03 (Pintip Hompluem 113 Yale L.J. 493)<br />

Each act of overruling potentially challenges the Court’s legitimacy … operate with “the randomness of a lightning bolt.”<br />
<br />
LEGITIMACY<br />
<br />

<br />
Carrington 99 (Paul D., Prof of Law @ Duke, Alabama Law Review)<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, a Commission of the American Bar Association … little that mere lawyers can do to correct it.<br />
<br />
Upholding bad law is much worse for judicial legitimacy – the casey court decided incorrectly and the decision must be rectified to restore legitimacy<br />
<br />
Forsythe and Presser 06 (10 Tex. Rev. Law &amp; Pol. 301)<br />
<br />
In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania … judiciary as continued adherence to a rule unjustified in reason.”<br />
<br />
No public perception of losses in legitimacy – perceptions are resilient to a single court case<br />

Smith 91 (Christopher E, Kentucky Law Journal, ln)<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s status as a legal institution reinforces the image … trying to do right as they see the right.<br />

STRIPPING<br />

Court stripping is happening now – the house and senate have passed legislagtion including the patriot act as well as others that strip authority<br />

It follows that Congress may not, even though … federal jurisdiction over particular constitutional claims.<br />
<br />
Legislative rollback efforts fail<br />
<br />
McDowell 88 (Gary, Curbing the Courts, p. 165)<br />

In concluding that the Constitution authorized judicial review of federal statutes … supreme law and state constitutions or laws, state judges are to enforce the supreme federal law.<br />
<br />
Court action key – neither states nor congress can establish fetal right to life<br />
<br />
Whalen 05 (Alec, Constitutional Commentary 22:1, ebsco)<br />
<br />
Dworkin’s argument is meant to shore up Roe at this point … nationally guaranteed constitutional rights than states can.<br />
<br />
No solvency without personhood – denial is part of america’s histerory of slaughter of expendable populations<br />
<br />
Cunningham 03 (Gregg, Director Center fo Bioethical Reform, www.cbrinfo.org/Resources/abortion02.html)<br />
<br />
“Humanity,” however, is quite different from “personhood.” … subhuman to justify taking their lives.<br />
<br />
Distinction of a human allows for mass slaughter and allows humans to be killed under law<br />
<br />
Rhonheimer, 1998 (Martin, 43 Am. J. Juris. 135)<br />
<br />
The first strategy for rendering this fact innocuous … can be killed for any reason, without any justification before the law.<br />

Congressional action would just be co-opted by special interests – only Supreme Court action solves<br />

Life Begins at Conception--the position of those who support abortion is inconsistent and not in line with scientific or moral reasoning when it comes to this question<br />
Diamond in 2005 (Eugene, MD, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.culture-of-life.org/?Control=ArticleMaster&amp;aid=1444&amp;c=1&amp;p=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.culture-of-life.org/?Control=ArticleMaster&amp;aid=1444&amp;c=1&amp;p=1</a>)<br />
”The existence of life is intrinsic … Roe v. Wade is on a collision course with itself.”<br />
<br />
We must adopt a precautionary principle when it comes to the abortion issue—the risks are simply too dire if it turns out that the fetus actually is human<br />
Oliver in 2005 (Daniel, National Review, 5-9)<br />
“If neither tradition nor science can tell us whether the fetus is a person, … knowledge about the humanity of the fetus.”<br />
<br />
Casey governs modern abortion jurisprudence—In it’s central holding, the court upheld the right to abortion on demand, allowing for the continuation of mass slaughter<br />
Paulsen in 2003 (Michael Stokes, Minnesota Law, 78 Notre Dame L. Rev. 995)<br />
“A tumultuous decade ago, the … the decision would have gone the other way.”<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular opinion, legalized abortion is highly unsafe. Lightly regulated abortion mills injure thousands of minority women and prey upon their socioeconomic position.<br />
Crandle 1996 (Candice, Wall Street Journal, http;<em>www.wprc.org/23.52.0.0.1.0.phtml)<br />
“Just how much bad medicine is being glossed over… intimidate doctors and control women’s lives.”<br />
<br />
The refusal to grant constitutional personhood to the fetus allows for the depersonalization of life, resulting in a culture of death that sanctions mass killing in the name of rights – the supreme court must address this wrong<br />
Rice in 2005 (Charles, Notre Dame Law, Ave Maria LR, Spring, lexis)<br />
“What is a legal person is for the law … “rights” runs contrary to their own “interests.”<br />
<br />
The supreme court has a moral imperative to declare fetal personhood and prevent the slaughter and enslavement of millions of embryos<br />
Lugosi in 2005 (St Thomas Law, Issues in Law and Medicine, Spring, Lexis)<br />
“There is a moral imperative to affirm and constitutionally … to abolish the laws that have revived a new form of human slavery in Twenty-first Century America.”<br />
<br />
The Court’s refusal to recognize fetuses as alive and human is based upon the same categorical dismissal of humanity that formed the basis for the worst atrocities in history. Abortion is literally the most pernicious expression of democratic rights ever manifested.<br />
Gairdner in 2006 (William, PhD, Stanford, MA, Structural Linguistics, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.williamgairdner.com/abortion-and-slavery/" rel="nofollow">http://www.williamgairdner.com/abortion-and-slavery/</a>)<br />
The importance of such category … work them to death, or simply to liquidate them<br />
<br />
Legal sanction promotes abortion—a reverse in the court’s direction on abortion would lead to a cultural shift that would never allow for another Roe.<br />
Robinson in 2005 (Edward,<br />

Comment: My first reaction to your … parts for the supposed benefit of others.<br />
<br />
Relying on a static conception of personhood is the logic that justified slavery – the fetus must be granted personhood and protected under the 14th amendment<br />
Aljalian 99 (Natasha, St John’s LR, spring, texas)<br />
It is commonly argued that one must be born … constitutional protection as a “person” under the Fourteenth Amendment.”<br />
<br />
abortion is a special case that we must always have an absolute side constraint against—any moral system that rejects this precept hopelessly devalues life<br />
Sisk in 2005 ( St Thomas School of Law, 43 Catholic Law. 255)<br />
”Archbishop Charles J. Chaput of Denver has … doctrine and morals to which all faithful Catholics must confess.”<br />
<br />
Even if they win that obligations to the future exist, when balanced against present day suffering, the case outweighs. Their framework is grossly immoral, diverts us from current responsibilities, ignores issues of certainty and is the ultimate in intellectual and ethical arrogance.<br />

Federalism- Federal judicial interference in the realm of abortion upsets the balance of federalism.<br />
Wardle in 99 (Lynn, BYU Law, 62 Alb. L. Rev. 853)<br />
“The Roe decision “constitutionalized” a controversy…legislation has been invalidated by federal courts.”<br />
<br />
CP- Doesn’t solve because does not enshrine a personhood standard in the Constitution.<br />
<br />
Stare Decisis- is a defense of judicial activism, creates doctrinal problems for constitutional law, places court precedent above constitutional text, as necessary for public confidence- this arrogance has lead to the court’s cavalier striking down of legislative acts<br />
Michael Stokes Paulsen, 2k3 “The worst constitutional decision of all time” 78 Notre Dame L. Rev. 995)<br />
<br />
Stare decisis in Casey creates a superficial veneer of lawfulness to a decision not defensible on its own terms, a disingenuous cover to enhance the courts own power through the transparently manipulable stare decisis which is not absolute, and ironically which casey meets all four factors for an overrule- the decision itself overruled two cases<br />
Paulsen again…<br />
“There is a reason for this…of decision was outright dishonest”<br />
<br />
Stare decisis props up elites- assures no radical or revolutionary attacks on the status quo- no threatening issues are ever put on the agenda, its disruptive to tell oppressors that can no longer oppress<br />
Lynne, Henderson 1991 “authoritarianism and the rule of law” 66 Ind. L. J. 379<br />
<br />
Court got it backwards in Casey- court should rule on merits of constitutionality instead of invoking phony reliance interests- particularly when other political branches are urging reconsideration<br />
Calabresi 2005 “Text, precedent, and the Constitution: some originalist and normative arguments for overruling parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey” Constitutional Commentary, June 22, 2005 p 311 Vol 22 No 2 ISSN 0742-7115<br />

No internal link between the US econ and the World econ<br />
Abortion institutes aren’t key to the whole econ<br />
There are still other support for the econ<br />
We don’t expand biotech industry<br />
Case outweighs more probable happening now<br />
Don’t evaluate Futuristic impacts that’s our 1ac Evidence<br />
Nuclear war isn’t possible<br />

2AC Answers to: Court Stripping<br />
<br />
O evidence is specific to the plan<br />
T/ Fiat solves the credibility of the court<br />
We rule on the 14th amendment, means we don’t link<br />
Court stripping is occurring now<br />
T/ GOP supports our plan means there wont be any stripping<br />
Case Outweighs<br />
<br />
2AC Answers to: judgment isn’t opinion<br />
<br />
Destroys the ability of the aff, no aff overturns all aspects of the decision<br />
Not grounded legally<br />
The decision defines fetus<br />
Counter-Interp – Overrule is to make obsolete<br />
Vote aff, b/c the topic is already bias toward the neg<br />
reasonability<br />
<br />
2AC Answers to: Test Case Spec<br />
<br />
Not grounded in the resolution<br />
There are millions of cases that the court can use<br />
Plan is still in your jurisdiction<br />
Cross-X checks<br />
Alt grounds cp’s solve all of their offense<br />
Specific case based on overturning a case is better<br />
<br />
Add-on advantages: None
