Education is not neutral they should be held accountable for running framework<br />
Fw celebrates white man<br />
Friere Banking Edu – necrophilic, make oppressed mechanistic, revisionist bad<br />
Strategies of the oppressed are seen an unpredictable.<br />
Liberation of the oppressed is topical- we capture shively<br />
USFG is inaccessible to the oppressed<br />
They cede agency to the government, cede responsibility<br />
People are what matter theory and agency<br />
We are resolved<br />
They prescribe solutions, which recreates oppression<br />
SC can be libratory but not for me. Answers shively they make us into something we are not.<br />
Role playing SC is bad, not empowering. Or educational<br />
Grammar recreates guilt, create a system when Spanish speaking would be excluded<br />
We aren’t the endpoint of change, we push transformation outwards.<br />
They mischaracterize our story, not about good/bad, misses the point about our narrative,<br />
moral systems area a false choice<br />
We can change those systems, abortion is morally complex we need a nuanced response<br />
Must consider social location<br />
Strategy of ethnic cleansing, rape women, they were tools of war.<br />
Neg ignores this, makes these women responsible,<br />
They are like ethic cleansing, by siding with babies<br />
Their arguments reinforce guilt.<br />
Make all women bad mothers, and makes women subservient.<br />
Violence becomes inevitable<br />
That rhetoric is bad, purity of the fetus makes the women invisible.<br />
Abortion bad gets them no where. Back ally abortions replete<br />
Life of the mother becomes less important than they become invisible<br />
Women have already had abortion<br />
They cant access bush creating health centers, bush would never create those centers for Hispanic<br />
Universality is negative, legitimates colonization,<br />
Question of ethic and existence. We should consider what we should do<br />
We shouldn’t use universal law, bc the state would just co-opt it and lead to more oppression<br />

Self Destruction comes first.<br />
Cp will be co-opted by the states leads to harms of the 1ac the church will take over<br />
The counter plan is not practical<br />
Framework means cp doesn’t matter<br />
Minorities wont get access<br />
Not allowing women to have abortions is bad<br />
We should focus on guilt and destroy the trinity<br />
Cultural death is essentialized, you need to understand the experience<br />
Latinas are given false choices we change that<br />
Prolife ignores women who kill children to save themselves and children<br />
They are tools to resist rape, oppressors ruin women’s races<br />
Serb example<br />
Their rhetoric is violence<br />
Empowerment stops bad conditions solves for the harms<br />
They don't answer our counter interp to<br />
Sovereignty rests w the people, we are resolved better for social location<br />
Their agency claims mask<br />
Banking systems, objectifies people<br />
We need to resist systems from our social status.<br />
They destroy praxis<br />
They lead to necrophilia,<br />
They sp;lit theory and advocacy that is bad<br />
They had many options<br />
Perm goes our way<br />
If we win their edu is not libratory, and we don't exclude means we get their evidence<br />
We need a multiplicity of views<br />
We are the only ones who can solve<br />
They are false alterity,<br />
we directly challenge the supreme court, solve assimilation, destruction of revolution, their edu is worse they center is on the state<br />
their reference about policy edu leading to agency is bad<br />
They justify violence<br />
We are not all policy makers they divide debate and mean we cant be empowered<br />
<h3 id="toc11"><a name="Doubles-Fullerton MM-2ar Strategy Notes"></a><strong><em>2ar Strategy Notes</em></strong></h3>
Oppression inev in their framework<br />
We reconceptualize the virgin, only we solve for guilt,<br />
We are a pre-req for our framework,<br />
Exclusion inev in their framework<br />
Elite should be excluded<br />
Novalue to life in their framework. For minorities<br />
You teach college debaters to exclude undoctumeted immigrants<br />
We have no ethical stance<br />
Ballot is ethical stance against self hatred. We can create education and self responsibility<br />
Pre-req to overcome totalitarianism<br />
Debate creates strategy our social location means we get shively evidence<br />
Our form of the topic include all legal status,<br />
Politics exists at all levels<br />
We push transformation, coalition politics<br />
Reform political system means we wont be coopted<br />
You should talk about the gov if it is your social location, but then you force that edu on us which is bad and exclusionary<br />
Permutation, they don't allow other political strategy<br />
Predictability is inevitable. Doesn’t matter enough to justify exclusion or oppression<br />
Not just about quantity of edu it is about libratory edu and oppression you are banking.<br />
Their forms aren’t accessable to the oppressed, we use our own agency<br />
They defer agency that leads to necrophilia<br />
Hierarchy of politics justifies assimilation, hooks and friere.<br />
Assimilation is the biggest impact and should have ethical alignment.<br />
t/s no universal truth means grammar arguments go away,<br />
they create guilt about what language is alright that leads to subordination.<br />

Assimiliation is self-destruction and any self-esteem can only be achieved by destroying others. The solution is neither to overidentity with one’s own culture but to recognize that we are all universal within our particulars.<br />
Aceves 2004. (Carlos, Me.d @ Univ. of Texas &amp; Activist in Education, “The Xinachtli Project: Transforming Whiteness though Mythic Pedagogy,” Identityfing Race and Transforming Whiteness in the Classroom, ed. 262.<br />

CARDS:<br />
Recognition of our role in oppression and the move to empower ourselves instead of disempower the oppressor is the opposite of Nietzsche’s slave morality.<br />
Brown, Wendy. (professor of political science at UC Berkeley, “Politics out of History.” 2001. p25-26.<br />
“To be sure, a theological pathos…universal human rights.”<br />
We must not separate Nietzsche’s philosophy and prejudice as they affect each other. It is critical to understand how his theory was intended. In understanding this, we must reject his philosophy that endorsed authority and oppression.<br />
Schutte, 1986. [“Beyond Nihilism: Nietzsche without masks.” Ofelia Schutte PHD. Yale University. P 1865-88.<br />
“Having said this much…are not convincing.”<br />
<br />
500 yrs we were taught to desire something we were not devalue our own cultures and lives assimilate into the other.<br />
It’s about breaking from this change, embracing a way of life in which we oppose we have the agency to do so.<br />
Should be about learning and giving strategies to the oppressed, debate is intellectual masturbation.<br />
I have the choice of intervening – impact turn theirs<br />
They are the their k – can’t win. Scapegoat and holding violent institutions accountable.<br />
Allows oppressor relieve themselves<br />
The oppressed accept their oppressed as it is inevitable<br />
See people massacred and no one is responsible<br />
Alternative does not solve the aff.<br />
Hold systems of whiteness not white people – male body, elite body, use system deliberately knowing the physical and psychological accountability<br />
Do violence against our indigenous brothers – not a one sided system.<br />
Use the strategies of the oppressed – become the oppressed<br />
Forced them tot alk about why the specific project<br />
No contextual argument<br />
Create same universal valley<br />
Exclude movements and theirs would be a world of weakness<br />
Their alternative does nothing – vote on cognitive not about having pride of your culture but understanding that differences exist.<br />
Imagining a new world – this is about overcoming oppressive methodologies.<br />
Be humanist in creating movements prereq<br />
Gandhi socially structured something make others sufferer as the suffer does<br />
Solidarity rooted in solid belief – not a fetish to create<br />
Women were fueled by opposition.<br />
Their claim that pain only makes us weak – differences about using it to transcend the pain<br />
Come to grips with our sufferings – exclude the Zapatistas who use their own oppression<br />
Oppression who purposely creates – Nietzsche theory about the evil dichotomy but he never attempted to overcome it<br />
Creating more oppression – affirm life perpetuate the culture<br />
Genocide and slavery – children satisfied – cannot be successful<br />
Western solution – no idea about latino culture<br />
In their world latinos would be exterminated.<br />
Everyone enjoys life in the same way – inferiority privilege<br />
Don’t solve the alternative<br />
Child does not just love life after being humiliated<br />
How does a child transcend – in a younger transition – loss of value to life is inevitable<br />
We come to understand there are differences – form of culture no practical<br />
They become complicit, never exemplify this as oppressive function – no action – cosmic form of race their evidence talks about how identities are inevitable the only way we can not talk about it means we leave those in tact and leave them as oppressed.<br />

If debate is not about this, it is only intellectual masturbation.<br />
We’re all oppressed takes out alternative<br />
Extend perm<br />
Don’t answer impact turn. Scape goating people.<br />
Scapegoating is inevitable – solve terminal impact.<br />

Ballot = ethical alignment w/ canonization. Act of mourning &amp; suffering key to finding strategies.<br />
Personal strategies = prereq to political strategies<br />
Their evidence says that it’s impossible to create new forms of government, meaning the neg either advocates the SQ or intellectual masturbation.<br />
Their framework args uphold power structures of white men &amp; those who assimilate into it. Allows for continued combination by the elite.<br />
FW = banking system of education. Makes us mechanistic. Freire.<br />
Root of aff is to overcome scapegoating. Guilt leads to scapegoating<br />
FW leads to debate as a form of competition, not forum for understanding.<br />
Limits is the same logic to exclude migrant immigrants.<br />
Under their framework, aff is forced to always defend SC.<br />
Counter interpretation: agency should reside with the people, not the state.<br />
Not all people can access the SC<br />

<strong>Mythic pedagogy is the transcendence of identity that is imposed on by oppressive institutions. It is the recognition the identity is never static but constantly changing</strong><br />
Aceves 2004 (<u>Identifying race and transforming whiteness in the classroom.</u> Page 265-6)<br />
“in this early writing” … universe”<br />
<strong>Universal truths don’t exist. We must understand truths as resideing in the totality of a situation</strong><br />
Aceves, same, p 267<br />
“truth is often viewed” … “sit around it”<br />
<br />
<strong><u>1AR:</u></strong><br />
- role of aff is to stop preference of one over another<br />
- dangerous to elevate one strategy over another - disregards identity of oppressed<br />
- intersection key - fight next to the oppressed, not distance ourselves from them<br />
- self - hatred is the root cause - splits coalition and makes any solvency impossible<br />
- debate is shitty for women b/c of the self hate - discourages from joining the activity<br />
- our strategy better understands culture and location of debaters<br />
- they don't actually question judges privelage<br />
- necessary to solve oppression - we are all particulars w/in a universal<br />
<strong><u>2AR:</u></strong><br />
Similar to 1AR: no link, privelaging bad, permutation-type arg, alt isn’t any better for opressed, intersectionality good, self-hate is root cause<br />

Disowned by my family, and<br />
Expelled from the Christian school that calls me the heretic, the blasphemer, the disbeliever.<br />
But worse still,<br />
I would be lashed, and internal and external lashing that gapes my soul and physically opens up the wounds that are carried by my father, my brother, and my daughter.<br />

Part II: Mental Colonization:<br />
<br />
At the center of the Aztec calendar is a human face. Most Mexicanos who look into the piercing eyes of the Sun Stone see something they know but have difficulty articulating. The language of this ancient text is unknown to them, deprived of its use for nearly four hundred years. [Mexicanos] are expressing a dilemma articulated by those who have been colonized and have not recovered their history, a history confined in museums and used in academic interpretations by a society that uses it for its own objectification rather than as an active avenue of knowledge. Part of what Mexicanos are saying when reluctantly accepting a historic tie to the face of the Tonal Machiotl (Aztec calendar) is “It’s my face but it looks foreign to me. Part of me is not understandable to my psyche.” Another implication is racial in nature. The face in the calendar is an indigenous face, but how can it be mine if I am no longer indigenous? These questions reflect an internal conflict affected by five centuries of European colonization. Reclaiming this face would be an act against the mental colonization during three hundred years under the colonizer, under whiteness. (257)<br />
<br />
Part III: Whiteness and Milliken v. Bradley.<br />
<br />
The mechanisms of whiteness that legitimize cultural destruction occur through power relations that privilege a certain identity. Such hegemonic tactics do not directly appear discriminatory, nor do they seem to target and punish bodies of color, but they lie hidden in the structures that make it. For example, in Milliken v. Bradley, the Court held that integration remedies could extend across district lines only where districts had purposely engaged in a policy of segregation. This decision reinforced the existing trend of &quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight" rel="nofollow">white flight</a>&quot; from cities to suburban school districts. The Court implicitly ignored de facto segregation that resulted from voluntary residential segregation.<br />
<br />
This logic permeates the educational and cultural system where institutions protect the choices and cultural values of those who embody whiteness, while marginalizing the social existence of entire communities like Latinos and Mexicanos. As a result we have justified a hyper segregation where we elevate one culture—and as a result one curriculum—over the other—A curriculum that is based on Western values, English-only norms, Christian traditional values, and western scientific explanations for creation. De facto racism permeates western curriculum under the guise of “neutral standards” and “meritocracy” as it prohibits and condemns the use of Spanish by punishing students with detention, slapping hands with a ruler or being paddled and as it marginalizes alternate pedagogical possibilities, like the use of stories and readings that uphold values that are not relevant to western culture. Those who hold political and economic power portray the European image as universal and superior, disregarding our own educational contributions to math, literature, philosophy and the creation story. Carlos Aceves states that “This is detrimental for two reasons. It caused in the people a kind of cultural psychosis and inferiority complex by looking and living a brown life but having to pretend to be white” (260). We are taught to assimilate and conform to Western educational mechanisms.<br />
<br />
The erasure of our bodies through the erasure of our cultural becoming becomes a violent act to our psyches, making us self-destructive. We are taught to believe that our bodies, our histories are not worthy sources of knowledge, even though it is what makes us. We are taught to hate that part of ourselves that will deny us success in the dominant culture. In fact, I may not be literally lashed when I dwell upon understanding my roots through the Sun Stone, but the suppression of such knowledge is a way to mummify our identity. As long as it remains mummified, we will fall prey to the psyche of dependency and low self-esteem. We begin to be embarrassed for who we are when we speak Spanglish or embrace some of our cultural traditions, like wearing guaraches or proudly saying that we are Mexican, this makes us humiliate all those who wear their identity proudly. We secretly become the hands that whip our people because that is the only way we can gain power. We whip ourselves every time we look at the Sun Stone and laugh at its meaning.<br />
<br />
But, it is the Sun Stone that makes us. Unless we understand this ancient document and what lies in that stern face in relation to our respective lives, then we cannot achieve our own liberation. Carlos Acevedes contends that by presenting the face of the Sun Stone in the classroom it allows students to recognize their own fluidity within their own particular existence in relation to the creation story. As Acevedes states “My identification …kinship with Creation” (258).<br />
<br />
This mythic pedagogy carried itself into the Xinachtli Project, a project created in the 1990’s by Chicana/o activists who sought to address the loss of ancestral culture in schools. The term Xinachtli is a Nahuatl word that means “seed”, within the educational context it describes the seed of culture being nurtured to grow. The goal of the program is to make Mexicanos owners of their culture<a href="http://opencaselist.wikispaces.com/Fullerton+MM+Aff#_ftn2">[2</a>]. As students learn to use the dates of the calendar and understand its story the sun stone becomes alive and empowering to students who critically affirm it instead of just viewing it as some static objectified artifact.<br />
<br />
The Xinachtli Project uses teaching methods that are rooted in indigenous traditions such as using the Thahtokan or Speaking circle where students can share their experiences. The setting of the circle reminds students that ideas spoken in the circle are not “universal” truths, creating a sense of mutual respect within students. Other projects consist of placing memorable incidents and feelings in a box and setting them on fire where students are explained that traumatic emotions are released in the smoke while good emotional experiences are enhanced by the fire and sahred with the universe. The use of indigenous culture via the mythic process allows students to find empowerment within themselves and to actively use their culture as part of the critical thinking process. Without this we cannot dismantle the imposed identity of colonialism or the defacto racist tendencies that elevate a Western curriculum over our identities, but rather we would be perpetuating the internal mental colonialism under an indigenous title. Without interaction based on mutual respect and free of the burden of oppressed-oppressor relationship, people condemn themselves to a schizophrenic cultural mode (262).<br />
Debate should be about the liberation of the oppressed. Brenda and I believe that Miliken v. Bradley in relation to our social location gives us an opportunity to denounce the way that de facto and de jure discrimination functions through systems of oppression. Nullifying the dichotomy of segregation versus integration in Miliken v. Bradley allows us to realize that systems of oppression take a larger psychological and detrimental effect in the everyday curriculum of the classroom rather than on governmental policies. We can learn from the myth of the sun stone and attempt to dismantle cultural hierarchies by adopting the concept of the fifth Sun and its people, la raza cosmica, the cosmic race, an identity that challenges binary category constructions, from race to nationality to gender to sexuality to language. The ballot becomes a stand in solidarity with adopting this mythic pedagogy and the transgressions taken by the Xinachtli project to create a space for ourselves and others.<br />
Brenda and I take the following memories and burn the hatred that we have had towards ourselves, others and our culture; we allow the fire to embrace our souls, we willingly give this part of ourselves as a sign of representing Xinachtli—a moment of infinite possibilities.<br />

White man came onto the land, and they passed down the Word of the Lord:<br />
<br />
Proverbs 6:16-17: (16) There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to him: (17) ...[one of which is] hands that shed innocent blood...<br />
<br />
Deuteronomy 27:25a: &quot;Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe* to kill an innocent person,&quot;....<br />
<br />
Exodus 21:22a, 23a: 22[The LORD said to Moses] &quot;If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman... 23[and] there is serious injury, you are to take life for life....&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew 19:14: Jesus said, &quot;Let the little children come to me,... for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&quot;<br />
(Read similar verses in Mark 10:14 and Luke 18:16.)<br />
<br />
Matthew 18:6: [Jesus said] &quot;But if anyone causes one of these little ones to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.&quot;<br />
(Read similar verses in Mark 9:42 and Luke 17:2.)<br />
<br />
To the thirsty I will give water without price<br />
From the fountain of the water of life<br />
He who conquers shall have this heritage<br />
And I will be his God and he shall be my son<br />
<br />
But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted<br />
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolators, and all liars<br />
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone.&quot;<br />

<br />
The story of La Malinche – the woman who betrayed Mexico—who would later be called La Llorna – the Crying woman –begins in 1521 with the arrival of Herman Cortez and Catholicism. The Aztecs, believing Cortez to be their lost god Quetzalcoatle sent a peaceful welcoming with figs with 20 other women as guides. Cortes did not receive the women with the same purpose as they were sent. He assigned the women to certain men, who raped them for no reason. Cortes took Malintzin, a 14 year-old, as his concubine. Malintzin’s multilingual talents became essential to mobilize indigenous groups against the Aztecs. When Malintzin gave birth to Martin, the first mestizo child, she was considered a traitor to Mexico. Even though more indigenous men sided with Cortez, it was Malintzin who took blame and became the outcast. When Cortez was leaving for Spain he wanted to take his son. It is said that the worst thing that could happen in Aztec culture was to die away from your land. It meant that your spirit would be cast into eternal damnation. Malintzin, seeing the genocide that Cortez inflicted on her people, took her child to the lake where she killed the child.<br />
<br />
<br />
She cried out of horror and pain to see her child float away and to see her people raped and massacred. As a result she drowned herself in the river. When she reached the gates of heaven, God told her she couldn’t enter until the soul of her child and the others were found. She is thus found wandering in the lakes, oceans and rivers in our world crying for her children.<br />
<br />
The story of La Llorona has been inflicted upon Latino culture since the time of colonization. Our ancestors have handed it down in order to enforce Catholic values, in order to keep chains over our bodies and minds, strongly encouraging maternal duty. The pain of La Llorna inflicts scars on the bodies and souls of everyone, including ourselves. Her screech remains equally terrifying; the screech of psychological agony repeats itself in the minds and dream of all those women who betrayed their role as a mother. She is the ghost that wanders between our conscious and sexuality condemning us every time we masturbate, every time we orgasm, every time women caress other women, every time we refuse to get married, every time we don’t want to have children, every time we abort them and kill them, every time we choose our independence. La Llorona reminds us of her destiny becoming our own, becoming La Chingada – the fucked, the whores, and the bad mothers that will be refused entrance from the heavens and condemned by God. Through her story we are raised not to love ourselves; we are taught to give no meaning to our lives. The guilt that has been inflicted on us has allowed us to let others do violence against us; it has allowed us to do violence against others. We are taught not to trust each other because we don’t deserve better, we selfishly want others to be haunted by the ghost of La Llorona and so we continue to tell her story preventing us from ever uniting, understand one another.<br />
<br />
And yet, for centuries Latina women have transgressed their gender role by practicing abortion as a means to escape socio-economic problems, psychological terror, and in order to protect themselves or their child. Yet for too long the women’s movement and conservatives have exhibited whiteness and ignored the cultural dimensions that abortion carries to Latina women. The woman’s movement having claimed victory in Roe v Wade ignored that the only women available to choose were women of privilege. Conservatives believe that they protect Latino populations by protecting the fetus and upholding Catholic values. Planned Parenthood v Casey has become the linchpin of both of these frameworks. Women with language barriers who have to go through the informed consent process are not only heavily disadvantaged in terms of communication, but are forced to expose and re-explain their decision for an abortion ignoring that his process already creates internal psychological trauma. Despite the promise to make abortion accessible the current system ignores and dismisses the psychological are not women of color, they are not familiar with cultural norms and instead essentialize Latina cultures into one. Simply, the neutral programs are not accessible to womyn who don’t speak English fluently and attempt to use scientific explanations to prove how an abortion affects a group of cells and not a child. But for man Latina women it doesn’t matter if we were raped, if we are too poor, if we want to protect ourselves, we are carried on with an insurmountable cultural guilt. Caught in a guilt laden, criminalized, dehumanized position as the ‘evil’ mothers that we have become the core of social disintegration, a dominant culture has taken over us for centuries. Colonization drives us, producing inward-hate, and therefore, internalized racism, sexism, homophobia!<br />
<br />
But…our identity and psychological dilemma is also what gives us meaning and possibilities of subverting the cultural norms imposed on us. According to Kathleen Borgan our stories of cultural haunting, like La Llorona, suggests that ethnicity is a function of memory, it is an attempt for cultures to conjure up ghosts and learn from ancestral ghost, to recreate identities into culture. La Llorona has become the identity given to Latina women who have made the choice to abort. Regardless, the church, making them sinners who will burn for eternity, condemns their decision. As the sinners and the condemned, we recognize that La Llorona was never given a proper burial or given forgiveness. La Llorona is the cultural ghost that has become our destiny. We live with this psychological oppression because our culture has betrayed and silenced our women. Our culture’s Christianity has become the new Cortez. As Gloria Anzaldua speaks in Boderlands “It was Not me sold out my people, but they sold me…the worst kind of betrayal lies in making us believe that the Indian woman in us is the betrayer…For 300 years she was invisible, she was not heard. Man times she wished to speak, to act, to protest, to challenge. The odds were heavily against her. She hid her feelings…she concealed her fire; but she kept stoking the inner flame. She remained faceless and voiceless, but a light shone through her veil of silence…The spirit of the fire spurs her to fight for her own skin and a piece of ground to stand on, a ground from which to view the world—a perspective, a homeground where she can plumb the rich ancestral roots into her own ample Mestiza heart…Aqui en la soledad prospera su rebeldia…here in her solitude her rebellion prospers.<br />
<br />
Brenda and I believe that we can transform this cultural haunting by canonizing La Llorona. Canonization can grant us a cultural transgression of the haunting that has promulgated a deeply entrenched psychological dislocation and trauma. Through this we can transform the powerful image of Christianity in Latino culture as a tool of empowerment for women. Making Malintzin, La Llorona, a saint allows us to use her wailings as a way to properly mourn our guilt as well as to mourn the children that have been aborted . As Anzaldua continues “The Aztecs female rites of mourning were rites of defiance of protesting the cultural changes which disrupted the equality and balance between female and male, and protesting their demotion to a lesser status, their denigration.” We believe debate should be about the liberation of the oppressed. Canonizing La Llorono becomes a starting point for pushing transformation outward and achieving societal transformation by changing the Supreme Court image of womyn as controllable and inferior. The ballot represents an of solidarity with canonizing La Llorona as a possibility of transgression. We believe that La Llorona can help our society toward the completion of a mourning that will help women overcome their guilt and trauma over abortion. We believe that a proper way of mourning means using her symbolism in a productive view and incorporate her into our daily life to help us as guidance. For centuries we have been taught to mourn malignly by allowing La Llorona and the children we have killed to haunt us, reminding us that we have to repent for our actions and decision.<br />
<br />
She’s always borne for everybody’s sins,<br />
Nobody’s ever offered a mass<br />
for La Llorna, wicked mother<br />
grieving on the riverbank<br />
wailing through the streets<br />
haunting the causeways<br />
of our island-hearts<br />
nobody’s ever asked<br />
why she is still<br />
not canonized , devil’s matry.<br />
(Gaspar de Alba, Alicia 2003)<br />
<br />
The accomplishments and miracles of La Llorona shall be recognized for having the courage to sacrifice her children for the greater good, for being capable of using mourning as a weapon to redeem the pains of guilt, and for carrying the burden of colonization.<br />
<br />
Thus we declare and define Blessed Malintzin Tenapal, also known as La Malinche and La Llorona, as enrolled among the saints, decreeing that she is to be veneraged in the whole church of one of the saints. (Towards her image of her): In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit…Amen.
