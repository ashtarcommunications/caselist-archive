In an appropriate test case, the United States Supreme Court will declare that its decision in United States v Morrison is overruled insofar as its federalism analysis is based on a flawed model of “dual-federalism.” The Court will adopt a cooperative federalism test to determine the legitimacy of federal lawmaking authority.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc5"><a name="x-Harvard AK Aff-1ac w/ cites"></a><em>1ac w/ cites</em></h3>
OBSERVATION ONE: The Morrison Decision Entrenched a Strict Dualist Model of Federalism<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision is grounded in an attempt by the Court to preserve a dualist notion of federalism pitting the states against the federal government, while rejecting the notion of a cooperative model. Professor Goldfarb of Rutgers Law in ‘02<br />
<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor of Law, Rutgers University, 2002 [“The Supreme Court, The Violence Against Women Act, And The Use And Abuse Of Federalism” 71 Fordham L. Rev. 57, October] p. 59-63<br />
“Among the infinite variations on the theme”<br />
<br />
We isolate two harm scenarios from the Court’s federalism analysis in Morrison.<br />
<br />
One: Dual Federalism Undermines Rights and Freedom<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision’s revival of the abstract and antiquated notion of “states’ rights” federalism threatens individual liberty. We isolate three reasons. First, this federalism construct has once again become a powerful tool for conservative activists to restrict liberty. Professor Chemerinsky of Duke Law in ‘02<br />
<br />
Erwin Chemerinsky, visiting professor at Duke Law School, Fall ’02, Human Rights: Journal of the Section of Individual Rights &amp; Responsibilities, Vol. 29, Issue 4, ASP<br />
“My point so far has been that”<br />
<br />
Second, Morrison’s insistence on abstract and antiquated notions of “state’s rights” ignores the reality that the states are often unable to adequately protect rights on their own and look to assistance from the federal government, as was the case with the VAWA. Professors Brown and Enrich of Northeastern and Boston College Law Schools in 2000:<br />
<br />
Judith Olans Brown And Peter D. Enrich, Professor Emerita, Northeastern University School Of Law; A. B., Mount Holyoke College; Ll. B., Boston College Law School, 2000 [“Nostalgic Federalism “ 28 Hastings Const. L.Q. 1, Fall]<br />
“ [*62] Conversely, the Court's nostalgic”<br />
<br />
Third, Morrison’s federalism concept shields state actors from accountability for their actions. Professor MacKinnon of Michigan Law in 2000:<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law, University of Michigan, 2000, Harvard Law Review, November, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. 135-6<br />
“ Last Term, in United States v. Morrison,”<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision thus represents the effort by the Court to privilege abstract doctrine over individual dignity and rights. This choice has fueled wars and political violence throughout the world. Ambassador Koppelmen in 1990:<br />
Kopplemen, US Ambassador to CSCE, WORLD AFFAIRS, Summer 1990, p. unknown (PDCL2274)<br />
”Yet, these great advances in the human “<br />
<br />
Each invasion of liberty must be rejected. Professor Petro of Wake Forest Law in 1974:<br />
Sylvester Petro, Professor of Law, Wake Forest University, TOLEDO LAW REVIEW, 1974, p. 480 (MHBLUE1523)<br />
”It is seldom that liberty “<br />
<br />
Overruling Morrison’s dualistic federalism in favor of a more cooperative model energizes both federal and state level civil rights action and reasserts the proper federal role in that effort. Professor Goldfarb again in 2002:<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor Of Law, Rutgers University, 2002 [“The Supreme Court, The Violence Against Women Act, And The Use And Abuse Of Federalism” 71 Fordham L. Rev. 57, October]<br />
“Central to the Morrison Court's “<br />
<br />
Only by rejecting the dualistic notion of federalism in favor of a dynamic and cooperative model can the hoped-for benefits of federalism as a system for preserving freedom and guarding against tyranny be realized. Professor Schapiro of Emory Law School in 2005:<br />
<br />
Robert A. Schapiro, Professor Of Law, Emory University School Of Law, 2005 [“Toward A Theory Of Interactive Federalism” 91 Iowa L. Rev. 243, October]<br />
“ The attempt to define quintessentially”<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: TERRORISM<br />
<br />
OVERTURNING MORRISON IS CRITICAL TO INCREASING COOPERATION AND COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE ANTI-TERROR EFFORTS<br />
<br />
Richman, Daniel C., &quot;The Future of Violent Crime Federalism&quot; (May 2005). Fordham Law Legal Studies Research Paper No. 82“This responsibility on the part of states and their”<br />
AND ONLY A COOPERATIVE MODEL AND PROTECT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WHILE EFFECTIVELY COMBATING TERRORISM<br />

AND THE IMPACT IS EXTINCTION<br />

“ That deceptively simple “<br />
<br />
Advantage Three: Judicial Tyranny<br />
<br />
The revival of the dualist federalism model is based on flawed analysis, is unstable and reckless. Professor Jackson of Georgetown Law in ‘01<br />
Jackson 01: Vicki C. Jackson, Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, October 2001. Duke Law Journal, 51 Duke L.J. 223<br />
“The dramatic title of the conference”<br />
<br />
In Morrison, the Court rejected a long time doctrine of deference to Congressional determinations of its commerce clause authority based on a rational basis test. The Arkansas Law Review in 2001:<br />
University of Arkansas at Little Rock Law Review, 2001, [Jennifer L. Wethington, JD Candidate], Winter, 23 U. Ark. Little Rock L. Rev. 485, p. 507<br />
“ By invalidating the Civil Rights Remedy “<br />
<br />
The Court’s abandonment of rational basis deference substitutes the views of individual judges for those of elected representatives. Professor Sargentich of American University in 2003:<br />
<br />
Thomas O. Sargentich, Law Professor, American University, 2003, Widener Law Journal, 12 Widener L.J. 459, p. 465<br />
“The Rehnquist Court majority has”<br />
<br />
The Court justified its renewed mission to restrict Congressional authority on the argument that it must be subjected to some limit and the Court must be the arbiter. On the basis of this flawed analysis the Court inappropriately usurps the power from the democratic process where it was intended to reside. Justice Souter eloquently explains in dissent in 2000:<br />
Souter, 2000, United States v. Morrison, Dissenting Opinion, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-5.ZO.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-5.ZO.html</a><br />
“Although Madison had emphasized “<br />
<br />
Failure to reign in the current wave of activism against Congressional authority as elucidated in the Morrison decision threatens the federalist balance envisioned in the Constitution. We must stop it now. Professor Arceneaux of Loyola University in 2001:<br />
<br />
Scott Arceneaux, Adjuunct Professor At Loyola University New Orleans School Of Law, 2001 [“Federalism In The Balance: How The Supreme Court's Recent Federalism Opinions Are Threatening To Upset The Delicate Balance Between The Federal Courts, Congress, And The States” 47 Loy. L. Rev. 797, Summer]<br />
“ Like an antique timepiece, with each part working”<br />
<br />
The political process advantages of federalism can only be achieved if we return their enforcement to the political branches and the states. Graglia, Law professor at Texas in 2003:<br />
<br />
Lino A. Graglia, Law Professor, Texas, 2003, Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy, Winter, 26 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y 281, p. 294-5<br />
“The preservation of some degree of policy-making”<br />
<br />
There is no justification for the Court’s dual federalism model expounded in Morrison. Courts should return to the practice of deference to Congressional determination of enumerated power on a rational basis. This is consistent with the founders intent, and provides the most appropriate checks on federal power. NYU Law Professor Kramer in 2000:<br />
Larry D. Kramer, NYU Law Professor, 2000, Columbia Law Review, January, 100 Colum. L. Rev. 215, p. 289-94<br />
“ So, again, we must ask: Why is the Court “<br />
<br />
We propose the following plan:<br />
In an appropriate test case, the United States Supreme Court will declare that its decision in United States v Morrison is overruled insofar as its federalism analysis is based on a flawed model of “dual-federalism.” The Court will adopt a cooperative federalism test to determine the legitimacy of federal lawmaking authority.<br />
<br />
We note the plan works in Observation Two: Solvency<br />
The precedent for injecting impact evaluation into the Court’s federalism analysis exists in Justice White’s dissent in New York v US. Professor Sargentich explains in 2003:<br />
<br />
Thomas O. Sargentich, Law Professor, American University, 2003, Widener Law Journal, 12 Widener L.J. 459, p. 481-3<br />

Fordham Int’l Law journal ‘3<br />
“Second, Justice Scalia. . . Arguing that the majority. . . holding as announcing an end to all morals”<br />
<br />
2. We meet—the plan uses the ICCPR to amplify understanding of the 14th amendment<br />

3. We meet—Lawrence v. Texas proves that use of international law—even though previously unmentioned—can overrule the cnetural holding of a decision<br />
Boston College international and Comparative Law Review 2006<br />
“One year later, Lawrence. . . substantive due process clause.”<br />
<br />
4. Counter interpretation—topical affs must reverse the final decision of one of the four cases.<br />

Kennedy will not politicize his decisions<br />
Above cite<br />
“He staid O’Connor was something of a “judicial . . .and understand it better.”<br />

Your generic link doesn’t apply to our plan—Kennedy ignores the political ramifications of decisions that cite international human rights law<br />

State Action Doctrine Adv. 1AC<br />
Only overturning the 14th amendment rationale of morrison overrules the state action doctrine of civil rights cases, which is crucial to combating racism. Francisco Ugarte, Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, 2k6 “the Fourteenth Amendment’s equality protection did not extend to private actors”<br />
<br />
Racism embeds sovereign power with the will to indiscriminately annihilate others – this is the key enabler for global atrocities and extinction. Eduardo Mendieta, 4-25-2k2 www.sunysb.edu “This is where racism intervenes, not from without”<br />
<br />
Overturning the state action doctrine is critical to forming a new empathetic humanism, challenging all forms of domination including the root causes of nuclear war and environmental collapse. Hayward Reynolds, Ohio NUL Rev. 1994 “Critical humanism is a way of being in the world that affirms the existence”<br />
<br />

State environmental suits da 2ac<br />
Environmental cases are overwhelmingly locating in federal courts now – multiple warrants Puder and Veil, 2k2 Vermont Law Review, “According to overwhelming statistics, environmentalists habitually”<br />
<br />
No link – their u card has 3 warrants: 1/standing in federal court has been limited 2/the supreme court gave the states jurisdiction, and 3/the court has upheld concurrent jurisdiction – we change none of these.<br />
<br />
No link – we do not federalize criminal law, only civil suits. All the ev they read from kemler says we would discredit state criminal systems not civil courts.<br />
<br />
No link – concurrent jurisdiction – Senator Biden, 2k, Harvard Journal on Legislation, “was narrowly drafted with the goals of minimizing”<br />
<br />
Empirically denied – vawa would have caused the link<br />
<br />
Not unique – lawyers are afraid to take suits to state courts. Elmendorf 2k1 Yale Law Journal, “This note assesses the state of the law”<br />
<br />
Federal courts key.<br />
<ol><li>state courts don’t solve federal environmental destruction. Elmendorf 2k1 Yale Law Journal, “state-court citizen suits will not prove a panacea for non-Article III”</li><li>the federal government is the biggest threat to bio d. Bekner Newsreview.com, 2k4 online “Lockyer claimed in testimony presented to California’s”</li><li>none of their evidence makes a comparative claim about federal courts – it just says states solve, not that the feds don’t</li></ol><br />

Plan:<br />
<br />
The United State Supreme Court should overrule the decision in United States v. Morrison [529 US 598] on the grounds that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights amplifies Congressional power under section 5 of the 14th Amendment sufficiently to sustain enactment of 42 USC 13981.<br />

1AC Plan Text (transcribe exactly):The United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in US v. Morrison [529 US 598] on the grounds that the International Covenant on Civil &amp; Political Rights amplifies Congressional power under section 5 of the 14th Amendment sufficiently to sustain enactment of 42 USC 13981<br />
<br />
2AC Answers to: Topicality – Overrule means Grounds in Original Decision<br />
<br />
We meet – reinterp the 14th amendment<br />
We meet – question of Morrison was whether Congress had authority, not why – Rehnquist in Morrison decision – In these cases we consider…section’s civil remedy<br />
We meet – plan says overrule<br />
Counter-Interp – topical affirmative must reverse final decision of one of four cases<br />
Decision is judgment, not opinion – West’s Encyclopedia of American Law 1998 – when referring to…determination made by the court<br />
To overrule means to reject – New Oxford American Dictionary – reject or disallow by…overruled the lower Court<br />
In the context of Morrison, the sole question was the legality of the remedy – Epstein 99 – “amici Brief for: Institution for Justice and Cato Institute, US V. Morrison” – The sole question in this…claims are manifestly mistaken<br />
Counter-interp sets fair limit and preserves a stable plan action which is enough ground<br />
Specification of grounds not extra-T<br />
Real world – Supreme Court never just changes its mind, its gives reasons for its decision<br />
Increases neg ground – they get links to the grounds and if new grounds then magnifies court da links<br />
Their interp bad<br />
Its too small – there are barely any affs, this interp would allow only five or six distinct plan texts as most<br />
Its unfair – any aff adv. Is non-unique because the opinions are on the books now, new grounds key to aff felx to read worthwhile advantages<br />
Its unpredictable – resolutions refers to “the” decisions, which denotes them as objects of import – however, the important (unique) characteristics of each decision is not its opinion, which is in many cases upheld or revised by later decisions, but the judgment – heres evidence on the “the question” – New Oxford American Dctionary 2005 – denoting one or more people..thing that is unique: the Queen…<br />
Don’t vote on competing interps – topics skewed neg, justifies hyper limited topics and escalates side bias – err to reasonability for Supreme Court topics – Gerhardt 2005 – Moreover, constitutional history reflects a growing awareness…reliability, predictability, stability, and finality<br />
<br />
Key 2AR explanations:<br />
We went for democracy impacts and a slew of solves case impacts (gender violence arguments) – the 2AR framed the debate as staying in idea of conflict is bad because gender violence is an ongoing conflict in itself and makes all other injustices inevitable. Our discourse concerning conflict turning case is untrue because it does not look at gender violence as a conflict that needs to be solved in itself (I think that was the 2AR explanation?)<br />

<br />
OBSERVATION ONE: The Morrison Decision Entrenched a Strict Dualist Model of Federalism<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision is grounded in an attempt by the Court to preserve a dualist notion of federalism pitting the states against the federal government, while rejecting the notion of a cooperative model. Professor Goldfarb of Rutgers Law in ‘02<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor of Law, Rutgers University, 2002 [“The Supreme Court, The Violence Against Women Act, And The Use And Abuse Of Federalism” 71 Fordham L. Rev. 57, October] p. 59-63<br />
“Among the infinite variations… both the Commerce Clause and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.”<br />
<br />
We isolate three harm scenarios from the Court’s federalism analysis in Morrison.<br />
<br />
<br />
One: Dual Federalism Undermines Rights and Freedom<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision’s revival of the abstract and antiquated notion of “states’ rights” federalism threatens individual liberty. We isolate three reasons. First, this federalism construct has once again become a powerful tool for conservative activists to restrict liberty. Professor Chemerinsky of Duke Law in ‘02<br />
Erwin Chemerinsky, visiting professor at Duke Law School, Fall ’02, Human Rights: Journal of the Section of Individual Rights &amp; Responsibilities, Vol. 29, Issue 4, ASP<br />
“My point so far has been… in an undesirable way.”<br />
<br />
Second, Morrison’s insistence on abstract and antiquated notions of “state’s rights” ignores the reality that the states are often unable to adequately protect rights on their own and look to assistance from the federal government, as was the case with the VAWA. Professors Brown and Enrich of Northeastern and Boston College Law Schools in 2000:<br />
Judith Olans Brown And Peter D. Enrich, Professor Emerita, Northeastern University School Of Law; A. B., Mount Holyoke College; Ll. B., Boston College Law School, 2000 [“Nostalgic Federalism “ 28 Hastings Const. L.Q. 1, Fall]<br />
“ [*62] Conversely, the Court's nostalgic federalism places… institutional structures and prerogatives.”<br />
<br />
Third, Morrison’s federalism concept shields state actors from accountability for their actions. Professor MacKinnon of Michigan Law in 2000:<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law, University of Michigan, 2000, Harvard Law Review, November, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. 135-6<br />
“Last Term, in United States v. Morrison… in an area that states have inadequately protected.”<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision thus represents the effort by the Court to privilege abstract doctrine over individual dignity and rights. This choice has fueled wars and political violence throughout the world. Ambassador Koppelmen in 1990:<br />
Kopplemen, US Ambassador to CSCE, WORLD AFFAIRS, Summer 1990, p. unknown (PDCL2274)<br />
“Yet, these great advances in the human condition… It is peace and liberty that we seek.”<br />
<br />
Overruling Morrison’s dualistic federalism in favor of a more cooperative model energizes both federal and state level civil rights action and reasserts the proper federal role in that effort. Professor Goldfarb again in 2002:<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor Of Law, Rutgers University, 2002 [“The Supreme Court, The Violence Against Women Act, And The Use And Abuse Of Federalism” 71 Fordham L. Rev. 57, October]<br />
“Central to the Morrison Court's reasoning was the assumption… without sacrificing federalism.”<br />
<br />
Only by rejecting the dualistic notion of federalism in favor of a dynamic and cooperative model can the hoped-for benefits of federalism as a system for preserving freedom and guarding against tyranny be realized. Professor Schapiro of Emory Law School in 2005:<br />
Robert A. Schapiro, Professor Of Law, Emory University School Of Law, 2005 [“Toward A Theory Of Interactive Federalism” 91 Iowa L. Rev. 243, October]<br />
“The attempt to define quintessentially state and federal domains… the greatest promise for the fullest vindication of state and federal rights in the contemporary United States.”<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: State sovereignty<br />
<br />
While the Morrison decision does substantially disrupt the ability of the Congress and states to work together to solve pressing national problems, it does not ensure that state authority will be protected as there are numerous other ways for Congress to intrude. Professor Shane of Villanova in 2000:<br />
Peter M. Shane, Professor, Villanova Law, 2000, Villanova Law Review, 45 Vill. L. Rev. 201, p. 219-223<br />
“The arbitrariness of Brzonkala's reading of the Commerce Clause… economic sector at a time serves no federalism value.”<br />
<br />
It’s impossible for the Court to determine strict constitutional limits on the scope of Congress. Justice Souter explains in dissent in 2000:<br />
Souter, 2000, United States v. Morrison, Dissenting Opinion, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-5.ZO.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-5.ZO.html</a><br />
“Although Madison had emphasized… judicially created limitations on federal power”<br />
<br />
Young adds that cooperative federalism increases ways for the states to resist federal intrusion in 2004:<br />
Ernest A. Young, Law Professor Texas, 2004, Texas Law Review, November, 83 Tex. L. Rev. 1, p. 60<br />
“States may oppose national policies… aspects of the War on Terrorism that they felt intruded too far into personal liberties. n290”<br />
<br />
Justice Breyer concurred that drawing an appropriate line between federal and state jurisdiction is impossible and thus congress is better equipped to protect state, local and individual interests in 2000:<br />
Breyer, 2000, United States v. Morrison, Dissenting Opinion, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-5.ZO.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-5.ZO.html</a><br />
“The majority, aware of these difficulties… must apply more general legal rules and categories.”<br />
<br />
Advantage 3 is that the federal government needs help, too.<br />
<br />
COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THEREBY ENHANCING OUR ANTI-TERROR EFFORTS<br />
Richman, Daniel C., &quot;The Future of Violent Crime Federalism&quot; (May 2005). Fordham Law Legal Studies Research Paper No. 82<br />
“This responsibility on the part of states and their instrumentalities… becomes a characteristic of the entire network.”<br />
<br />
AND ONLY A COOPERATIVE MODEL AND PROTECT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WHILE EFFECTIVELY COMBATING TERRORISM<br />
HERMAN, SUSAN N., &quot;Collapsing Spheres : Joint Terrorism Task Forces, Federalism, and the War on Terror&quot;, in : Willamette Law Review, 41 (2005), no. 5, pp. 941-<br />
“Daniel Richman has argued that the political process of federal/state negotiations… library records, and Internet surfing. n121”<br />
<br />
FURTHERMORE, DUALIST NOTIONS OF FIXED AND SEPARATE SPHERES OF GOVERNMENT CAN’T COPE WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS – ADAPTATION IS CRITICAL<br />
STEVER, UNIV OF CINCINNATI, 2005 [JAMES, “ADAPTING INTERGOVERNMENTAL MANAGEMENT TO THE NEW AGE OF TERRORISM” SAGE PUBLICATIONS, VOL 37, NO 4]<br />
“The third assumption for the new IGM is support for a new set of values…. are required to cope with the attack.”<br />
<br />
NEW INTERACTION AND COOPERATION BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERMENTS IS KEY TO PREVENTING TERRORIST CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL/AND NUCLEAR ATTACKS<br />
STEVER, UNIV OF CINCINNATI, 2005 [JAMES, “ADAPTING INTERGOVERNMENTAL MANAGEMENT TO THE NEW AGE OF TERRORISM” SAGE PUBLICATIONS, VOL 37, NO 4]<br />
“The requirements of controlling would-be terrorists.... should guide the next generation ofIGMmodels.”<br />
<br />
AND THE IMPACT IS EXTINCTION<br />
John Steinbruner, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, chair of the committee on international security and arms control of the National Academy of Sciences, Foreign Policy, December 22, 1997<br />
“That deceptively simple observation has immense implications… but not necessarily its outer limit.”<br />
<br />
We propose the following plan:<br />
In an appropriate test case, the United States Supreme Court will declare that its decision in United States v Morrison is overruled insofar as its federalism analysis is based on a flawed model of “dual-federalism.” The Court will adopt a cooperative federalism test to determine the legitimacy of federal lawmaking authority.<br />
<br />
We note the plan works in Observation Two: Solvency<br />
The precedent for injecting impact evaluation into the Court’s federalism analysis exists in Justice White’s dissent in New York v US. Professor Sargentich explains in 2003:<br />
Thomas O. Sargentich, Law Professor, American University, 2003, Widener Law Journal, 12 Widener L.J. 459, p. 481-3<br />
“In 1992 in New York v. United States… in achieving local solutions to local problems.’&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
A Constitutional crisis is near. When the court strikes down a law it sends a pulse through the country that can serve as a tool for ideologically driven politicians and legislators – initiating a dangerous game with the Constitution. The best theory of federalism is fluid. NYU Law Professor Kramer in 2000:<br />
Larry D. Kramer, NYU Law Professor, 2000, Columbia Law Review, January, 100 Colum. L. Rev. 215, p. 289-94<br />
“So, again, we must ask: Why is the Court doing this?... countermand that decision and substitute their own.”<br />

<br />
Plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in United States v. Morrison by holding that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights authorizes Congressional enactment of the civil rights remedy of the Violence Against Women Act.<br />
<br />
Observation 1: Exclusion From Law<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s decision in Morrison establishes a zone outside the law where women can be abandoned to violence. This division between the local and national reproduces the line between the public and private, creating interlocking spheres of sovereign exception that makes dehumanizing subjugation inevitable. The question is not whether the civil remedy is good or bad, but the institutional power relations that can declare such a law unconstitutional. <br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon  ‘2k Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135<br />
  &quot;To the ear of violated women...people by the other should survive.&quot; <br />
<br />
And, the Morrison decision did more than just confine women to the home – it was a national decision which refused to recognize the nature of gendered violence – under the logic of the decision, domestic violence is not only tolerated, but sanctioned<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law, The University of Michigan Law School, 11/2K, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. 170-1<br />
  &quot;The Morrison majority does not simply respect...sphere in which it is socially exercised.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision, like the Confederate Flag, symbolizes institutionally sanctioned violence. <br />
Alberto B. Lopez ‘1 law professor at Northern Kentucky University  (69 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 251)<br />
  &quot;In the end, the Morrison decision ties...dealing with a national problem - the Congress.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, the refusal to apply international law for women’s human rights abandons women to violence. International law can provide an escape from this logic, exposing the legal neutrality of sovereignty for the political domination it is<br />
Judith Resnik, Arthur Liman Professor of Law, Yale Law School. December, 2001<br />
  &quot;Categorical federalism has appeal...as this Essay was in press).&quot;<br />
<br />
The parallel exclusion of women from international human rights law maintains subordination and annihilation worldwide.<br />
Mackinnon ’06, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School. [Are Women Human? And other international Dialogues p. 155-159]<br />
  &quot;As currently defined, international human...under any but genocidal conditions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Confronting the Law<br />
<br />
Overruling Morrison is necessary to achieve a national rejection of the Court’s refusal in the status quo to recognize certain social spheres and the violence that they produce. <br />
Deborah M. Weissman, Associate Professor of Law and Director of Clinical Programs, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law, 9/01, 42 B.C. L. Rev 1081, p. 1157-9<br />
&quot;Any issue is considered and framed...change in public values and concerns.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, civil rights claims function as a demand to be heard—they form a political floor that is necessary to build social recognition of gender violence that does not reduce it to private solutions<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor Rutgers School of Law, 2003, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 251, p. 254-7<br />
  &quot;The enactment of a federal statute treating...individual perpetrators of violence against women.&quot;<br />
<br />
This recognition of violence against women in civil remedy forums allows an expansive platform for victims of violence to assert their rights within the law<br />
Ellen M. Bublick, Law Professor University Of Arizona, 2006, SMU Law Review, 59 SMU L. Rev. 55, P. 68-74<br />
  &quot;Although only a small percentage...satisfaction of particular victim demands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Observation Three: The Role of the Ballot<br />
Treat the ballot as a decision in a Court case. Voting Aff overrules Morrison, while voting Neg upholds it.<br />
Role-playing as Supreme Court justices demystifies the law.<br />
Nancy V. Baker, asst. prof. of gov. @ New Mexico State Univ., 1994, Political Science and Politics 24 (2), pg. 253<br />
  &quot;The law is more than a list of case names...factors that contribute to the outcome of a case.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, role-playing is a form of defiant deliberative politics that reclaims the political sphere<br />
Jessica Kulynych, Asst Professor of Political Science at Winthrop University, Polity, Winter, 1997, n2 p315(32)<br />
  &quot;When we look at the success of citizen...actually diverse and participatory democracy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confronting law with our own experiences exposes dominance as epistemic, not ontological.<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law, The University of Michigan Law School, ’89, Toward a Feminist Theory of the State, p. 239-240<br />
  &quot;Structurally, only when the state has acted...level of the state for women?&quot;<br />
<br />
Voting affirmative as an ethical obligation of inclusion within the law serves as a challenge to the law itself—the very promise of justice is on the line, and the plan is a gesture not simply at one policy, but at a politics of legal openness, of both criticizing the law and allowing that criticism to transform society<br />
West, Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, ’05, [Robin L. 17 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism 385, lexis]<br />
  &quot;Here, then, is the heart of MacKinnon's legal...Path of Our Law - thus cleared.&quot; <br />
<br />
Take this opportunity to challenge the privileging of security over humanity; instead of fearing the chaos of the post-Cold War period, you should embrace new possibilities for emancipation. <br />
Anne Orford, Lecturer, Faculty of Law, The Australian National University, Winter ’96, 17 Mich. J. Int'l L. 373, lexis<br />
  &quot;While images of the &quot;anarchic society&quot; have...white men to recreate a fictitious unity.&quot;<br />

The United States Supreme Court should overrule United States v. Morrison [529 U.S. 598 (2000)] on the grounds that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights authorizes 42 U.S.C. §13981.<br />

1. Topicality<br />
A. W/m—our plan text states that we overrule Morrison—Game over—<br />
B. W/m—the plan uses the ICCPR to amplify understanding of the 14th amendment—their evd. Calls this a holding<br />
C. W/m—Lawrence v. Texas proves that the use if IL even though previously unmentioned—can overrule the central holding of a decision—<br />
D. C/I—topical affs must reverse the final decision of one of the four cases—decision=judgment, not opinion—<br />
E. To overrule means reject—new oxford American dict. 2005<br />
F. In the context of morrision, sole question was legality of the remedy—<br />
G. c/i—grounds for decisions must be briefed—we/m<br />
H. spec. grounds is not extra-t: real world; increases neg ground<br />
I. c/I preserve predictability—ground: all neg overrule generics are preserved; brief solves limits-only int’l law, commerce and EP, strategy soles limits—no absurd affs<br />
J. their interpretation sets a bad limit: too small—two Morrison plans; unfair, any aff adv. Is non unique bc decision sare on books now; arbitrary—overrule and decision are not objective terms of art; unpredictable—resolution refers to the decision, objects of import—<br />
K. impact calc: predictability precedes limits—basis for setting up limits is their assurance of predictable ground; aff predictability outweights—all research on full half of topic is irrelevant; good is good enough<br />

OBSERVATION ONE: The Morrison Decision Entrenched a Strict Dualist Model of Federalism<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision is grounded in an attempt by the Court to preserve a dualist notion of federalism pitting the states against the federal government, while rejecting the notion of a cooperative model. Professor Goldfarb of Rutgers Law in ‘02<br />
<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor of Law, Rutgers University, 2002 [“The Supreme Court, The Violence Against Women Act, And The Use And Abuse Of Federalism” 71 Fordham L. Rev. 57, October] p. 59-63<br />
“Among the infinite variations on the theme”<br />
<br />
We isolate two harm scenarios from the Court’s federalism analysis in Morrison.<br />
<br />
One: Dual Federalism Undermines Rights and Freedom<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision’s revival of the abstract and antiquated notion of “states’ rights” federalism threatens individual liberty. We isolate three reasons. First, this federalism construct has once again become a powerful tool for conservative activists to restrict liberty. Professor Chemerinsky of Duke Law in ‘02<br />
<br />
Erwin Chemerinsky, visiting professor at Duke Law School, Fall ’02, Human Rights: Journal of the Section of Individual Rights &amp; Responsibilities, Vol. 29, Issue 4, ASP<br />
“My point so far has been that”<br />
<br />
Second, Morrison’s insistence on abstract and antiquated notions of “state’s rights” ignores the reality that the states are often unable to adequately protect rights on their own and look to assistance from the federal government, as was the case with the VAWA. Professors Brown and Enrich of Northeastern and Boston College Law Schools in 2000:<br />
<br />
Judith Olans Brown And Peter D. Enrich, Professor Emerita, Northeastern University School Of Law; A. B., Mount Holyoke College; Ll. B., Boston College Law School, 2000 [“Nostalgic Federalism “ 28 Hastings Const. L.Q. 1, Fall]<br />
“ [*62] Conversely, the Court's nostalgic”<br />
<br />
Third, Morrison’s federalism concept shields state actors from accountability for their actions. Professor MacKinnon of Michigan Law in 2000:<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law, University of Michigan, 2000, Harvard Law Review, November, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. 135-6<br />
“ Last Term, in United States v. Morrison,”<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision thus represents the effort by the Court to privilege abstract doctrine over individual dignity and rights. This choice has fueled wars and political violence throughout the world. Ambassador Koppelmen in 1990:<br />
Kopplemen, US Ambassador to CSCE, WORLD AFFAIRS, Summer 1990, p. unknown (PDCL2274)<br />
”Yet, these great advances in the human “<br />
<br />
Each invasion of liberty must be rejected. Professor Petro of Wake Forest Law in 1974:<br />
Sylvester Petro, Professor of Law, Wake Forest University, TOLEDO LAW REVIEW, 1974, p. 480 (MHBLUE1523)<br />
”It is seldom that liberty “<br />
<br />
Overruling Morrison’s dualistic federalism in favor of a more cooperative model energizes both federal and state level civil rights action and reasserts the proper federal role in that effort. Professor Goldfarb again in 2002:<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor Of Law, Rutgers University, 2002 [“The Supreme Court, The Violence Against Women Act, And The Use And Abuse Of Federalism” 71 Fordham L. Rev. 57, October]<br />
“Central to the Morrison Court's “<br />
<br />
Only by rejecting the dualistic notion of federalism in favor of a dynamic and cooperative model can the hoped-for benefits of federalism as a system for preserving freedom and guarding against tyranny be realized. Professor Schapiro of Emory Law School in 2005:<br />
<br />
Robert A. Schapiro, Professor Of Law, Emory University School Of Law, 2005 [“Toward A Theory Of Interactive Federalism” 91 Iowa L. Rev. 243, October]<br />
“ The attempt to define quintessentially”<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: TERRORISM<br />
<br />
OVERTURNING MORRISON IS CRITICAL TO INCREASING COOPERATION AND COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE ANTI-TERROR EFFORTS<br />
<br />

“ That deceptively simple “<br />
<br />
Advantage Three: Judicial Tyranny<br />
<br />
The revival of the dualist federalism model is based on flawed analysis, is unstable and reckless. Professor Jackson of Georgetown Law in ‘01<br />
Jackson 01: Vicki C. Jackson, Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, October 2001. Duke Law Journal, 51 Duke L.J. 223<br />
“The dramatic title of the conference”<br />
<br />
In Morrison, the Court rejected a long time doctrine of deference to Congressional determinations of its commerce clause authority based on a rational basis test. The Arkansas Law Review in 2001:<br />
University of Arkansas at Little Rock Law Review, 2001, [Jennifer L. Wethington, JD Candidate], Winter, 23 U. Ark. Little Rock L. Rev. 485, p. 507<br />
“ By invalidating the Civil Rights Remedy “<br />
<br />
The Court’s abandonment of rational basis deference substitutes the views of individual judges for those of elected representatives. Professor Sargentich of American University in 2003:<br />
<br />
Thomas O. Sargentich, Law Professor, American University, 2003, Widener Law Journal, 12 Widener L.J. 459, p. 465<br />
“The Rehnquist Court majority has”<br />
<br />
The Court justified its renewed mission to restrict Congressional authority on the argument that it must be subjected to some limit and the Court must be the arbiter. On the basis of this flawed analysis the Court inappropriately usurps the power from the democratic process where it was intended to reside. Justice Souter eloquently explains in dissent in 2000:<br />
Souter, 2000, United States v. Morrison, Dissenting Opinion, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-5.ZO.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-5.ZO.html</a><br />

There is no justification for the Court’s dual federalism model expounded in Morrison. Courts should return to the practice of deference to Congressional determination of enumerated power on a rational basis. This is consistent with the founders intent, and provides the most appropriate checks on federal power. NYU Law Professor Kramer in 2000:<br />

“ So, again, we must ask: Why is the Court “<br />

We propose the following plan:<br />
In an appropriate test case, the United States Supreme Court will declare that its decision in United States v Morrison is overruled insofar as its federalism analysis is based on a flawed model of “dual-federalism.” The Court will adopt a cooperative federalism test to determine the legitimacy of federal lawmaking authority.<br />

In the context of the Morrison decisions the sole question was the legality fo the remedy<br />
Richard Epstein, Amici Brief For: institution for justices and Cato INstitutue, US V. Morrison, 1999, 1999 U.S. S. Ct. Briefs<br />
The sole question in this case is whether Congress has the power to create a private cause of action against a person<br />
<br />
The counter-itnerpretation sets a fair limit and preserves a stable plan action, which is enough to guarantee ground<br />
<br />
Specification of grounds is extra-topical<br />
A_ real-world – the supreme court never just changes its mind – it always gives a reason for decisiosn – nto spec ifying grounds would make the plan vacvuous<br />
b) Increases negative ground – they get links to the grounds<br />
<br />
Their interpetation sets a bad limit<br />
a) it’s too small – there are barely any Quirin or millliken affs – this interpretation would allow only five or six distinct plan texts at most – even the most limited topics like treaties follow fledxiblity in implementation<br />
b) it’s unpredictable – the resolution refesr to the decsisoin but the important characteristics of each is not its opinion, which is in many quesiotns upheld or revised by later decisiosn, but the judgment – here’s evidence on the question d<br />

don’t vote on competing interpretations – predictability precedes limits negatives arbitrary define out plans which leave affs unable to prodeict what constitutes a topical plan<br />

Since the classical age, the West has undergone a … and the large-scale phenomena of population.<br />
<br />
THE ARRANGEMENT OF POPULATIONS IN SPACE ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH THEY DESERVE TO LIVE THROUGH A NUCLEAR ATTACK IS MORE THAN SIMPLY AN EFFECT OF THE MILLIKEN DECISION THAT WE ARE OBJECTING TO. THIS IS A CONSTITUTIVE MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATE’S CONFRONTATION WITH DEATH AND RACE. THE COURT DECLARES DESEGREGATION, BUT RETRACTS ITS PROMISE AT THE VERY MOMENT IT MIGHT BECOME DISRUPTIVE TO THE STRATIFICATION OF SPACE BY RACE. AS SOON AS THE MOVEMENT OF MUNDANE EQUALITY REACHES THE EDGE OF THE RADICAL, THE COURT DECLARES THAT THE STATE NO LONGER HAS THE AUTHORITY OR RESPONSIBILITY TO CONFRONT THE HISTORY OF RACISM. THE PAST IS ERASED AND PLACEMENTS BECOMES PERMANENT.<br />
<br />
THUS,<br />
MOTION: THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE ITS DECISION IN MILLIKEN V. BRADLEY BY HOLDING THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT LINES ARE ARBITRARY LINES ON A MAP DRAWN FOR POLITICAL CONVENIENCE.<br />
<br />
THIS IS MORE THAN A BLAND STATEMENT OF NORMATIVE LEGAL PRESCRIPTION—IT IS AN INTERVENTION IN THE PRECOSTITUTED FIELD OF THE POLITICAL. TO SAY THAT THE INVISIBLE LINES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ARBITRARY RATHER THAN INEVITABLE, PERMEABLE RATHER THAN INEVITABLE, PERMEABLE RATHER THAN INVULNERABLE, IS TO ASSERT THE POSSIBILITY OF MOTION. TO READ THE AFFIRMATIVE AS LOCKED IN THE HERE AND NOW, RATHER THAN PART OF A POTENTIAL NETWORK OF POLITICS CAPABLE OF READING HISTORY DIFFERENTLY IS TO SHUT DOWN THE POSSIBILITY OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN MERE ASSENT OR UNNUANCED REFUSAL OF THE PRE-GIVEN “STATUS QUO.”<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE MEANS BY WHICH INSTITUTIONAL INVULNERABILITY AND SYSTEMATIC VIOLENCE ARE REPRODUCED. IT’S NOT A QUESTION OF TODAY’S BIOPOWER COUNT OR THE EVIL-STATE-ACTION-O=METER; IT’S ABOUT HOW WE THINK AND SPEAK ABOUT THE POLITICS TO WHICH DEBATE REFERS ITSELF. PUT WHATEVER FORCE YOUR BALLOT HAS BEHIND OUR MOTION TOWARDS A POLITICS THAT CAN SEE BEYOND THE DISABLING HORIZONS OF WHAT HAS BEEN DEFINED FOR US AS “POLITICS.”<br />
Henry Giroux, Global TV Network chair professorship at McMaster university in English and cultural studies department. College Literature 33.3, 2006<br />
Any viable attempt to challenge the biopolitical project that now shapes American life… becomes cold and indifferent in the face of death.<br />

<br />
The law has already hailed us as subjects, given us our identity, so the question is not an absolute affirmation or rejection of the law. We are complicit in the law because it gives us our identity, and our task is to resist the lure of this identity and to engage in a critical desubjectivation. Vote affirmative not to create the perfect law for the situation, but to affirm the law’s inability to totally define who we are<br />

Cites – Harvard LP – Casey Aff v1.1<br />
<br />
1. - “Calm down! You’re getting <em>hysterical</em>. Don’t you think that you should take some time to think about this? It’s a tough decision, wouldn’t it be better to sleep on it? What we’ve just told you is a lot to take in, you’ll need some time to absorb it. You might think you’re ready to make a choice, but trust us—it’s better that we make you wait.”<br />
<br />
Can this injunction be anything but belittling? The Supreme Court’s ’93 Casey decision—the doctrine currently on the books regarding abortion—addresses people who wish to terminate a pregnancy in exactly this way. A 24 hour waiting period for an abortion was held to be justified even though such a requirement exists for <em>no other medical procedure, even those that are substantially more dangerous.</em><br />
<br />
“The idea that important decisions will be more informed and deliberate if they follow some period of reflection does not strike us as unreasonable” says the plurality. Sure, that might be true sometimes. But to ensconce that intuition in the law in a way that defacto targets the portion of the population called “women” violently writes that identity in terms of its incapacity to choose well and its need for help from above not to make mistakes.<br />

2. This legal depiction of women as irrational in relation to their reproductive capacity cannot be separated from a genealogy of oppression, which has sought to construct the inferiority of women around the potential for their wombs to “drive them mad” – This reduction has severely limited the ability of women to represent themselves in legal situations, while simultaneously creating female worth only in terms of biological functions – Those whose bodies are considered “unproductive” are erased from view – to be packed into the asylum and “treated” or completely abandoned.<br />
<br />
Carol <strong><u>Smart</u></strong>, Feminism and the Power of the Law, 19<strong><u>89</u></strong>, pp 93-96<br />
<br />
Thus, affirm that:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. casey by holding that mandatory waiting periods for persons seeking abortions are dicriminatory and thus unconstitutional.<br />
<br />
This rejection of the legal creation of “women” as the “bad-choosers” opens up politics beyond circular doctrinal infighting and invasive legislative scheming—new opportunities, both in terms of governmental initiatives and local practice, become available after we stop framing the discussion in terms that attempt to belittle and exclude.<br />
<br />
Jeffrey A. <strong><u>Van Detta</u> ,</strong> professor of law at John Marshall Law School, 10 S. Cal. Rev. L. &amp; Women's Stud. 211, 20<strong><u>01.</u></strong><br />
<br />
Laws that marginalize populations for being somehow “less-than” cannot simply be left in place—this is the formula by which all manner of exclusion, subordination and violence can be justified. The current law is indefensible and the goal of a discussion of jurisprudence should be to recognize that fact—the <em>first question</em> for the court and for your ballot must be how to undue a social and legal history of marginalization of maternal identity.<br />

2. THIS LEGAL DEPICTION OF WOMEN AS IRRATIONAL IN RELATION TO THEIR REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM A GENEALOGY OF OPPRESSION, WHICH HAS SOUGHT TO CONSTRUCT THE INFERIORITY OF WOMEN AROUND THE POTENTIAL FOR THEIR WOMBS TO “DRIVE THEM MAD” – THIS REDUCTION HAS SEVERELY LIMITED THE ABILITY OF WOMEN TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES IN LEGAL SITUATIONS, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY CREATING FEMALE WORTH ONLY IN TERMS OF BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS – THOSE WHOSE BODIES ARE CONSIDERED “UNPRODUCTIVE” ARE ERASED FROM VIEW – TO BE PACKED INTO THE ASYLUM AND “TREATED” OR COMPLETELY ABANDONED.<br />

LAWS THAT MARGINALIZE POPULATIONS FOR BEING SOMEHOW “LESS-THAN” CANNOT SIMPLY BE LEFT IN PLACE—THIS IS THE FORMULA BY WHICH ALL MANNER OF EXCLUSION, SUBORDINATION AND VIOLENCE CAN BE JUSTIFIED.

Casey is bad – we should OT by saying the waiting periods are bad because the legal reasoning assumes women are poor decision makers.<br />
It seems like the omission of notification rules is a big problem for solvency<br />

Not the 1ac – not locate power – choice vs equality: they think juridical power is juridical<br />
Not just express but produce a vision, not just a law but effects all over – not cap T truth<br />
View the 1AC as an attempt to recognize (language and power, the concepts, shape popular authoritative, radical and unthinkable, inhibit change, seek to use power, nature and structure, constantly and critically ask WHO has been involved – dichot roles)<br />
<ul><ul><li>They do not ask</li></ul></ul>Nationalize sexual differences – you are weak and not valuable – monolithic and essentialist US of power (contingency of such claims, beyond CS in law, the fallacy of this claim, only law’s legitimacy shapes it)<br />
History is a battle, the fight in the context – rep the SQ in favor of rejecting the choice model: women SN have BC feed into system – feeds into the harms<br />
Poor women greatly impacted = violent eugenics (Hornsberg 06 – eugenic sterilization, only validation)<br />

Psych US of mind as scapegoating – this blocks social change (barrier between theory and politics – Lacanian theory adds an always, a movement of forced choice)<br />

Simple question: What is the link to the waiting period – why only impact WMC women?<br />
True it does hamper – some lack the RS to get there in the 1st place…Whether want in the 1st place<br />
How does the alt solve<br />
View abortion as larger – raped, etc.<br />

Topicality<br />
1. we meet, plan says overrule<br />
Fordham international law journal 2003, 27 forham int’l l. j. 370<br />
Second, justice scalia argues that the majority….all morals-based legislation<br />
<br />
2. we meet – the plan ues iccpr to amplify congress power under the 14th amendment, their evidence alls that a holding<br />

3. we meet Lawrence v. texas proves<br />
Boston college international and comparative law review 2006, 29 b.c. int’l &amp; comp. L. Rev. 269<br />
One year later, Lawrence held that the liberty and privacy…scope of the substantive due process clause<br />
<br />
4. counter interpretation – topical affs must reverse the final decision of one of the four cases<br />
A decision is a judgment, not the opinion of the court<br />

When referring to judicial matters…..its determination made by the court<br />
<br />
To overrule means reject<br />
New oxford American dictionary 2005<br />
Reject or disallow by exercising one’s superior authority: the supreme court overruled the lower court<br />
<br />
In the context of the Morrison decision, the sole question was the legality of the remedy<br />
Rehnquist, us v Morrison, 2k<br />
In these cases we consider the constitutionality…(1883), we affirm<br />
<br />
5. counter interpretation – grounds for decision must be briefed – we meet<br />
Falk 1999, us briefs 5 US v. Morrison, brief amici curiae on behalf of international law scholars<br />
Congress has unquestioned authority….entitled to great deference<br />
<br />
6. specification of grounds is not extra topical<br />
Realworld – the supreme court never just changes its mind – it always gives a reason for decision – not specifying grounds would make the plan vacuous<br />
Increase neg ground – they get links to the grounds and if they’re new then all court da links are magnified<br />
<br />
7. the counter interpretations preserve predictability<br />
Ground – all neg overrule generics are preserved, the vast majority of the case args and cps<br />
Briefs solve limits – only international law, cc, 14th were briefed<br />
Strategy solve limits – make them prove list of abusive cases<br />
<br />
8 they set bad limit<br />
Too small – 2 plans, writes casey out<br />
Unfair – advantages are bad because on books now<br />
Arbitrary – overrule and decision are not an objective terms of art<br />
Unpredictable – the res refers to “the” decisions, which denotes them as objects of import, however the important characteristics of each decision is not its opinion, which is in many cases upheld or revised by later decisions<br />
New oxford American dictionary 2005<br />
Denoting one or more people….that is unique<br />

Fullerton’s condemnation of “traditional debate” in favor of a debate forum that focuses on “the liberation of oppressed peoples” mimics the political failures of Freire’s critique of the banking model of education. The demand that radical pedagogies be fore-grounded over policy considerations denies agency to people who find policy debate educational and liberating and replicates the worst of the banking model by presupposing that other teams need to be educated about the proper framework for debate. The alternative is contestation. The debate forum allows for the possibilities of mutual respect and two-sided examination of competing ideas as long as we do not foreclose those possibilities by valorizing the necessity of alternative pedagogies.<br />

Their call for the liberation of oppressed people constructs the oppressed as passive subjects incapable of resistance without the help of paternalistic outsider; the result is an imperialistic universalization of Western modes of thought which marginalizes the very people they attempt to help<br />

First:<br />
US v. Morrison is the product of a logic of boundaries and jurisdiction – the institutional doctrines that justified the decision denied to victims of gendered violence recourse at the highest level – that of international law.<br />
<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon ‘2k Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135<br />
To the ear of violated … people by the other should survive.<br />
<br />
This logic which condones and sanctions gendered violence extends through BOTH domestic AND international structures. The logic of the home as a private place is the same as the logic of state sovereignty as inviolable<br />
<br />
Catherine A. Mackinnon 2006, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School. [Are Women Human? And other international Dialogues p. 192-194]<br />
The denial of gender inequalities … committed against them.<br />
<br />
What’s more – the US refusal to incorporate international human rights law domestically is a POLITICAL CLAIM that supports and sanctions the logic of jurisdictional boundaries. Only interacting with and embracing the international human rights framing as it relates to gendered violence can provide an escape from this logic.<br />
Judith Resnik, Arthur Liman Professor of Law, Yale Law School. December, 2001<br />
Categorical federalism has appeal, … as this Essay was in press).<br />
<br />
There are two impacts:<br />
<br />
The first is domestic violence:<br />
The Morrison Decision did more than confine women to the home – it was a national decision which refused to recognize the nature of gendered violence – under the logic of the decision, domestic violence is not only tolerated, but SANCTIONED<br />
<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon ‘2k Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135<br />
The Morrison majority does not … problem and what does not.<br />
<br />
As a result of this logic, domestic violence is rampant in the United States – more than four people die a day. Countless more are battered and abused.<br />
National Organization of Women, 2006, Violence against Women in the United States, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.now.org/issues/violence/stats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.now.org/issues/violence/stats.html</a>, accessed 6-21-2006<br />
Murder. Every day four… a “pre-existing condition.”<br />
<br />
Descriptions of a “peaceful” status quo and impact comparisons prioritizing the harms of traditional “wars” ignore the ongoing war against women perpetuated by gendered violence – only the Aff’s acknowledgement of the public and political nature of supposedly private violence solves<br />
<br />
Amy Ray, US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 2-1997 American University Law Review<br />
Because, as currently constructed,…or in a concentration camp in a foreign country.<br />

What’s more – responses on the state level by their very nature fail<br />

What was at stake … antidiscrimination standard.&quot; 315<br />

With respect to prevention, … and remedy state wrongdoing.<br />
<br />
Don’t underestimate the impact of the remedy – a little more law goes a long way in combating domestic violence<br />
Robin West, Professor of Law, Georgetown, 2006 29 Harv. J.L. &amp; Gender 1<br />
If this is the sequence--from hurt… with a little more law.<br />
<br />
But, simply reinstating the remedy isn’t enough – in order for a little more law to be effective, we must change our interpretation of the constitution – accepting the positive obligations of international law is necessary<br />
Robin West ‘94 Prof. of Law. Georgetown (Progressive Constitutionalism p. 119-121)<br />
The difficulty goes even deeper,… women's subordination occurs.<br />
<br />
Additionally -- overruling Morrison is necessary to achieve a national recognition of the right to be free of sexual violence, creating social change and substantive improvements in victim’s lives.<br />
<br />
Deborah M. Weissman, Associate Professor of Law and Director of Clinical Programs, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law, 9/01, 42 B.C. L. Rev 1081, p. 1157-9<br />
Any issue is considered …public values and concerns.<br />
<br />
Finally, there is an ethical obligation to support the plan: the courts must do everything within their power to stop gender violence<br />
<br />
Robin L. West, Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, ’05, 17 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism 385, lexis<br />
Here, then, is the heart of MacKinnon's …in practice, in the world of ideas and in our lives.<br />
<br />
The second impact is international human rights -<br />
<br />
The only real way the Morrison Court’s logic of arbitrary boundary construction can be challenged is by incorporating INTERNATIONAL human rights law domestically - The United States must recognize that international law enjoins on the federal government a positive obligation to combat gendered violence. Only this recognition can build an institutional and societal culture of human rights awareness and compliance that can solve global systemic violence and planetary extinction alike.<br />

3. perm – do the counterplan. Their evidence says implicit overrule is a type of overruling; they just specify further than the plan<br />

AT RUDS (TREATY RESERVATIONS) CP<br />
<br />
US bound by iccpr and other relvant treaties whether we attached reservations or not – they have achieved status as customary international law<br />
Albisa and copelon 1999 – 1999 u.s. briefs 5<br />
“widely ratified treaties, together with unchallenged interpretive declarations and statements” … “albeit long-ignored and still pervasive”<br />
<br />
Their evidence is in the context of the court usurping congress’s power by substituting its own enforcement judgement. Under our plan, the court is not ruling that the treaty is self-executing, it is ruling that congress has the authority to pass legislation to execute it.<br />
Georgetown Law Journal 2003 – 91 Geo. L.J. 1277<br />
“courts, scholars, and politicians have used the term” … “we must first identify what non-self-executing means”<br />

counterplan doesn’t solve – american exceptionalism<br />

AT AGAMBEN<br />
<br />
Agamben’s argument is a politically paralyzing ruse of ideology and breeds passivity – the notion of bare life dooms the world to inactivity and despair. WE should instead recognize the productive capacity of bare life and harness the potentiality of being for good – empirically, this has been able to effect real world change. Only the aff retains value to life<br />
<br />
Neilson, 2004. [Brett. “potenza Nuda? Sovereignty, Biopolitics, Capitalism” Contretemps, December 5]<br />
<br />
For negri, the dange of Agamben’s though lies, not in its Aristotelian rigour or formal elegance but in its inability to open a panorama of revolutaionary struggle…this analysis functions without lack and provides the basis for an absolute democaracy that reaches beyond modern political representation.<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
Agamben’s extreme simplification of politics and blanket statements obscures multiple sites of resistance to bare life. He is a total purist, which actively reproduces his own impact.<br />
<br />
Mesnard, 2004. [Phillipppe, Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions. Ebsco. Vol. 5 No. 1<br />
<br />
Let us make another observation here. It could be argued that the camps were structures…let us now trun our attention to the most spectacular ‘blind spot’ of Agamben’s approach.<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
Biopolitics are good – allow for liberal and social freedoms<br />
<br />
Dickinson, 2004 [Edward Ross, “Bioplitics, Fascism, Democaracy: Some reflections on our discourse about ‘Modernity’” Central Euopean History, Issue: Volume 37, Number 1, p. Springer<br />
<br />
A second example is Geoff Eley’s masterful synthetic introduction to a collection…and that focus has remained characteristic of the literature as a whole.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
The denial of human rights to victims of gender-based violence ontologically damns them to less than human status. Recognizing these human rights is key to combating dehumanization<br />
<br />
Mackinnon 2006. [Elizabeth A. Are Women Human? And other international Dialogues p. 2-3]<br />
<br />
Becoming human in both the legal and lived senses is a social, legal, andp litical process…Women are in the midst of this process.<br />

HARVARD MR 2AC – T OVERRULE<br />
<br />
Their Interpretation sets a bad limit<br />
A – its too small – there are already barely any Quirin or Milliken affirmatives – this interpretation would allow only five or six distinct plan texts at most – even the most limited topics like treaties allowed flexibility in implementation<br />
B – It’s unfair – any affirmative advantage is not unique because the opinions are on the books now – only introducing new grounds allows the aff flexibility to read worthwhile advantages at all<br />
C – It’s unpredictable – the resolution refers to “the” decisions, which denotes them as objects of import – however, the important (unique) characteristics of each decision is not its opinion, which is in many cases upheld or revised by later decisions, but the judgement – here’s evidence on the “the question<br />
New oxford american dictionary 2005 – used to refer to a person, place, or thing that is unique: the queen | the mona lisa | the nile<br />
<br />
Don’t vote on competing interpretations – tpics have already become massively skewed toward the neg – competing interpretations justifies hyper limited topics that only escalate this side bias and it encourages substantive crowd-out – err on the side of reasonability – especially in the context of the supreme court<br />
Gerhardt 2005 – 7 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 903<br />
“moreover, constitutional history reflects a growing awareness” … “consistency, reliability, predictability, stability, and finality.”<br />
