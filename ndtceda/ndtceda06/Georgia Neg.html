Round 4 NEG:<br />
<br />
We will defend policy debate as a process that requires an outcome focused analysis of the world. Debate offers a unique way of talking and thinking about the world, and these benefits justify a vote negative.<br />
<br />
Our ethics begins with the question of the other, and a foundation for action in the world. The foundation for ethics should be in the corporeal suffering that we are able to witness as a reflection of our own tenuous position as living beings. The experience and knowledge of suffering animates our reason for being, even if their discussion of the world is correct, we must act<br />
Levinas, “The Face and Responsibility for the Other” World Ethics, p158<br />
<br />
The experience of Communism and totalitarianism demonstrates the necessity of evaluation of our actions in a calculative framework<br />
<br />
Issac 02, “Ends, Means and Politics” Dissent, Spring<br />
<br />
Debate about policy provides the most effective avenue to begin discussion of our position in the world, and our ethical obligations that demand a response. Switch side debate serves as the most effective avenue for beginning to theorize our own position. Switch side debate allows us the opportunity to view the world as constructed by indeterminate political structures and from that begin to change the world.<br />
Mitchell 2000, Argumentation and Advocacy, Winter 2000, 143-4<br />
<br />
Only analyzing the world with the presumption of rationality and by use of predictive and logical structures creates solves social oppression. The mask of relativisim that the aff wears imposes its own metaphysics of violence<br />
<br />
Bookchin, 1994 Left Green Perspectives, no 29, March – lpg.social-ecology.org<br />
<br />
The affirmative team cannot avoid the spectacle and dangers of debate – their anti-systemic poetics is subordinated to the demands of the ballot – We will still defend that the debate should be decided on a structure of argumentation – but the aff is trapped performative and structural demands that demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the performance and any reason to vote aff.<br />
<br />
Also – what does the affirmative leave us? If we recognize the incoherence of existence, what myths can reappear? We believe that an embrace of an inescapable incoherence also concedes space for the violence of capitalism to emerge stronger.<br />

A preoccupation with moral purity denies the possibility of an effective response to violence. A cycle of violence won’t be broken by ignoring effective policy alternative.<br />

A stopping point for infinite responsibility is essential to notions of justice that don’t force the slave to heed the call of an other who demands cheap labor. Indefinite responsibility infuses ethics with a sense of justice and proves the necessity of context.<br />

<strong>“Shit K”</strong><br />
The plan is potty-trained fecal-civic performance that takes ideas and neatly excretes them into the designated place- in this we become subjects of a repressive economy that desires fascism and global exploitation through the alienation of labor.<br />

The affirmative’s anal economy creates its own alternative—rejective the aff constructs a new mode of shitty public address—we may be a little co-opted, but only by taking pride in our ability to shit can we escape the fascism of the affirmative’s discipline.<br />

<strong>Motherhood CP</strong><br />
Text: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey on the grounds that there is no constitutional right for a mother to define her own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe and the mystery of human life.<br />
<br />
The aff replicates the logic of sameness-decontextualizing the subject allows for sovereign calculation and produces otherization.<br />
Anne Caldwell, 2002. Hypatia 17.4, Transforming Sacrifice: Iragaray and the Politics of Sexual Difference<br />

Affirming motherhood is key to solve—recognizing ourselves as born from women allows for constitution of a subject that allows difference and connection.<br />

Text: The United States Supreme Court should adopt a new standard for evaluation of Commerce Clause jurisprudence that reflects the text and history of the Clause. Specifically, the Court will require that all federal statutes enacted under the Commerce Clause meet two requirements: The Statute must regulate “commerce” and the statute must implicate commerce in more than one state.

Plank 1: The US Congress should propose an amendment to the US Constitution to create authority for congress to protect the environment based on customary international law. The text of the amendment will be: Congress shall have the power to preserve, protect, and promote the environment. A sufficient number of states should ratify the amendment.<br />
Plank 2: The United States Congress should repeal the “Global Gag Rule” by repealing authority for the President to prohibit United States aid from going to groups in foreign countries that counsel or provide information to women about abortion.<br />
Plank 3: The United States Congress should pass a federal civil rights remedy for gender violence. The proposed civil rights remedy should read: a civil cause of action against the state will exist if the plantiff can prove a conspiracy between the individual violator and the state. A conspiracy will exist if the state’s purported punitive action against the criminal helps or encourages the criminal to commit his gender-based act of violence.<br />

Plank 1: The United States Congress should propose an amendment to the United States Constitution to create authority for Congress to protect the environment based on customary international law. The text of the amendment will be: Congress shall have the power to preserve, protect, and promote the environment. A sufficient number of states should ratify the amendment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Plank 2: The United States Congress should repeal the &quot;Global Gag Rule&quot; by repealing authority for the President to prohibit United States aid from going to groups in foreign countries that counsel or provide information to women about abortion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Plank 3: The United States Congress should pass a federal civil rights remedy for gender violence. The proposed civil rights remedy should read: a civil cause of action against the state will exist if the plaintiff can prove a conspiracy between the individual violator and the state. A conspiracy will exist if the state's purported punitive action against the criminal helps or encourages the criminal to commit his gender-based act of violence.<br />

<strong>CP</strong>:<br />
Text: The United States Congress should enact a National Fair Share Act to combat housing inequality in the United States. Each state will be encouraged to designate a central planning development agency to coordinate and oversee implementation of the statute at the state level. Municipalities should be required to establish a plan that meets strict criteria for residential desegregation established by the state and federal oversight agencies. All municipalities should be required to include a substantially greater percentage of low income applicants. The federal government will aggressively apply Title VIII to housing policies of all states and municipalities in compliance with the Fair Share Act. Municipalities should be required to account for racial composition of fair share households and make this a primary consideration in implementation of the Act. Suburban zoning laws that limit multi-family housing units, such as apartments, should be significantly reduced to encourage more apartment development in primarily white communities. Congress will authorize $5 billion a year in fair share funds for ten years to assist states and municipalities to implement the act. These funds will be conditioned on successful implementation of the Act’s mandates, as determined by the state and federal government. In municipalities refusing to establish and meet the goals of the Act, the homeowner mortgage interest tax deduction and the local property tax deduction should be progressively withdrawn from property owners. Non-compliant states will be required to forfeit all fair share funds and federal funds designated for state infrastructure improvements, such as highways and bridges. The Act will also authorize federal funds for housing mobility programs to encourage racial integration of communities nationwide. States should distribute these subsidies to eligible participants of the program on a proportional basis with the benefit conditioned upon the relative population of African Americans in the given residential location. Subsidies will be largest for areas with smaller populations of African American home purchasers. Mobility grants for the Act should be explicitly limited to a period of ten years before expiration.<br />

CP<br />
- Text: The United States Supreme Court should hold that all future Commerce Clause jurisprudence should better reflect the text and history of the Clause. Specifically, the Court will redefine “commerce” to encompass the following three categories: (1) buying and selling goods, including the production and incidents of that production, (2) the compensated provision of services which are considered ‘commercial’, and (3) the means by which commerce is transacted. In addition to falling within one of these three categories, the regulated activity must implicate commerce in more than one state.<br />
All states and localities should implement a civil rights remedy designed to model the civil remedy provided in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.<br />
The United States Congress should provide all necessary resources to help states establish agencies and to enforce child support obligations.<br />

Evidence concludes that Civil Rights Remedy would be immediately enforced<br />
Treanor, 1993 (William, Michael, 93 Colum. L. Rev. 1902)<br />
This argument for the extension… is overturned.<br />
<br />
Civil rights remedy doesn’t solve<br />
A. Gender animus requirement prevents solvency<br />
Mackinnon 2000 (Catherine, A., 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135)<br />
In all these respects, the Violence Against… it cut violated women out.<br />
<br />
B. Civil grievances can only be filed against individuals, not institutions – won’t file<br />
Davis, 2001 (Martha, 9 J.L. &amp; Pol’y 387, lexis)<br />
VAWA’s redefinition of violence…not deep pockets.<br />
<br />
C. Women don’t want to confront batterers<br />
Goldscheid 2003 (Julie, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol’y &amp; L. 417)<br />
More significantly, a law… of civil rights remedy.<br />
<br />
D. Narrow interpretations of “crime of violence”<br />
Jarunsinsky 2000 (Renee, 27 Fordham Urb. L.J. 965)<br />
Utilizing existing precedent from… experiences of violence.<br />
<br />
They don’t solve all gender equality<br />
A. Lack of child care<br />
Dixon 2005 (Heather, 36 Colum. Human Rights L. Rev. 561)<br />
Contrary to the position taken… exacerbates gender inequality. 56<br />
<br />
B. Unconscious biases from the work environment<br />
Olsen 95 (Amy, 35 Santa Clara L. Rev. 983)<br />
Although there may be a new commitment… defeat gender discrimination.<br />
<br />
The civil rights remedy doesn’t solve – women don’t have the financial means to pursue civil action. Symbolic action is irrelevant without a meaningful remedy<br />
Regan 99 (Christopher James, 75 Notre Dame L. Rev. 797)<br />
The civil rights remedy of the 1994… what it paid for.<br />
<br />
Turn – invalidating VAWA is key to political mobilization<br />
Greve, 2000 (Michael S. The Supreme Court’s Federalism” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11797/pub_details.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11797/pub_details.asp</a><br />
Judicial invalidation of congressional enactments… that insight.<br />
<br />
Domestic violence is already a significant part of the public sphere now – Morrison is ireelevant<br />
Goldfarb 2000 (Sally F., Spring, 102 W. Va L. Rev. 499)<br />
Clearly VAWA, even as expanded by Congress… a new era.<br />
<br />
Intersectionality<br />
A. the public is a racially-saturated forum that enhances racism against black women<br />
Nash 2005 (Jennifer C., Winter, 11 Cardozo Women’s L. J. 303)<br />
The cultural and social surveillance… apply to them.<br />
<br />
B. Fighting racism must be our number one priority; our survival is contigent on its elimination<br />
Feagin 2006 (Joe R., Systemic Racism: A Theory of Oppression, p 322)<br />
No present-day society would exist… social oppressions.<br />
<br />
Turn – circularity of law – VAWA is an example of the limits of the legal system – the plan is an appeal to institutions that are inherently oppressive towards women. This reaffirmation of the law further oppression of women.<br />
Goldfarb 2003 (Sally F., Applying the Discrimination Model to Violence Against Women,” 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol’y &amp; L. 251)<br />
However, any civil rights law… between men and women.<br />
<br />
VAWA Bad<br />
1. Turn – the civil remedy is antitherapeutic – Torts allow for comparative fault which blame the woman for being abused<br />
Koss, 1999 (Mary P., Blame, Shame and Community: Justice Responses to Violence Against Women, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/koss/koss.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/koss/koss.html</a>)<br />
Because an attorney retained… Bublick, 1999, p. 1476).<br />
<br />
2. Turn – civil remedy reinforces the myth of the crazed rapist, causing more gender violence<br />
Wells &amp; Motley 2001 (Christina, and Erin, 81 B.U.L. Rev. 127)<br />
Sexual violence has received… serious harm.<br />
<br />
3. Turn – Privacy – shifting gender violence into the public sphere through VAWA devastates privacy protections<br />
Bumiller, 2005 (Kristin, Freedom from Gender Violence as a Human Right, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Bumiller%20paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Bumiller%20paper.pdf</a><br />
Although Morrison is a terrible blow… into private lives.<br />
<br />
4. Court clog<br />
A. VAWA overwhelms federal courts with civil rights cases, impeding their ability to function, which means you don’t solve gender violence<br />
Bassler, 1996 (William G., 48 Rutgers L. Rev. 1139)<br />
Concern over the effects of the… than federal courts. 80<br />
<br />
B. Clogged courts mean no solvency and collapses legitimacy<br />
Bassler, 1996 (William G., 48 Rutgers L. Rev. 1139)<br />
While it may be impossible… in the legal system. 85<br />
<br />
C. Judicial legitimacy is key to prevent terrorism<br />
Shapiro, 2003 (Jeremy, March, French Lessons: The Importance of the Judicial System in Fighting Terrorism, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/fp/cusf/analysis/shapiro20030325.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/fp/cusf/analysis/shapiro20030325.htm</a>)<br />
The unique nature of terrorism… desire to protect.<br />
<br />
D. Unchecked terrorism causes extinction<br />
Alexander, 2003<br />
Last week’s brutal… no survival.”<br />
<br />
Civil remedy isn’t key to combating gender violence – VAWA I and II are enough<br />
Acikalin 2000 (Tulin, 74 Tul. L. Rev. 1045)<br />
While a Supreme Court decision declaring the civil remedy … punish domestic violence.<br />
<br />
A. Upholding the civil remedy provision causes unchecked Congressional Power<br />
Levey 2001 (Curt, Spring, 47 Loy. L. Rev. 535, Symposium on Integrating Responses to Domestic Violence)<br />
The Center for Individual Rights declined… for all Americans.<br />
<br />
B. Unchecked congressional regulatory power devastates business confidence – the threat is enough to trigger our link<br />
Lee 96 (Susa, Vol. 79, No. 8, pg 15, How Government Menaces Our Economic Health, lexis)<br />
Who Pays for All… slower economic growth.<br />

<strong>Political actions in this context is thus an abdication of the responsibility of sens and for ense. By engaging without prior questioning, without the letting be of thought the affirmative advocacy trumpets the presupposition of sense rather than sense itself. This is a confusing distinction, but a critical one. The project of this debate should be a letting-be, an openness to sense as the sense of existence, as tat thing that makes sense of political and allows us to think and negotiate the possibility of politics as such. Endorsing action is thus antithetical to our proeject; the only hope for responsibility is to rescue it from the shackles of essentialist authority.</strong><br />

The affirmative’s overrule enacts the buraial feature by removing the decision from the lasting public view. Without the constant accountability generated by keeping the worst decisions on the books, the Court has worked to generate new instutitnoal protections for power and sovereignty.</strong><br />

<strong>Throught history the court has attempted to remove any lasting legacy of oppression by overruling decisions which removes them from the public realm of consideration. The 1984 Korematsu case proves that instead of overruling horrible decisions, a better alternative is to distinguish decisions by limiting them to the facts of the ase which removes the ability of any court to use the decision as precedent but keeps the decision in the public realm. This process of leaving the decisions on the books engenders strategies of resistance to new forms of oppression because the courts complicity in oppression is never forgotten.</strong><br />

Lower Courts CP<br />

Lower Court underruling of Supreme Court cases is essential to enforcement of the plan – the result will increase legitimacy of the Court by sensitizing it to enforcement problems and improving the quality of decisionmaking<br />

Bhagwat '00 (Ashutosh, Professor of Law @ University of California, Hastings College of Law; J.D. from UChicago; 80 B.U.L. Rev. 967 ln)<br />
These limitations not only provide important insights...avoidance of precedent is far from uncommon . 118<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Concurrent Jurisdiction PIC<br />
<br />
<br />
Text: The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in U.S. v Morrison by holding that all sections of Sec. 13981 are constitutional except the Concurrent Jurisdiction clause (subsection (e)(3)). The U.S.S.C. should hold that only state court should have jurisdiction to hear litigation relevant to the federal civil rights remedy of the Violence Against Women Act.<br />
<br />
A. It Solves the Case:<br />
<br />
A federal right can be vindicated exclusively in state courts – unique expertise of the state is effective<br />
Bassler ’96 (William G, Judge, United States District Court, District of New Jersey, 1991 present; Adjunct Prof of Law @ Seton Hall School of Law; 48 Rutgers L. Rev. 1139 ln)<br />
Although the federal courts' true role… emerge late in the proceedings. 274<br />

The creation of a federal civil… in the state judicial arena.<br />
<br />
B. Net Benefit<br />
<br />
1. VAWA overwhelms federal Courts with civil rights cases, impeding their ability to function. This means they don’t solve their advantages – the CP is key.<br />
Bassler ’96 (William G, Judge, United States District Court, District of New Jersey, 1991 present; Adjunct Prof of Law @ Seton Hall School of Law; 48 Rutgers L. Rev. 1139 ln)<br />
Concern over the effect of the Violence… filed in state, rather than federal courts. 80<br />
<br />
2. Clogged courts prevent justice for victims of domestic violence and crushes Court legitimacy<br />
Bassler ’96 (William G, Judge, United States District Court, District of New Jersey, 1991 present; Adjunct Prof of Law @ Seton Hall School of Law; 48 Rutgers L. Rev. 1139 ln)<br />
While it may be impossible… confidence in the legal system. 85 [*1156]<br />
<br />
3. Supreme Court legitimacy is key to check tyranny<br />
Spriggs, Scott, &amp; Zink ‘06 (James, Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Davis; John and James, Profs @ UC Davis, “Courting the Public: Judicial Behavior and Public Views on Court Decisions”)<br />
Because the Court’s legitimacy is… simultaneously must court public opinion.<br />
<br />
4. The impact is extinction<br />
Benoit ’80 (Progress and Survival, Pg 97-98)<br />
It must be clear, however, that nonresistance… persons, with a supranational status and orientation.<br />
<br />
CONCURRENT JURISDICTION EXTENSIONS<br />

<br />
<br />
Concurrent Jurisdiction is uniquely worse for solvency - major jurisdictional problems slow down effective processing of domestic violence claims<br />
McKinley ’96 (Stacey L, 44 Clev. St. L. Rev. 345, Cleveland State Law Review, ln)<br />
State supreme court justices say another problem… serious problems regarding federalism and statutory interpretation. <a name="r90"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=1288ef53109847761660e64935f37ef3&amp;docnum=8&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLzVlz-zSkAl&amp;_md5=2f0606ac9068dfc85f8575c80f6dcb2e&amp;focBudTerms=&amp;focBudSel=all#n90" rel="nofollow">90</a><br />

CRR remedy of VAWA à court clog – only state courts can hear a lot of cases<br />
Regan ’99 (Christopher James, J.D. Candidate, Notre Dame Law School; 75 Notre Dame L. Rev. 797 ln)<br />
Even more disheartening than the CRR's failure… federal docket is an &quot;impending crisis.&quot; 49<br />
<br />
State courts won’t get swamped – federal courts are more likely to get clogged – only a risk of our net benefit<br />
Bassler ’96 (William G, Judge, United States District Court, District of New Jersey, 1991 present; Adjunct Prof of Law @ Seton Hall School of Law; 48 Rutgers L. Rev. 1139 ln)<br />

The growth of the federal caseload has… signs pointing to a negative diagnosis.]<br />
<br />
Clogged courts are uniquely detrimental to Court legitimacy<br />
Newman ’90 (Glenn, University of Illinois Law Review, 1990 U. Ill. L. Rev. 177 ln)<br />
Inconvenience is not the only… solutions to the problem of overcrowded courts.<br />
<br />
Clogged court system jacks public respect for the system and undermines legitimacy<br />
Bassler ’96 (William G, Judge, United States District Court, District of New Jersey, 1991 present; Adjunct Prof of Law @ Seton Hall School of Law; 48 Rutgers L. Rev. 1139 ln)<br />

A. The CP solves the case – distinguishing a case to its facts has the same precedential effects as overruling, the difference is solely in perception<br />

Reconsideration need not … or simply overrule it entirely.<br />

Overruling a decision is a clear violation of stare decisis – only distinguishing allows the court to sidestep precedent without violating the stare decisis doctrine<br />

There is always a difference in facts – there is virtually no solvency differential between the plan and the counterplan<br />

TOPICALITY<br />
<br />
A: Definitions:<br />
<br />
A Supreme Court decision has two components – a judgement and the holdings that support the judgement<br />
Baum 1998 – the supreme court, 132<br />
“supreme court decisions usually have two components” … “constitutes an authoritative statement by the court.<br />
<br />
2 – overruling a decision requires overruling holdings and the judgement<br />
Lieberman 1999 – companion to the constitution, page 338<br />
“when the supreme court declines to follow the reasons that led it to decide an earlier case”<br />
<br />
KRITIK – INTENTIONALITY<br />
<br />
Overruling is an exercise in intentionality. Despite the fact that judges attempt implicit overrules the court has determined that only explicit statements of intentionality are sufficient to complete the performative act of overruling<br />
Yale Law Journal 2003 – 113 Yale L.J. 493<br />
“thus far, we have examined how justices stray from the traditional” … “justices’ reasons for using this form, some examples of which include”<br />
<br />
Despite the af firmative’s attempt to engage in progressive politics, the plan’s use of the legal doctrine of overruling locks them into a system of formalism that relies on the doctrine of intentionality. This intentionality presumes a static interpretation of meaning which closes down texts and constitutes a community that dismisses dissent as irrational and extinguishable<br />
Fish 1989 – doing what comes naturally: change, rhetoric, and the practice of theory in literary and legal studies, page 7<br />
“formalism, as unger correctly sees, is not merely a linguistic doctrine” … “mechanically ennumerable features-has always and already occurred”<br />
<br />
The alternative is the counterplan. By leaving the decision on the books, the cp opens the decision continual interpretation. The affirmative’s use of overrule, however, bestows intentionality to the court through the performative act of declaring the decision overruled. The affirmative’s continued framework of intentionality generates a rigid certitude in the law which reifies and produces systems of violence that kills tens of m illions. It is only by opening up the law to interpretation that we can beign to challenge these structures<br />
Derrida 1995 - the gift of death – page 85<br />
“what is thus found at work in everyday discourse, in the exercise of justice” … “who becomes for his part nothing more than a murderer”<br />

BEATIFICATION<br />
<br />
A SAINT CLOSES THE BOOK ON ALTERNATIVE HAGIOGRAPHIES AND INTERPRETATION OF HER STORY.<br />
<br />
THE IMPLICATION FO THIS IS THAT IT REPLICATES AND PRODUCES THE STRUCTURES OF POWER THEY ATTEMPT TO ERADICATE. THEY’RE IDENTITIFAICATION AS “CATHOLIC” AND NON-CATHOLIC TEMPORALIZES THEIR IDENTITY AS STATIC. DEFINING THE MYTH IN ONE PARTICULAR MANNER PRECLUDES AN UNDERSTANDING OF IDENTITY AND MYTH AS ALWAYS FLUID BOTH IN UDNERSTANDING BUT ALSO AS WE PROGRESS THROUGH TIME.<br />
<br />
THIS SHORT CIRCUITS THEIR ADVOCACY ENTIRELY AS IT DEMONSTRATES HOW THEIR INTERPRETATION OF “ARGUING FROM ONE’S SOCIAL LOCATION” IS A STATIC ONE. WHAT IS MY SOCIAL LOCATION, WHERE AM I SITUATED, WHERE ARE YOU SITUATED, WHERE IS XXXX SITUATED ALL BECOME THE QUESTIONS RATHER THAN WHAT HAS CREATED THE SITUATION I AM IN AND WILL BECOME. THIS STATIC NOTION OF IDENTITY IS WHAT ALLOWS FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF XXXX IN THE FIRST PLACE. HER IDENTITY AS A KILLER AND HERETIC AND EXILE DOES NOT CHANGE PLACING HER AS A GHOST---A GHOST THROUGH ALL TIME.<br />
<br />
WE ADVOCATE BEATIFICATION TO ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF DIFFERENT READINGS OF THE STORY, RECOGNIZING HER STORY IN A WAY THAT MORE APPROPRIATELY REPLICATES THE EXPERIENCE OF US WITHIN THE DEBATE ROUND AND LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY FOR A RESPECT FOR DIFFERENCE THEY ELIMINATE<br />

Intentionality<br />

Despite the affirmative’s attempt to engage in progressive po litics, the plan’s use of the legal doctrine of overruling locks them into a system of formalism that relies on the donctrien of intentionality.

Denning and Reynolds 2003, 55 Ark. L. Rev. 1253<br />
“The third circuit admitted that the government presented…stood only for its results.”<br />
<br />
Lower courts are abandoning Morrison now with ZERO repercussions from the Supreme Court – the court won’t deny cert because they’re tired of seeing commerce clause issues on the docket<br />
Denning and Reynolds 2003<br />
“What explains lower court resistance to the Supreme Court’s…of deliberate misunderstanding.”<br />
<br />
Empirically, the lower court has successfully avoided Supreme Court overrule in the area of gender discrimination and the equal protection clause<br />
Bhagwat, 2000, 80 B.U.L. Rev. 967<br />
“For yet another example of lower court avoidance of the logical implications…pretense of distinguishing it.”<br />

Kritik<br />
The 1AC presents an advocacy grounded in political figures of community, identity, and statehood, figures that equip politics with a content without themselves being questioned for their political form. These warrants predicate themselves upon the essence of these figures, a predication so expansive and hegemonic it can only be understood as totalitarian<br />
Nancy 1991 (Jean –Luc, The Inoperative Community, 2-3)<br />
That the justice and freedom… juridical parapets.<br />
<br />
Political action in this context is thus an abdication of the responsibility of sense and for sense, By engaging without prior questioning, without letting be of thought, the affirmative advocacy trumpets the presupposition of sense rather than sense itself. This is a confusing distinction, but a critical one. The project of this debate should be a letting be, an openness to sense as the sense of existence, as that thing that makes sense of the political and allows us to think and negotiate the possibility of politics as such. Endorsing action is thus antithetical to our project; the only hope for responsibility is to rescue it from the shackles of essentialist authority<br />

This isn’t a caricature…undetermined animal.”5<br />

Case 1NC<br />
Turn – the affirmatives acts on the presumption that legal power can constrain monarchical power – this move masks the convergence of arbitrary sovereignty with law and turns the case.<br />

Let me offer a general…without the king.<br />

Turn – the plan’s solvency within the confines of the United States reduces the rest of the world to bare life – turns the case by constructing an indeterminate zone of sovereign power<br />

If these tasks are… and realization.<br />

2NC Kritik<br />
Second movement – that of refusal and retreat. Our alternative is to put the very essence of politics into question, to refuse to believe that politics must operate vis-a-vis the conventions of the community and the capricious whims of the victors’ justice of the nation-state. Politics can be more, and that “more” begins with the possibility of refusal of politics, the 1ac and its attendant discourses included.<br />
Lacoue-Labarthe, 1997 (Philippe, Retreating the Political, 95 -97)<br />
By this I mean…has triggered<br />
<br />
Far from being a simple impact of their discourse, totalitarianism is both the possibility and the outcome of the political system the 1ac predicates itself upon. This is not a totalitarianism of the Soviets but a totalizing form of politics that exclused its Other. Nowhere is this attempt more egregious than in their framework arguments, where the very possibility of alternate way of thinking are defined, a priori and through hrecourse to some communal essence of the purpose of debate, as unacceptable.<br />
Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy, 1997 (Phillipe and Jean-Luc, Retreating the Political, 126-127)<br />
There is, on the…their results.<br />
<br />
This politics as normal faces its own paradox: it believes in the communal foundation of conventional politics, and yet it predicates this community on the silent killing of its constitutive outsides.<br />
<br />
The 1ac pretends at a certitude made possible only by a forced ignorance of the attendant histories and contexts that surround their project. There is no finite solution and no corrective action that can take place within the rules of the present game. Responsibility demands rethinking the prospect of the perhaps of the decision. Failure to do so reifies and produces a systematic violence, swamping and overwhelming their pretense of transformation<br />
Deridda, Gift of Death, 1995 (p 85)<br />
What is thus found at work…than a murderer?<br />
<br />
AT: Permutation<br />
1. Extend our Lacou-Labarthe alternative evidence – the political is by nature tyrannical in every form including that of the plan. The permutation suffers from the same limitation<br />
<br />
2. Do both means you vote negative – the permutation is included in our alternative; our goal is a retreat of the polticical and the interrogation that requires includes the ethical goals of the affirmative<br />
<br />
3. The plan corrupts the alternative – extend our nancy totalitarianism evidence – the affirmative retains the possibility of impossibly large imaginations of community that re-creates the violence of the status quo.<br />
<br />
4. One cannot risk a return to foundations, even when acknowledging that there are none. The horrors of the Holocaust demand a constant deconstruction in the face of the authority of law and politics<br />
Derrida, 2002 (from Force of Law, in Acts of Religion, p 298)<br />
When one thinks of the gas… to dictate.<br />
<br />
5. The questioning is not one that can be enshrined in prediction and established law but rather one that should be divorced from any pretense of determination and allowed open itself up to its own uncertainty<br />
Nancy 1997 (Jean-Luc, Retreating the Political, 157-158)<br />

The United States Supreme Court should overrule US v Morrison, holding that all components of a federal civil remedy for gender-based violence, with the exception of concurrent jurisdiction, can be sustained under a rational basis test of the Commerce Clause. The United States Supreme Court will hold that this remedy should be enforced by state courts.<br />
