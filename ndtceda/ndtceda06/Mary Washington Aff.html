“What would be the consequences… planet, we will all be losers.”<br />
<br />
Thus we offer the following plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex parte Quirin [317 U.S. 1 (1942)] ruling military commissions violate the due process clause of the 5th Amendment.<br />
<br />
Contention 3: Solvency<br />
The Quirin decision is outdated—advances in due process jurisprudence are reflected in court-martials and civilian courts but are lacking in military commissions. Enemy combatants should be prosecuted under the Geneva Conventions.<br />
Martinez is Assistant Professor of Law at Stanford and Lead Counsel in Padilla, 2004 (Jenny, Legal Affairs, Sept, 13, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.legalaffairs.org/webexclusive/debateclub_terror0904.msp" rel="nofollow">http://www.legalaffairs.org/webexclusive/debateclub_terror0904.msp</a>)<br />

“The military commission trials… Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.”<br />

Using court-martials to try terrorists would send a clear international signal that the US is committed to the rule of law<br />

<br />
“Congress could also create… under the rule of law.”<br />
<br />
And, military commissions are not necessary to protect classified intelligence—court-martials protect intelligence sources and methods without denying due process<br />
Sloan and Onek, Executive Dir. Of the Constitution Project and Senior Counsel of the Liberty and Security Initiative, 2002 (Virginia and Joseph, The Constitution Project, “Recommendations for the Use of Military Commissions,” Sept, 18, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/military_commissions_recommendations.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/military_commissions_recommendations.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
“As provided by the President’s…. for military commissions.”<br />
Our plan utilizes a Human Rights standard which is lacking in both the current counter-terror model and any other model. This standard spurs greater solvency of the root causes of terrorism and greater international cooperation<br />
<br />
Kielsgard, J.D. from Rutgers University , 2006 (Mark D., “A Human Rights Approach to Counter-Terrorism,” California Western International Law Review, 36 Cal. W. Int'l L.J. 249)<br />

Therefore we advocate the following plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) by ruling that the biased counseling laws upheld in Section 3205 of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 is unconstitutional based under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment.<br />

Contention One: Inherency<br />

AGAMBEN/STATE OF EXCEPTION OBS I<br />
1. Based on the Nazi saboteur incident, Ex Parte Quirin destroyed habeas corpus for enemy combatants. --- (Corpin) 06<br />
2. Quirin is the grounds for the War on Terror’s distinction of people inside and outside the law.<br />
3. This state of exception (SOE) leads to bare life for entire categories of people and guarantees absolutism. ---Agamben (05)<br />
4. SOE will cover the globe and lead to “global civil war.” Agamben 99<br />
5. SOE leads to living dead/concentration camps. Agamben 99<br />
<br />
SOLVENCY/OBSERVATION II<br />
1. Terrorists are a replay of Quirin for the collective memory<br />
2. Quirin on the periphery of the decision (??? Didn’t get this) Hasan 03<br />
3. The politics of necessity (DA’s) =&gt; empower the sovereign. Reject the mask of necessity. Agamben<br />
4. Reconciliation requires apology and recognition of responsibility by the perpetrator class (the Court). The 1AC is that act. We must recognize that under SQ we are all potential homo sacer. (Schapp? 04?)<br />
5. Critical act of remembrance is key to reconciliation with the other. Hasan 03<br />

a. Competing interpretations checks any abuse<br />
b. Don’t vote on potential abuse<br />
c. No in-round abuse<br />
COURT-STRIPPING DA (democracy good impact)<br />
1. Aff solves global war via Agamben<br />
2. Only Aff solves true democracy, guarantees human rights<br />
3. Impact calculus, DA’s non-unique in world of SQ SOE<br />
<br />
BIZ CON<br />
1. cross-apply Agamben 04: Aff solves via reconciliation of perpetrator class<br />
2. N/U: Global war inevitable via SOE<br />
3. Turn: economic rationalism destroys citizens’ agency<br />
4. Turn: economic rationalism leads to a hierarchical authoritarianism<br />
5. Cross-apply Agamaben: DA’s politics of necessity is bad<br />
<br />
Aff Strategy Notes:<br />
If the affirmative straight turned a DA, read a kritik against a DA, or did anything else unusual, make a note of it here.<br />
<br />
2AC Overview:<br />
They try to leverage the Agamben/SOE impact to non-unique all disadvantages. Only the 1AC’s reconciliation and apology by the perpetrator class has any risk of solving those disad impacts. Only the Supreme Court can solve collective memory. This means there is no Neg offense.<br />
The Agambe SOE scenario cites “liminal zones” that lead to a scenario like the breakup of Yugoslavia writ large. The inaction of voting Neg guarantees global civil war. All disads are mere speculative scenarios as to how the Agamben impact will materialize.<br />
