The affirmative team engages in the Kitsch” that is the grand march: a cultural wolrdview that says something must always be better than it is now. In the worldview of the grand march life is fundamentally unpleasant.<br />
White, 1990 (Alan, <em>Within Nietzsche’s Labyrinth</em>)<br />
Their representation of shit is not a moral one. It is proof that they view creation as unacceptable. You can’t have both; if you think shit is bad, then you don’t love it.<br />
White, 1990 (Alan, <em>Within Nietzsche’s Labyrinth</em>)<br />
Shit is not something bad. In fact, it is because of shit that life is so beautiful, and trying to get rid of shit indicates a failure to see life as valuable<br />
White, 1990 (Alan, <em>Within Nietzsche’s Labyrinth</em>)<br />
Any attempt to make change shows discontentment with life as it is. We reject the need to doubt our being and adocate that human experience is good as it is. A categorical agreement with being is in order<br />
White, 1990 (Alan, <em>Within Nietzsche’s Labyrinth</em>)<br />
Kitsch is the only shit. Although we can never get rid of this hatred of shit, we must unmask the life of kitsch, and spread the word that shit is good<br />
White, 1990 (Alan, <em>Within Nietzsche’s Labyrinth</em>)<br />
The presence of the ballot makes up their efficacy. They participate in debate only to further their own ends. They love the other only in order to impose themselves on their world<br />
Hall, 2004 (Gary, “Why you can’t do cultural studies and be a Derridean”)<br />
The attempt to identify, isolate, and solve suffering is a mechanism for creating an intrinsic moral order.<br />
Connelly, 2002 (William, <em>The Augustanian Imperative</em>)<br />
This drive to confess creates a moral order which is coercive and only breads resentment and anxiety for compliance with that very moral order. Reject their system of surveillance. Also vote against them because their alternative fails and is counter-productive<br />

EDELMAN<br />
Scrooge, living a life with his partner, was queer in the most basic form of the word. Leaving church, never raising a family and refusing to buy into the notion that the future rests on Tiny Tim, he had the potential to destroy and remove the fantasy that the town refused to deny: that life itself depends on the survival of the child. Scrooge gave in when Ghosts revealed to him the horrible fate he would suffer if he did not sacrifice his way of life for the child. Like the Ghosts in A Christmas Carol, the 1AC is a specter that haunts us with an impending doom of tomorrow, and persuades us to orient our every action towards saving the child of today’s world. The hidden message behind the 1AC is the same as that of the ghosts: the social and the political is not for the Queer.<br />
It is the political action of the 1AC and their commitment to preserving the social order that proves their inability to perceive of the value of life without its investment in the future.<br />
Edelman, 04<br />
(, Lee [Professor of English, Tufts University] <em>No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive</em>) 11<br />
In its coercive universalization….which meaning always depends.<br />
This action props up the belief that any failure to uphold the cultural burden of creating the future is not only meaningless but threatening to the social order.<br />
Edelman, 04<br />
(, Lee [Professor of English, Tufts University] <em>No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive</em>) 13<br />
Given that the author … “meaning,” despite itself, means.<br />
The affirmative’s commitment to futurity mandates the exclusion of all who do not ally themselves with the march to tomorrow and thus all who show the least sign of resisting this sameness. By weighing the future as more important than the present, they create a cycle of violence where anything resembling Queer must be destroyed for the sake of the Child.<br />
Edelman, 04<br />
(, Lee [Professor of English, Tufts University] <em>No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive</em>) 19-22<br />
Thus, while lesbians and … our children, God’s children.<br />
Reproductive futurism props up hatred and exclusion and justifies the abuse of today’s adults in favor of tomorrow’s children. The Queer must resist this everyday violence by saying FUCK THE FUTURE.<br />
Edelman, 04<br />
(, Lee [Professor of English, Tufts University] <em>No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive</em>)<br />
Bernard Law, the former … serves as its prop.<br />
Every one of the Ghosts the 1AC warns us of must be rejected as a fantasy. By embodying the Queer we refuse the need for commoditization of the social, and deny the illusion that identity must be based on the Child.<br />
Edelman, 04<br />
(, Lee [Professor of English, Tufts University] <em>No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive</em>)<br />
To figured the undoing … our lives to maintain.<br />
Queers find jouissance in the death drive, a drive that rejects the drive for purpose that the social has constructed, and embraces the narcissistic pleasure that says, “fuck the future.”<br />
Edelman, 04<br />
(, Lee [Professor of English, Tufts University] <em>No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive</em>)<br />
The drive – more exactly, … held in perpetual trust.<br />
Their defense of futurity falls into the cycle of continually convicting the queer members of society as villains to their cause. In this worldview, they rock the cradle of life at the expense of sinthomosexuals, creating the future by means of sacrificing and doing violence against the queer.<br />
Edelman, 04<br />
(, Lee [Professor of English, Tufts University] <em>No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive</em>) 153-154<br />
In what he called … drive, keep on coming.<br />
There is hope in the Sinthome; the part of a being that does not exist for the future and that denies any part of being that is not immediate and individual. The 1ac would have us understand being as something that can only be defined in reference to some external Other, making us invalid without our connection to the future. It is through sinthomosexuality, that those excluded from the façade that futurity has painted over the nothingness that seeps beyond its seems, that we can finally enter a space that yields us agency.<br />
Edelman, 04<br />
(, Lee [Professor of English, Tufts University] <em>No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive</em>)<br />
Sinthomosexuality, on the other … which meaning comes undone.<br />

The use of law legitimizes sovereignty, causing marginalization and exclusion and ultimately resulting in violence. It forecloses actual resistance and recreates bare life.<br />
<br />
Kohn 06 Barelife and the limits of law, Theory and Event Project Muse<br />
<br />
At this point it should be clear that Agamben would….or more precisely not seeing, sovereign powr is the only way to disrupt its hegemonic effects<br />
<br />
New law is merely conservation of the old, maintaining the link between law and violence. The affirmative is a conservation of the law, that excepts the sovereign outside the law. It places the state, in the form of the Supreme Court, back into a state of exception, turning the case by justifying the 1AC harms as well as new atrocities by moving the homo sacer further outside the scope of the public<br />
<br />
Agamben Homo Sacer: Sovereign power and Bare 98 p. 464-5<br />
<br />
The violence exercised in the state of exception clearly neither preserves…the link between violence and law is maintained even at the point of their indistinction.<br />

K- Foucault<br />
<br />
<ol><li>Our specific links- the torture chamber- the harms of Guantanamo are endemic to the liberal system. Rather than fixing the problem of Guantanamo, the affirmative merely creates a system of ‘pure principals’ of rights and democracy, which doom the world to perpetual torture. Changes in law and appeals to the international system merely cause violence to be exported to other countries. Guantanamo is a new level of biopolitical control, whose solution is Foucaultian critique, not appeal to legal or liberal principals</li></ol><br />
Neal “Foucault in Guantanamo: National, sovereign, disciplinary exceptionalism”<br />
Is it true that there is nothing new about torture…It is Michel Fucault who here offers an enciting invitation<br />
<br />
<ol><li>The right to control life- rights discourse is the root cause of Guantanamo- it can only exist as a state of exception because it is in a zone of rights. The aff participates in a dialectic of exception which ensures continuing violence</li></ol>Neal 05<br />
<br />
There does not exist today…undermines individual rights, the exemplar ideal genesis of the state in the constitution and law itself.<br />
<ol><li>Exporting the exception they don't solve their case- ending detention just means that Bush will export suspects to other nations. The aff cant solve this because they only end detention without charge</li></ol><br />
Neal 05<br />
<br />
As well as detaining terrorist suspects…justify interrogating such suspects in third countries.<br />
<br />
Freedom is only possible through a K of identity- affirming civil rights locks identity into place as determined by one’s relations to the state. Only the K calls into question political identities and enables a break from the model of state domination.<br />

Too often strategies of resistance…identificationa determination, possible to be other than what we presently are/
