Contention One – An Unhappy Precedent<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court explicitly relies on Ex Parte Quirin to justify intervention into on-going military proceedings in the war on terror<br />
Justice Stevens 6/29/06 (Hamdan v Rumsfeld, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-184.ZS.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-184.ZS.html</a>)<br />
<br />
The language used by the current court to reject abstention in Hamdan is taken verbatim from the Quirin decision<br />
Former Chief Justice Stone 1942 (EX PARTE QUIRIN 317 U.S. 1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/quirin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/quirin.html</a>)<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 is Military Effectiveness<br />
<br />
The Supreme Courts interference in war on terror operations has created a breakdown in comity; the judiciary feels no obligation to abstain from interference in on-going military proceedings. This insertion of the court into the arena of foreign affairs will create new distractions and obligations that will significantly undermine the effectiveness of our armed forces<br />
Haagensen, Managing Editor of the Ohio Northern University Law Review, 2006 (Ohio Northern University Law Review)<br />
<br />
Rejection of comity causes mass disruption of the armed forces because of judicial micromanagement and exploitation of the system from savvy wartime captives<br />
Hoffman, Attorney and retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, Summer 2005 (Parameters)<br />
<br />
The effect that judicial interference will have on the armed forces cannot be underestimated – effective deployment will be impossible as our military gets bogged down in legal bureaucracy. Under these conditions, a decline of US military superiority is inevitable<br />
Barr, Former Attorney General of the United States, 6/15/05 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1542&amp;wit_id=4362" rel="nofollow">http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1542&amp;wit_id=4362</a>)<br />
<br />
The impact is nuclear conflict across the globe<br />
Ferguson, Professor of History at NYU and Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Sep/Oct 2004 (Foreign Affairs)<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 is Terrorism<br />
<br />
A lack of comity creates a policymaking role for the courts in the war on terrorism. Inherent design and operation flaws in the judiciary make it particularly unsuited to this task. Continued decision making by courts in the war on terror ensures that we will be unable to prevent future terrorist attacks<br />
Yoo, Professer of Law at Berkeley, January 2006 (Cornell Law Review)<br />

Judicial interference in on-going military proceedings threatens intelligence operations which are the most important means of preventing future terrorist attacks on the U.S.<br />

We cannot reduce terrorism through gestures of compassion that win the hearts and minds of anti-American populations – only by disrupting terrorist activity can we win the war on terror<br />
Peters, Retired Army Officer, Summer 2004 (Parameters)<br />
<br />
Therefore we offer the following plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in Ex Parte Quirin that federal courts are not required to abstain from ruling on on-going military proceedings on the grounds that comity requires military defendants to exhaust all military remedies before seeking federal court relief<br />
<br />
Re-establishing judicial abstention prevents harmful interference in military and war on terror proceedings while improving judicial review after defendants have exhausted all military remedies<br />

<br />
Abstention is the most practical course – it allows the court to see the completion of military tribunals so that complicated questions concerning the Geneva Conventions, the UCMJ, and congressional authorization can be more effectively resolved without interference in on going military proceedings<br />
Sunstein, Professor of Law at Chicago, July 2006 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ssrn.com/abstract_id=922406" rel="nofollow">http://ssrn.com/abstract_id=922406</a>)<br />
<br />
Comity is the best middle of the road option because it preserves executive flexibility without unrestricted deference. Judicial review after all available remedies have been exhausted ensures protection of civil liberties and provides an effective check against an over-reach of executive wartime power<br />

the impact of terrorism is not just some big bang – it takes place throughout the world each and every day through suicide bombings which transform society to a life of permanent suffering<br />

In the block we went for 2 disads (court-stripping and India Deal (good) politics) and case, they kicked out of their hege and Israeli modeling advantages and went hardcore for terrorism. They make a 'means v motivation' argument to answer any turns to the terrorism argument, saying means are more important because you can never solve motivation. That was the underlying theme of the 1AR and 2AR. Also, the terrorism impact they focus on is retaliation. We won on court-stripping and case takeouts. I didn't grab any cites from that round, sorry. Hope that helps,<br />

<br />
contention two is terrorism<br />
<br />
