I. THE COMMERCE CLAUSE HOLDING IN MORRISON UNDERMINES ECONOMIC CITIZENSHIP FOR VICTIMS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Intimate partner violence proceeds mostly unpunished in America. In part this is due to the US v. Morrison decision where the Court ignored the economic impact of that violence.<br />
<br />
Johnson, Editor-in-Chief of the Santa Clara Law Review, 2003<br />
<br />
[“Jennifer, Comment: Privileged Justice Under Law: Reinforcement of Male Privilege by the Federal Judiciary Through the Lens of the Violence Against Women Act and U.S. v. Morrison”, 43 Santa Clara Law Review, Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399, p. L/N]<br />
<br />
Every year in the United States, violence by men kills women in numbers…not at economic activity appropriate for Commerce Clause regulation. n23<br />
<br />
<br />
This undervaluation increases the subordination of women in our society.<br />
<br />
<br />
Johnson, Editor-in-Chief of the Santa Clara Law Review, 2003<br />
<br />
[“Jennifer, Comment: Privileged Justice Under Law: Reinforcement of Male Privilege by the Federal Judiciary Through the Lens of the Violence Against Women Act and U.S. v. Morrison”, 43 Santa Clara Law Review, Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399, p. L/N]<br />
<br />
With these aspects of our economy in mind…further discriminatory factors to its analysis.<br />
<br />
<br />
By explicitly holding in Morrison that intimate partner violence does not produce a national or material impact it confined meaningful solutions to violence to the “local” level.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
<br />
[Catherine, “The Supreme Court, 1999 Term Comment: Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison”, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. L/N]<br />
<br />
Instead, the Morrison majority revived a long discredited tradition…gender-based inequality before the Court.<br />
<br />
<br />
By holding in Morrison that intimate partner violence has less of a national economic effect than the production and home consumption of wheat, as in the Wickard decision, the Court relegated the issue to the margins of ineffective local, family law solutions.<br />
<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
<br />
[Catherine, “The Supreme Court, 1999 Term Comment: Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison”, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. L/N]<br />
<br />
But violence against women remained, to the Morrison Court,…jurisprudence to its interest in the new federalism. n77<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that the Court almost always upholds Congressional authority as legitimate under its interstate commerce power, as it did under the recent Raich decision, only underscores how, in Morrison, it singled out and undervalued the impact of intimate partner violence against women.<br />
<br />
Epstein, Professor of Law Chicago, 2005<br />
<br />
[Richard, Cato Supreme Court Review, 2004-05 Cato Sup. Ct. Rev. 11]<br />
<br />
There has been much talk of a revival of the Commerce Clause…home-grown or supplied for free from in-state sources.<br />
<br />
<br />
The holding in the Morrison majority opinion guarantees the perpetuation of gendered patterns of discrimination in our economy, reinforces subordination of women and denying them equal economic citizenship.<br />
<br />
<br />
Resnik, Professor of Law, Yale 2001<br />
<br />
[Judith, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe”, Yale Law Journal, 111 Yale L.J. 619, p. L/N<br />
<br />
Explanation of the refusal to subsume VAWA within legitimate…the role that violence plays in economic citizenship.<br />
<br />
<br />
The majority holding in Morrison has the effect of preventing the federal government from legislating equality rights for women.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
<br />
[Catherine, “The Supreme Court, 1999 Term Comment: Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison”, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. L/N]<br />
<br />
On its most obvious level, Morrison represents the high-water mark to…meaningful equal protection of the laws to them.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon adds, Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
<br />
[Catherine, “The Supreme Court, 1999 Term Comment: Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison”, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. L/N]<br />
<br />
The Morrison majority found gender-motivated crimes of…and medical and other expenses. n62<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Court sent a message to Congress and society fundamentally denying the equality of women and in the process entrenched a script of self-blame for victims of intimate partner violence.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gleason, The Center for American Women and Politics, Rutgers, 2001<br />
<br />
[Christie, “Presence, Perspectives and Power: Gender and the Rationale Differences in the Debate Over the Violence Against Women Act”, Women's Rights Law Reporter, 23 Women's Rights L. Rep. 1, p. L/N<br />
<br />
By ignoring the legislative history and granting little…enough to be a part of our national legal structure. n209<br />
<br />
<br />
The majority holding in Morrison blocks full equality for women, particularly in the area of economic citizenship.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
<br />
[Catherine, “The Supreme Court, 1999 Term Comment: Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison”, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. L/N]<br />
<br />
Men have long fought over who has power over whom and…of its people by the other should survive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2. IMPACTS TO THE LACK OF FULL ECONOMIC CITIZENSHIP.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Commerce Clause reasoning in Morrison perpetuated the historical lack of economic citizenship for women in the United States. Legal recognition is essential.<br />
<br />
Kessler-Harris, Professor of American History, Columbia, 2001<br />
<br />
[Alice, In Pursuit of Equity: Women, Men, and the Quest for Economic Citizenship in 20th- Century America, p. 12-13<br />
<br />
What about women? The language of economic citizenship…and opportunity in the marketplace.<br />
<br />
<br />
Citizenship as recognized by protection from violence is crucial to the establishment of individual agency.<br />
<br />
White, Fellow in Politics, Oxford University, 2003<br />
<br />
[Stuart, The Civic Minimum: On the Rights and Obligations of Economic Citizenship, p. 30-31<br />
<br />
Firstly, each citizen has a physical-integrity interest… violate the slave’s interest in physical integrity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The resulting impact of subordination amounts in magnitude to a literal war against victims of intimate violence.<br />
<br />
Ray, US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 2-1997<br />
<br />
[Amy, American University Law Review]<br />
<br />
Because, as currently constructed, human rights…prosecuted for human rights violations under war crimes statutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Male dominance must be effectively challenged to protect human survival.<br />
<br />
Steans, Senior Lecturer, International Relations Theory, University of Birmingham, 1998<br />
<br />
[Jill, Gender and International Relations: An Introduction, p. 102-103]<br />
<br />
In this view, not only is war part of women’s daily existence… other states militarism and internal hierarchy. [IT CONTINUES…] Human survival may depend upon … ‘revisions’ are the subject of chapter 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
Increased democritization of the economy is vital for decision-making that resists oppressive institutions.<br />
