Infromed consent is designed to coerce women<br />
Informed consent through the use of controlling physician to patient speech delivers a message with the intent of overwhelming the woman’s own deliberative powers and is impermissible b/c it would undermine the woman as the ultimate decision maker and therefore creates an undue burden<br />

Turn: the Genocidal Mentality<br />
<ol><ol><li>Our construction of scenarios aims the worlds nuclear weapons</li></ol></ol>Lipschutz; Assistant Professor of Politics and Director of the Adelai Stevenson Program on Global Security at the UC Santa Cruz ’95 (Ronnie D.’ On Security’ page 10)<br />
Security is to put…to us with them.<br />
<ol><ol><li>Nuclear scenario repition guarantees omnicide</li></ol></ol>Lifton &amp; Markusen, Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology at John Jay College and CUNY &amp; Sociologist at Carthage College, in 1990 (Robert and Eric, The Genocidal Mentality, p. 213)<br />
The psychological process of…got a way out.<br />
Masking your actions under the rubric of making objective reality more tolerable is exactly what allows us to commit atrocities in the name of maintaining the SQ.<br />
Zizek, 2001 (Slavoj, Senior Researcher at the Inst. For Sociology in Ljubljana, “Did somebody say totalitarianism?” p. 112-3)<br />
The standard motto of ethical…object-instrument of the big Other’s jouissnace.<br />
This regulatory power on the part of the state finds its ultimate expression in wholesale slaughter<br />
Michel Foucault, 1978. The history of sexuality, v.1 p. 135-7<br />
Since the Classical age…phenomena of population.<br />
The language of the bomb envelops us and masks our thinking – we come to view nuclear weapons as part of the necessary cosmic balance and socialize those weapons into permanency<br />
Lifton &amp; Markusen in 1990 (Robert J. &amp; Eric, The Genocidal Mentality, p. 146-8)<br />
Strategists’ language is crucial…twice barbaric indeed.<br />
Their calculative FW reduces life to no value, DA is just an excuse to exclude the other from geopolitics, looking to projected threats in order to justify extermination of the politically dis-qualified. This calculation devalues all life.<br />
Dillon 99 (Michael, Politics at Lancaster, “Another Justice,” Political Theory, v27, n2, April, p.164-6)<br />
Quite the reverse. … of the human way of being.<br />
Yes, Calculation and decisions are inevitable, but organization of life through a risk-based framework that places a limit on the value to life. Rather than conservatively seeking to avoid danger, we must commission an incalculable strategy to combat systemic injustice.<br />
Campbell 98. Professor of International politics at the U of Newcastle. [David. National Deconstruction: Violence, Identity, and Justice in Bosnia, p. 186-8]<br />
That undecidability resides within the decision…an affirmative political manner.<br />
Calculative framework draws an offensive and arbitrary distinction between what type of violence is considered “important”. Conceptions of war and peace ignore systemic violence against women.<br />
Chowdhury 2k2 (Rumna, “Kadic v. Karadzic: Rape as a Crime Against Women as a Class”, Law and Inequality Journal, Winter)<br />
The international attention begs…as rape during war.<br />

THE SORDID HISTORY OF ABORTION REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES REVEALS DEEP SEEDED NORMATIVE JUDGMENTS ABOUT WOMEN, THEIR ROLES AND SOCIETY AT LARGE. IT IS ONLY THROUGH A CRITICAL HISTORICAL INTERROGATION THAT THE POWER RELATIONS WHICH CREATED THESE LAWS ARE EXPOSED. WITHOUT THIS EXPOSURE THE ILLICIT THOUGHTS AND DOMINATIONS INHERENT IN ABORTION LAWS WILL BE ENDLESSLY REPEATED.<br />
THE MEDICALIZATION RHETORIC FINDS ITS BEGINNINGS IN THESE ROOTS OF SOCIAL PREJUDICE, AS WOMEN WERE PORTRAYED AS INSTRUMENTS FOR NATURE’S PURPOSES, BEREFT OF ANY AGENCY BEYOND THAT DICTATED BY THEIR BODIES<br />
Reva Siegel, 1992, Reasoning from the Body: A Historical Perspective on Abortion Regulation and Questions of Equal Protection, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 261, Acting Professor of Law, University of California at Berkeley<br />
<br />
THE CAMPAIGN TO WREST FROM WOMEN CONTROL OF REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS WAS ALSO INFORMED BY A DESIRE TO MAINTAIN THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE “NATIVE” STATE AGAINST ENCROACHING POOR AND ETHNIC POPULATIONS, REVEALING THE RACIST AND CLASSIST MOTIVATIONS DRIVING POPULATION CONTROL<br />
Siegel continues<br />
<br />
THE JURISPRUDENCE SURROUNDING ABORTION IS ENTRENCHED IN THE LEGACY OF THE ANTI-ABORTION CAMPAIGN—JUSTIFYING THE SUBORDINATION OF WOMEN DUE TO ANTIQUATED GENDER ROLES, STILL INSIDIOUS YET RENDERED INVISIBLE BY MEDICALIZED DISCOURSE<br />
Siegel continues<br />
<br />
FROM THIS EXPLICATION OF OUR ADVOCACY IT IS CLEAR THAT IN ORDER TO FINALLY PUT AN END TO THE VIOLENCE AND SUBJUGATION OF ABORTION REGULATION:<br />
<br />
WE STAND RESOLVED THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE ITS DECISION IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY (505 U. S. 833 1992) BY HOLDING THAT THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD ESTABLISHED IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY VIOLATES THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.<br />
WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CLARIFY.<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION ONE: THE BIOPOLITICS OF ABORTION REGULATION<br />
<br />
ABORTION REGULATION IS THE STATE’S COERCIVE POWER WRIT LARGE, THE DISCOURSES OF WOMEN’S “CHOICE” AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE ONLY OBSCURE THIS POWER<br />
Reva Siegel, 1992, Reasoning from the Body: A Historical Perspective on Abortion Regulation and Questions of Equal Protection, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 261, Acting Professor of Law, University of California at Berkeley<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS REGULATORY POWER ON THE PART OF THE STATE FINDS ITS ULTIMATE EXPRESSION IN THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER OF WARS, GENOCIDE AND THE NUCLEAR THREAT TO SURVIVAL<br />
Michel Foucault, 1978, The History of Sexuality, v. 1, p. 135-137<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION TWO: SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
RECONCEPTUALIZING THE HISTORY OF ABORTION REGULATION IS THE FIRST STEP TO UNDERSTANDING<br />
Siegel, 1992<br />
<br />
EQUAL PROTECTION IS THE ONLY BODY OF CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS THE GENDER BIAS OF ABORTION REGULATION—HOWEVER EVEN EQUAL PROTECTION IS INEFFECTIVE WHEN FORMALLY CONCEPTUALIZED. OUR HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE’S CRITICAL SOCIAL FOCUS CORRECTS THIS.<br />
Siegel, 1992 (p. 32)<br />
<br />
THE COURT HAS A SPECIFIC MANDATE TO SETTLE ISSUES OF ABORTION RIGHTS DUE TO ITS UNIQUE LEGITIMACY REGARDING RIGHTS ISSUES ENCOMPASSED IN THE CONSTITUTION<br />
Tyler and Mitchell 94 (Tom and Gregory, “Legitimacy and the Empowerment of Discretionary Legal Authority: The United States Supreme Court and Abortion Rights.” Duke Law Journal 43, no. 4 (February): 719-720)<br />
<br />
PROBLEMATIZING HISTORY IS CENTRAL TO ENGAGING IN ETHICAL PRACTICES, WHERE WE DESTABILIZE OUR OWN SUBJECTIVITIES AND RECREATE OURSELVES AS ETHICAL BEINGS<br />
Rainbow 97 (Paul, Professor of Anthropology at U.C. Berkley, “Introduction,” Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth, p. xxxv-xxxvi)
