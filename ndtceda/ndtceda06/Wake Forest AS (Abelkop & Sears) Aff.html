Contention one is constitutionalism – Casey established a special justification for violations of stare decisis, which ensures judicial activism and subverts constitutional integrity – This reliance on stare decisis is unconstitutional and must be rejected to prevent a breakdown in the constitutional order<br />
Paulsen in ‘95<br />
50 Alb L. Rev. 671, lexis<br />
“Who, in his or her right…..of constitutional law”<br />
Focus on precedent relegates decision-making to the elites and alienates the public – a return to textualism is necessary to galvanize democratic deliberation<br />

Boggs in ’97<br />

“The decline of the public…..of public space”<br />
Arguments in favor of stare decisis are self-justifying, empirically false, and incorrect – a framework of textualism is on balance more predictable and results in greater judicial restraint<br />
Calabresi ‘05<br />
22 Const. Commentary 311, lexis<br />
“saying that stare decisis……our constitutional history”<br />
Casey’s stare decisis test should be replaced with a standard of deference to the elected branches, which will cause the Court to decide cases on their merits<br />
Calabresi in ‘05<br />

Ammendments allow for all progressive change – orginalism is inherently adaptive<br />

Plan: The Supreme Court of the United States should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey by rejecting the special justification standard for stare decisis, holding instead that the Court should evaluate challenges to precedent based on the text of the United States Constitution and should defer to politically elected officials in considerations of stare decisis. We can clarify.<br />

Contention 1 – terrorism<br />

Initially note that a consensus of experts agrees we will not win the war on terror in the status quo.<br />

Since 2001, terrorists have found their targets on almost every continent, with bombings in Bali, London, Madrid, and elsewhere. Five years on, however, America<br />
<br />
<br />
And, terrorists will use weapons of mass destruction.<br />
Posner, US Court of Appeals 7th Dist. Judge, lecturer at U of Chicago Law, 2k6 [Richard,Not a Suicide Pact: The Constitution in a Time of National Emergency, p2]<br />
All these episodes placed pressure on existing constitutional understandings.<br />

Without sustained international cooperation terrorism will escalate to extinction.<br />

Global terrorism is on the rise and is likely to continue unabated for the next 100 years<br />

Even an unsuccessful attack causes extinction.<br />

What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists?<br />
<br />
Eliminating military commissions in their entirety is essential to gain international credibility and sustain cooperation in the war on terror.<br />
Koh, Editor of the American Journal of International Law, 2k2 [Harold Hongju, 96 A.J.I.L. 337, lexis]<br />
The use of military commissions potentially endangers Americans overseas by undermining the U.S. government's ability to protest effectively when other countries use such tribunals. But just as troubling, espousing military commissions undermines U.S. moral leadership<br />
<br />
Commissions undermine domestic and international support making effective coalitions impossible.<br />
Fogarty, colonel in the Australian army, 2k5 [Gerald, “Guantanamo Bay: Undermining the Global War on Terror, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0KNN/is_39/ai_n15893117/pg_6" rel="nofollow">http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0KNN/is_39/ai_n15893117/pg_6</a>]<br />
The international community, along with individual rights<br />

And, self-interest arguments are wrong – our credibility affects the degree of cooperation, which is essential to sustainable terrorism prevention.<br />
Nye, government prof at Harvard, 2k4 [Joseph, professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, a former US assistant secretary of defense| Sydney Morning Herald]<br />
Today, some states harbour terrorists in order to attack their enemies<br />
<br />
Military commissions prevent extradition of suspects, which is essential to prosecution and overall success of the war on terrorism.<br />

The blowback to the special military tribunals was almost immediate from<br />

Advantage Two: Democracy<br />
The Court’s attempts to check the executive have been circumvented because they have been too narrow <em>– the Military Commission Act is the most recent example.<br />
