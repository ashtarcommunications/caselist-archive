The affirmative demonstatrees a political framework that is only willing to commit responsibility explicity, in contexts where we can identifgy exactly what mus be done, and thus feel as if we have completed our jobs so we can be done with our responsibilityies<br />
<br />
The status of the other as other is reaffirmed, made legal andmade permanement. The gift of law becomes a way of withdrawing rsposbility by saying we hav done all we can do<br />
<br />
Explicit moral commitments undermine a larger framework of ethical relations. We need an ethical system that can relate to the other without having to commit to the other being or not being a partilar thing. When the aff establishes a norm for identiy they also establish and expectation that indivial appear or no appear in a certaina way. When theother does no appear as we expect or when they do no appear at all an enxiet is produced that peeresses itself in disassociated forms of violence<br />
<br />
Derida 92 (The Gift of Death pg 85-86)<br />
<br />
The applies all the more to political or legal matters….. The permanent operation of this sacrifice.<br />
<br />
The appearance of the other produces a tremendous anxiety because we don’t know whether they can be treated as friend or must be kept away as an enemy. The aff tries to do away with this anxiety by incorporating the other into law but its attempts to negotaiat euqlaity and responsibility in terms of the other’s identyy codify hierarchial valuations of the nhuman body as a basis for legal relationshisps with the other. Trying to resovle the ambiguity of the other is just an attempt to do away with aneixt rather than confiont it. Integration the friendly other is as easy as killing the foreign enemy but either position result sin a responsible ethical disposition. Instead th aff turns inwar in a form of policait narcissism that produces new and crueler forms of aggression<br />

Economy<br />
1. U.S. economy is resilient<br />
Avery, 2005 (Susan, 6-16, Report from ISM: Forecast is optimistic)<br />
The U.S. economy is amazingly resilient… economic performance<br />
<br />
2. Recession of 2001 and Asian Financial crisis proves economic downturn doesn’t cause war<br />
<br />
3. The economy is in a better position now – consumers know how to deal with decession<br />
Miller and Benjamin, 9-12-06 (Rich and Matthew, Bloomberg News, Economy resilient after the attacks, but now? Another shock could be damaging)<br />
Not all economists agree… in Cleveland.<br />

4. The impact is wrong – economic decline doesn’t cause war<br />
Deudney, 1991 (Daniel, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, April)<br />
Poverty wars. In a second scenario, declining living standards first cause internal turmoil… will exacerbate the problem.<br />

5. World War II example is wrong<br />

Delgado and Stefancic 2004 (Richard and Jean, Howard Law Journal, Spring)<br />

2. Integration isn’t the opposite of segregation – integration obliterates distinctive black institution<br />

Over the years, people such as… basis of race.<br />

3. Racist means nuclear war impact doesn’t make sense<br />
a.. no timeframe for solvency – elites are historically isolated<br />
b. Japan proves – using a nuclear weapon against another ethnic group causes backlash<br />
c. deterrence means people won’t use WMD<br />
d. nuclear war cause racism – war propaganda proves our argument<br />

<u>T: Must Overrule</u><br />
A. Interpretation<br />
1. Overrule means to make a precedent void on the SAME GROUNDS as the original decision<br />
2. Decision is synonymous with the holding in the case – it’s distinct from reasoning and dicta.<br />
B. Violation – due process under 5th amendment, not 14th, is equal protection<br />

Emory HH Specific CP Text:<br />
The USSC should adopt the structural necessity test for evaluating congressional power under the commerce clause. The US congress should condition federal grants under Medicaid, Medicare, and the social security act to the fifty sovereign states of the US of America upon the 50 states surrendering their 11th Amendment immunity under the federal acts banning discrimination based on age and disability and enacting all civil remedies found within the former VAWA of 1994.<br />
<br />
Observation One: Solvency<br />
Congress can sidestep US v Morrison by conditioning funds through Medicare and Social Security on state’s enforcing the provisions of the former Violence against Women Act of 94<br />
Leon Friedman, professor of Const. Law @ Hofstra, 8-27-01, “Overruling the court,” American Prospect<br />

Round after round we return to framing politics as a relationship between multiple people mediated by the centrally important figure of the law. How does this law come into being? What sustains our practices of the law and their relationship to legal violence?<br />
<br />
Politics appears when we see the world in terms of interactions between different people. Any interaction comes out of an initial moment of confrontation where two individuals recognize each other as subjects. What we <em>really want</em> is to <em>be</em> subjects - that is, recognized by (an)other. But to be subjects we have to be subjected to a common condition - call this 3rd figure “the law”. We make the law intervene so that we have a consistent mechanism to relate to others. The law is supposed to do away with the anxiety that the other may not be knowable and controlling and replace this anxiety with a clear image of friend or enemy that we can at least integrate into our depiction of reality.<br />
<br />
We think that the affirmative operates to insert the law in such a way that it can supplement equality by mediating our relationships with others in terms of identity and citizenship.<br />

Peter <strong><u>Gabel.</u></strong> May <strong><u>1984</u></strong><br />
[ A Critique of Rights: The Phenomenology of Rights-Consciousness and the Pact of the Withdrawn Selves., 62 Tex. L. Rev. 1563 ]<br />
Although <strong><u>the law</u></strong> has a positive dimension to which I will return later, in its negative<br />
An idealized object begins to stand in for the actual other. ....Loving the other begins to define politics, but this type of love treats the other as an object, and politics turns back on itself in narcissism, producing the desire to sacrifice freedom for order.<br />
<br />
Wendy <strong><u>Brown</u></strong>, Prof @ UC Berkeley, <strong><u>2006</u></strong><br />
[Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire]<br />
<br />
<br />
The law brings us together by alienating us, producing quietude, passivity and submission while enabling state violence....<br />
The affirmative representations of politics reduces the political to identity and the negotiation between isolated, “free”, “autonomous” individuals. A politics of ontology and predictability takes over, treating others as objects, like marionettes on a stage.<br />
<br />
Wendy <strong><u>Brown</u></strong>, Prof @ UC Berkeley, <strong><u>2006</u></strong><br />
[Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire]<br />
The affirmative expresses an attempt to regulate social violence, but this search for control produces isolated individuals (call them “subjects”) whose anxiety can only be resolved through surveillance of each other and themselves.... Violence and enmity are naturalized as politics is removed from historical context and identity is asserted as a “strategic rubric,” meaning in terms of security.<br />
<br />
Wendy <strong><u>Brown</u></strong>, Prof @ UC Berkeley, <strong><u>2006</u></strong><br />
[Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire]<br />
<br />
We offer the alternative of a precarious existence, finding security in our insecurity and refusing to turn our insecurities into a hunt for a terrorist other. ....<br />
Failing to deal with this internal human aggression expressed in identification and difference turns us toward a political narcissism and anxiety that produces new and crueler forms of aggression.<br />
<br />
Judith <strong><u>Butler</u></strong>, Phallic Metonym, <strong><u>2003</u></strong><br />
[Precarious Life]<br />
: &quot;<strong><u>The face as the extreme precariousness of the other. Peace as awakeness to the precariousness of the other&quot;</u></strong> (PP, iG7). ...<strong><u>Aggression is then turned back upon oneself in the form of super-egoic cruelty. If the ethical moves us beyond bad conscience, it is because bad conscience is, after all, only a negative version of narcissism, and so still a form of narcissism. The face of the other comes to me from outside, and interrupts that narcissistic circuit. The face of the other calls me out of narcissism towards something finally more important.</u></strong>
