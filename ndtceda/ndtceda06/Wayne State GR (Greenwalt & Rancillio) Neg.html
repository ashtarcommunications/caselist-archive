The neg solves managerialism<br />
Case<br />
No reason the aff gets to all of these args – the timeframe is long<br />
Racism inevitable – subjectivity in terms of ethics comes into plays<br />
No ethics exist within capitalism<br />
Courts of status quo will lead to bans anyway<br />
We can still access this arg with the criticism<br />

Sacrifice link extended at the top of the 2nc<br />
Class politics is another link<br />
Win a link = turn to case<br />
Zizek and Daily Evidence<br />
You radically depoliticize when you don’t get rid of the root of the aff problem – capitalism<br />
Permutation operates within the system of capitalism – this allows capitalism to fill-in<br />
Capitalism Creates – makes extinction inevitable – meszarros ‘97<br />
AT: Schwab – Zuponjec ev proves that your ethics don’t work – the alternative works outside of the bounds of capitalism – which is like suicide – creates a new plane of thinking<br />
Ideological differences will exist post the plan – this recreates the system of capital<br />
K is essential to liberation<br />
Zizek ‘99<br />
Alternative is a question of alignment – voting aff = ok to exploit people<br />
Zizek in ’97 – reliance on external state authority to solve assumes the state CAN break itself down<br />
Plan Reslults in ineffective coalitions, the state backlashes against the movements they say are critical to solve<br />
Civil Rights – movement caused more backlash<br />
Politics is a game of keeping up<br />
Rights links – ability of the state to control, and sanction all actions<br />
Reject the law = open space for new responsibility and ethic<br />
You cant access solvency – you cant reach the other<br />
Framework<br />
Capitalism is merely a belief issue – stop believing and it will collapse<br />
The k is a pre-condition to the aff<br />
<br />
CITES<br />
CP – All 50 States and relevant territories should repeal their safe haven statutues ask and we’ll clarify<br />
And, repealing the safe havens status is crucial to stop a cultural shift that makes the roll back of protections inevitable and stops the stigmatization of mothers who choose to have an abortion<br />

the neg interpretation is superior<br />
1. the issue of what occurs in the law after a case is oveeruled is core negative ground by identifying the new precedent the affirmative forecloses this area of debate which destroys key solvency args allows the aff to spike out of das and crushes negative predictability<br />

In the next available test case, the USSC should overrule its decision in U.S. vs. Morrison by ruling that section 13981 of the Violence Against Women Act does not violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and that inaction by the USFG in the realm of gendered violence violates the right to the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness (*not pursuit of?) guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. We can clarify.<br />
<br />
The Net Benefits<br />
<br />
A. Due Process is Good<br />
<br />
In the Lawrence decision Justice Kennedy established the groundwork of a new form of Due Process – granting new fundamental rights represents a turn away from the historical baggage of previous Due Process Claims<br />
Parshall 05 Albany LR<br />
Justice kennedy consistently reflected AND protected liberty interests<br />
<br />
B. Expanding due process to include a fundamental right to be free from gendered violence established a precedent for future cases. The CP proved the necessary groundwork for larger Due Process struggles.<br />
Hard 2k4 (Assistant Executive Editor of the Buffalo Law Review) (Nicole, Buffalo Law Review, fall page lexis)<br />
Yet by characterizing the petitioners' claim as one of due process….the result is a narrow win that could eventually work against the gay comunity.<br />

Second, Equal protection relies on a male-female paradigm that erases interseuxals<br />
Hart Cites above 2k4<br />
However, sex-based equal protection arguments rely on the assumption that gender is a rigid characteristic….Biological circumstances at birth can lead to a range of intersex conditions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Impacts:<br />
<br />
First, heterosexism in the law erases and exterminates sexual minorities<br />
Eskridge, Jr., John A. Garver, Prof. of Jurisprudence, Yale Law School, 1997<br />
(William, Yale Law Review, page lexis)<br />
Once mobilized at the state level….their identity secret in exchange for survival, is now known as the &quot;closet&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, Your should reject equal protections essentialist notion of intimacy and sexual identity-only the CP can allow for a discursive space for marginalized person to come to the forefront of criticism.<br />
Iglesias and Valdes, Prof. of Law at the University of Miami Law , 1998<br />
(Elizabeth and Francisco, Chicano-Latino Law Review, Spring page lexis)<br />
The observation about the anti-essentialist….as with all hierarchies of social power, be consciously critical and self-critical.<br />
<br />
<br />
Third, Hetero-normativity replicates discrimination and assures the failure of progressive movement-it should be rejected.<br />
Hutchinsion, Assistant Professor, Southern Methodist University School of Law, 1999<br />
(Darrent Lenard, Buffalo Law Review, winterpage lexis)<br />
Furthermoe, a heteronormative response to white supremacy….anti-racist legal theory and civil rights regime.<br />
<br />
Fourth, Equal protections reliance on heterosexual identity actegories is a form of supremacist identity politics which sanitizes violence again those written out of legal standards like equal protection.<br />
Valdes cites above<br />
The hate crimes, microaggressions and other acts of violation….are multiply diverse across multiples axes of identity and interest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fifth, the hetero-normative standards of the 1ac are a strategy of erasure which must be rejected<br />
Valdes, 1997 cites above<br />
Moreover, the practice of erasure inevitably….similar patterns of social or legal injustice<br />
<br />
<br />
The CP solves theses arguments:<br />
<br />
Due Process is key to struggle against heterosexism<br />
Hart cite above<br />
A substantive due process argument….ways in which gays are similar to heterosexuals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Narrow interpretations make equal protection unachievable for many oppressedgroups- their precedent precludes a multi dimeninsional prtocetions from the law,<br />
