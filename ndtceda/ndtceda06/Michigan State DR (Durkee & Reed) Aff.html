Plan Text – Andrea and I defend the United States Supreme Court overruling the 1974 Milliken v. Bradley decision by specifically stating that the premise to holding “B” that:<br />
“(school) boundary lines may be bridged in circumstances where there has been a constitutional violation calling for inter-district relief”<br />
no longer has precedential value – and that school boundary lines may no longer allow bridging in such circumstances.<br />
(<strong>not in the plantext but they say</strong>) It is not our contention that this text is the literal voice with which the Court speaks – rather this text is our method of best conveying our advocacy within the unique parameters of college debate community.<br />
1ac w/ cites –<br />
1. Overrules coming now – these are on the caselist<br />
2. Milliken Misunderstood<br />
Milliken is inaccurately understood as a decision that limited inter-district relief. James Liebman , Columbia Law Review 1990. “Interdistrict desegregation also lives on…the Detroit School District.”<br />
The only express holding on interdistrict relief states that it was constitutional. Syllabus – reporter of decisions, Milliken v. Bradley 1974. “(b) While boundary lines…deeply rooted tradition.”<br />
Syllabus is best standard—it uses the Reporter of decisions and does not bleed into other parts of the opinion. Legal Information Institute, United States v. Morrison. “NOTE: Where it is feasible…for the convenience of the reader.”<br />
The reporter of decisions is official. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://answers.com/" rel="nofollow">Answers.com</a> ’06. “The Reporter of Decisions…<br />
Contention 3: All Black Academics<br />
Court desegregation trades off with all black academies<br />
Seidman ’92 (Professor of Law, California Law Review – May)<br />
In addition, integration attack group orientation…primacy of white culture and its values.<br />
Milliken creatd inter-district remedies are a one-way street, rarely bringing suburbanites to the city – this shatters ABAs and turns integration good claims<br />
Dyson ’07, “Race Rules Navigting the Color Line” – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mdcbowen.org/p2/rm/ri/dyson.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.mdcbowen.org/p2/rm /ri/dyson.htm__</a><br />
But for blacks, our real dilmma…Desegregation has produced serious and undeniable failures.<br />
Desegregation fails and creates a culture of white supremacy<br />
Leake 1993, “Do We need to desegregate al of our Balck Schools?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://epx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/7/3/370" rel="nofollow">__http://epx.sagepub.com/cgi /reprint/7/3/370__</a><br />
The implication that desegregation would help children…must we desegregate all of our Black schools?<br />
If this were the Native Americans topic, “school integration” wouldn’t seem so progressive – in practice, desegregation orders cause assimilation and genocide – Khan 94, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=abu_kashif" rel="nofollow">__http://works.bepress.com/cgi /viewcontent.cgi?article=1009 &amp;context=abu_kashif__</a><br />
Many in the dominant group viewed desegregation…a sort of painless genocide.<br />
Comparative studies prove ABAs are better<br />
Sowell 06’ <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.realclearpolitic.com/articles/2006/12/supreme_farce.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.realclearpolitic .com/articles/2006/12/supreme _farce.html__</a><br />
What are those “compelling” benefits of “diversity”?...however politically correct it is to proclaim such benefits<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Movements<br />
Setbacks to equality outside of schooling are coming – only a newly sparked movement can prevent this. W. Avon Drake, Western Journal of Black Studies 3/22/03. “In the late 1960s, the move…self-reliance movement is the key.”<br />
A mobilized black radical movement is key to challenge oppression. Palmer ’97. Black Nationalism promotes concept of racial solidarity. 4/17. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://afgen.com/black_nationalism2.html" rel="nofollow">__http://afgen.com/black_national ism2.html__</a> “The time is ripe…Africa and African people.”<br />
Black radical movements would link up with international movements. Robin D.G. Kelley, “Arm the Spirit – Some thoughts on the BRC, the ‘Post-Civil Rights Era,’ and the history of black radicalism.” 6-20-98. “We should also follow…struggles in Africa.”<br />
Black mobilization is key to overall success of global justice movements. Dr. Manning Marable, Winter 2006. “Synthesis/Regeneration.” “The recently successful…collective, transnational struggle.”<br />
That linkage is key to check wars of US imperialism. Leigh Hughes 2-13-02. Model Minority Journal (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.themodelminority.com/journal" rel="nofollow">__www.themodelminority.com /journal__</a>) “Another target of this war…a world without war and racism.”<br />
Nuclear war is inevitable – its try or die for an inclusive black-led movement – Strickland 04 – The Black Scholar, Fall, Vol. 34, Iss. 3, p 2<br />
But now the lust for power…will define the success or failure of ht emovement that needs to be<br />
Venue matters – minority led social movements are stuck in courts because of the symbol of Brown. This deflates movements and hampers success on non-schooling issues – Spann, 1993<br />
The aff is key because court desegregation order uniquely addicted movements to itigation – a et back like the plan gets movements out of the court – McDonnell 97<br />
Schools are the vital internal link to sparking movements – Pedroni ’05, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/tcre/2005/00000107/00000009/art00007" rel="nofollow">http://www.ingentaconnect.com /content/bpl/tcre/2005/00000107 /00000009/art00007</a><br />

Schools are the vital internal link to sparking movements<br />

The aff solves white privilege by sparking inclusive movement centered around white supremacy – Kelley ’97 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://racetraitororg/robinkelley.html" rel="nofollow">__http://racetraitororg/robinkell ey.html__</a><br />
White privelege causes extinction through global conflict and environmental collapse – Bedford and Workman ’02 “Working Through Whiteness: International perspectives – p 39<br />
Dismantling racism is a d-rule – but requires political planning and strategy like the aff – Silliman ’03, htpp:/tre.sagepub.com/cgi /reprint/1/3/303<br />
<br />
Brown and decisions like the plan are currently modeled in Europe – creating unique tensions – Hepple 06<br />
These efforts decrease EU unity – Savage 04’<br />
EU disunity causes WW3 – Kinkel 2002<br />
The plan will be perceived as overturning Brown – Spann ’90 – Michagan Law Review, June<br />

Opposition to how the int’l system has been constructed does not deny the truth-value of our case advantages.
