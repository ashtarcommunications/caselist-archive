lots of comparative evidence. No Rawls cards or defense of predictability.<br />
1. Still a debate. Must prove predictability<br />

1. Cannot get more negative ground. Should try to limit out interpretations. 2. Complexity proves metaphyscis Ward 02 part of the whole. Justify process across the heavens lie somewhere in the middle left out alone. Longings. We become nothing special. thermodynamics link to universality pedestal we place upon themselves<br />

Weber ran a kritik of complex systems basically, with the Supreme Court being their example of a complex system, and said that we can't predict the actions of these systems so we should reject the plan because it appeals to one. They answer add-ons by saying we can't predict the consequences of the system that we solve with and they say that Morrison specifically crushes the adaptability to democracy. Also in the 1nc was the T/presumption violation that VAWA can't be revived because it is dead. They went for this violation and asked the judge to vote on presumption. There was also a no test case portion to their violation, but the meat of the 2nr was this piece of evidence that VAWA is dead and can't be revived.<br />

Cunningham in 99 (Radical Orthodoxy, pg 54-8, Conor)<br />
“This essay defines philosophical metaphysics as….he came close to doing so.”<br />
Standards:<br />
A) Failure to specify makes the affirmative a moving target by enabling them to reinterpret the 1AC advocacy to avoid our K links which kills our ground<br />
B) Specificity is key to solvency—lack of specification or appeal to transcendence means that the aff cant sovle for their impacts beacuase without metaphysics life has no value.<br />
C) Lack of specification reners the 1AC harms and solvency improvable they lack an outside source of coherence or meaning. Vote neg on presumption—they can’t prove that the change they propose is tenable<br />

the first off was a joke argument which they called &quot;the sixth amendment violation&quot; where teams shouldn't have authors since their credibility would be called into question and everyone has a sixth amendment right to confront their accuser. they also argued that we couldn't verify the existence of our authors, so we should be rejected.<br />
<br />
the second off was their K- a religion argument similar to Idaho State's affirmative- the literature base is from a school of philosophy/theology known as &quot;radical orthodoxy&quot; (if you want a lexis term.)their links were off rights- (rights create a legal contract between humans and the state which prevent us from developing a metaphysical contract with god and all other humans through the community of the eucharist) using the state (same link story)and using other humans as tools instead of affirming the sacredness of life. the impact was metaphysical violence and this argument about how we allowed people to experience all things the same, which meant that people would start equating the holocaust with vanilla icecream. this latter card was warrantless. the alternative was to affirm the eucharist as a community. the alternative was perhaps one of the stronger parts of the K.<br />
<br />
we read morrison w/ gender violence advantage. we said that using a male pronoun for God excludes women, that jews and muslims won't join the community of the eucharist because even if christian theology is inclusive other religions still aren't which takes out solvency. we did not have evidence for these claims. we then read cards that their alternative would be coopted by the christian right, would be used destroy stem cell research which is key to solve disease spread. then generic fiat good, state good, rights good.<br />
<br />
we won on the argument that performative contradictions are a voting issue, because their joke violation said that we should give our authors rights, which links to their K.<br />

Jesus said, “Surely I come quickly,” be we seem to have forgotten that. Church is no longer central to the lives of the even most religions Christians, instead is has become a private association. Church has become the State. It must be worshiped and defers to this notion. A new political imagination that challenges the centrality of the state and proposes a new theopolitical imagination that centers on the Eucharist as a source of salvation.<br />
William Cavanaugh 2003 (Theopolitical Imagination p 1-8<br />
“Politics is a practice of the imagination. Sometimes politics is the art of the possible” … “and the disruptive presence of Christ the King to the politics of the world”<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court Links<br />
Marie Failinger 2006 (“Against Idols: The court as a symbol-making or rhetorical institutions.)<br />
“In sluch circumstances – where public reassurance in public eladers who act as symbol-makers” … “feel compelled to symbolize, however reluctantly.”<br />
<br />
Attempting to create this political order causes violence because you deny metaphysics<br />
Blond 1998 (Post-Secular Philosophy: Between Philosophy and Theology pg 1-3)<br />
“We live in a time of failed conditions. Everywher people who have no faith<br />
<br />
And the inevitable result of displacement of salvation, or sotiology, from the Church is the rise of a state soteriology that mimics but cannot recreate a true social process. This results in a logic of extermination by which all communiies and localities that don’t fit within the norms of a globalized democractic society are cluster bombed in oblivion. The final logic of extinction<br />
William Cavanaugh, “The City: Beyond Secular Parodies” Racial Orthodoxy 192-4<br />
Why has the state been hailed to save us? Its habitual discipline for binding use one to another.<br />
<br />
We reject the affirmative’s USE of SC. This is an act of political imagination that seeks to affirm a Eucharistic community<br />
William Cavanaugh, The world is a wafer: the geography of the eurcharist as resistance to globalization” modern theology<br />
15:2 april 1999<br />
Does the eucharist offer a counter narrative………..a story enacted in the Eucharist.<br />
<br />
Embracing the eucharist as the organizing principle for our political imagination overcomves artifical national bounds leads capitalism globalism that’s bad<br />

P/T: Justices Roberts, Alito, Breyer, Souter, Stevens, Ginsburg, Scalia, Thomas, and Kennedy should overrule Ex Parte Quirin by holding that trials of enemy combatants in military tribunals violate the Geneva Convention and hold that all enemy combatants will be guaranteed a trial through a courts martial in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice.<br />

The Affirmative must justify their discursive framing in this round before their specific strategy can be evaluated.

Using the name “Supreme Court” sets the court up as the final word which trumps all other views.

Your Harms are wrong – they are based on a predictive principal that cannot be justified within the complex system. Chaotic systems operate on non linearity meaning that your plan text could create drastic changes not the small proportional changes that you think<br />
Geu 1994 – “The Tao of jurisprudence: chaos, brain science, synchronicity and the law” 61 tenn L. rev. 933<br />
<br />
Law is not deterministic – viewing predictability as an absolute in legal principals only results in nihilism<br />
Reynolds 1991 – “Chaos and the court” Columbia Law Review, Jan 91 Colum Rev. 110<br />
<br />
Critical approaches to the law end in reductionism – the cracks and the fissures that your K tries to open is an attempt to simply the system to a manageable part and in so doing ignores the fact that the contradictions that they unearth are inescapable function of the dynamic system<br />
Ruhl 1996 – “complexity theory as a paradigm for the dynamic law and society system: a wake up call for the legal reductionism and the modern administrative state. 45 Duke L.J. 849<br />
<br />
The AFF attempts to predict system behavior as affected by plan is rooted in legal reductionism which destroys any chance to make a predictive model of the law – this failure promotes the growth of the administrative state<br />
Ruhl 1996 – “complexity theory as a paradigm for the dynamic law and society system: a wake up call for the legal reductionism and the modern administrative state. 45 Duke L.J. 849<br />
<br />
<br />
Reductionism is dominant in all current legal theories and it leaves large chunks of the law-society system incomprehensible. This incomprehensibility is where you supposedly garner your link but your arguments will always collapse under its own, rules based weight. Without understanding the chaotic unpredictable nature of the system there impacts become inevitable<br />
Ruhl 1996 – “complexity theory as a paradigm for the dynamic law and society system: a wake up call for the legal reductionism and the modern administrative state. 45 Duke L.J. 849<br />
<br />
Complexity is the alternative formalism, transitioning to complexity theory is key to correcting the top-down orientation of current legal theory<br />
Webb 2005 – “law, ethics, and complexity: complexity theory and the normative reconstruction of law” 52 Clev. L. Rev. 227<br />
<br />
Complexity forces us to recognize a metaphysical responsibility to the other, it eliminates out ability to externalize that responsibility to the rules based law. Complexity is the only way to achieve an ethical responsibility<br />
