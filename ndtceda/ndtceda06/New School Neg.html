New School Neg (round 2 vs. SFSU)<br />
<br />
We specifically endorse the use of fiction as a means of traversing the artificial distance between the spectators and suffering. Reality is its own sort of fiction. The difference though, is that fiction explicitly acknowledges its own inadequacycies of representation. Fiction does not allow the audience to obsecenely and secretly enjoy the suffering of others.<br />
<br />
Slavoj Zizek, The Fright of Real Tears, p. 71-77<br />
“The Ultimate gap that gives rise to sulture is ontological . . . fantasies that form the unavowed kernel of our lives.<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s politics of compassion cannot be removed from the culture in which it is both presented and received, a culture obsessed with its own sense of superiority that is fiendishly in love with control. Witnessiing on behalf of a suffering other requires, creates and sustains a political economy of traumatic imagines in which suffering is commodified and the other is distorted into a helpless, inferior, passive object.<br />
<br />
Kleinman and Kleinman, ’96 (Arthur and Joan, “The Appeal of Art; the Dismay of Images: Cultural Appropriations of Suffering in our Time” Daedalus, Winter ’96, Proquest<br />
<br />
“This may seem too thoroughgoing a critique. . . often are part of the problem; they become iatrogenic.”<br />
<br />
Questions of representations come first in international policy-making – key to ethics, which is the foundation of relations with alterity<br />

Round 3 – same K as round 2, but with:<br />
<br />
Agamben’s notion of biopower and the camp creates powerlessness<br />
Michael Hardt &amp; Thomas Dumm “Sovereignty, Multitudes, Absolute Democracy: A Discussion between Michael Hardt and Thomas Dumm About Hardt and Negri’s Empire” Theory &amp; Event, 4:3; Project Muse<br />
“But still none of that . . . . struggles over forms of life”<br />
<br />
Agamben’s notion of homo sacer becomes and excuse for passivity and a mask for daily violence in all it’s forms<br />
<br />
Hardt &amp; Dumm (above)<br />
“In that regard, my sense is that you . . . sovereignty would also disappear”<br />
<br />
<br />
Agamben’s Homo Sacer masks imperial sovereignty, a less visceral but more insidious form of violence<br />
Hardt &amp; Dumm (above)<br />
“The most significant difference between our projects . . . .subtle and not so subtle horrors.”<br />
<br />
Agamben’s application of homo sacer as a material occurrence is problematic – his theory is only applicable in a historical context<br />
Panagia ’99 (Davide, “The Sacredness of Life and Death: Giorgio Agamben’s Homo Sacer and the Tasks of Political Thinking, Johns Hopkins University Press, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v003/3.1r_pangia.html" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v003/3.1r_pangia.html</a><br />
“The political point here is, I think . . . sovereignty and the state of indistinction”
