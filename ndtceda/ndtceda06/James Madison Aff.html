Re-segregation of public schools is on the rise and in some areas schools are more racially segregated than before Brown V. Board of Education.<br />
<br />

<br />
Observation 1:<br />
- Racism is entrenched- the normal operation of social institutions in the maintenance and protection of white power and privilege. (Feagin 2006, Joe, r Prof. Of liberal arts at texas a &amp; M, systemic racism: a theory of oppression.)<br />
- In particular, education curriculum is a major vehicle in the status quo to oppress African – American students. (Marks, doctorate-to-be of philosophy, Wayne state u. 2005. Jay B “The effects of African centered education on African American students. Dissertation submitted to wayne state U.)<br />
<br />
Advantage 1: School Funding inequalities.<br />
- Institutionalized racism in education is perpetuated through funding practices. (Feagin 2006, from above.)<br />
- Such institutionalized racism is reified when a lower quality of education for poorer children is accepted by the majority of US citizens. (Kozol 91, accomplished education scholar, Jonathan “savage inequalities” p. 116. Also, #9 on Bernard Goldberg’s list of 100 people who are screwing up America .)<br />
- The public school systems force inequalities which frequently condemns children to unequa lives. (Kozol 91 from above.)<br />
- Unequal funding of education dooms students to a life of poverty and threatens the national economy. (Goldba 98, Amy, High school teacher, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iusb.edu/%7Ejournal/1998/Paper5.html#AmyGolba" rel="nofollow">http://www.iusb.edu/~journal/1998/Paper5.html#AmyGolba</a>)<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Cultural Imperialism<br />
- The current educational system is inherently oppressive. (Wayne State U. “The effect of African-centered education on African American students “dissertation submitted to waynest.uiv)<br />
- Through the plan, the Supreme Court can send a signal to other government officials and the public what values are important. (Bhagwat 1998, Ashutosh, Associate Professor of law, University of California, Hasitngs College of law, Connecticut Law Review, Spring 1998, 30 Conn L Rev 961, Article: hard cases and the (D)evolution of constitutional doctrinine.)<br />
- Black Community leaders will perceive the signal and push in favor of segregated , equally funded schools, (Twohey writer for the journal sentinel Sept. 19, 1999. Megan “Desegregation is Dead” National Journal)<br />
- African American centered pedagogy is vital in order to end the perpetuation of an educational model that oppresses minority groups and hegemonic attitudes. (Marks 2005 from above.)<br />
- Afrocentricity is an alternative to the existing education in America in order to center Blacks around their own cultural life, not a black version of Eurocentricity. (Marks 2005 from above.)<br />
- We cannot be complicit in racism- to be ethical, we must reject it. (Barndt 1991, Joseph Dismantling Racism: The continuing challenge to white America. P 155-156)<br />
<br />
Plan: The United State Supreme Court will overrule the precedent in Milliken v. Bradley, 418 US. 717 (1974) on the grounds that separate but equal schools are acceptable in the instance that equivalent funding per public school within state jurisdiction is the benchmark for assessing equality.<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Solvency<br />
-The supreme court is positioned to lead resegregation efforts in name of promoting diversity. (Twohey 1999, from above)<br />
- Only the supreme court decision can ensure equal treatment under the law. (Staudt, 2003, Nancy, professor of law, Washington University, Emory Law Journal Spring 2003. 52 Emory L.J. 771, Article: taxpayers in courtL a systematic systematic study of a (Misunderstood) standing doctrine)<br />
- The only way to resist racial domination is to embrace a separatist strategy. (Spann 1993, Girardeau, Race against the court: the supreme court and minorities in contemporary America, p. 145)<br />
- Even if forces other than the quality of the schools affect a child’s performance, it is still the government’s responsibility to offer equality in schools. It is one of the factors that can be changed. (Kozol, 91 from above.)<br />

<br />
Observation 1:<br />
- Racism is entrenched- the normal operation of social institutions in the maintenance and protection of white power and privilege. (Feagin 2006, Joe, r Prof. Of liberal arts at texas a &amp; M, systemic racism: a theory of oppression.)<br />
- In particular, education curriculum is a major vehicle in the status quo to oppress African – American students. (Marks, doctorate-to-be of philosophy, Wayne state u. 2005. Jay B “The effects of African centered education on African American students. Dissertation submitted to wayne state U.)<br />
<br />
Advantage 1: School Funding inequalities.<br />
- Institutionalized racism in education is perpetuated through funding practices. (Feagin 2006, from above.)<br />
- Such institutionalized racism is reified when a lower quality of education for poorer children is accepted by the majority of US citizens. (Kozol 91, accomplished education scholar, Jonathan “savage inequalities” p. 116. Also, #9 on Bernard Goldberg’s list of 100 people who are screwing up America .)<br />
- The public school systems force inequalities which frequently condemns children to unequa lives. (Kozol 91 from above.)<br />
- Unequal funding of education dooms students to a life of poverty and threatens the national economy. (Goldba 98, Amy, High school teacher, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iusb.edu/%7Ejournal/1998/Paper5.html#AmyGolba" rel="nofollow">http://www.iusb.edu/~journal/1998/Paper5.html#AmyGolba</a>)<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Cultural Imperialism<br />
- The current educational system is inherently oppressive. (Wayne State U. “The effect of African-centered education on African American students “dissertation submitted to waynest.uiv)<br />
- Through the plan, the Supreme Court can send a signal to other government officials and the public what values are important. (Bhagwat 1998, Ashutosh, Associate Professor of law, University of California, Hasitngs College of law, Connecticut Law Review, Spring 1998, 30 Conn L Rev 961, Article: hard cases and the (D)evolution of constitutional doctrinine.)<br />
- Black Community leaders will perceive the signal and push in favor of segregated , equally funded schools, (Twohey writer for the journal sentinel Sept. 19, 1999. Megan “Desegregation is Dead” National Journal)<br />
- African American centered pedagogy is vital in order to end the perpetuation of an educational model that oppresses minority groups and hegemonic attitudes. (Marks 2005 from above.)<br />
- Afrocentricity is an alternative to the existing education in America in order to center Blacks around their own cultural life, not a black version of Eurocentricity. (Marks 2005 from above.)<br />
- We cannot be complicit in racism- to be ethical, we must reject it. (Barndt 1991, Joseph Dismantling Racism: The continuing challenge to white America. P 155-156)<br />
<br />
Plan: The United State Supreme Court will overrule the precedent in Milliken v. Bradley, 418 US. 717 (1974) on the grounds that separate but equal schools are acceptable in the instance that equivalent funding per public school within state jurisdiction is the benchmark for assessing equality.<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Solvency<br />
-The supreme court is positioned to lead resegregation efforts in name of promoting diversity. (Twohey 1999, from above)<br />
- Only the supreme court decision can ensure equal treatment under the law. (Staudt, 2003, Nancy, professor of law, Washington University, Emory Law Journal Spring 2003. 52 Emory L.J. 771, Article: taxpayers in courtL a systematic systematic study of a (Misunderstood) standing doctrine)<br />
- The only way to resist racial domination is to embrace a separatist strategy. (Spann 1993, Girardeau, Race against the court: the supreme court and minorities in contemporary America, p. 145)<br />
- Even if forces other than the quality of the schools affect a child’s performance, it is still the government’s responsibility to offer equality in schools. It is one of the factors that can be changed. (Kozol, 91 from above.)<br />

<br />
Observation One: The History of Tribunals in the U.S. begins with the Quirin decision of 1942 which is the basis for present day military tribunals. The decision created distinctions between military tribunals for citizens such as military personnel and non-citizens such as “enemy combatants”. The decision also set the precedent for allowing tribunals that are secret and prevented prisoners from seeing or hearing secret evidence against them.<br />
<br />
Charles Lane, Liberty and The Pursuit Of Terrorists, The Washington Post, 25 November 2001<br />
Some have argued that the President’s power to convene tribunals was overturned as a result of the recent Supreme Court case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. However, this argument is wrong. Hamdan specifically recognizes that the President has the power to convene tribunals Stevens notes in his plurality decision:<br />
(Supreme Court Justice Stevens, in his plurality opinion in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, June 29, 2006)<br />
Finally, Bush is consolidating his power now. Compromise between Bush and GOP dissidents will allows for tribunals and detention without habeas corpus which means that Quirin is still law of the land.<br />
New York Times, September 21, 2006, lexis.<br />
Therefore, we offer the following plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942).<br />
The Supreme Court must overrule Quirin for tribunals to be illegal.<br />
Jonathan Turley, Jewish World Review October 30, 2002, “'Quirin' revisited: The dark history of a military tribunal” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/jonathan/turley103002.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishworldreview.com/jonathan/turley103002.asp</a><br />
The court has a unique responsibility to review the acts of the executive and provide the necessary checks to unconstitutional action.<br />
Jay Alan Bauer, Detainees Under Review: Striking the Right Constitutional Balance Between the Executive's War Powers and Judicial Review, Alabama Law Review Summer, 2006<br />
Observation Two: The advantages.<br />
Rights:<br />
A. Military tribunals destroy fundamental rights. Allowing this type of injustice will snowball destroying all rights and the country itself.<br />
Katyal (Professor of Law, Georgetown) &amp; Tribe (Professor of Law, Yale) 2002<br />
Neal &amp; Laurence, Waging War, Deciding Guilt, Yale Law Journal, April, lexis - 111 Yale L.J. 1259<br />
<br />
B. The precedent established by Bush and legitimated by Quirin makes all future president’s capable of threatening all rights.<br />
Katyal &amp; Tribe again…<br />
C. Rights are critical to human dignity and survival<br />
