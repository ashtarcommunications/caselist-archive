GRIEVABLE LIFE<br />
<br />
We live in an era filled with the greatest amount of violence in history. We are constantly confronted with loss and vulnerability. But, who can we grieve for? What constitutes a grievable life? These questions appeal to something beyond the minutiae of technical policy-making, but rather speak to the very condition of life itself. At every moment of everyday, we are vulnerable, we are exposed to the other. This vulnerability threatens us to fall apart. This is a universal vulnerability, and its causes everyone of us to come undone by the touch, the feel and the memory of others. But it it through this touch that we can experience empathy as a common basis to build new communities.<br />
<br />
Butler, 2004, “Precarious Life: The powers of Mourning and Violence”, p19-25<br />
“I propose to consider…….them as well.”<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s scenes of war and violence induce panic and fear, because they remind us of the omnipresent threat of bodily harm, the specter of exposed flesh, and the mortality of our own skin. However, the first step of grief is to acknowledge this very vulnerability and to make ourselves vulnerable to others.<br />
<br />
Butler, 4, p. 26-31<br />
<br />
“But is there……its possibility”<br />
<br />
This Drive to rationality suppress violence through order and reason has brought us to the edge of extinction through militaristic, ecological and political means<br />
<br />
Dillon and Campbell in 92, (Michael, Lancaster and David, Newcastle, The Political Subject of Violence, p. 163-164”<br />

Alt text: Our K of the ethics of control is about advocating an ethics of universal vulnerability: By insisting on our universal and constant exposure to death and violence, we can re-configure the subject by foregrounding our commonality with others and by insisting that we can never prioritize the protection of the vulnerability of others, we can end the cycle of violence.<br />

Inclusive Zoning CP<br />

Ground SPEC<br />
<br />
Justice SPEC – specifies who your judges are<br />
- decreases education<br />
- avoids solvency debates<br />
- decreases CP ground<br />
- decreases DA links<br />
- makes the aff conditional because they are not resolved<br />

round 1 vs Clarion AD (overrule Stare Decisis in Casey)<br />
Judge-Gordie Miller- University of Rochester<br />
<br />
Offcase #1- ASPEC<br />
A) plan does not specify the decision nor which justice votes which way<br />
<br />
1) hurts decision making<br />
2) avoids important solvency question<br />
3) kills cp ground<br />
4) kills da ground<br />
5) makes aff conditional, violates resolved in resolution, american heritage dictionary, they are thus not topical<br />
B) Aspec is voter for fairness and education<br />
<br />
offcase #2- Overrule Marbury vs. Madison CP<br />
<br />
text- The SCOTUS will choose a test case on writ of cert and overturn Marbury v. Madison and Martin v Hunters lessee stipping the court of its power to review acts og Congress<br />
<br />
Theory<br />
1. Test case fiat is reciprocal and has been invoked by the aff<br />
2 we advocate the counterplan unconditionaliy but reserve right to go for theory or topicality<br />
<br />
Competitiveness<br />
3. The CP is competitive because the Court cannnot strip both itself of the ability to hear the affirmative and hear the affirmative simultaneously. The only perm is a time frame perm, which is illegitamate because the affirmative could just delay the cp indefinately in order to achieve its ends. and its counterproductive b/c they’d still link to the disad/turn<br />

State Courts Counterplan<br />
<br />
1. State constitutions can be used to provide uniform rights protections, similarities in state constitutions allow for universal action to guarantee rights beyond federal protections<br />
GARDNER, JAMES A., Professor of Law, State University of New York, University at Buffalo Law School., Georgetown Law Journal June, 2003 91 Geo. L.J. 1003<br />
“One of the most prominent… federal constitution.”<br />
<br />
2. State Supreme Courts are superior- they can interpret law to provide protection where national law doesn't, and state Supreme Court rulings have a more direct impact on the populace<br />
GARDNER, JAMES A., Professor of Law, State University of New York, University at Buffalo Law School., Georgetown Law Journal June, 2003 91 Geo. L.J. 1003<br />
“Here… punishment at all.”<br />
<br />
3. State Supreme Court action is key to judicial federalism-state courts have the duty to independently interpret and provide rights protections beyond that of its federal counterpart<br />
Fitzpatrick, Robert K., JD, NEITHER ICARUS NOR OSTRICH: STATE CONSTITUTIONS AS AN INDEPENDENT SOURCE OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS New York University Law Review, November, 2004 79 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1833<br />
“Most arguments in favor… abdicate that duty.”<br />
<br />
NB<br />
<br />
1. Judicial Federalism driven by State Constitutional independence provides a forum for federal and state dialogue and increases rights protections<br />
Friedman, Lawrence, Visiting Researcher, Harvard Law School, “The Constitutional Value of Dialogue and the New Judicial Federalism,” HASTINGS CONSTITUTIONAL LAW QUARTERLY v. 27, Fall 2000,<br />
“The expectation of dialogue… constitutional democracy.”<br />
<br />
2. Judicial Federalism requires an independent reading of constitutions by State Supreme Courts<br />
Saphire, Richard B., Professor of constitutional law at the University of Dayton in Ohio, Cleveland State Law Review, 2004, 51 Clev. St. L. Rev. 437<br />
“It is worth noting… enforce that understanding.”<br />

C. INTERNAL LINK – SUCCESS IN COURT ATTRACTS MOVEMENTS, MISDIRECTING ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM SOURCES OF ACUTAL CHANGE<br />
Rosenberg, ’91 (Gerald, The Hollow Hope, University of Chicago Press, p 341)<br />

D. IMPACT - USE OF THE COURTS CAUSES BACKLASH, TURNING CASE<br />

<br />
CLS<br />
<br />
The 1AC frames the use of the court as the bulwark against oppression, the guarantor of rights and privileges entitled to and individual or class of people. This desire to deploy the law as arbiter of claims covers over the lack of foundation inherent in law. Our fear of disorder creates the desire to establish order by any means possible. The 1AC’s claims to garner advantages are nothing but a post-hoc rationalization of the desire for order. It’s like pretending to have a chicken because you need the eggs.<br />
Harrison and Mashburn – 1989 (Jeff and Amy, Prof. of Law @ U. of Florida and Practicing Lawyer, “ESSAY: JEAN-LUC GODARD AND CRITICAL LEGAL STUDIES (BECAUSE WE NEED THE EGGS”, Michigan Law Review, 87)<br />
“The central problem… most of us need the eggs.”<br />
<br />
Some desires seem harmless enough, like the desire to work out in the morning or eat your breakfast. However, denying the lack of foundation at the heart of law makes it seem natural and inevitable, even though the law is wholly indeterminate, whimsical, and unstable. Legitimating the law in this fashion solidifies existing power relations, making them seem invulnerable to change and guaranteeing the perpetuation of inequity.<br />
