In the US Supreme Court’s decision in Milliken v Bradley it was held that rulings which proposed a multi-district solution to school segregation were based on “erroneous standards” which were “unsupported by evidence” asserting that outlining districts certainly could not be responsible for discrimination that existed, that still exists, within the Detroit Public School system. But what is it that defines these districts? Is the boundary between Detroit Public Schools and the Grosse Pointe or Birmingham School systems really just a line in the sand, or is it a boundary that has been established over the concepts of agency? The decision in Milliken attempts to wash away the central questions of participation, discrimination and access to life itself.<br />
Driving into Detroit from any direction is an experience, it’s almost surreal as you notice a slow transition from wealth to despair. Burned out buildings, rows of blight exponentially increase as you make your journey to the core of the city. This journey, this historical path towards poverty and discrimination shapes our very existence in Detroit. The Supreme Court’s decision in Milliken v. Bradley ignores the power of education, culture and societal history in shaping our understandings of ourselves and of Others. But the discourse of the Supreme Court, the blight that exists around our home does not have to be the story of Detroit. A city that experiences discrimination does not have to be separated from the larger questions of ontological boundaries which establish unequal access and distribution of education. Rejecting the separation of Detroit from the world around it allows us to inhabit cracks and fissures in the dominant discourse of Detroit, of our very agency.<br />
<br />

<br />
Despite their power to frame the world, … more abstract insights into the question of Being?<br />
Detroit is portrayed as decaying, destroyed, dilapidated and depressing, but there are signs of life within this cityscape. Everyday mobile subjectivities have created pockets of resistance, from street art to performance, even act as simple as seeing beauty in a landscape that has been separated and forgotten by forces larger then itself. Vote affirmative to engage in a politics of everyday life. The 1AC has created a space for you to inhabit and resist the separation and linearity of the supreme courts decision in Milliken v. Bradley – you should engage in this act of resistance because our politics – our space for activism – is a temporal embrace of the concept of politics. Affirm agency, affirm Detroit even if only for this moment even if only in the signing of the ballot.<br />
<br />
Bleiker, School of Political Science, University of Queensland, Brisbane, 2003<br />
(Roland, Contemporary Political Theory page proquest GJM)<br />
<br />
More layers of abstraction must be removed … public transcripts is torn apart (Scott, 1990, 19-20, 183-227).<br />
<br />
How do we inhabit the space left by the dominant discourse? Should we call on the United States Supreme Court to overrule its decision in Milliken v. Bradley? We ultimately say no, the call to the state to engage in revolution for our agency is a project which always fails. Constant simulation is destructive to the cornerstones of our existence. We instead view the 1AC, this very moment, as a political act which refuses the state, and instead inhabits a discursive space which refuses to be co-opted our return to the Real in the form of violent martyrdom<br />

<br />
I accept this as a fair criticism. I'd make two rejoinders nevertheless; … TAZ begins with a simple act of realization.<br />
<br />
Our impact is autonomy, agency and the beauty of life – vote affirmative to live, if only for a moment in a space ruled by freedom – the 1AC is true political action and it is through an affirmation of this space that we find meaning in life<br />

In the next available test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule the United States Supreme Court’s decision in U.S. v. Morrison by ruling that the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution provides a sufficient grant of authority to Congress to authorize the Federal Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act. We can clarify.<br />

Plan:<br />
In the next available test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule the United States Supreme Court’s decision in U.S. v. Morrison by ruling that the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution provide a sufficient grant of authority to Congress to authorize the Federal Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act. We can clarify.<br />
<br />
Advantage One is Criminal Categories:<br />
In Morrison the Court’s use of section 13981 established a categorization of the Federal Civil Rights Remedy as a criminal concern – this ideology was modeled through the media to the public<br />
Russell, JD from Yale Law School, 2003<br />
(Sarah, Michigan Journal of Gender and Law, page lexis gjm)<br />
Why didn't the name &quot;civil rights remedy&quot; stick? … conceptualize the remedy as a discrimination law.<br />
<br />
This media perception of the decision outweighs the decision itself – communication through the media shifts public opinion on gendered violence<br />
Russell, JD from Yale Law School, 2003<br />
(Sarah, Michigan Journal of Gender and Law, page lexis gjm)<br />
Proponents of the remedy hoped to change …editorials and commentary pieces.<br />
<br />
The Criminal framing by the Court was a very specific rhetorical strategy which should be rejected because it assures transformation to a discrimination model remains impossible<br />
Weissman, Associate Professor of Law UNC- Chapel Hill School of Law, 2001<br />
(Deborah, Boston College Law Review, September page lexis gjm)<br />
Furthermore, there was virtual silence …prohibited the transformation of these issues to a national civil rights concern. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://proxy.lib.wayne.edu:2112/universe/document?_m=39309c97f889a41878ad87f2e4d93d61&amp;_docnum=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVtb-zSkVA&amp;_md5=d92ab9a7e4764ff45ecd4718e94a2547#n135" rel="nofollow">135</a><br />
<br />
The categorization of the Civil Rights Remedy as criminal supports the current ideology of the public private dichotomy which constantly regulates violence against women to a separate sphere outside of public concern<br />
Russell, JD from Yale Law School, 2003<br />
(Sarah, Michigan Journal of Gender and Law, page lexis gjm)<br />
The characterization of the remedy … other federal civil rights statutes, and proper for regulation under the Commerce Clause.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Shifting this categorization is essential to understanding gendered violence and local / national turning back the process of trivialization of violence against women<br />
Russell, JD from Yale Law School, 2003<br />
(Sarah, Michigan Journal of Gender and Law, page lexis gjm)<br />
Drafters of the Violence Against Women Act …faced in state legal systems.<br />
<br />
Rejecting this trivialization is essential to the broader struggle against gendered violence – concerns for political consequences assure the continued erasure of violence<br />
Enloe, Professor of Women’s Studies at Clark University, 2004<br />
(Cynthia, The Curious Feminist, page 73-74 gjm)<br />
One of the most potent mechanisms for political silencing is dichotomizing &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private.&quot; … who would think to add &quot;lesbian&quot;.<br />
<br />
Finally, Violence against women serves as the foundation for greater campaigns of aggression, the systemic slaughter of women’s material and psychic existence provides the context for the violence of the international system.<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, U of Michigan Law School, 2006<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard International Law Journal, winter page lexis, gjm)<br />
Acts of violence against women are mass atrocities, … while everyday life never ends.<br />
<br />
Advantage Two is the Civil Rights Remedy:<br />
<br />
The Civil Rights Remedy is essential to shift the current debate about violence against women away from piecemeal solutions ands towards systemic political solutions – this remedy not only shifts how individuals engage society but also transforms the legal culture by transforming our cultural frames of reference<br />
Goldfarb, Associate Professor, Rutgers University School of Law, 2003<br />
(Sally, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, page lexis gjm)<br />
The enactment of a federal statute …task of responding to such violence. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://proxy.lib.wayne.edu:2112/universe/document?_m=99591aabca6c5c50649357c1d8c6c7ef&amp;_docnum=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVtb-zSkVA&amp;_md5=af515c7a64d71cc181a9e138198334b8#n27" rel="nofollow">27</a><br />
<br />
We must move beyond criticism of the law and instead focus on the material consequences of legal actions – the Morrison decision should be overruled because its rejection of the Civil Rights Remedy was a major setback for the struggle against violence<br />
Weissman, Associate Professor of Law UNC- Chapel Hill School of Law, 2001<br />
(Deborah, Boston College Law Review, September page lexis gjm)<br />
[*1086] The Morrison decision … transform the legal culture as it relates to violence against women.<br />
<br />
Lack of court action legitimizes violence – going to the law may not be perfect but it improves the material conditions for women who use the system<br />
Weissman, Associate Professor of Law UNC- Chapel Hill School of Law, 2001<br />
(Deborah, Boston College Law Review, September page lexis gjm)<br />
The unwillingness of the courts … attendant change in public values and concerns.<br />
<br />
Ignorance of material suffering provides no mechanism to counter the hegemony of the right –in the face of violence against women we must provide a choice for persons to access remedies for the suffering they have experienced<br />
West, Professor of Law Georgetown University Law Center, 2006<br />

<br />
In the context of the War on Terrorism, the distinction between legal and illegal combatants is tactically deployed as part of a larger strategy of derealization – deeming a combatant illegal not only suspends the law for that individual – but it establishes a framework to make the lives of entire populations unlivable<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 67-68, gjm)<br />
<br />
These acts of state ...one’s situation is highly, if not fatally, politicized.<br />
<br />
In order to answer the question: “should the supreme court overrule ex parte quirin?” we must interrogate powers larger aim in the deployment of the legal/illegal distinction<br />
<br />
It would be a mistake to center this discussion anywhere but on the populations who are deemed unlivable by the larger strategies of the war on terror – to start from ourselves would simply replicate the ignorance of violence against the other that justifies their exclusion from our understanding of the world around us. Why is it that images like this small girl who is bleeding and screaming after US soldiers shot and killed her parents are excluded from coverage of the war? Why is it that this murder was blamed on poor aim, and pushed into non-existence? It is our separation from these images and stories that allows us to deny our responsibility for the violence that is committed in the name of the War on Terror<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 5-7, gjm)<br />
<br />
Our own acts of violence do not receive graphic coverage ...future shape and possibility of global cooperation.<br />
<br />
The lives we have destroyed in the war on terror have become unreal, unlivable and therefore ungrievable lives, how else could one explain the disconnect present in this image where an American soldier is playing with parts of a human body, mutilated and incomplete, as if they were a toy? Or this image, where a man was shot in the head which was for some reason then flattened? We can guess that what is left of the persons in this picture will not receive an obituary – the Soldiers dragging the remnants of bodies in seclusion seems to tell us that their remains will most likely not be identified. The violence committed against these people is a natural consequence of our current ideology – by making these populations unreal we have necessitated their extermination – it is through the omission of images and perspectives that the discourse of the war on terror plays its violent games – the 1AC refuses to relegate these lives to the sphere of the unlivable – we instead reject the foreclosure of these lives by opening the possibility of mourning those who are considered ungrievable.<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 33-35, gjm)<br />
<br />
If violence is done against those who are unreal, ... for the most part unmarkable and ungrievable.<br />
<br />
The images we show should make you uncomfortable, in fact they should inspire a sense of remorse, outrage and hopefully grief. In the same way images like this one, of children burning and dying from Napalm attacks produced ethical outrage and protest against the<br />
Vietnam War, images of the people killed by US aggression can produce an ethic which allows us to adequately recognize the violence we commit against the other. Showing images like this man, shot in the head while sitting in his car at a US checkpoint, disrupts the hegemonic field of representation and the entire sense of public identity that was founded on it.<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 150-151, gjm)<br />
<br />
In the Vietnam War, it was the pictures ... a sensate democracy they occasionally perform.<br />
<br />
therefore we advocate an obituary for the United States Supreme Courts decision in Ex Parte Quirin.<br />
<br />
OR &quot;we evacuate the United States Supreme Court's ability to define greivable life as established in Ex Parte Quirin&quot;<br />
<br />
This act is an affirmation of those who have been negated by the larger application of the legal / illegal distinction that this decision upholds. This affirmation is essential to opening a space for us to grieve the persons who have been lost in strategies of violence and aggression advanced in the name of the War on Terrorism. This is a specific strategy of criticism which should not be excluded – attempts to restrain our affirmative by placing arbitrary limits on the game of debate is an extension of a conservative strategy which deems what is and is not sayable in order to control the public sphere of debate. Once it has been decided that our 1AC is treasonous, and can’t be seen or heard the atrocities we’ve outlined also become invisible. You should reject the strategy of quelling dissent because it is too easily incorporated into larger strategies of derealization of life.<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page xix-xvi, gjm)<br />
<br />
Dissent and debate depend upon the inclusion ... publicly about the effects of war.<br />
<br />
Providing a obituary for Ex Parte Quirin establishes a politics of grief which refuses to foreclose our vulnerability to violence this opens a space for an identification with suffering -- voting affirmative is essential to creating a relationship with the other that is not based on violence or the urge to exterminate<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 30-32, gjm)<br />
<br />
Is there something to be gained from grieving ... will not even qualify as “grievable.”<br />
