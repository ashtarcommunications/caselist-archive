<strong>1AC (NEW AFF)</strong><br />
<strong>*NOTE: All of these cards are written in the context of Star Wars. They all talk about Jedis and Luke Skywalker and such.<br />
Abortion is an action with no clear cut moral solution. Mediation creates insight into this. “Mindful breathing” allow for compassion. This creates a unique compassionate system.<br />
Ken Jones ’03 (The New Social Face of Buddhism; a Call to action. 2003. P 136-137)<br />
“It may be helpful to clonclude” … “goes with our deepest love.”<br />
We shouldn’t act but wait. Abotion debate touches many lives on both sides. It will affect thousands/millions. It is important we don’t rush in to anything.<br />
Matthew Bortholin ’05 (The Dharma of Star Wars, p. 12-13)<br />
The issue of abortion and the casey decision in particular is ripe for mindfully breathing.<br />
(Then there was a long pause- about 10 seconds where the 1AC mindfully breathed)<br />
Mindful breathing can remedy this problem and allow us to create true compassion.<br />
Same as above (Jones) p 7-9<br />
“And so we come to” … “all living things.”<br />
Demonization of pro-choice/pro-life people causes demonization that makes us unable to be compassionate<br />
Same as above (Bortholin) p. 47-48<br />
“When Luke Confronts” … “the reality of emptiness”<br />
Physical suffering inevitable- both sides of the movement are perpetuators of death and suffering<br />
Elizabeth Mensch and Alan Freeman, 1991 (“The Politics of Virtue: Animals, Theology and Abortion, UGA Law Review, Spring)<br />
“Which of us can claim to” … “morally responsible way.”<br />
Vote aff to resist compulsion to act. Mindful breathing accepts and transcends suffering by creating a new happiness which accepts suffering and moves beyond it. Acting just recreates bad shit<br />
Same as above (Bortholin) p. 20-23<br />
“Recognizing that suffering is” … “to carefully examine it.”</strong><br />
2AC<br />
<u><strong>No link- accept beauty of the moment<br />
We say accept society how it is and get the beauty of the moment<br />
Suffering inevitable<br />
Compassion begets more compassion = we solve the violence<br />
No reason we can’t permute the alternative and the plan.<br />
Nothing in the 1AC to reject or alter the society<br />
They recreate the mindset they critique because they force urgency<br />
They try to manipulate society around them and say that we can all be individuals- this recreates our suffering<br />
Bortholin (Same as above in the 1AC)<br />
“We create suffering by playing the” … “do not buy into these ideas.”<br />
The idea of rejection creates a craving/desire to change the world and limit ideologies which turns their own argument<br />
Bortholin (same as above)<br />
“It is important that we accept” … “freedom we enjoy”<br />
Card above = net benefit to permutation<br />
We can accept their arg, wrap it up and notice its existence and prevent the suffering they claim<br />
They use a fear of violence- fear that it cannot occur but we’re criticizing this attachment ot fear<br />
They say the world should be a certain way<br />
Avoiding suffering is bad- we never accept things and become at peace. So this only recreates the suffering they criticize.<br />
External suffering and internal suffering. We say that external suffering is not your source- internal is, that’s where you suffer. Desire not to have violence committed against you.<br />
When we abandon internal desires in the world we can relieve the suffering creating by external suffering.<br />
We are a focus on the individual and the individual mindset not collective.<br />
Physical suffering will eventually be relieved and you can show compassion which is necessary to solve violence<br />
If you run and avert that situation then it only recreates the suffering because you desire a certain world.</strong></u><br />

The United States Supreme Court should rule the holding in Milliken v.

NEW ADV: Immigration<br />
Local communities are enacting laws to place the harshest restrictions on immigration possible: the higher level of governments won’t act on immigration.<br />
Brown, 2006 [“Pa poll finds support for local immigration laws,” Pittsburgh Tribune Review, 10/23]<br />
“Sixty-five percent of those…number of municipalities nationwide.”<br />
Local control is using racist policies to enforce its immigration laws<br />

The United States Supreme Court should overrule the central holding of Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) by holding: the 13th Amendment’s right to self-interest extends to all life beginning at conception overwhelming a right to choose an abortion<br />
<br />
Second is Anthropocentrism<br />
Current legal protections for abortion are anthropocentric allowing for animal slavery and exploitation<br />

Much as localities do not…<br />

<br />
Plan<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule in the next available test case that the holding in Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974) that the relief ordered by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals was based upon erroneous standards; the decision will establish that Districts are subordinate entities of the State and school districts are simply matters of political convenience as per its original grounding.<br />
