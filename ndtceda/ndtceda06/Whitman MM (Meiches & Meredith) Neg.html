<u>Casey “Abortion Good” Affs</u><br />
<br />
The language of choice is not a neutral political vehicle, but imbedded in a series of power relationships that ensure it is deployed for coercive ends. This is historically documented in the early mid and late 20th centuries and is continued by the 1AC which assumes full right to choose, but does not confront technology that in turn becomes the new method of patriarchal domination.<br />
Christine Stolba, Ph.D., is a member of the National Advisory Board of the IWF, Policy Review “Overcoming Motherhood,” 11-29-2005, pg. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://webmail.whitman.edu/horde/services/go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpolicyreview.org%2Fdec02%2Fstolba.html" rel="nofollow">http://policyreview.org/dec02/stolba.html</a><br />
<br />
The language of rights is problematic for abortion. It neglects a host of collective concerns that are at play in defnining abortion, relies on an individualisitic model for thinking about rights that cannot adequately describe abortion and ultimately holds women hostage in male-dominated legal through from which they cannot escape.<br />

Only a retheorization of the ethical based on the drowned bare life stripped of meaningful distinction can begin to resist this framework of ethics that reduces all dignity to nothing.<br />
Ewa Ziarek, University of Notre Dame, “Evil and Testimony: Ethics ‘after’ Postmodernism,” Hypatia, volume 18, number 2, Spring, 2003, pg. 200-201<br />
<br />
The primacy of the Other in ethical decision-making is nothing more than a ruse. Our subjectivity is not structured by a face-to-face experience with the Other that overwhelms us, indeed, subjectivity is structured by our relationship to a faceless mass of “other” Others that Levinas termed “Thirds.” Our alternative is to ethically privilege the thirds, those who are left in the shadows of the affirmative’s ethics. This is the truly radically ethical move, and the only way to bring an ethic of justice into being.<br />

<u>Morrison “VAWA” Affs</u><br />
<br />
VAWA does little more than mask relations of non-spectacular violence and the domination of sexuality in the West that enables biopower.<br />
Nancy Meyer-Emerick, associate professor of public administration the university of Cleveland, The Violence Against Women Act of 1994: An Analysis of Intent and Perception, 2001, pg. 16-17<br />
<br />
VAWA’s civil rights remedy is not a neutral legal tool. Rather, it stands at a paradoxical point between advancing women’s autonomous legal being and protecting their defenseless bodies from being battered and abused. This paradigm constitutes women as beings that must willfully endorse their own victimhood or appear confident and unharmed. Moreover, this strategy of advancement excludes other strata such as race and class that define victimhood. Ultimately, the civil remedy collapses into a scientific confessional confirming the essence of the feminine as a an essential weakness turning the case and justifying state intervention.<br />
Caroline Joan S. Picart, assistant professor of English and associate professor of law at florida state university-tallahasssee, “Rhetorically Reconfirming Victimhood and Agency: The Violence Against Women Act Civil Rights Clause,” Rhetoric and Public Affairs 6 (1), 2003, pg. 97-100<br />
<br />
Civil remedies for domestic violence are raced in a particular fashion. Legitimate victims in today’s legal setting are all constructed as white women who are the passive victims of their abusive husbands. This theorization neglects substantial considerations of race and class by viewing the problem as associated exclusively with gendered norms, which translates into a theoretical and practical neglect of women of color. Moreover, this neglect is transferred into the legal system and is particularly true in the instance of VAWA’s legal services.<br />
Adele M. Morrison, associate professor of law northern illinois university college of law, “Changing the Domestic Violence (Dis)course: Moving From White Victim to Multi-Cultural Survivor,” University of California-Davis Law Review, March 2006, pg. 1078-1087<br />

<u>Morrison “Commerce Clause” Aff</u><br />
<br />
Politics has produced an end of history in the form of the consistent operation of an anthropological machine, ceaselessly deciding on the conflict between the human and the animal. The great totalitarian projects of the 20th century were not so much exercises in nationalism, but events designed to generate bare life in a last ditch effort to reinvigorate politics. Ultimately, however, all these struggles have been subordinated to the unending task of managing biological life, thus, creating a politics only capable of generating unending indistinction. The products of which is the removal of any condition through which life is given meaning.<br />

The concept of environmental degradation produces a sovereign relationship reinforcing the political need to discipline people who do not act “naturally” towards the environment<br />
Ronnie D Lipschutz, Professor of Politics at UC Santa Cruz, After Authority 2000 p.102-103<br />
<br />
The 1AC relies on the notion that the Third World requires Euro-American styles of classical democracy. However, this merely reaffirms the fundamental racial narrative of world history where the Third World constituted the “laboratory” of state forms in modernity. This constitutes the people of the Third World as bare life, and perpetuates a form of state racism that enables genocide.<br />
Ann Laura Stoler, professor of anthropology and history at the university of Michigan-ann arbor, Carnal Knowledge and Imperial Power: Race and the Intimate in Colonial Rule, 2002, pg. 145-151<br />

Biopolitics makes massacres vital, teaches us who to kill, develops extreme racism, necessitates violent wars, and cares to death entire populations.<br />

Our alternative is to vote negative. This performs a criticism of the limitations implicit in the 1AC’s representation. This both undermines the stability of static epistemological claims and opens the terrain for a transformative self-relationship thereby enabling alternative visions of politics and social relations to appear. We solve the aff through the simple act of challenging its assumptions.<br />

The affirmative defaults to treating former ‘enemy combatants’ as ‘unlawful combatants’ this change is nothing more than a semantic gesture that retains the Terrorist’s status as homo sacer, life capable of being killed without the commission of homicide. It is precisely this violent humanitarianism that is turning the globe into an ongoing state of emergency. Only by challenging the frame of the fantasy of American prestige can we shatter the ongoing reduction of all life to bare life.<br />

Particularized demands for change, no matter how radical fail to fundamentally change hegemonic ideology.<br />

<br />
Their construction of terrorists as a faceless enemy is an ideological fantasy which allows for terror to be cast as the universal signifier for all social evils, which any amount of violence can be mobilized against.<br />
Slavoj Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies in Ljubljana, 2002, Welcome to the Desert of the Real!, p. 109-111<br />
<br />
Anti-terrorism and humanitarian aid as part of the war on terror create Homo sacer – the war on terror designates individuals as ‘unlawful combatants,’ who can be killed under the laws of war but cannot fight back lawfully<br />
Slavoj Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies in Ljubljana, 2002, Welcome to the Desert of the Real!, p. 91-93<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s appeal to international human rights law legitimizes the international state of emergency. The discourse of international legal struggle merely supplements the biopolitical activities of the sovereign. Even the ICCPR should treated as suspect when considering the adequate starting point from which to challenge state violence.<br />
Kim Lane Schleppe, professor of comparative law and sociology at the university of Pennsylvania, “The International State of Emergency: The Challenge for Constitutionalism After September 11th,” last modified, 8-28-2006, pg. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/cclt/documents/Scheppelebookproposal.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.georgetown.edu/cclt/documents/Scheppelebookproposal.doc</a><br />

If we win the claim that the 1AC engages in dehumanization this straight turns their international democracy arguments and leads to total war.<br />

Our alternative text: The United States Supreme Court should rule that extraordinary rendition, and military tribunals are legitimate under international law<br />

Overidentification is the most effective method of subverting the law - it shatters this distance and the law’s symbolic authority<br />
