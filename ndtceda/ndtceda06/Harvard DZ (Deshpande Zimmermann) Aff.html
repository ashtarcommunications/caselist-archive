2AC tricks:<br />
Framework: you should evaluate the round as a Supreme Court justice, not as a “gods eye view.” This means, according to Harvard, that the judge can’t evaluate Kritik alternatives, non-supreme court CP’s, or disads<br />

MORRISON AFF, AS OF NORTHWESTERN<br />
<br />
Plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in United States v. Morrison by holding that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights authorizes Congressional enactment of the civil rights remedy of the Violence Against Women Act.<br />
<br />
Observation 1: Exclusion From Law<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s decision in Morrison establishes a zone outside the law where women can be abandoned to violence. This division between the local and national reproduces the line between the public and private, creating interlocking spheres of sovereign exception that makes dehumanizing subjugation inevitable. The question is not whether the civil remedy is good or bad, but the institutional power relations that can declare such a law unconstitutional.<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon ‘2k Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135<br />
&quot;To the ear of violated women...people by the other should survive.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, the Morrison decision did more than just confine women to the home – it was a national decision which refused to recognize the nature of gendered violence – under the logic of the decision, domestic violence is not only tolerated, but sanctioned<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law, The University of Michigan Law School, 11/2K, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, p. 170-1<br />
&quot;The Morrison majority does not simply respect...sphere in which it is socially exercised.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision, like the Confederate Flag, symbolizes institutionally sanctioned violence.<br />
Alberto B. Lopez ‘1 law professor at Northern Kentucky University (69 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 251)<br />
&quot;In the end, the Morrison decision ties...dealing with a national problem - the Congress.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, the refusal to apply international law for women’s human rights abandons women to violence. International law can provide an escape from this logic, exposing the legal neutrality of sovereignty for the political domination it is<br />
Judith Resnik, Arthur Liman Professor of Law, Yale Law School. December, 2001<br />
&quot;Categorical federalism has appeal...as this Essay was in press).&quot;<br />
<br />
The parallel exclusion of women from international human rights law maintains subordination and annihilation worldwide.<br />
Mackinnon ’06, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School. [Are Women Human? And other international Dialogues p. 155-159]<br />
&quot;As currently defined, international human...under any but genocidal conditions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Confronting the Law<br />
<br />
Overruling Morrison is necessary to achieve a national rejection of the Court’s refusal in the status quo to recognize certain social spheres and the violence that they produce.<br />
Deborah M. Weissman, Associate Professor of Law and Director of Clinical Programs, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law, 9/01, 42 B.C. L. Rev 1081, p. 1157-9<br />
&quot;Any issue is considered and framed...change in public values and concerns.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, civil rights claims function as a demand to be heard—they form a political floor that is necessary to build social recognition of gender violence that does not reduce it to private solutions<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor Rutgers School of Law, 2003, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 251, p. 254-7<br />
&quot;The enactment of a federal statute treating...individual perpetrators of violence against women.&quot;<br />
<br />
This recognition of violence against women in civil remedy forums allows an expansive platform for victims of violence to assert their rights within the law<br />
Ellen M. Bublick, Law Professor University Of Arizona, 2006, SMU Law Review, 59 SMU L. Rev. 55, P. 68-74<br />
&quot;Although only a small percentage...satisfaction of particular victim demands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Observation Three: The Role of the Ballot<br />
Treat the ballot as a decision in a Court case. Voting Aff overrules Morrison, while voting Neg upholds it.<br />
Role-playing as Supreme Court justices demystifies the law.<br />
Nancy V. Baker, asst. prof. of gov. @ New Mexico State Univ., 1994, Political Science and Politics 24 (2), pg. 253<br />
&quot;The law is more than a list of case names...factors that contribute to the outcome of a case.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, role-playing is a form of defiant deliberative politics that reclaims the political sphere<br />
Jessica Kulynych, Asst Professor of Political Science at Winthrop University, Polity, Winter, 1997, n2 p315(32)<br />
&quot;When we look at the success of citizen...actually diverse and participatory democracy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confronting law with our own experiences exposes dominance as epistemic, not ontological.<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law, The University of Michigan Law School, ’89, Toward a Feminist Theory of the State, p. 239-240<br />
&quot;Structurally, only when the state has acted...level of the state for women?&quot;<br />
<br />
Voting affirmative as an ethical obligation of inclusion within the law serves as a challenge to the law itself—the very promise of justice is on the line, and the plan is a gesture not simply at one policy, but at a politics of legal openness, of both criticizing the law and allowing that criticism to transform society<br />
West, Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, ’05, [Robin L. 17 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism 385, lexis]<br />
&quot;Here, then, is the heart of MacKinnon's legal...Path of Our Law - thus cleared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Take this opportunity to challenge the privileging of security over humanity; instead of fearing the chaos of the post-Cold War period, you should embrace new possibilities for emancipation.<br />
Anne Orford, Lecturer, Faculty of Law, The Australian National University, Winter ’96, 17 Mich. J. Int'l L. 373, lexis<br />
&quot;While images of the &quot;anarchic society&quot; have...white men to recreate a fictitious unity.&quot;
