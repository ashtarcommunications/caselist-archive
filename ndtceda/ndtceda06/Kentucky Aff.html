Contention One is a tale of two cities<br />
<br />
Minorities have been organized in the inner city by the government resulting in racially divided cities. As minorities populated the metropolis, their location was increasingly influenced by local government tax boundaries, resulting in widespread racial-residential segregation<br />

Plan:<br />
The United State Supreme Court should grant cert to the next relevant test case to overrule Milliken v.

The aff you have on the casebook is right and you seemed to have the sites to the midterms we went for every negative debate at wayne state (and can't go for now).<br />
<br />
We are reading the same as aff as Kentucky ST read at Georgia State - Quirin. Also I don't think the plan text was in the outline so here it is:<br />
Upon the next available test case the United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in Ex parte Quirin by ruling that persons considered to be unlawful combatants accused of violating the laws of war should not be deprived of the rights prescribed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

KENTUCKY ST 1AC â€“ QUIRIN<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation One: The Status Quo â€“<br />
<br />
In the immediate aftermath of September 11 president Bush authorized the use of military commissions to try individuals in the war on terrorism citing the supreme courtâ€™s decision in ex parte quirin as its primary justification<br />
Kichtenthal 2004 â€“ 10 Buff. Hum. Rts. L. Rev. 399<br />
â€œmilitary tribunals may be closed proceedingsâ€ â€¦ â€œquirin is one of the primary precedents cheney cites to justify the military commissionsâ€<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the decision in Hamdan V. Rumsfeld did not address the constitutional implications of military commissions nor did it reject the presidentâ€™s inherent powers justification for establishing these commissions<br />
Rivkin and Casey 7-14-2006 â€“ Washington times<br />
â€œbush administration critics have tried mightily to characterize the supreme courtâ€™s recent military commission decisionâ€ â€¦ â€œa significant segment of his political oppositionâ€<br />
<br />
Advantage â€“ Liberty<br />
<br />
Bushâ€™s authorization of military commissions to try detainees without csontitutional guarantees shreds the rights of the accused, oversteps the executiveâ€™s constitutional authority, and lays the basis for an imperial presidency associated with the worst rights violations in history<br />
Sutter 2005 â€“ 36 U. West. L.A. L. Rev. 117<br />
â€œthe academic debate over the breadth of the presidentâ€™s orderâ€ â€¦ â€œimplicates the seperation of powersâ€ â€¦ â€œatrocities from this era need not even be embellishedâ€<br />
<br />
continued concentrationo f political power in the executive in violation of the separation of powers will resut in a widespread assault on individual liberties by a tyrannical executive and war â€“ the magnitude of this impact outweighs other concerns<br />
Redish and Cisar 1991 â€“ Duke Law Journal<br />
â€œin any event, the political history of which the framersâ€ â€¦ â€œthreat of nuclear warâ€ â€¦ â€œI told you soâ€<br />
<br />
PETRO<br />
<br />
<br />
KENTUCKY ST 1AC â€“ QUIRIN<br />
<br />
Advantage â€“ Democracy<br />
<br />
Bushâ€™s establishment of military commissions represents an unprecedented expansion of presidential powers signifying the restoration of an imperial presidency that threatens democracy<br />
Mathews 2002 â€“ 23 Hamline J. Pub. L. &amp; Polâ€™y 455<br />
â€œhas this war on terrorism produced a president who is increasingly isolatedâ€ â€¦ â€œpower in order to achieve fameâ€<br />
<br />
Establishment of military tribunals represents the creation of a shadow criminal justice system that threatens the entire democratic process<br />
Gross 2002 â€“ 13 Ind. Intâ€™l &amp; Comp. L. Rev. 1<br />
â€œit is a government that detains people for the slightest violationâ€ â€¦ â€œdoes not exist in special military tribunalsâ€<br />
<br />
Bushâ€™s revitalizing of quirin makes it inevitable that the scope of military commissions will be expanded domestically<br />
Katyal and tribe 2002 â€“ 111 Yale L.J. 1259<br />
â€œthe presidentâ€™s legal claimâ€ â€¦ â€œthese examples may seem far afieldâ€ â€¦ â€œset new precedent for future presidentsâ€<br />
<br />
US Failure to respect due process rights domestically in the war on terror results in hollow and failed democracies abroad<br />
Carter center 5-24-2006 â€“ <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc2350.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc2350.html</a><br />
â€œhuman rights, and the people trying to protect themâ€ â€¦ â€œdetention without trial, or other denials of due processâ€<br />

<br />
Democracy impact â€“ extinction<br />
Kirkus Reviews 1993 â€“ 7-15<br />
â€œthe elder-statesman/philosopher of the French right ponderously warnsâ€ â€¦ â€œrise of neo-nazism in geermanyâ€<br />
<br />
Advantage â€“ War<br />
<br />
Inherent powers justification guarantees eventual miscalculation and nuclear war â€“ maintaining constitutional checks on the executive is key to avoid this<br />
Forrester 1989 â€“ 57 geo. Wash. L. rev. 1636<br />
â€œthe most dangerous governmental power ever possessedâ€ â€¦ â€œconsequences that a decision on the merits might entailâ€<br />
<br />
<br />
KENTUCKY ST 1AC â€“ QUIRIN<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage â€“ International Law<br />
<br />
Despite binding legal obligations bush has been unwilling to comply with international laws of war for military commissions<br />
French 2003 â€“ 63 Ohio St. L.J. 1225<br />
â€œthe November 13 orderâ€ â€¦ â€œdespite president bushâ€™s express assertionâ€ â€¦ â€œ1949 geneva conventions articulatedâ€<br />
<br />
specifically bushâ€™s military commissions violate several aspects of the international covenant on civil and political rights<br />
Dickinson 2002 â€“ 75 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1407<br />
â€œalthough less explored by critics of the commissionsâ€ .. â€œa civilian judicial body could not satisfyâ€<br />
<br />
Additionally the Geneva conventions provide several procedural safeguards for trials of individuals accused of having violated the laws of war that bushâ€™s military commissions donâ€™t satisfy â€“ trying unlawful combatants via the same type of courts-martial that would try us soldiers is key to comply with international law<br />
French 2003 â€“ 63 Ohio St. L.J. 1225<br />
â€œpresident bush insists thatâ€ â€¦ â€œrequirement of equal treatment with u.s. military personalâ€<br />
<br />
US Adherence to international law is key to winning the war on terror and global stability<br />
French 2003 â€“ 63 Ohio St. L.J. 1225<br />
â€œeven if president bushâ€™s November 13 order is constitutionalâ€ â€¦ â€œorder and stability that benefit the united statesâ€<br />
<br />
Impact â€“ extinction<br />
International physicians for the prevention of nuclear war 2002 â€“ <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ippnw.org/washingtondec.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ippnw.org/washingtondec.html</a><br />
â€œhunger, pestilence, poverty, and war continue to claim millionsâ€ â€¦ â€œaffirm the need for alternative solutions to the terrible problemsâ€<br />
<br />
KENTUCKY ST 1AC â€“ QUIRIN<br />
<br />
<br />
Solvency â€“<br />
<br />
Suspected terrorists could be triad via court martial or civil courts<br />
Glazier 2003 â€“ 89 va. L. rev. 2005<br />
â€œother than simply waiting to determine whether the current military commission directives survive the testâ€ â€¦ â€œnations have shown some recent concern over traditional anglo-american court-martial practicesâ€<br />
<br />
Trying terror suspects via court martial is necessary for effective prosecutions and the perception abroad that the u.s. adheres to the rule of law<br />
Smith 2005 â€“ 33 hastings const. l.q. 83<br />
â€œthis note will not attempt to argue whether or notâ€ â€¦ â€œamericaâ€™s commitment to the rule of lawâ€<br />
<br />
Court martials are the best possible venue â€“ all available alternatives either violate international law or would seriously hamper the war on terrorism<br />
Smith 2005 â€“ 33 Hastings Const. L.Q. 83<br />
â€œone alternate option is to hold the trials of suspected terrorists in the U.S. district courtsâ€ â€¦ â€œdeals our reverence for the rule of law a major defeatâ€<br />
<br />
historically civil courts are effective at prosecuting terrorists<br />
Gross 2002 â€“ 13 Ind. Intâ€™l &amp; Comp. L. Rev. 1<br />
â€œit is not disputed that there is a need for secrecy in appropriate casesâ€ â€¦ â€œbringing international criminals to justiceâ€<br />
<br />
Terrorists can be effectively prosecuted in civil courts without undermining the war on terror<br />
Torruella 2002 â€“ 4 U. Pa. J. Const. l. 648<br />
â€œTRIALS OF THIS NATURE HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE IN united states DISTRICT COURTSâ€ â€¦ â€œAGAIN MOST OF WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS WONâ€<br />
<br />
Court action solves without collapsing judicial deference<br />
Jinks and Sloss 2004 â€“ 90 Cornell L. Rev. 97<br />
â€œin a brief submitted to the district courtâ€ â€¦ â€œthat al qaeda members are not covered by the conventionsâ€ â€¦ â€œdirectly contradict the administrationâ€™s positionâ€<br />
<br />
Several factors make international terrorism against the u.s. inevitable â€“ trying both foreign and domestic terrorists as criminals in civil courts is crucial to preserve the credibility of the american justice system and to win hearts and minds abroad in order to create a world where it is possible to address root causes that motivate terrorism<br />
Torruella 2002 â€“ 4 u. pa. j. const. l. 648<br />
â€œthe removal of the Afghanistan detainees from the mainstreamâ€ â€¦ â€œbackwards down our own national slopesâ€<br />
<br />
The rule of law is the single-most effective weapon in the war on terror â€“ victory cannot be achieved militarily<br />
Danner 2005 â€“ 46 Va. J. Intâ€™L l. 83<br />
â€œALTHOUGH MEMBERS OF THE BUSH ADMINSTRATION HAVE NOT SUGGESTEDâ€ â€¦ â€œrevising its strategy if it desires to enlist the power of law in that effortâ€<br />

â€œa different danger is that of the â€œslippery slope:â€ â€¦ â€œnon other than oneâ€™s political opponentâ€<br />
<br />
congress doesnâ€™t create a clear statuatory limit on military tribunals<br />
baldrate 2005 â€“ 186 Mil. L. Rev. 1, Winter<br />
â€œin practice, both congressional statutes and unwritten common lawâ€ â€¦ â€œsupreme courtâ€™s role in determining the jurisdiction of military courtsâ€<br />

<br />
Congress has already held a series of hearings over military tribunals<br />
Iraola 2003 â€“ 33 N.M.L. Rev. 95<br />
â€œnotwithstanding president bushâ€™s consistently strong public defenseâ€ â€¦ â€œturned it into a lesson in democracyâ€<br />

â€œmany prominent scholars wrote substantive articlesâ€ â€¦ â€œmatters properly situated before military tribunalsâ€<br />

â€œan alternative model of seperation of powers actually amounts ot the absenceâ€ â€¦ â€œ misses the point of separation of powers protections in the first placeâ€<br />

â€œpresident bush has claimed the power to create and operate a systemâ€ â€¦ â€œeviscerate structural constitutional protectionsâ€<br />

<br />
quirin = illegit precedent<br />
katyal and tribe 2002 â€“ 111 yale l.j. 1259<br />
â€œthe procedural protections of the due process clauseâ€ â€¦ â€œmaintenance under principles of stare decisisâ€<br />
