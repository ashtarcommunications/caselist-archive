Round # 3<br />
Vs Team: Central Oklahoma CH<br />
Judge: Matheson, Vats, Morris<br />
Case Args:<br />
Supreme Court doesn’t solve (implementation, counter movements, enforcement)<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
Plan Flaw – overruling Casey also restricts abortion because aff is a total overrule of opposite holdings,<br />
On the caselist:<br />
Amendment CP w/ progressivism net benefit,<br />
Roberts/Minimalism disad,<br />
Capitalism K<br />
Included new link arguments:<br />
To claim that abortion rights hold the key to emancipation is as dangerous as it is delusional --- such claims only localize the abortion smokescreen for the entrenchment of capital --- only the radical alternative of labor can get us out of this deadlock.<br />
Mas’ud Zavarzadeh, Sept/Oct 2002, Red Critique, “The Labor Theory of (Anti) Abortion”<br />
“The lack of class conciousness … effect of production.”<br />
Your claims of radical emancipation are a farce --- abortion rights are merely a tool for the elite classes to maintain exclusive access to a racist, unjust system that creates your scenarios in the first place.<br />
Mas’ud Zavarzadeh, Sept/Oct 2002, Red Critique, “The Labor Theory of (Anti) Abortion”<br />

Neg: Quirin (Straight Up)<br />
<br />
SUPREME COURT HAS OVERWHELMINGLY AFFIRMED THAT DETAINEES HAVE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO U.S. COURTS<br />
Erwin Chemerinsky, Alston &amp; Bird Professor of Law, Duke University, “Unanswered Questions,” GREEN BAG v. 7, Summer 2004, p. 324-325.<br />
In three cases … war on terrorism.<br />
<br />
HAMDI DECISION GRANTS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS TO U.S. CITIZENS CLASSIFIED AS ENEMY COMBATANTS<br />
Erwin Chemerinsky, Alston &amp; Bird Professor of Law, Duke University, “Unanswered Questions,” GREEN BAG v. 7, Summer 2004, p. 326-327.<br />
The other four … without any form of due process.<br />
<br />
COURTS MAKING AT LEAST SOME EFFORTS TO PROTECT CIVIL LIBERTIES IN THE WAR ON TERROR<br />
Steven R. Shapiro, National Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union, “Defending Civil Liberties in the War on Terror: The Role of the Courts in the War Against Terrorist: A Preliminary Assessment,” THE FLETCHER FORUM OF WORLD AFFAIRS v. 29, Winter 2005, p. 103.<br />
Three years after … an encouraging sign.<br />
<br />
RASUL DECISION ASSERTED COURT POWER AS THE PROTECTOR OF CIVIL LIBERTIES<br />
Steven R. Shapiro, National Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union, “Defending Civil Liberties in the War on Terror: The Role of the Courts in the War Against Terrorist: A Preliminary Assessment,” THE FLETCHER FORUM OF WORLD AFFAIRS v. 29, Winter 2005, p. 108.<br />
Seizing on these points… peacetime, for aliens as well as citizens.<br />
<br />
THE HAMDAN DECISION HAS REQUIRED TRIBUNALS CONFORM TO INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THAT COMMON ARTICLE 3 PROTECTIONS APPLY TO DETAINEES<br />
WASHINGTON TIMES 8/7/2006<br />
[“Justice for Jihadists”, p. ln]<br />
After the Supreme Court's June …Court standards.<br />
<br />
FIRST, OVERRULING DOESN’T SOLVE WAR ON TERROR PROBLEMS:<br />
A) OTHER PRECEDENTS EXIST<br />
WUERTH (Assoc. Prof of Law at Univ. of Cincinnati) 2004<br />
[Ingrind Brunk, “The President’s Power to Detain Enemy Combatants”, Northwestern Law Review, Summer p. ln]<br />
Although Quirin is said … by providing its advice and consent to that Convention.<br />
<br />
B) BUSH VIOLATES QUIRIN NOW—IT DOESN’T GIVE HIM HIS POWER<br />
ORENTLICHER &amp; GOLDMAN (Prof’s of Law @ Washington College) 2002<br />
[Diane &amp; Robert, “When Justice Goes to War”, Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy, Spring, p. ln]<br />
Much like the Supreme Court's … challenge the lawfulness of their prosecution before a<br />
<br />
C) QUIRIN SUPPORTS INTERNATIONAL LAW NOW<br />
JINKS &amp; SLOSS (Assoc. Professors of Law at Arizona State &amp; St. Louis Univ) 2004<br />
[Derek &amp; David, “Is the President Bound by the Geneva Conventions?”, Cornell Law Review, Nov, p. ln<br />
By its terms, this provision … does not authorize their use.<br />
<br />
SECOND, CIVILIAN COURTS FAIL:<br />
A) THEIR INADEQUATE FOR TERRORISTS<br />
Amanda Schaffer, J.D. Candidate, Fordham University School of Law, “LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF TERRORISTS: AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S RIGHT TO CLASSIFY UNITED STATES CITIZENS SUSPECTED OF TERRORIST AS ENEMY COMBATANTS AND TRY THOSE ENEMY COMBATANTS BY MILITARY COMMISSION,” Fordham Urban Law Journal, v.30, May 2003, p. 1474-1475.<br />
Trying suspected terrorists …terrorist suspects.<br />
<br />
B) AL QAEDA IS A UNIQUE THREAT<br />
WEDGWOOD (Board of Editors) 2002<br />
[Ruth, “Military Commissions”, American Journal of International Law, April, p. ln]<br />
Good faith … the network's members.<br />
<br />
C) MILITARY COMMISSIONS ARE COMPARATIVELY BETTER<br />
Joseph P. Bielke, Staff Judge Advocate, Pacific Air-Forces Australia, “AL-QAEDA &amp; TALIBAN UNLAWFUL COMBATANT DETAINEES, UNLAWFUL BELLIGERENCY, AND THE INTERNATIONAL LAWS OF ARMED CONFLICT,” AIR FORCE LAW REVIEW, v. 55, 2004 p. 73-74.<br />
Similarly, when necessary, … against protected civilians.<br />
<br />
D) CAUSES DOMESTIC OVERSTRETCH, CAN’T RESPOND TO DISASTERS<br />
Cynthia Honssinger et al., Chief Council Office of Governor Bill Owens, State of Colorado, Brief Amici Curiae of the Honorable Bill Owens, Governor of the State of Colorado, and the Honorable Rick Perry, Governor of the State of Texas, in Support of Respondent United States, Shafiz Rasul et al., Petitions, v. George W. Bush President of the United States Et al., Respondents; Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad Al Odah, et al., Petitioners, v. United States of America et al., Respondents, Nos. 03-334, 03-343, 2003 U.S BRIEFS 334, March 3, 2004, npg.<br />
States often rely on … to domestic emergencies.<br />
<br />
THIRD, LEGITIMACY TURN<br />
A) GRANTING TERRORISTS POW STATUS DESTROYS THE POWER OF LAW, GRANTING LEGITIMACY TO TERRORIST ACTIONS, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS<br />
ZACHARY (J.D.) 2005<br />
[Shlomy, “Between the Geneva Conventions”, Israel Law Review, Winter/Spring, p. ln]<br />
Klabbers takes Rubin's … encourage the continuation of terrorism.<br />
<br />
B) THAT CAUSES EXTINCTION<br />
Harvey Gordon, Visiting Lecturer, Forensic Psychiatry, Tel Aviv University, “The ‘Suicide’ Bomber: Is It a Psychiatric Phenomenon?” PSYCHIATRIC BULLETIN v. 26, 2002, pp. 285-287. Available from the Wrold Wide Web at: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/26/8/285" rel="nofollow">http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/26/8/285</a>.<br />
Although terrorism throughout human history … destruction of life, including their own.<br />
<br />
FOURTH, LAW OF WAR TURN<br />
A) ELIMINATING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAWFUL AND UNLAWFUL ENEMY COMBATANTS LEADS TO COLLATERAL DEATH AND GREATER SUFFERING BY CIVILIANS.<br />
Joseph P. Bielke, Staff Judge Advocate, Pacific Air-Forces Australia, “AL-QAEDA &amp; TALIBAN UNLAWFUL COMBATANT DETAINEES, UNLAWFUL BELLIGERENCY, AND THE INTERNATIONAL LAWS OF ARMED CONFLICT,” AIR FORCE LAW REVIEW, v. 55, 2004 p. 7-8.<br />
Armed conflict places … for failing to do so.<br />
<br />
B) THAT CAUSES INDISCRIMINATE SLAUGHTER<br />
Joseph P. Bielke, Staff Judge Advocate, Pacific Air-Forces Australia, “AL-QAEDA &amp; TALIBAN UNLAWFUL COMBATANT DETAINEES, UNLAWFUL BELLIGERENCY, AND THE INTERNATIONAL LAWS OF ARMED CONFLICT,” AIR FORCE LAW REVIEW, v. 55, 2004 p. 13.<br />
If an opposing side is … compliance with LOAC.<br />
<br />
FIFTH, COURT DUCKING<br />
A) USING FORMAL LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THE SCOPE OF EMERGENCY POWERS NORMALIZES THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. VAGUENESS OF WHAT THE POWERS ARE IS A GOOD DETERRENT AGAINST ABUSE<br />
Mark Tushnet, Professor, Constitutional Law, Georgetown University, “Defending Korematsu? Reflections on Civil Liberties in Wartime,” WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW, 2003, p. 303-304.<br />
As I have emphasized, … beyond the period of the emergency.<br />
<br />
<br />
B) THE FRAMERS COULD NOT ANTICIPATE ALL SCENARIOS FOR EMERGENCY. LITERAL INTERPRETATIONS CANNOT SOLVE SECURITY AND ENCOURAGE DISTORTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW<br />
Mark Tushnet, Professor, Constitutional Law, Georgetown University, “Defending Korematsu? Reflections on Civil Liberties in Wartime,” WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW, 2003, p. 299-300.<br />
The first possibility is … in the face of a less substantial one.&quot;<br />
<br />
C) NOT HAVING THE SUPREME COURT DECIDE MATTERS INVOLVING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IS BEST—PREVENTS BAD PRECEDENT.<br />
Laurence H. Tribe, Tyler Professor of Constitutional Law, Harvard University, “Trial by Fury: Why Congress Must Curb Bush’s Military Courts,” THE NEW NREPUBLIC, December 10, 2001, p. 18+.<br />
It would have been … power of its own.&quot;<br />
<br />
SIXTH, RENDITION TURN: JUDICIAL REVIEW WOULD FORCE THE PENTAGON TO SHIFT DETAINEES TO THEATERS OF WAR, WHICH WOULD WORSEN CONDITIONS<br />
John Yoo, Professor, Law, University of California at Berkeley, “Terrorists Have No Geneva Rights,” WALL STREET JOURNAL, May 29, 2004. Available from the World Wide Web at: www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005144, accessed 8/2/05.<br />

A: Dallmyar, Philosophy of East &amp; West 2002 At this juncture… local cultures and practices<br />

<br />
<br />
K: Capitalism (v. Pomos)<br />
<br />
The affirmative is a fundamental misreading of politics and the reproduction of social relations. The state and capital move hand in glove- one cannot exts without the other. Only a total distance from the modern state can allow for the destruction of capital. Otherwise what is pushed out the door only comes back in through the window.<br />
<br />
Meszaros 95 Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition<br />
The modern state as the comprehensive political command structure of capital….reamining faithful to the Marxain concern with the eithering away of the state<br />
<br />
The absence of structural historicism is no mere oversight nor is it enough to simply mention economics in a few of your cards- the reliance of identity based politics is not an accidental instance of ignoring class. The deman arises out of the crisis of liberalism- such politics particularizes the oppressions of capitalism to the point that the universal system is naturalized. Attaining white, male bourgeoisse privilege becomes the bench mark of political success, re-entrecnching the very foundation of the system.<br />
<br />
Brown 1993 Political Theory<br />
<br />
Although the detente between universal and particular within liberalism…identity through normalizing practices<br />
<br />
From the perspectice of structural K there can be no such thing as making things better their model of politics, no matter how subversive or conservative all fundamentally exaggerate the importance of the formal institution of politics and power, isnoring the ways such a system creates knowledge- only a Marxist shift to K the structure and create mass social consciousness will overcome this failure of politics<br />
<br />
Harnecker 00 www.dsp.org.au/links/back/issue16/harnecker.html/wyo<br />
<br />
To think about the construction of forces….only needs to be stirred up but as something that has to be built<br />
<br />
There is no such thing as an ethical action that stands outside of politics- your ethical demand to come prior to the structural negation of capital is the largest violation of ethics<br />
<br />
Mezaros 95<br />
Politics and morality are so closely intertwined…taking fully on board the painful lessons of the recent past<br />
<br />
Vote negative to validate and adopt the method of structural/histoirical criticism that is the 1NC. This is not the alternative, but in truth the only option- a radical socialist reimagination of politics is the only solution to the crisis of capital- institutional political action is the road to nowhere as capitalist intertial will destroy any radical component<br />
<br />
Meszaros 95<br />
<br />
If however the questioning remains….through which the realization of socialist economic aims 1st become feasible at all<br />
