Off Case Args:<br />
T – must rule directly opposite (the same side can’t have won – the aff has to overturn the holding that multi-district desegregation remedies could not be imposed unless the discriminatory actions of the affected distracts had caused segregation)<br />
Court-stripping CP: Tripp and I defend the United States Congres enacting legislation stating that school coundary lines may no longer be bridged in circumstances where there has been a constitutional violation calling for inter-distrcit relief. The Congress should eercise its Article III power to eliminate the jurisdiction of any Federal Court to hear any challenges to the constitutionality of this legislation or to the authority of this Congressional interpretation.<br />
Jurisdiction stripping revives popular constitutionalism and provides a check on judicial supremacy – Norton 06, Wake Forest L Review<br />

Popular constitutionalism<br />
<ol><li>Ending judicial supremacy is key to revive democratic discourse 0 Lipkin 2006</li><li>The impact is extinction – Boggs 1997</li></ol>Modelling<br />

Coercion K – it’s on the caselist<br />
Referendum CP: The U.S. Supreme Court should hold that they should overrule Milliken only if the decision conforms with the outcome of a binding national referendum. The U.S. federal government should submit the proposed ruling for a binding national referendum.<br />
CP is not a supreme court overrule – an overrule requires that the Supreme Court change the force of law. Words and Phrases 95.<br />
The CP is mutually exclusive with exercising the force of law at the federal level. Harlan Hahn 1987. Referendum Voting: Social Status and Policy Preferences. “The initiative, recall, and referendum…act upon it themselves.” ‘<br />
—Harvard am read this CP round 8. The rest of the cites are on the casebook under Harvard am round 8.<br />
<br />
Direct democracy DA<br />
Tyranny is inevitable within the current framework of representative governance – only direct democracy can infuse the citizenry with an ethic of political engagement to solve. Alan Hirsh and Akhil Amar, 4-2002. Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly 29:2 “Direct Democracy and Civic Maturation.” “The Founders believed…government on every level.”<br />
Short time frame – the US government is on the brink of a slide into despotic tyranny. Stephen Neitzke 2006. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ddleague-usa.net/" rel="nofollow">__http://www.ddleague-usa.net__</a>. “Under cover of their…illegally and unconstitutionally.”<br />
US referendums are modeled worldwide –CP creates a global precedent for direct democracy. David Magleby. 1994. Referendums around the world. “As with other forms of electioneering…campaign in the American states.”<br />
A precedent toward direct democracy prevents transition wars and democratic rollback. Ian Rourke et al, 1992, “Direct Democracy and International Politics.” “Whether or not Fukuyama is correct…referendums were held each year.”<br />
Global war and genocide – Gerome Scott and Walda Katz-Fishman, 10-26-04. Online at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://zmag.org/" rel="nofollow">zmag.org</a> . “When people talk about…liberation for humanity.”<br />

<br />
<strong>1NC:</strong><br />
<strong>Framework:</strong><br />
Contest over political proposals—instrumentally defend that the SC should<br />
Topic is defined by the following<br />
Resolved—attmpt to implement a plan<br />
USSC is highest supreme court in the US<br />
Aff violates—affirm as aphorism<br />
Aff undermines legal reformism<br />
Ground—we reorient the political, reinvigorate agency<br />
Deliberation about this preserves peace (Reagan 2k)<br />
Topical education—they skirt discussion about study of government<br />
Even if their intentions are noble—their politics causes facism (Lewis)<br />
This education is uniquely important because post-9/11 government will inevitably be violent—we need a way to engage it (Ignatieff 03)<br />
Extratopicality—they skirt the discussion of resolutions instrumental benefit, voting issue because we need T to get back to square one<br />
Limits—any person can come up with an idea of the ideal—explodes limits to the infinite<br />
Politics is the realm of the possible, not impossible. Need to set clear limits, they endorse the status quo. (shively 2k)<br />
Framework is a reason to vote negative—must use the ballot to regulate this activity (Shively 2k)<br />
Instrumental advocacy is key to supreme court decision-making—tie the ballot<br />
Their lack of specification of the grounds of decision is unique reason to vote—destroys legal advocacy.<br />
<br />
<strong>Counter-warrants:</strong><br />
If you want to affirm the resolution, do it:<br />
Affirming Milliken spreads racism<br />
Supreme Court structure of the law perpetuates racism (Fallon 93)<br />
The overrule in casey would be bad, allows state to control women (Graebber 99)<br />
Judicial review itself is itself bad—very undemocratic<br />
Impact is on the framework debate—collective peace<br />
<br />
<strong>Block:</strong><br />
Topicality is necessary to debate—we have to limit the meaning of words so we can have effective communication<br />
Garth Kemerling, 1997, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.philosophypages.com/lg/e05.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.philosophypages.com /lg/e05.htm__</a> “we’ve seen that sloppy…precising definition”<br />
Grammar is key to communication<br />
Brock Haussamen, 2002, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ncte.org/about/over/positions/category/gram/107646.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.ncte.org/about/over /positions/category/gram /107646.htm__</a> “Grammar is important because…grammatical patterns.”<br />
Instrumental focus is most descriptive of the court<br />
Richard Fallon, 2001, Implementing the Constitution, p 5 “Rather than picturing the Justices… institutions of government”<br />
Predictability is key to clash, which is necessary for political success<br />
Holly McCammon, 2004 Sociology Quarterly, 45:3, “But we argue as well…amplified when.”<br />
Ground is key to fair and productive debate over competing proposals<br />
Ruth Lessl Shively, 2000, Political Theory and partisan politics, p 182-3 “The point may seem trite…act of argumentation”<br />
This demonstrates that our interpretation promotes an ethic of political fairness<br />
Thomas A. Spragens, 2000, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p 82-3 “The first of these modalities… mutual predation”<br />
Instrumental policy debate encourages citizen education that prevents totalitarianism<br />
Dougles Torgerson, 199 “the promise of green politics” p 154-6 “One rationale for Arendts…green politics.”<br />
Creating limitless ways to affirm is uniquely bad because it makes clash impossible, which destroys competitive equity and neutralizes the value to debate—this accesses every impact because any political potential to debate is lost<br />
Ruth Lessl Shively, 2000, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p 180 “Thus far, I have argued…civility and democracy.”<br />
Ratifying a common starting point for debate is the only way for any productive discussion to occur<br />
Shively, 2000 p 181-2 “The requirements given thus far…agreement or harmony”<br />
We conceive of the ballot communicatively as a consensus decision in favor of better arguments—only this allows productive political discourse<br />
Mary Dietz, 2000, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p 121-3 “Jurgen Habermas has recently…sway participants.”<br />
Preserves a constant ethic of persuasion—prevents dissolution into violent or coercive monopolization of the discussion<br />
Shively, p 183, “Earlier we asked…rational persuasion.”<br />
Consensus can create common understanding<br />
Yale Ferguson, 2002, “IR and the ‘Third Debate’” “although there may be no such thing…to know”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Extinction is bad<br />
Outweighs their value to life claims<br />
<br />
<br />
2NR goes for the framework and counter-warrants arguments.<br />
Sets up 2 ways to vote negative:<br />
Within the aff’s framework, the neg accesses their impact claims.<br />
Within the neg’s interpretation, debate is good and has value, the neg solves all the impacts best.<br />

3. DISTINGUISH CP- INTERNAL NB- DISTINGUISHING QUIRIN PRESERVES LAW OF WAR<br />
<br />
<br />
Formal War 1NC – Terrorism<br />
<br />
Text: the United States Supreme Court should, distinguishing from Ex Parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942), hold that because Congress has not issued a formal declaration of war: (1) military commissions are not lawfully constituted and (2) detainees are not held in lawful custody for trial before a military commission because no cause has been shown for their detention.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Distinguishing solves the case and is the best way to interpret Quirin<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
David M. Brahms, former senior legal adviser to the Marine Corps, and James P. Cullen ‘6 former Chief Justice, Army Court of Appeals (Amicus Brief in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hamdanvrumsfeld.com/HamdanBrahmsCullenamicus.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.hamdanvrumsfeld.com/HamdanBrahmsCullenamicus.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The case involved admitted … military commission.<br />
<br />
2. This is especially true in the context of terrorism – the lack of a formal war declaration is uniquely important in evaluating Bush’s policies<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
University of Detroit Mercy Law Review ‘3 (80 U. Det. Mercy L. Rev. 231, COMMENT: With Liberty and Justice for All: The November 13, 2001 Military Order Allowing the Use of Military Tribunals to Try Those Suspected of Aiding Terrorists Violates the Rights Guaranteed to Non-Citizen United States Residents Under the Constitution, Kathleen M. McCarroll)<br />
<br />
Ex Parte Quirin does not justify … in a fact-distinguishable situation.<br />
<br />
Enforcing the laws of war strictly by upholding the distinction between lawful and unlawful combatants is necessary to sustain the laws of war more broadly<br />
<br />
JOSEPH P. Bialke ‘4 Lt. Col. USAF, J.D., Univ. North Dakota, Staff Judge Advocate, Pacific Air Forces-Australia (55 A.F. L. Rev. 1)<br />

However, adherence to the international … laws. This would be unacceptable<br />

2NC Distinguish Solves – Declaration Key<br />
<br />
1. Because Congress has not issued a formal declaration of war, the affirmative can be distinguished from Quirin – it solves the case and avoids overrule DAs<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Neal Katyal and Laurence Tribe ‘2 (111 Yale L.J. 1259, Waging War, Deciding Guilt: Trying the Military Tribunals0<br />
<br />
Our general argument is … means sufficient, requirement. 103<br />
<br />
2. The key issue in Quirin was the declaration of war – the case is irrelevant to the status quo<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Neal Katyal and Laurence Tribe ‘2 (111 Yale L.J. 1259, Waging War, Deciding Guilt: Trying the Military Tribunals0<br />
<br />
Despite language in President … on Article 82:<br />
<br />
3. Quirin relied heavily on the formal declaration of war – without it the case would have been decided the other way<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thomas Geraghty ‘2 (33 McGeorge L. Rev. 551)<br />
<br />
<br />
Quirin clearly … for the conduct of war.&quot; 356<br />
<br />
4. The formal declaration of war is key – without it, the UCMJ prevents ALL military tribunals<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Neal Katyal and Laurence Tribe ‘2 (111 Yale L.J. 1259, Waging War, Deciding Guilt: Trying the Military Tribunals0<br />
<br />
As we have noted, however, … review by an Article III court.<br />
<br />
The term enemy combatant is used by Bush differently from how it was used in Quirin – overrule isn’t key, since Bush uses a different concept<br />
<br />
Joanna Woolman ‘5, JD, University of San Francisco School of Law. “Enemy Combatants: The Legal Origins of the Term &quot;Enemy Combatant&quot; Do Not Support its Present Day Use,” 2005 7 J.L. &amp; Soc. Challenges 145<br />
<br />
Since September 11, 2001… roots in Quirin.<br />
<br />
Quirin isn’t key to the enemy combatant language – overrule isn’t necessary<br />
<br />

<br />
The historic use of the term … and potentially unconstitutional.<br />
<br />
<br />
Their reading of Quirin is flawed – the judges themselves thought they were limiting presidential war powers<br />
<br />
Marouf A. Hasian ‘3 Jr. (Associate Professor of Communication at the University of Utah Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 6.2 (2003) 233-260)<br />
<br />
One of the most fascinating … and selective reading of the case.<br />
<br />
Distinguishing solves – terrorists aren’t enemy combatants because they don’t follow the laws of war – Quirin is not applicable<br />
<br />
Michael H. Hoffman ‘2 American Red Cross Officer for International Humanitarian Law (34 Case W. Res. J. Int'l L. 227)<br />
<br />
The term unlawful combatant … as unlawful belligerents.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Maintaining a distinction between lawful and unlawful combatants is necessary to prevent civilian casualties during war<br />
<br />
JOSEPH P. Bialke ‘4 Lt. Col. USAF, J.D., Univ. North Dakota, Staff Judge Advocate, Pacific Air Forces-Australia (55 A.F. L. Rev. 1)<br />
<br />
Armed conflict places … for failing to do so<br />
<br />
2. The imperative to avoid civilian causalities is absolute – any chance in policy in which the direction favors killing civilians must be rejected<br />
<br />
Colm McKeogh ‘2 Senior Lecturer, Pol Sci and Public Policy, The University of Waikato (Innocent Civilians: the Morality of Killing in War p. 14-16)<br />
<br />
How absolute is the PNCI? … that is necessary to achieve the ad helium end.<br />
<br />
Quirin is key to the enforcement of the laws of war – elimination of that power would destroy the laws of war globally<br />
