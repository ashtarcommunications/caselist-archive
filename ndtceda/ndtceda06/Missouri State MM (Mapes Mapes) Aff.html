<strong>1AC:</strong><br />
CONTENTION ONE – WHAT’S AUTONOMY<br />
THE PRO-CHOICE IDEOLOGY THAT IS RAMPANT AS A RESULT OF UNITED STATES V. CASEY REPRESENTS A STRATEGY OF SEEKING TO AVOID THE WORST PARTS OF LIFE THROUGH EXPANDING THE MOVEMENT TO ESCAPE OUR COLLECTIVE GUILT. THIS FORM OF POLITICS RESULTS IN COMPLETE RELIANCE ON THE LAW FOR TOTAL ABSOLUTION<br />
The Balnibarbian Heresies<br />
J. Budziszewski (Department of Government at the University of Texas at Austin.) 94<br />
But in another sense,… post-Christian University is about.<br />
THIS NEED TO ESCAPE GUILT LOCKS US INTO A CYCLE OF GUILT – PUNISHMENT – AND THEN GUILT AGAIN WHICH CONSTITUTES THE BINARY LOGIC OF MODERN TIMES. ABORTIONS SERVE THE FUNCTION OF ENHANCING OUR LIVES INSOFAR AS WE AVOID FEELING GUILTY FOR THE CHOICE. ABORTION IS ROOTED IN A DESIRE FOR A WORLD THAT IS ALWAYS PLEASURABLE.<br />
ZUPANCIC 2K3 ALENKA THE SHORTEST SHADOW 54-60<br />
AUTONOMY AND MORALITY ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. THE ABORTION “RIGHTS” THEORY FOSTERS THE COLLAPSE OF EVERY SYSTEM OF MORALITY. THE ARGUMENT THAT RIGHTS ARE A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF LIFE IS BASED ON FLAWED THEORY. THE CHOICE TO HAVE AN ABORTION IS PRIMARILY BASED ON WHATEVER ARBITRARY VALUE IS ASSIGNED BY THE PERSON RECEIVING THE PROCEDURE. THIS LEADS TO FALSE COMPASSION AND A DANGEROUS FORM OF NIHILISM.<br />
Slouching Toward Infanticide Thomas S. Hibbs Natural Rights and the Right to Choose Hadley Arkes, Cambridge University Press, 288 pages, $28 Thomas S. Hibbs, professor of philosophy at Boston College, is the author of Shows About Nothing: Nihilism in Popular Culture from The Exorcist to Seinfeld (Spence, 2000).<br />
There are serious questions…. allows for their vivisection.<br />
ARGUMENTS ABOUT A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO ABORTION ARE CORRUPTED BY ENJOYMENT – ACADEMICS AND PRO-CHOICE ACTIVISTS DERIVE THEIR PRIMARY ENJOYMENT FROM REVELING IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY ARE IMPROVING SOCIETY. THEY REPRESS ANY THEORY DISPROVE THEIR WORLD VIEWS<br />
RAGLAND 96<br />
ABORTION RIGHTS PRE-DETERMINE WOMEN’S LIVES AND IS AN ORIGINAL FORM OF CONTROL THAT REQUIRES MEDICAL INTERVENTION TO MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING. THIS MAKES LIBERATION IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE BEST WE CAN DO IS ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR EXISTENCE. OUR AFFIRMATIVE REFUSES THIS NOTION OF STATE REGULATION OF BEING.<br />

Take, for example, the right to choose ….<br />
to liberate themselves. n83<br />
THE PLAN IS THE ACT OF GIVING UP CONTROL AND RELEASING OUR DESIRE TO CREATE A NEW AND IMPROVED BETTER WORLD. THE PLAN REQUIRES THAT THE CURRENT CONCEPTION OF RIGHTS, FREEDOM, AND AUTONOMY IN THE CONTEXT OF UNITED STATES V. CASEY BE IMMEDIATELY ABANDONED. IT REQUIRES US TO IGNORE POTENTIAL LIVES SAVED OR DEATH AVERTED. THIS GIVES WAY TO A NEW FORM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT IS NOT MEDIATED BY THESE CONCERNS.

<strong>Rd 1 – [S]MS MM v. Michigan FK</strong><br />
Missouri State MM<br />
<br />
<strong><u>1AC</u></strong><br />
<br />
The 1AC begins with a narrative about the fictional city of Omalas where everyone is happy because there is a child who is abused and lives alone in a basement room. They say that this is a metaphor for our world where we all are convinced that we have total happiness and follow whatever the government tells us to do. We ignore that suffering is a part of life and so we construct government policies so that we can go home and feel like we’ve avoided catastrophe. They read some evidence- it is cited below. The plan is to overrule Casey because of undue burden standards (I’ll type the full thing below) and they say that the plan is to affirm what abortion politics seeks to deny and stop death avoidance because it creates meaning outside of biology. They say that the plan is a way of recognizing and celebrating. They say that the affirm is a particular good that can be embraced even if it isn’t universally good.<br />
<br />
They say that they will defend the plan and they say that they should NOT win because they read a story. They will not claim an advantage outside of the court doing it.<br />
<br />
Plan: USSC should overrule decision in PP v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) on the grounds that the government may impose an undue burden on women seeking abortions.<br />
<br />
They read some pieces of Shapiro work and Zupancic work and Badiou stuff but none of it is clearly delineated cards. All supports the above arguments about fear in the SQ and how we can overcome that.<br />

Prefer how academics do stuff- every aff begs questions, they create a false dichotomy. They create bad ground. We allow debates about ethics. Ci: we must defend topical plan. Look at our advantages. No other critical affirmatives would work. Should be able to talk about methodology in terms of advantages. Their framework forces you to look at advantage to look at what works.<br />

PLAN: Don't have precise wording on me - basically, overrule PPvC by ruling that government regulation imposing an undue burden are constitutional.<br />
<br />
THE PRO-CHOICE IDEOLOGY THAT IS RAMPANT AS A RESULT OF UNITED STATE V. CASEY ENSURES THAT PREGNANCY CONTINUES TO BE TREATED AS A DISEASE IN NEED OF A MEDICAL CURE. THIS MANDATES THAT SCIENCE RATHER THAN THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN DIGNITY GOVERN OUR LIFE<br />

The usual response…given the situation<br />
<br />
THE NOTION THAT ABORTION IS A “WOMAN’S RIGHT” OR NECESSARY FOR “EQUALITY” IS PREMISED ON THE IDEA THAT TECHNOLOGICAL MANIPULATION IS A NECESSARY COMPONENET OF PERSONHOOD. THIS ARGUMENT APPEALS TO THE TRADITION OF WOMEN TO VIEW THEIR BODY AS DISGUSTING. THIS IS THE WORST FORM OF DEVALUATION BECAUSE IT LITERALLY TELLS WOMEN THAT IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO HAVE ABORTIONS THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO EXIST.<br />

<br />
ARGUMENTS ABOUT HOW PRO-LIFE ARGUMENTS SHOULD NOT HEARD OR DEBATERS WHO RUN THE ARGUMENTS SHOULD NOT BE TRAVELED ARE AKIN TO KICKING US OUT OF THE DEBATE CLUBHOUSE. THE ADVOCACY OF PREVENTING ABORTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY OTHER POLITICAL OR MORAL ADVOCACY.<br />
