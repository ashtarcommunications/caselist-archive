FRAMEWORK: (Aff and neg) (all Navy teams)<br />
The alternative utopia may promise the enjoyment of a universe absolved of uncertainty, but it is ultimately entrapped in the universe of self-fulfilling discourse. Slavoj Zizek 95. Philosopher and Psychoanalyst, Institute for Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana, ”LAW AND THE POSTMODERN MIND: SUPEREGO BY DEFAULT”, Cardozo Law Review, 16 Cardozo L. Rev. 925. Copyright (c) Yeshiva University 1995.<br />
&quot;Perhaps yet another ... never be rid of it&quot;<br />
<br />
The critical discourse’s use of terms; e.g. capitalism as anything undesirable and postmodern rhetoric or communism as perfection, divorces them from any real meaning. This tactic is used to deliberately obscure meaning.Orwell 46George Orwell, writer &amp; political activist, ‘Politics and the English Language’ First published: Horizon. — GB, London. — April 1946., available at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit" rel="nofollow">http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit</a><br />
&quot;Meaningless words ... bourgeois, equality.&quot;<br />
<br />
This method of speaking is used to defend The Indefensible: They can’t say “We favor the massive slaughter of the rich and other innocents in order to try a never worked utopian system because we feel that anything less than perfect equality is unacceptable” ­ That wouldn’t work. Hence they hide it, which corrupts thought and will be used to Normalize atrocities.Orwell 46George Orwell, writer &amp; political activist, ‘Politics and the English Language’ First published: Horizon. — GB, London. — April 1946., available at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit" rel="nofollow">http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit</a><br />

Turn: Calculability is critical to the ethical life of value. The advocacy of the affirmative must be rejected as a moral vacuum devoid of responsibility and compassion.Paul C. Santilli 03.

Plan Text<br />
The U.S. Supreme Court Should Rule That;<br />
1) Trial By Military Tribunals Violates The Fifth Amendment Requirement of Due Process,<br />
And that<br />
2) Where Access to the Courts is Available – No Person May Be Detained As An Enemy Combatant Unless the Government Shows, After Challenge By the Detainee, That the Government Has Reasonable Cause To Believe They Are An Enemy Combatant.<br />
<br />
We Argue that this would that this would Overrule the Decision in Ex Parte Quirin that “Lawful combatants are subject to capture and detention as prisoners of war by opposing military forces. Unlawful combatants are likewise subject to capture and detention, but in addition they are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals”<br />
