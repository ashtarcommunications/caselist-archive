Weber State CD v UTD RS<br />
Judged by Hardy Steele Galloway<br />
<strong><u>1AC</u></strong><br />
The notion of the atomized individual made explicit in Casey reinforces a state soteriology wherein salvation is only to be found in a society body of enemies. This religion of liberalism is inevitably totalitarian.<br />
Neuhaus 1996 (Richard “A strange new regime: The naked public square and the passing of the American Constitutional order”, Heritage)<br />
“this is most explicitly spelled out in the 1992…by the constitution”<br />
<br />
Plan: The USSC should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey 505 U.S. 833 (1992) by holding that individual liberty is not a constitutional right.<br />
<strong>Liberal Dem.</strong><br />
The individual liberty doctrine held in Casey obliterates any criterion for wrongness, making it impossible to oppose atrocity which paradoxically cripples the liberalism it attempts to uphold—meaning we are a pre-requisite for evaluating any of their impacts.<br />
Scaperlanda 2005 (Micheal A., 55 Cath. U.L. Rev. l/n)<br />
What are these anthropological assumptions…the human person<br />
<br />
And, participation in God and to one another is a threat to the liberal democratic state which relies on relation via formal mechanism of contract to ensure humanity in never unified. The contract system of liberalism turns war and violence into unifying mechanisms for social body.<br />
Cavanaugh 1999 (William, “Beyond secular parodies”, <em>Radical Orthodoxy</em>)<br />
The state mythos…one to another<br />
<br />
Demarcations are inevitable, every position has an enemy, but the defining feature of a law rooted in God is that all enemies fall under the same category of being. Only in a paradigm of liberal humanism can the conditions for the subhuman arise.<br />
Rasch 2003 (William, “Human rights as geopolitics”, cultural critique 54 muse)<br />
This passage attests to the antiliberal…liberal order<br />
<br />
<strong>Metaphysics</strong><br />
Obliteration of the individual liberty doctrine is key to accessing the transcendent.<br />
Peterson 2005 (Brent, “Eucharistic Ecclesiology: a community of joyful brokenness”, google)<br />
Is those who are called out of individual pursuits…of its reception<br />
<br />
Life is a gift, not a supreme political value. Plan is key to bear witness to the kingdom of heaven. Our hospitality children cannot be conditional; to welcome the other is to see the face of god.<br />
Hauerwas 1991 (Stanley, “Abortion, Theologically Uniderstood”, google)<br />
When many people start talking about abortion…do and believe<br />
<br />
Modern thought has reduced all being to epistemic consideration; the faith in nihilism destroys all meaning to life. The 1AC’s appeal to transcendence is critical to making human existence valuable.<br />
Cunningham 2002 (Conor <em>Genealogy of Nihilism</em>)<br />
What we may begin to realize … ‘nonoccurrence’ can occur<br />
<br />
<strong>The culture of death</strong><br />
The abortion right marks a culture of death that legitimizes all atrocity<br />
Fox-Genovese 2007 (Elizabeth, “How abortion has failed women”, google)<br />
Abortion begets and anchors… hard to imagine<br />
<br />
The totalitarian violence of abortion must be rejected at every instance—even if our strategy fails, we cannot negotiate compromise with human lives<br />
Budziszewski 1999 (“The Future of the End of Democracy”, First Things, google)<br />
The charge of absolutism involves a different… here and now<br />
<br />
You should act under the precautionary principle and treat the unborn as being alive.<br />

Roe v. Wade signaled the birth of an autonomous individual separated from unity<br />

<br />
This affirmative case has no plan text because the team says you cannot force action on the world before you right your own mind. The only way to do this is to recognize your own psychoses and this includes all of the paradoxes that exist within each of us. One member of the team acts psychotic while the other performs rational tasks. The 1AC consists of the 1A beginning with a constitutional law lecture and is interrupted by one of the voices in her head. All the while the 2A counts pennies and plays with a printing calculator. They recognize psychoses within debate. These come in the guises of performative contradictions, critical teams that call for the ballot, switch-side debate, delusions of being a policy maker, and playing by the rules while criticizing them. Or at least those are the only ones they point out. They claim a sort of homosexuality advantage. They do this by comparing coming out as a homosexual with coming out as a psychotic. And by making the step to actually admit that they are psychotic they say they are setting up ground for homosexuals who wish to admit who they truly are as well. This ground would be an area where they would be accepted, they wouldn't be met with violence, and they would not be forced into some sort of category where they would be other-ized. They also claim a subjectivity argument, saying before you can relate to others you must first understand yourself, and the only way to do this is to recognize and deal with the psychoses and paradoxes within yourself. They also will claim that they are more realist than many will admit, because they are dealing with a problem that is much more wide-spread than most would care acknowledge. They also claim to use poetic discourse which is a link out of language critiques. And they argue that they are going to help reclaim words such as fag. The role of the ballot is that they combine theory with practice and that should win them the round, and also that they are just straight-up beating you in debate terms. There are two types of schizophrenia or psychoses that they deal with and those are violent and productive. They say by recognizing the existence of our psychotic states we are able to fully participate in society and this detracts from the violent states of the psychotic and creates productive individuals. Their link to the topic is through experiential topicality, the 1A has a voice in her head that has been a victim of sexual abuse as is described in Morrison. This is also how they claim their link to homosexuality as the victim is a homosexual male.<br />

1. The Rehnquist Court planted precedent in Morrison.<br />
Johnson in 2003 (Jennifer R. &quot;Privileged Justice Under Law: Reinforcement of Male Privilege by the Federal Judiciary Through the Lens of the Violence Against Women Act and U.S. v. Morrison&quot; Santa Clara Law Review 2003)<br />
Citing similarities to the Lopez analysis, one commentator…Court characterizes the right at issue in anticipation of future cases.<br />

Now in 2006 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.now.org/issues/violence/stats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.now.org/issues/violence/stats.html</a> )<br />
Murder. Every day four women die in this country…three times more common than they were prior to 1988.<br />
<br />
2. Plan Text:<br />
On the next available test case, the United States Supreme Court should restore the remedy provided by § 13981 of the Violence Against Women Act by overruling the decision in U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) on 14th Amendment grounds.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc26"><a name="Morrison aff-3. Harms"></a>3. Harms</h2>
1. Morrison denies equal citizenship and creates a natural identity that relegates gender subordination to the private sphere.<br />
Resnik in 2002 (Judith &quot;Feminist Justice, at Home and Abroad&quot; 14 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism 393)<br />
<br />
In this volume dedicated to Women, Justice, and Authority…just as images of hulking women with broken columns, pitchers, and mirrors have retreated from view.<br />
<br />
2. Relegating gender violence to the private sphere leads to and lends credibility to a more militarized type of citizenship. Fighting this relegation is the initial step in changing the understandings of violence and security.<br />
Tickner in 1992 (&quot;Gender in International Relations&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner13.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner13.html</a>)<br />
Reexamining the Anarchy/Order Distinction…citizen-defender rather than warrior-patriot.<br />
<br />
3. Allowing the militarization of citizenship invites domination and violence. But through analysis of the relations of gender inequality and different forms of insecurity we can build a more sustainable form of politics.<br />
Tickner in 1992 (&quot;Gender in International Relations&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner16.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/tickner16.html</a>)<br />
In previous chapters I have argued that traditional notions…identity of others outside our own state.<br />
<br />
4. Rape is an attack on women as a class, it isn't a private matter.<br />
Chowdhury in 2002 (Rumna &quot;Kadic v. Karadzic – Rape as a Crime Against Women as a Class&quot; 20 Law &amp; Ineq. J. 91)<br />
The repercussions of rape for an individual woman…the crime is also not simply private, and therefore deserves public attention.<br />
<br />
4. Solvency:<br />
1. Only overruling Morrison gets rid of gender based violence and initiates the charges needed in our legal system.<br />
Weissman in 2001 (Deborah M. &quot;Gender-Based Violence as Judicial Anomaly&quot; 42 B.C.L. Rev. 1081)<br />
Any issue is considered and framed in accordance…gradually transforms the legal culture, with an attendant change in public values and concerns.<br />
<br />
2. Court decisions do alter social beliefs.<br />
Chowdhury in 2002 (Rumna &quot;Kadic v. Karadzic – Rape as a Crime Against Women as a Class&quot; 20 Law &amp; Ineq. J. 91)<br />
The judgment against Karadzic would be impossible if the proper…which is beginning to recognize that violence is never a private matter.
