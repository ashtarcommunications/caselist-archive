Berkeley BS – Round 4, Aff vs. Emory MP<br />
1AC:<br />
Contention One – Inherency:<br />
The Quirin decision lay dormant for six decades; now it has returned to the public sphere, its rhetorical force and the principles it symbolizes have been mobilized in the service of another war, one of infinite duration where anyone anywhere can instantly become an enemy at the word of the president. Despite Supreme Court decisions that have enhanced the rights of detainees, the underlying logic of Quirin remains unchallenged.<br />
Stewart Rhodes, 06 – “enemy combatant and the military commissions act,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.moreliberty.org/more_liberty/2006/11/enemy_combatant.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.moreliberty.org /more_liberty/2006/11/enemy _combatant.html__</a><br />
“As it turned out, it was Quirin…face –for ever”<br />
Contention Two – A Rhetorical Review:<br />
Contemporary debates about Quirin limit themselves to the abstract, formulistic rules it established. Our rhetorical review of the decision will put it back in context and examine the filtration of judicial intruge and perceived military necessity from Quirin to present.<br />
Marouf Hasian, 03 – “Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wartime Anxieties, and the Saboteurs’ Case,” Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 6(2): 233-260<br />
“Are there ever really times…legitimacy of these tribunals”<br />
At first glance, Quirin appears unproblematic because of the justices’ universal assent. Closer analysis reveals that Court Justices all had personal and institutional stakes in acquiescing to the show trials and executions of Nazi sabatoeurs in service of FDR’s war effort. Quirin wasn’t based on the rule of law; it was an exercise in judicial fiat.<br />
Belknap, 02 – 38 CAWLR 433<br />
“The Court also had trouble with…authorized to try al Qaeda terrorists”<br />
Context is critical here; in Quirin, the Court accepted the government’s argument from “military necessity” because it was duped, bullied, co-opted, and ultimately corrupted by the politics of world war 2. almost all the people associated with the case would come to regret their actions, but this fact has been erased from our memories and rarely appears in debates about quirin.<br />
Marouf Hasian, 03 – “Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wartime Anxieties, and the Saboteurs’ Case,” Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 6(2): 233-260<br />
“It could be argued that we now know…civil liberties and military necessities”<br />
Despite its problematic historical context, Quirin is the legal and theoretical lodestone for the current administration’s current war policies. Just as the outcome in quirin was predetermined by secret decisions, so the outcome of our national dialogue about terrorism was pre-determined – in both cases, extreme cruelty and violence were rendered inevitable. Quirin is both a legal and rhetorical precedent<br />
Paul Alexander, 06 – Culture, society, and praxis 5 (1)<br />
“’Establishing ‘enemy combatant’ as political rhetoric’…whether justice is being served”<br />
The rhetorical gesture to WW2 establishes a moral equivalence based on the need for clear and immediate response. Reference to Quirin eliminates the need for political debate and personal reflection – it pushes us back into WW2, a morally unambiguous struggle with a monolithic threat that requires no new ethical judgments<br />
Marouf Hasian, 03 – “Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wartime Anxieties, and the Saboteurs’ Case,” Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 6(2): 233-260<br />
“When American presidents…World War II saboteurs”<br />
“Military necessity” is the key concept underlying contemporary analyses of Quirin. Based in an uncritical analytic framework that decontextualizes decisions and uncritically accepts fundamental concepts as apolitical and neutral, it emphasizes meaningless procedure over constitutive rhetoric and consistently contributes to repression.<br />
Marouf Hasian, 05 – <em>In the name of necessity: military tribunals and the loss of American civil liberties</em>, p. 11-2<br />
“From a critical rhetorical…due American presidents.”<br />
The Court’s communicative function has ensured that the Quirin’s underpinnings have filtered throughout society, implicating contexts beyond military tribunals convened in 1942. the Court is the most powerful interpretive institution participating in social dialoge; its decisions enshrine certain values throughout society. Focus on quirin’s implications as legal precedent – as opposed to rhetorical artifact – blinds us to injustice and disables resistance<br />
Santos, 99 – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.library.unt.edu/theses/open/19993/santos_belvin/thesis.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://www.library.unt.edu /theses/open/19993/santos _belvin/thesis.pdf__</a><br />
“The supreme court of the united states…see in Roe vs. Wade”<br />
Rhetorically, advancing the interests of the rule of law” disempowers the powerless, marginalizes opposition, and upholds status quo injustice. Pedagogically, it destroys agency.<br />
Gerald Wetlaufer, 90 – “Rhetoric and Its Denial in Legal Dicourse,” 76 Va. L. Rev. 1545<br />
“The rhetoric of law may also…effective human beings”<br />
Here the drive to exclude the court from detention policy is merely the most obvious component of a strategy that frames criticism, questioning and judicious inquiry with disloyalty in the face of an unrelenting enemy. Society is slowly being terrorized into complete submission.<br />
Elmer and Opel, 06 – “Surviving the Inevitable future,” Cultural Studies, 20(4-5): 477-492)<br />
“In the lead up to the presidential…may be our very own”<br />
Our reaction to a complex 21st century is rooted in a reference to an imagined and distorted history, we have assigned a purely negative identity to the figure of the enemy; the Nazis at least had a state, and an agenda, they were comprehensible to us – now that our counter-Nazi tools are being applied to people without a legitimate politics, the most extreme forms of violence can be justified – our targets are unworthy of rights because they are quintessentially subhuman<br />
Butler, 02 – “Guantanamo Limbo,” The Nation<br />
“Since we are already outside…by definition, illegitimate”<br />
In the face of an inhuman enemy with purely destructive aims, any response is justified – there is no stopping point once apocalypse has become personified – this is how genocide begins<br />
Peter Coviello, 2000 – Apocalypse from now on<br />
“Perhaps. But to claim…can scarcely be done without”<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin, holding that military tribunals for the purpose of the trial of unlawful belligerents violate Constitutional guarantees of due process.<br />
Contention Three – Solvency:<br />
Ultimately, affirmation cannot “solve” the ethical and political dilemmas inherent in US war and detention policies; instead, voting aff should be seen as the judge’s response to the rhetorical artifact that is the quirin decision, an artifact that has come to dictate the course of our politics simply because of its status as “tradition,” or precedent<br />
Geoffrey Klinger, 94 – “law as communicative praxis: toward a rhetorical jurisprudence,” argumentation and advocacy, 30 (4), ebsco<br />
“The theory of rhetoric…their medieval and modern slumber”<br />
Voting Affirmative enacts a politics that instantiates a super Supreme Court that engages in dialogue with political institutions in response to injustice – our aff renders the call of an apolitical, historical “necessity” discourse an insufficient basis for the war on terrorism and forces us to ethically re-engage as a body politic<br />
Jack wade nowlin, 2 – notre dame l. rev. 171<br />
“As Justice Jackson’s remarks suggest…a large number of readers”<br />
The ballot serves the function of symbolic response and criticism – a gesture that combats the state’s reappropriation of memory – only the ballot can mark the traumatic excesses of state power and enable productive activism<br />
Edkins, 99 – poststructuralism and international relations: bringing the political back in<br />
“It should be noted that...lulled into forgetfulness”<br />
The fact that our affirmative prioritizes issue of language over institutional politics does not mean that institutions are irrelevant – the contrary, we affirm the deployment of sovereignty as a call to ethics<br />
Michaelson, 04 – “beyond and before the law at guantanamo,” peace review 16:3<br />
“The act of sovereignty…and he [it] is us”<br />
Only an appeal to the constitution can serve a productive rhetorical and institutional politics. Our constitution is the bedrock of our body politic – announcing that it is open to revision and reinterpretation enables transformative social change.<br />
Solum, 89 – “Originalism as Transformative Politics,” 63 Tul. L. Rev. 1599<br />
“Michael Perry defends what he calls…linchpin of a transformative politics”<br />
Calling upon the congress does not solve.<br />
Stewart Rhodes, 06 – “solving the puzzle of ‘enemy combatant’ status”<br />
“the passage of congressional legislation…some manner or a scheme of”<br />
Paradoxically, the attempt to build an analogical relationship between our struggle with the Nazis and the war we are currently fighting dooms us to failure as surely as it authorizes hideous acts of violence – we wish 9/11 were pearl harbor, so we could fight a hostile state to the death with modern weapons. Instead we find ourselves referencing our history in a struggle with non-state ways of being that thrive on the violence we inflict upon them, a war that by its very nature is unwinnable and without end<br />
Vlahos, 07 – “the fall of modernity,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amconmag.com/2007/2007_02_12/feature.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.amconmag.com/2007 /2007_02_12/feature.html__</a><br />
“The Great Muslim War…this is finished”<br />
Admittedly, the federal government as constituted is unlikely to respond to the plan – this objection misses the point. Precisely because the federal government will not accept the institutional politics of the plan, refusing quirin is essential. Ironically, legality becomes an effective tool of opposition because the state has cloaked its violence in the rhetoric of law enforcement.<br />
Dellinger, 06 – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://slate.com/id/2144476/entry/2144825" rel="nofollow">__http://slate.com/id/2144476 /entry/2144825__</a><br />

AT: Immigration:<br />
Turn – legal formalism – understanding the law as something which can be opportunistically traded cements the narrative of “military necessity” – Hasian – their framing destroys effective solutions.<br />

Quirin, The Nearly Forgotten Constitutional Ticking Time Bomb<br />
Justice Jackson, in his famous …human face --for ever.&quot;<br />

However, these issues …… May I see your papers, please?<br />

Conclusion<br />
In the lead up … may be our very own.<br />
<br />
It is precisely this narrative of national security at all costs which makes the abuse of detainees inevitable.<br />
Donald E. Pease, Avalon Foundation Chair of the Humanities at Dartmouth College, Fall 2003, The Global Homeland State: Bush’s Biopolitical Settlement, Boundary 2 30:3, Project Muse<br />
The detention camps erected at Guantanamo Bay … ‘‘persons of interest.’’<br />

There is no limit to the violence which becomes possible once the state has harnessed the threat of apocalypse<br />
Peter Coviello 2000—Peter, assistant professor of English at Bowdoin College, Apocalypse &gt;From Now On<br />
Perhaps. But to claim … can scarcely be done without.<br />

All security is interconnected—only a focus on human security issues can provide any realistic means towards combating international conflict in its many manifestations.<br />
Dan Caldwell and Robert E. Williams, Distinguished Professor of Political Science and Associate Professor of Political Science both at Pepperdine University, 2006, Seeking Security in an Insecure World, pg 183-193<br />
Shifting the focus, even partially, … approaches of the past.<br />
<br />

<br />
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE ITS DECISION IN EX PARTE QUIRIN, HOLDING THAT DETENTION WITHOUT CHARGE VIOLATES CONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS GUANRANTEES AND THAT MILITARY TRIBUNALS VIOLATE CONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS GUANRANTEES.<br />
<br />
That is a paraphrase…ill send the real text when I next get my tubs (im at home)<br />

Court action is necessary to vindicate the rule of law internationally. Bush won’t stay within congressional limits.<br />

The court flat-out rejected … republic on track.<br />
<br />
Congressional approval is not good enough—only the Court can preserve respect for the Constitution.<br />

Political consequences cannot be a concern for the Court—only the prioritization of justice can preserve the ideals upon which the document rests.<br />
Justice George Sutherland, United States Supreme Court Justice, 1937<br />

In the context of Guantanamo, sovereignty must be torqued against itself in the name of justice.<br />
Michaelsen, Co-Editor of the Centennial Review, and Shershow, Associate Professor of English at Miami University, 2004, Beyond and Before the Law at Guantánamo, Peace Review 16:3<br />
The act of sovereignty that … &quot;we have met the enemy and he [it] is us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The symbolic gesture which is the act of overruling is a performative act which combats the state’s reappropriation of memory—only voting affirmative can mark the traumatic excesses of state power and make possible a genuine politics of resistance.<br />
Jenny Edkins, Senior Lecturer in International Politics at the University of Wales Aberystwyth, Postructuralism and International Relations: Bringing the Political Back In, 1999, p. 142<br />
It should be noted that … lulled into forgetfulness.<br />
