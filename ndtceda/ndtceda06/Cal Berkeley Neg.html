TEXT: The United States Congress should pass legislation establishing that all individuals detained by United States military, intelligence community or law enforcement authorities and considered to be unlawful combatants accused of violating the laws of war should not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the 5th and 6th amendments to the United States Constitution and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. To enforce this legislation the Congress should create stringent oversight requirements. The Supreme Court of the United States should apply its ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld to this legislation, stating that the Court’s rulingi n Hamdan resolved the issues raised by the Administration’s arguments regarding Ex Parte Quirin and that the new legislation is consistent with its previous decision and furthermore that this Congressional determination of the rights of detainees is to be considered dispositive, final, and beyond judicial scrutiny.<br />
<br />
<br />

We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
The CP solves the entire case – Hamdan opens the door to Congressional action and is specifically deferential to Congressional determinations of detainee status – also, we solve any argument about the application of Quirin<br />

CONGRESS CP 1NC<br />
<br />
TEXT: The United States Congress should pass legislation establishing that all individuals detained by United States military, intelligence community or law enforcement authorities and considered to be unlawful combatants accused of violating the laws of war should not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the 5th and 6th amendments to the United States Constitution and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. To enforce this legislation the Congress should create stringent oversight requirements. The Supreme Court of the United States should apply its ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld to this legislation, stating that the Court’s rulingi n Hamdan resolved the issues raised by the Administration’s arguments regarding Ex Parte Quirin and that the new legislation is consistent with its previous decision and furthermore that this Congressional determination of the rights of detainees is to be considered dispositive, final, and beyond judicial scrutiny.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
The CP solves the entire case – Hamdan opens the door to Congressional action and is specifically deferential to Congressional determinations of detainee status – also, we solve any argument about the application of Quirin<br />

C. Framing the Issue<br />
The Civil Remedy approach is a powerful medium for communicating equality and shifting social norms of individual and officials – it will change the cultural frame of reference and it will allow women to assert their cause in a collective fashion<br />

Civil rights claims are …task of responding to such violence.<br />

D. The localization of violence<br />
The Morrison decision unites the private and the local, treating violence within the home as outside of its power – the focus on violence against women as a local problem allows gender violence to continue unimpeded.<br />
MacKinnon, Professor of Law at Michigan Law, 2000<br />
[Catherine. “Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison” Harvard Law Review<br />

Gender violence prevents the self-actualization of life – it is a form of spirit injury that destroys the value to life of the entire community<br />
WING, Pf Law @ Iowa, 97 (Adrien Katherine, Albany Law Review, 60 Alb. L. Rev. 943)<br />

<strong>Violence K</strong><br />
<strong>First, understanding violence as something that happens “out there,” and is perpetrated by heads of state or armies, is the first step to forgetting our own responsibility for the many expressions of violence in the world. Questions about what the government should do erase questions about what we should do, and ensure that violence continues while we wallow in our powerlessness.</strong><br />
Susanne <strong>Kappeler</strong>, Associate Prof @ Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior, 19<strong>95</strong>, pg. 10-11<br />
‘We are the war’ - <u>of war and violence.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>Second, attempts to explain violence in abstract and formulaic terms shield individuals from any responsibility for their actions. The 1AC’s argument that _</strong> <strong>is an example of this. Describing violence as the inevitable result of a chain of events naturalizes it and washes the hands of those who actually decide to commit acts of violence.</strong><br />
Susanne <strong>Kappeler</strong>, Associate Prof @ Al-Akhawayn University, <u>The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior</u>, 19<strong>95</strong>, pg 14<br />
Scientific discourse- complicated set of causes.<br />
<br />
<strong>Third, the solutions the affirmative proposes rely on imagining an ordered world, united under the banner of American leadership and security. This project of ordering the world is inherently violent. It requires that the architects of the world be given the freedom to use violence and to determine when violence ought to be used. The empirical record demonstrates that this freedom can only result in suffering.</strong><br />
Jayan <strong>Nayar</strong>, Law Student at the University of Warwick, <u>Re-Framing International Law for the 21st Century: Orders of Inhumanity</u>, 9 Transnational Law &amp; Contemporary Problems 599, Fall 19<strong>99</strong>, ln<br />
<strong><u>The period since - order to be violent!</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>There are two distinct impacts to our position:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The first is that the affirmative’s explanations of violence can never produce positive change. Understanding violence as an aberration, or as an event that occurs outside of the sphere of our personal influence, guarantees our complicity with continued violent world orderings.</strong><br />
Susanne <strong>Kappeler</strong>, Associate Prof @ Al-Akhawayn University, <u>The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior</u>, 19<strong>95</strong>, pg 8-9<br />
<u><strong>Violence</strong> – what we - <strong>permit them to happen</strong>.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>Second, the affirmative’s depictions of violence are not simply inadequate; they are in and of themselves violent. By overshadowing individual responsibility for violence, the affirmative enacts a form of ideological violence that weaves violence into the very fabric of our society and consciousness.</strong><br />
Susanne <strong>Kappeler</strong>, Associate Prof @ Al-Akhawayn University, <u>The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior</u>, 19<strong>95</strong>, pg. 6-7<br />
This means engaging - refusing to fight back.<br />
<br />
<strong>Violence can never constitute an effective act of resistance to violence. Rather, acts of violence, however well-meaning, reaffirm the principle of violence and make us directly complicit with the violence we seek to prevent.</strong><br />
Susanne <strong>Kappeler</strong>, Associate Prof @ Al-Akhawayn University, <u>The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior</u>, 19<strong>95</strong>, pg. 258<br />
<u><strong>Resistance</strong> to violence - <strong>not to use violence ourselves.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<strong>We have an alternative. The text to it is that we should begin our interrogations of violence with a local refusal to endorse the violence of the affirmative. We should become peace by refusing the affirmative.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Our alternative of local analysis is the only way to understand our own complicity in the production of violent world orders. It politicizes the way we think, and hence opens a space for understanding the will to violence that traditional analyses of what we ought to do cannot.</strong><br />
Susanne <strong>Kappeler</strong>, Associate Prof @ Al-Akhawayn University, <u>The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior</u>, 19<strong>95</strong>, pg. 258<br />
<u><strong>If we</strong> nevertheless <strong>- non-violent society.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<strong>Additionally, our criticism is a prerequisite to the types of interrogations initiate by the affirmative. Seeking out the ways that we are connected to violence must precede discussions of global transformation.</strong><br />
Jayan <strong>Nayar</strong>, Law Student at the University of Warwick, <u>Re-Framing International Law for the 21st Century: Orders of Inhumanity</u>, 9 Transnational Law &amp; Contemporary Problems 599, Fall 19<strong>99</strong>, ln<br />
The description of the - the &quot;technologies&quot; of ordering.<br />
<br />
<strong>The constant search to propose good ideas, to act in the world, and to do something is exactly how we prevent ourselves from accepting our responsibility for the world. Refusal of the affirmative is the first step towards articulating a new emancipatory imagination, actually capable of dealing with their case harms.</strong><br />

<strong>The strategies of biopower make necessary and possible the worst violence in history. By pledging our identities towards the preservation of life, we have commited to a genocidal mentality that kills to save. Nuclear annihilation is inevitable due to the state’s need to cause massive destruction in order to preserve the health of its population. Only through an aesthetics of resistance—questioning and criticizing the norms which have invented and produced our identity—can we open up space for liberation and subvert the violent hegemony of disciplinary power.</strong><br />

Our broader negative strategy must be considered as a syntactical practice of democratic undecidability. Envisioning an imaginary policy process breaks down hegemonic discourses<br />
Norval, Journal of Political Ideology, 2004, Vol. 9<br />
Several implications follow from a focus…. decidability is suspended.<br />

Research we’ve put into investigating instrumental effects of the plan and counterplans are fundamental to a democratic responsibility by providing the context to the decision<br />
Norval<br />
Undecidability and responsibility I have alluded… need further elaboration.<br />

Net benefit – responsibility<br />
Undecidable decisionmaking key to finite responsibility – our strategy is the minimal required delimitation for democratic subjectivity<br />

Given this, I would argue that… account of democracy to come.<br />

CP embraces undecidability as a democratic ethos which stands counter to the plan’s antagonism. Outweighs the case – differentiating others is key to responsibility<br />

The United States Congress should pass school desegregation legislation requiring school districts to participate in educational integration plans in cases of de jure and de facto segregation. These mandates should include: comprehensive application to all school districts, inter-district remedies, special focus on kindergarten and elementary school, application to intra-school segregation. Funding and enforcement provided. Federal education funding to the states should be conditioned upon local and state level implementation of these mandates as well the following : prohibit exclusionary zoning, require comprehensive planning and provide for dedicated enforcement of land use policy, use urban growth boundaries to reduce sprawl and promote infill, adopt proactive policies to prevent displacement, link affordable housing with public transportation, adopt inclusionary housing policies, promote positive integration measures, effectively site subsidized housing, and enforce and strengthen laws prohibiting discrimination in housing markets.<br />

Roberts Overview:<br />
--Douglas – global rule of law critical to enduring peace. Accesses all aff crisis rhetoric – rule of law critical to reconceptualize peace. Independent judiciary is necessary to stop ideological politics.<br />
--Fiating social imaginary means the CP solves the case.<br />
--Representations good because they can change the actual policy. Instrumentality turns Dillon.<br />
--Prevents understanding and looking at consequences.<br />

Independent judiciary necessary internationally – the actual content of laws is not necessary, all that matters is structure<br />
