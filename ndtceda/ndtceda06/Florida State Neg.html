GSU Pre-Tournament Disclosure<br />
FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY<br />
<br />
Obs. 1: The world we live in<br />
<br />
As a response to a perceived threat the United States will use military strikes against Iran<br />
The Economist, February 10th, 2007<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should constructively engage Iran by offering a security guarantee that the United States will not participate in our support any military strikes against Iran.<br />
<br />
Observation II: A slave to the game<br />
<br />
The United States attempt to halt the development of Iranian nuclear technology is a tool of imperialist domination.<br />
Rozeff 06 (Michael, January) <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lewrockell.com/rozeff/rozeff62.htm" rel="nofollow">Http://www.lewrockell.com/rozeff/rozeff62.htm</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stopping Iran’s uranium enrichment program makes Iran a slave to United States usury by making Iran dependent on American energy.<br />
LA Times 06 (October 15, Alissa Rubin) <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dissidentnews.wordpress.com/2006/10/20/a-new-global-nuclear-order-los-angeles-times/" rel="nofollow">http://dissidentnews.wordpress.com/2006/10/20/a-new-global-nuclear-order-los-angeles-times/</a><br />

This example of neocolonialism descends Iranian life into domination and submission<br />
Aime Cesaire, columnist: Monthly review press 1994<br />
Colonial discourse and Post-colonial theory<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation III: Fire Dance<br />
<br />
An American attack on the nation of Iran would involve bunker buster weapons which would serve to blur the distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons- killing hundreds of thousands of people.<br />
Feinstein 06<br />
Dianne, US senator, LA TIMES, Confronting Iran<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://feinstein.senate.gov/06speeches/iran0415-oped.htm" rel="nofollow">http://feinstein.senate.gov/06speeches/iran0415-oped.htm</a><br />
<br />
The nuclear firebreak is key to stopping a nuclear war, while it is in place there is no risk, without it nuclear escalation becomes inevitable.<br />
Schwartz and Derber 1991<br />
(Harvard Nuclear Study Group 1991 (the nuclear seduction) pg.35)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation IV: The crazy giant<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
America is sick with Super power syndrome. An illness where it seeks to control the world through domination yet paradoxically has an intense fear of vulnerability. America’s policy towards Iranian nuclear program is Super Power Syndrome to the fullest where the US feels that it has the right to decide which technology Iran deserves because of America’s intense fear of competition on the world stage.<br />
<br />
Lifton, Robert Jay. 2003 Super Power Syndrome (Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical College)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to maintain Super Power Syndrome the US will eliminate the vulnerability perpetuated by Iran.<br />
Lifton, Robert Jay. 2003 Super Power Syndrome (Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical College)<br />
<br />
<br />
Our nuclear dominance represented by our relations with Iran is representative of Super Power Syndrome. The US will take all actions necessary to remain the only nuclear super power and comes to be grouped with a fear and eradication of terrorism.<br />
<br />
Lifton, Robert Jay. 2003 Super Power Syndrome (Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical College)<br />
<br />
<br />
The militarized “War on Terror” justifies endless violence<br />
<br />
Lifton, Robert Jay. 2003 Super Power Syndrome (Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical College)<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan is a realization that Iran could become a rival nation. This act is key to stepping off of the treadmill of death and apocalyptic violence.<br />
<br />
Lifton, Robert Jay. 2003 Super Power Syndrome (Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical College)<br />
<br />
<br />
The notion that Iran will build a nuclear weapon is unfounded. It goes against their political and religious beliefs, the Iran-Iraq war proves.<br />
<br />
Collier 2003 (Robert, 0ct 31) Chronicle Staff Writer, Nuclear weapons unholy, Iran says Islam forbid use, clerics problem SanFran Chronicle<br />

GSU Round 1<br />
Aff: Iran strikes<br />
Judge: Kristie Cramer<br />
<br />
Plan text: The USFG should constructively engage the country of Iran by guaranteeing that the US will not participate or support any military strikes against Iran.<br />
<br />
Case outline:<br />
1) The Crazy Giant --&gt; US has &quot;superpower syndrome&quot; - need to crush potential threats. Impact = war with Iran.<br />
2) A slave to the game - US trying to halt development of Iranian texh so they'll be dependent on us. Impact = neocolonialism<br />
3) Firedance - War w/ Iran will happen - we'll use bunker buster. This blurs the line between conventional weapons and nuclear ones. Busts up the FIREBREAK. Leads to lots of nuclear war.<br />
<br />
<strong>GSU Round 8: Aff vs. Emory DG (Scott Dinner &amp; Vlad Golgotiu)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1AC</strong> is same as pre-tournament disclosure<br />
<br />
<strong>2AC Strategy</strong><br />
Iran isn’t nuclearizing (security K-ish)<br />
<br />
We’ll never avoid the possibility of extinction unless we break the nuclear weapons taboo by using low yield bunker busters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
V<strong>andy Round 3: Aff vs. Kentucky CG (Charlie Cavalier &amp; Sohin Gautam)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1AC:</strong> Same as pre-tournament disclosure<br />
<br />
<strong>1NC Arguments:</strong><br />
ASPEC<br />
T-Quid Pro Quo<br />
Consult Japan<br />
Politics [no longer running, was armenian genocide bill, but we've kicked it, however it will be disclosed fully on one of the other teams disclosure]<br />
realism good as an off case<br />
Case:<br />
No strikes Now<br />
Iran says no<br />
<br />
<strong>2AC Tricks/Add-Ons</strong><br />
The 2ac was very straightforward, however they read a piece of Lipschultz evidence on politics about constructing threats being bad.<br />
<br />
On topicality, they read a piece of Haass &amp; O'Sullivan evidence which argues Constructive Engagement isn't Quid Pro Quo and indicts Crocker.<br />
<br />
1AR is theory heavy<br />
<br />
<strong>2NR Strategy</strong><br />
Consult Japan<br />
<br />
<strong>2AR Strategy</strong><br />
Conditionality bad and perm do both, normal means.
