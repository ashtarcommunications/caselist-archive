LEGITIMACY<br />
Legitimacy high – Neubauer and Meinhold 2006 “the public often…in the world.”<br />
<br />
Supreme Court overrule of precedent undermines its legitimacy and the rule of law – Van Geel “Understanding Supreme Court Opinions” 2007 “Yet the Court…to serious reconsideration.”<br />
<br />
Rule of Law/value of democracy has helped avert four times all this century’s battle deaths in all its domestic/international wars<br />
Rummel The Rule of Law: Towards Eliminating War and Democide October 10-11, 1991 “Today, we can…..and mass murder.”<br />
<br />
Legitimacy key to compliance – facilitates the ability of the Court to cause legal/political change<br />
Hansford and Spriggs “The Politics of Precedent on the US Supreme Court” 2006 pgs 19-20 “Judges promote legitimacy…..strength of the judiciary.”<br />
<br />
CULTURAL EQUAL PROTECTION CP<br />
<br />
CP Text: The United States Supreme Court should rule that laws may not be made based on race. The Court should also recognize a strict scrutiny standard for laws which discriminate on the basis of culture and also nullify local control over these objectives.<br />
<br />
The CP solves the case and avoids the K<br />
First, we solve “racism.” Reliance on Equal Protection doctrine on biological notions of race is the last gasp of White Supremacy – the Courty should instead recognize the importance of cultural diversity.<br />
Ramirez – Michigan Journal of Race and Law, Fall 2001<br />
“Still, merely showing….as a general proposition.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Equal Protection Clause should be reevaluated to include culture. This ends the focus on biological race.<br />
Ramirez – Michigan Journal of Race and Law, Fall 2001<br />
“Finally, the Court…must be eliminated.”<br />
<br />
2NC LINKS<br />
Emphasis on cultural diversity solves better – rather than relying on race as the basis for policy, we should encourage cultural interaction which prevents racism and domination.<br />
Ramirez – Michigan Journal of Race and Law, Fall 2001 “Cultural insights, understandings….as recent genetic learning.”<br />
<br />
Culture is a better lens than race through which to view societal discrimination. This does not preclude the Court from addressing racism, but prevents the use of natural categories in fighting injustice.<br />
Ramirez – Michigan Journal of Race and Law, Fall 2001 “Culture is different…..perspectives, insights, and skills.”<br />
<br />
K SOLVES THE AFF 2NC<br />
Emphasis on cultural diversity helps historically disadvantaged groups,<br />
Ramirez – Michigan Journal of Race and Law, Fall 2001<br />
“this does not…..about cultural diversity.”<br />
<br />
Emphasis on cultural diversity rather than racial diversity better solves the aff<br />
Ramirez – Michigan Journal of Race and Law, Fall 2001 “Recent affirmative action…culturally polylithic environment.”<br />
<br />
AT: PERM 2NC<br />
There is no way to have race based laws that engage race as a cultural rather than a biological construct. We should abandon the notion of race in law.<br />
Ramirez – Michigan Journal of Race and Law, Fall 2001 “A foundational element…racial discrimination prohibitions.”<br />
<br />
RACE K 1NC<br />
<br />
The affirmative is founded on a myth – the myth of biological race. In determining who should make up a particular classroom, the Court relies on skin color and other racial markers. This strategy is rooted in historical racism and racial Darwinism. Ramirez – Michigan Journal of Race and Law, Fall 2001 “Race does function,…in Ozawa and Thind.”<br />
<br />
The division of the world into biological races, particularly black and white, inevitable devolves into racism. The alternative is deconstruction of the notion of biological race.<br />
D. Marvin Jones, 1993, Georgetown Law Journal<br />
“According to Jacques Derrida…and implicit in each other.”<br />

<br />
Counter-Advocacy<br />
<br />
We believe that in order to begin a process of appropriation the<br />
CEDA/NDT community should increase the representation of<br />
underrepresented groups in intercollegiate debate, and leave open the<br />
space for the use of:<br />
<br />
1) Reliance on traditional authors.<br />
<br />
2) The flow to help map out and organize arguments coherently without<br />
having to let it rule debate, or without creating the domination of<br />
debate through break-neck speed.<br />
<br />
3) The transfer of responsibility specifically couched in the rhetoric<br />
of government obligation and resisting state violence, we are not saying<br />
that we should wash our hands of responsibility - but that we should<br />
look to the State as an important entity.<br />
<br />
4) The assumption of fiat helps individuals discuss what they think is<br />
ideal and important in the realm of State politics.<br />
<br />
We present the following advocacy:<br />
<br />
*We believe that in order to begin a process of appropriation of this<br />
activity that the CEDA/NDT community should increase the representation<br />
of underrepresented groups in intercollegiate debate by encouraging the<br />
development and acceptance of many different styles of engaging the topic. *<br />
<br />
Our advocacy is beneficial for a couple of reasons:<br />
<br />
First, our advocacy strives to ensure that equality and acceptance<br />
become founding principals of debate. We think that the best way to<br />
achieve this is not to debate over which styles are intrinsically<br />
“better” or “worse” for underrepresented groups, but rather to encourage<br />
an ethic of argumentative tolerance that transcends the boundaries and<br />
limitations that particular groups seek to place on debate.<br />
<br />
Second, you can think of our advocacy as inclusive of Towson’s, but<br />
without the baggage of having to shut down political spaces and debate<br />
practices that are deemed to be “intrinsically incompatible” with the<br />
purpose of furthering tolerance. Our advocacy doesn’t jettison any<br />
component of debate, and instead prefers to leave open the spaces of<br />
political activism that Towson’s advocacy eliminates, like engagement<br />
with the State or certain debate-related practices like evidence focus.<br />
Any attempt to “do both” Towson and Michigan’s advocacies would be<br />
incompatible and fail because Towson’s advocacy starts with the argument<br />
that we should throw out certain practices – we say that there should<br />
<em>/never</em>/ be a point where we make the decision to simply exclude a<br />
component of debate.<br />
<br />
Third, we also choose not to look to overruling <em>/Milliken</em>/ as the<br />
appropriate metaphor for this debate, and we provide disadvantages to<br />
doing so.<br />
<br />
Milliken Bad DA<br />
<br />
Forced desegregation is based on the racist assumption that Black<br />
children cannot learn if surrounded by other black children.<br />
Desegregation destroys the greatest resource the African-American<br />
communities: their schools.<br />
Sheldon Richman, August 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0408b.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0408b.asp</a>.<br />
“In Brown the unanimous…we lost our schools.”<br />
<br />
Desegregation destroys black teachers – gets them to lose their jobs<br />
Edgar G. Epps, 1999,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.urbanedjournal.org/archive/Issue%201/FeatureArticles/article0003/html" rel="nofollow">www.urbanedjournal.org/archive/Issue%201/FeatureArticles/article0003/html</a><br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.urbanedjournal.org/archive/Issue%201/FeatureArticles/article0003/html" rel="nofollow">&lt;http://www.urbanedjournal.org/archive/Issue%201/FeatureArticles/article0003/html&gt;</a><br />
“Finally, let’s look at the…is even lower.”<br />
<br />
If we win our arguments about why <em>/Milliken</em>/ and forced desegregation<br />
are bad then we have proven that your metaphor is a bankrupt one that<br />
ultimately falls flat – you would then vote negative since our advocacy<br />
doesn’t use <em>/Milliken</em>/.<br />
<br />
The metaphor should extend to your overall project – forced<br />
desegregation is bad in the context of schools precisely for the same<br />
reason that forced desegregation is bad in debate – because we lose<br />
components of all the different perspectives in debate in our blind<br />
attempt to create some universal rules that are equal for all people.<br />
<br />
Our advocacy solves this argument because it takes away the FORCED<br />
component of the “debate desegregation” since it gives individuals a<br />
choice to engage in whatever methods of engaging the topic they want.<br />
This retains all the different perspectives while allowing for friendly<br />
communication between the two.<br />
<br />
<br />
Politics Good DA<br />
<br />
Towson’s advocacy is plagued by apathy – their approach to politics,<br />
both in and out of debate, only results in paralysis and the foreclosure<br />
of opportunities for emancipation:<br />
<br />
First, tolerance can still exist within the confines of debate and<br />
politics as we know them. We’ll provide some examples of this:<br />
<br />
For debate, we will provide our own example of the Michigan Project.<br />
<br />
(We read from our brochure about the team's efforts to increase minority<br />
participation in this activity)<br />
<br />
The Michigan Project successfully recruits debaters of highly diverse<br />
backgrounds – poor or rich, black, white, Latina, Arab, Korean, gay,<br />
straight or somewhere in between – the level of diversity on our squad<br />
is uniquely encouraging.<br />
<br />
For engagement with the broader political system, we will provide a<br />
couple of examples:<br />
<br />
The Voting Rights Act struck down the Jim Crow laws of the South and<br />
eliminated the structural barriers that were designed to prevent voting<br />
by minorities, particularly blacks.<br />
<br />
Roe v. Wade eliminated the need for women to go and get back-alley<br />
abortions, a harm that targeted poor, minority women more than white<br />
women of privilege.<br />
<br />
Second, Towson’s advocacy closes off these forms of political activism<br />
by refusing to defend the actual overrule of <em>/Milliken v. Bradley</em>/.<br />
Their refusal to engage this system is tantamount to a “washing of the<br />
hands” of the political system – and all because they have determined<br />
that all attempts towards emancipation through this system are bankrupt<br />
and fail.</strong><br />

The notion of gender equality creates impossible space between sameness and difference that is implicitly measured against the dominant values of masculinity to see who it is that woman have actually become equal to.<br />
Smith and kimmel 2005, the hidden discourse of masculinity in gender discrimination law, signs: journal of women in culture and society, vol. 30, no. 3<br />
In the united states, the relationship among difference….anchored by traditional stereotypes.<br />
<br />
This type of polarized masculinity excludes those who do not conform to legalized notions of gender and perpetuates heteronormative concepts of what it means to be a man<br />

Plan change:<br />
The USSC should overrule the Millken v Bradley, 418 US 717 (1974) Decision on the grounds that de jure or de facto segregation in public education is evidence of racism. We can clarify.<br />
<br />
AT: Topicality – different grounds<br />
1. We Meet – Brown said inter-district bussing was OK, Milliken said it wasn’t we go back to Brown.<br />
2. We answer the question as to whether de jure or de facto matters<br />
3. Plan text says overrule in it – solves all ground problems<br />
4. not extratopical :<br />
Even if it is, it increases negative ground<br />
5. Don’t vote on potential abuse<br />
6. Topicality post plan – sacrifices liberty<br />
7. Should not use rules of the game to shut out arguments when civil liberties are at stake<br />

3. Impact turn – any risk the counterplan is racist vote aff<br />

6. CP = Status Quo. Good Faith effort enough<br />
7. Segregated identity politics false<br />
8. Plan text is a solution<br />
9. Policies based on promotion of identity entrench segregation<br />
10. Perm is the only way to solve must challenge unconscious racism<br />
11. Redefinition of race authority destroys race<br />

NEGATIVE Missouri State BW<br />
The 1acs Insistence that rights or peace can only be attained through the proper geopolitical strategy is the ultimate acceptance of the global neo-liberal order of violence. This represents a form of ethical imperialism in which we are only free when provided a certain set of material circumstance<br />

According to current…possibilities of a situation<br />
<br />
They represent an outdated form of kantian morality- a categorical imperative to reduce danger and violence. The 1ac isn’t an act of solidarity with those in need but rather a spectacle of consumerist enjoyment. This corrupted form of policy making prevents us from risking ourselves inn the name of the good<br />

To Badiou’s mind…liberating approach<br />
<br />
This desire to avoid risk is a stabilization of our desires. Freedom and happiness are only attained after indulging the prescribed politics of the affirmative. This is nothing more than a variant of conservative ideology and represents more than anything a deep rooted need to dictate who is good and who is evil. In light of this our alternative is to reject the plan as a way of moving away from the conservative politics of the 1ac. This act of rejection is what allows an emancipatory politics that embraces the impossible and allows us to break away from the nihilism mandated by the affirmative<br />

Whether we think…ethic of truths<br />

Neoliberal ethics…consciousness of iniquity<br />

Current approaches toward rights collapose and result in conservatism<br />

For Badiou…same for all.<br />
<br />
This is simply their appeal to your guilty conscious that positions us as spectators. We aren’t concerned with sotpping suffering but only making ourselves feel better this regulates desire and being<br />
