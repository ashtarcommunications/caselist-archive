Text: THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE EX PARTE QUIRIN [317 U.S. 1 (1942)] ON THE GROUNDS THAT COMBATANTS ARE NOT UNLAWFUL.<br />

Many oppose the rule of law – calling them lawful – incorporating them within its bounds – is ontological violence<br />

Root cause of new wars is the erosion of the states monopoly on legitimate violence<br />
Kaldor, 2000, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theglobalsite.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">www.theglobalsite.ac.uk</a><br />
Globalization is a wild process AND seeking alternative employment<br />
<br />
They don’t solve the root cause – this is fallacious – military companies create demand for their services as long as ANYONE is willing to supply violence for a price, there will be demand.<br />
Leander, 2002, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.copri.dk/publications/workingpakers.htm" rel="nofollow">www.copri.dk/publications/workingpakers.htm</a>, p. 9-10<br />
The first point about the risk AND contracts for training the Saudi Army<br />
<br />
The new wars are hideously violent<br />
Kaldor, 2000, above<br />
In these wars, violence is itself AND most violent regions<br />
<br />
Even if state violence is bad, the monopoly on legitimate violence is necessary – rights are meaningless without someone to guarantee them with force.<br />
Leander, 2002, above, p. 8-9<br />
These arguments are by and large AND rid oneself of the basic tissue<br />

Text: Congress should pass legislation prohibiting use of the clarification “enemy combatants” as prohibited by the UN Convention Against Torture. To enforce this legislation the Congress should create stringent oversight requirements. The Supreme Court of the US should apply its ruling in Hamdan to this legislation, stating that the Court’s ruling in Hamdan resolved the issues raised by the Administration’s arguments regarding Ex Parte Quirin and that the new legislation is consistent with its previous decision and furthermore that this Congressional determination of the rights of detainees is to be considered dispositive. The legislation should re-designate human rights treaties to which the US has ratified but declared non-self-executing as executable in federal district courts.<br />

CP<br />
Text- The United States Supreme Court should rule that<br />
1- Congress can only constitutionally exercise its Commerce Clause authority when such exercise meets the following independent threshold test: Congress must be regulating &quot;commerce&quot; in more than one state.&quot;<br />
2- &quot;commerce&quot; is the voluntary sale or exchange of property or services and all accompanying market-based activities, enterprises, relationships, and interests.<br />
3- In instances where COngress' authority to regulate particular activities has been establish under this test the Court should review specific regulations using the &quot;rational basis test&quot;.<br />
<br />
The CP established a clear standard that yields consistent application solving their certainty arguments. This standard also is mutlutally exclusive with the plan's precedent because would invalidate VAWA and the Lopez/Morrison 3 prong test.<br />

Interpretation. To overrule a decision, the aff must reach an opposite judgment on the legal question decided.<br />

Overrule. To Supersede; annul; reverse; make void; reject by subsequent action or decision. A judicial decision is<br />

Even if a new decision dictates a different result in an old case, it doesn’t overrule the old decision if (it’s reasoning is unrelated to the questions considered in the old case because) the relevant question hasn’t been so decided as to constitute a precedent.<br />

The United States Congress should pass school desegregation legislation requiring school districts to participate in educational integration plans in cases of de jure and de facto segregation. These mandates should include: comprehensive application to all school districts, inter-district remedies, special focus on kindergarten and elementary school, application to intra-school segregation. Funding and enforcement provided. Federal education funding to the states should be conditioned upon local and state level implementation of these mandates as well the following : prohibit exclusionary zoning, require comprehensive planning and provide for dedicated enforcement of land use policy, use urban growth boundaries to reduce sprawl and promote infill, adopt proactive policies to prevent displacement, link affordable housing with public transportation, adopt inclusionary housing policies, promote positive integration measures, effectively site subsidized housing, and enforce and strengthen laws prohibiting discrimination in housing markets.<br />
