WAYNE STATE GR AFFIRMATIVE:<br />
NDT Round 4:<br />
<br />
New Milliken Aff:<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s 1974 decision in Milliken v Bradley produced a radical segregation of Detroit and ourselves as Detroiter’s. the once unspoken lines of class, race, ect that exist btwn the upper class suburbs and the mostly minority, lower class city have become cemented in the psyche of dustin and I as we grew up in the suburbs of Rochester and Beverly hills, completely separated from the populations in the inner cities. The entirety of our understandings of the cirt have been shaped by this relationship<br />
<br />
These borders and experiences have become endemic of modern politics – the immutability of borders have come to demarcate the productivity of populations, determining their worth in a marketplace of fear driven discourse – this form of poitics radically denies the agency of everyone by producing an ideolology of militarism that prevents violence as the inevitability of politics in opposition to true democracy.<br />
Giroux 06<br />
<br />
The proliferation of borders has contributed to the growing segregation of ourselves into stable, linear identities such as suburban and urban. Our understanding of the linearity of identity represents a problematic notion of what it means to participate in the politics community – such as control of our own schools, keeping our funding here, where the I is already predetermined to denote privledge and the psecifcic special quality of inhabiting the suburbs represents a new form of cultural imperialisy that radically excluded our ability to become border crossers in this grand imperial narrative of whiteness<br />
Freed 04<br />
<br />
The experience of our childhoods represent a metaphor for the politics of Milliken – the notions of stable boundaries, stable identities and a radically depoliticized notion of what it means to be a citizen all served as a backdrop for who we knew the world. After high school ,dustin and I started attending wayne state university in the mid-town Detroit. Our move to Detroit is an act that problematizes a linear notion of ourselves – this problematization is the only starting point that allows the subject to encounter the urbal other on their own terms, making the border between the self and theother more fluid. For example, we could be considered to be apart for the Detroiters by choice, a growing movement of pprevios siburban dwellers that have began to redefine that it means to be an engaged citizen is Detroit, holding community events, ect. These experiences have allowed us to finally become friends with the life long city dwellers, changing the very notion of community in Detroit. Only an affirmative ballot can participate in new underrating of what it means to aprticiapte in democratic politics and community.<br />
Giroux 00<br />
<br />
The hering, speaking, and writing of being a border crosser is crutial to encountering question of politcs and schooling as they relate to being in the world – placing questions of our everyday experience as central to agency allow open space for knowing.<br />
Giroux 91<br />
<br />
Affirming our experiences in detoit as representating the nonlinearity of community, identity and borders participates in the greater struggle for pedagogu and learning against these problematic forms of agency – your ballot occupies an intellectual space that should seek to transcend boundaries as an assertion of what it means to be a public intellectual<br />
Giroux 06<br />
<br />
This debate round represents a political space – your intellectual endorsement of our performance of border-crossing is crucial to produce solidarity with struggles for equity and serves as a starting point for rethinking the politics of space deployed in Milliken<br />

We read 2 plans<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Milliken v. Bradley 418 U.S. 717. Ask and we'll clarify.<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Milliken v. Bradley 418 U.S. 717 (1974) by ruling that the prohibition on inter-district remedies to segregation violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Ask and we'll clarify.<br />
<br />
Advantage One- Local control<br />
In Milliken v. Bradley, The Supreme Court limited interdistrict desegregation efforts under the guise of local autonomy; this cemented the ongoing racial separation of minority populations<br />
powell '99 (john a. – Prof. Law at Ohio State and Executive Director of the Kirwan Institute for the study of Race and Ethnicity, September/October, &quot;Achieving Racial Justice: What's Sprawl Got to Do With It?&quot; Poverty &amp; Race, Vol. 8, No. 5, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://kirwaninstitute.org/documents/prrac-article-1999.htm" rel="nofollow">http://kirwaninstitute.org/documents/prrac-article-1999.htm</a> )<br />
<br />
The Milliken decision remains the largest road block to challenging this notion of an autonomous community; failure to do so ensures continuing exclusion of difference within every community<br />
john a. powell, Marvin J. Sonosky Chair in Law and Public Policy and the Executive Director of the Institute on Race and Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, Spring 01 (1 Margins 1, ln)<br />
<br />
This reliance on sovereignty has allowed suburban populations to segregate themselves from the urban center contributing to the continuing economic subjugation of minority populations<br />
Jerry Frug Professor of Law, Harvard University 1993 60 U. Chi. L. Rev. 253<br />
This continuing resegregation and economic exclusion is a part of a logic that renders urban populations invisible and unthinkable in American society- this forecloses active participation in democratic politics and exposes whole populations to militaristic values and violence,<br />
Henry A. Giroux currently holds the Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University in the English and Cultural Studies Department College Literature 33.3 (2006)<br />
This logic of disposable populations necessitates exposing outgroups to ongoing violence and genocide in order to preserve the hierarchies of race and class that constitute the sovereign.<br />
Elden, Lecturer in politics at the University of Warwick, England, 2002<br />
(Stuart, boundary 2 - Volume 29, Number 1, page project muse gjm)<br />
<br />
Advantage Two is the racialization of space.<br />
<br />
The current racialization and distancing of others via desegregation jurisprudence is an attempt to deny access to democracy based on race; it is historically linked to the denial of education to slaves<br />
Rhonda V. Magee Andrews Professor of Law, University of San Francisco 2004 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 891<br />
<br />
This denial of democratic participation is apart of a logic that makes genocide inevitable; only our re-interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment opens space for an ethical orientation towards the holocaust<br />
Rhonda V. Magee Andrews Professor of Law, University of San Francisco 2004 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 891<br />
<br />
Advantage is dignity<br />
Milliken V. Bradley ensured that desegregation could not occur beyond district lines; this ensures that even minorities in the suburban schools remain substantially segregated<br />
James, 1989. (David R, Prof of Sociology at Indiana University City Limits on Racial Equality: The Effects of City-Suburb Boundaries on Public-School Desegregation, 1968-1976. American Sociological Review, 54, 6. Dec. p. JSTOR)<br />
<br />
The decision stigmitizes minority children by sending a message that they were defective and should be shunned. The Supreme Court has an obligation to address this harm<br />
Lenhardt 04 - Fellow @ Georgetown University Law Center [R.A. Lenhardt, Professor of Law @ Fordham University Law School &quot;UNDERSTANDING THE MARK: RACE, STIGMA, AND EQUALITY IN CONTEXT,&quot; New York University Law Review, June 2004, 79 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 803]<br />
The Supreme Court's evasion of dignitary concerns ignores the fact that segregations primarily functions are to degrade, dishonor, isolate, and ostracize.<br />
Bracey 05 - Professor of Law @ Washington University School of Law [Christopher A. Bracey, &quot;RACE JURISPRUDENCE AND THE SUPREME COURT: WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?: DIGNITY IN RACE JURISPRUDENCE,&quot; University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law, February 2005, 7 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 669]<br />
A doctrinal shift is of paramount importance because this denial of dignity destroys the value of life and outweighs all calculable impacts<br />
David Berube, Ph.D. in Communications, &quot;Nanotechnological Prolongevity: The Down Side&quot;, NanoTechnology Magazine, June/July 1997, p. 1-6, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cla.sc.edu/ENGL/faculty/berube/prolong.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cla.sc.edu/ENGL/faculty/berube/prolong.htm</a><br />

Solvency<br />
First, Overruling Milliken removes the most important roadblock to developing effective metropolitan wide desegregation efforts<br />
A. DAN TARLOCK Professor of Law, IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law 1988<br />
64 Chi.-Kent. L. Rev. 573<br />
<br />
Metropolitan School integration erases the distinction in the housing market by lessening the incentive to make decisions about location based on race<br />
Deborah Kenn- Associate Professor of Law and Director, Community Development Law Clinic, Syracuse University College of Law 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35 2001<br />
<br />
Integration breaks down racism-the effects spill over to other settings and other generations<br />
Amy Stuart Wells, Professor, Sociology and Education, Columbia, and Robert L. Crane, 97, Stepping over the color line : African-American students in white suburban schools, p. 340-1<br />
<br />
Integration promotes a shift in the teaching cultures within schools that questions how dominant norms shape pedagogy<br />
Amy Stuart Wells, Professor, Sociology and Education, Columbia, and Robert L. Crane, 97, Stepping over the color line : African-American students in white suburban schools, p. 288-90<br />
Furthermore, Calls to just increase schools funding or maintain segregation ignore the importance of integration to the development a post-racist democracy<br />
Richard Thompson Ford Professor of Law and Justin M. Roach, Jr. Faculty Scholar, Stanford Law School March, 2004 117 Harv. L. Rev. 1305<br />
