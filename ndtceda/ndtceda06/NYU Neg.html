<br />
Anti-topicality argument<br />
<br />
Inherency → rhetoric of Aff is not credible<br />
<br />
Aff is not credible to discuss a “woman’s issue”<br />
- can’t argue topic because the Aff is too contradictory in their plan.<br />
<br />
Logos: Utilizes Butler as main source for discussing womanhood, transgendered peoples, gender construction/performance<br />
<br />
Ethos: Is est. for Butler, each member of the team utilized personal experience as credibility for him/her to speak on the issues of gender that they find are flawed in the Aff’s 1AC about womanhood<br />
<br />
Pathos: Both used eye contact and spoke slowly, using the typed of articulation and vocal inflection necessary for persuasive speech<br />

1NC Offcase Arguments:<br />
Be as detailed as possible. Just saying &quot;Topicality&quot; isn't particularly helpful. There needs to be some indication as to what the violation is. Try to include an outline of each argument that includes a tag for every card. Whenever you hear an argument that you have not previously heard, you should get complete cites for that argument and include them here.<br />
--Test Case spec<br />
--Distinguish/overrule Morrison that VAWA is constitutional CP: The USC should rule that they will defer to the primacy of congressional fact finding when determining whether jurisdiction exists for a federal regulation under the commerce clause regarding legislation over (advantages). The USSC should overrule its decision in US v Morrison by ruling that 42 USC 13981 of Title IV sec 40001-40703 of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 is a constitutional exercise of congressional power under section 5 of the 14th amendment to the united states constitution<br />
