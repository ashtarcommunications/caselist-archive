A. Weyerhauser will win now – experts<br />
<br />
CNN Money 10/2/06<br />
&lt;In Weyerhauser v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber….the company is accused of violating anti-trust laws…lower courts awarded Ross-Simons $78.7 million in damages, but legal experts expect the Supreme Court to overturn that verdict&gt;<br />
&lt; Another antitrust case has gotten the Bush administration involved. In<br />
Weyerhaeuser v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber, Ross-Simmons Hardwood - a now<br />
defunct saw mill - claimed that Weyerhaeuser paid more to hoard alder saw logs<br />
in order to create a monopoly on the timber and drive competitors out of<br />
business. The company is accused of violating antitrust laws by engaging in<br />
&quot;predatory buying.&quot;<br />

<br />
Washington Times 12/17/00<br />
&lt;There was some speculation by bush….expend political capital…legal analyst at the Cato institute&gt;<br />
<br />
There was some speculation by Bush insiders that he would drop the<br />
antitrust suit early next year to send a quick signal to the financial markets<br />
and the investment community that he was abandoning Mr. Clinton's aggressive<br />
antitrust policy. But outside observers disagreed with that view.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think he will intervene because I think the likelihood of reversal<br />
by the appeals court is very high. So why expend political capital to attain a<br />
goal that is likely to come about anyway?&quot; asked Robert A. Levy, an economic<br />
and legal analyst at the Cato Institute.<br />
<br />
Judicial enforcement of anti trust uniquely vulnerable to political influence<br />

&lt;Judges enjoy considerable discretion….Changes in the political climate [toward business – not read] determine whether antitrust enforcement policy and judicial doctrine takes expansive or narrow paths…justification for change&gt;<br />

All 50 states’ supreme courts should hold . The 50 states’ courts will clarify that this ruling is based exclusively on state constitutional grounds. The 50 states’ congresses will uphold this ruling by revoking all state laws inconsistent with the ruling and will not pass any laws or constitutional amendments which functionally overturn any part of this ruling. We reserve the right to clarify intent.<br />

States CP 1nc<br />
<br />
Text:<br />
<br />
The fifty state legislatures and relevant United States territorial actors should enact legislation that declares gender-motivated violence a state crime and recognizes that gender-motivated violence is a civil rights issue by providing a civil rights remedy in state courts. The legislation should adopt a construction of animus as “an attitude that informs one’s actions” as per the 1NC Bonner evidence. The legislation should mandate arrest in instances where state officials have probable cause of gender-motivated violence and should establish a minimum four year statute of limitations for gender-motivated crimes. The fifty state supreme courts and relevant territorial actors should uphold state civil remedies for gender-motivated violence. We will clarify.<br />

Enviro Amendments CP<br />
Text: The United States Congress should propose and adopt a constitutional amendment granting Congress the power to preserve, protect and promote the environment. This amendment should clarify that Congressional power to preserve, protect and promote the environment is retroactive. All relevant United States governmental entities will defer to the counterplan. We get to clarify intent.<br />
<br />
Contention 1 – Competition – Our counterplan avoids all disads based on Supreme Court action<br />
<br />
Contention 2 – Solvency<br />
<br />
We’ve got a solvency advocate – the constitution should be amended to give congress the power to regulate the environment<br />
<br />
Gildor 05 [Dan L, JD @ Berkley, “Preserving the Priceless: A Constitutional Amendment to Empower Congress to Preserve, Protect, and Promote the Environment,” 32 Ecology L.Q. 821, ln]<br />
On all of these grounds… function of the Constitution.&quot; 235<br />
<br />
This solves the whole case—it prevents roll back of current federal environmental law and creates a legal foundation for future environmental protections<br />
<br />
Gildor 05 [Dan L, JD @ Berkley, “Preserving the Priceless: A Constitutional Amendment to Empower Congress to Preserve, Protect, and Promote the Environment,” 32 Ecology L.Q. 821, ln]<br />
So what will adoption of the proposed … significant impact of adoption.<br />
<br />
Contention 3 – The Net Benefit<br />
<br />
The Commerce Clause foundation of the aff treats nature only in economic terms—this commodification makes the destruction of nature inevitable<br />
<br />
Gildor 05 [Dan L, JD @ Berkley, “Preserving the Priceless: A Constitutional Amendment to Empower Congress to Preserve, Protect, and Promote the Environment,” 32 Ecology L.Q. 821, ln]<br />
Presently at the federal level, expressions of this pervasive ethic are distorted by the limitations imposed on those expressions by the Commerce Clause. For instance…clock will function without the uneconomic parts.&quot; 214<br />
<br />
The counterplan solves – it allows us to value nature for nature<br />
<br />
Gildor 05 [Dan L, JD @ Berkley, “Preserving the Priceless: A Constitutional Amendment to Empower Congress to Preserve, Protect, and Promote the Environment,” 32 Ecology L.Q. 821, ln]<br />
Given that all federal environmental policy is …to such expression under the Commerce Clause.<br />
<br />
2NC<br />
And, only the counterplan solves—absent an affirmative power enabling congressional regulation, roll back of environmental protections by hostile courts and executives is inevitable.<br />
<br />
Gildor 05 [Dan L, JD @ Berkley, “Preserving the Priceless: A Constitutional Amendment to Empower Congress to Preserve, Protect, and Promote the Environment,” 32 Ecology L.Q. 821, ln]<br />
We return here, then, where we started, … the amendment proposed herein.<br />

The United States Congress, pursuant to its authority under the Militia Clauses, should organize and train each state’s militia as first responders to domestic terrorist attacks as per Brook. Specifically, Congress should use financial incentives to garner compliance with federal requirements about the makeup and training of first responder militias. All other branches should defer to the counterplan. We’ll clarify.<br />

the Uniform Code of Military Justice’s procedure for courts martial, in<br />
proceedings comporting with all requirements and regulations of Common<br />
Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1948. They should additionally<br />

Habeas Courts CP 1NC<br />
<br />
The United States Congress should revoke the Detainee Treatment Act,<br />
establish an Article 3 Federal District Court and Court of Appeals, as per<br />
Chrisman in 2005, with exclusive jurisdiction over all legal matters<br />
pertaining the detention of and trial of any charge brought against all<br />
individuals detained as part of hostilities that are part of the “Global<br />
War on Terror” inclusive of all individuals designated as enemy combatants<br />
by the executive branch. The Congress should explicitly mandate the<br />
provision of a right of habeas corpus, under a standard of reasonable cause,<br />
and twice-yearly combatant status reviews.<br />
<br />
( ) Separate Article III federal district courts for enemy combatants solve<br />

United States Supreme Court under the procedures that exist for other habeas<br />

Second, a Habeas Court will expedite the habeas review process, which is of<br />

2241 Counterplan<br />
<br />
The U.S. Congress should amend 28 USC Section 2241 to read &quot;Writs of<br />
habeas corpus may be granted by the Supreme Court, any justice<br />
thereof, the district courts and any circuit judge within their<br />
respective jurisdictions. The District Court for the District of<br />
Columbia may grant writs of habeas corpus when the place of<br />
confinement of a citizen is not within any other judicial district.&quot;<br />
Additionally, Congress should mandate that the Classified Information<br />
Procedures Act should apply to all evidence and testimony presented<br />
during any procedure arising from writs of habeas corpus filed by<br />
enemy combatants.<br />
<br />
The CP solves - 2241 controls the right to hear a habeas petition<br />
under Rasul and Hamdi - redefinition is best<br />

Locke ’92 (Stephen, Hofstra Law Review)<br />
<br />
“Justice Marshall's goals could be achieved in three ways not considered in his opinion” and “Additionally, patterns of white flight could then be traced to this de jure segregation and give the Court the power to fashion broader remedies.”<br />
<br />
And, we solve without violating precedent<br />
Locke ’92 (Stephen, Hofstra Law Review)<br />

“Given the choices that could be adopted to reach” and “leaving well entrenched case law essentially intact.”<br />

Remedial Activism Net Benift<br />
A. Remedial Activism is constrained amongst conservative Justices now – but could easily explode.<br />
Marshall ’02 (William P. Marshall, University of Colorado Law Review)<br />
<br />
“There is at least one area where the conservatives have been thoroughly” and “however, under the criterion of remedial activism, the conservatives have been a model of judicial restraint.”<br />
<br />
<br />
And, Roberts is more bound by precedent than a typical conservative Justice<br />

<br />
“As for just how Roberts will go about interpreting” and “lies at the heart of Roberts's approach to judging.”<br />

Campbell 92 (David, WRITING SECURITY: UNITED STATES FOREIGN POLICY AND THE POLITICS OF IDENTITY, p 258-259)<br />
The political possibilities enabled…is articulated.<br />
<br />
We must engage in political struggle form within biopolitics to open up space for political alternatives<br />
Dean, 2001 (Mitchell, STATE OF IMAGINATION: ETHNOGRAPHIC EXPLORATIONS OF POSTCOLONIAL SPACE, Ed: Thomas Blom Hansen, p. 61-62)<br />
The study of govenrmentality has yet… their mere existence)<br />
<br />
Modernity is open-ended – we can use the tools of biopower to challenge exclusion and oppression. Giving up te use of these resources enables the worst manifestations of violence to return<br />

<u>Topicality:</u><br />
The ballot should assess the consequences of enactment of the resolutional statement. If the statement “the supreme court of the united states should overrule” is true and should be affirmed, the aff wins- if its not and should be rejected, you should vote neg.<br />
<br />
Reversal alone is not topical – overrule necessitates specifying exactly what part of Quirin is overruled and on what grounds (Peterson ’04, Meghan M. Pererson –Creighton Law Review –April, 2004)<br />
<br />
It’s a voting issue- fairness and debatability- its not enough to merely talk about something related to the resolution or claim to be “not exclusive” with advocacy of Court action – defending the resolutional statement is the only way to ensure fair debate where we can engage their arugment. Otherwise, the aff can shift and dodge new arguments rather than engage us. Resolutional-basis learning is good and should be preserved- we change topics every year to discuss a variety of issues, expanding our horizons. If not tied to resolution, the material they rpesent is impossible to predict and prepare to debate their framework makes debate impossible. –Shivley 2000<br />
<br />
<u>CP</u> text: The Supreme Court should distinguish its decision in Ex Parte Quirin by holding that the decision is limited to its facts. The Supreme Court should hold that the executive’s distinction between legal and illegal combatants is unconstitutional. We get to clarify.<br />
<br />
Limiting to the facts has the same precedential effects as overruling. (Benjamin 99, Stuart Minor, Assoc. Prof of Law @ U San Diego, 78 Tex. L. Rev. 269, ln)<br />
<br />
Like Korematsu, the Quirin decision shouldn't be used as a precedent but should remain on the books, as a constant reminder of the violence our institutions commit in times of insecurity. Denial of this history turns the case- (Tamaki 04, Donald K., JD and Founder of the Asian Law Alliance, “Sixty Years After the Internment: Civil Rights, Identity Politics, and Racial Profiling,” Asian L.J. 147, ln)<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Kritik:</u><br />
Link- equality under the law is a sham- equal access to rights means nothing to those who cant make use of them. Discourse of rights masks structural inequalities that operate through the legal codification of identity- this insulates domination from critique – brown and halley 2002, (Wendy, Prof of PoliSci @ Berkeley and Janet, Prof of Law @ Harvard, Left Legalism/Left Critique., pg. 6-7)<br />
<br />
Their focus on changing cultural definitions of the human misses the boat- such an ontological approach masks the role capital plays in structuring the identities and material realities of life in the war on terror and beyond. – (Smith 04, Paul, prof of cultural studies @ GMU, “Precarious Politics,” symploke 12.1-2, muse)<br />
<br />
<br />
Impact- domination operates through the division of people along rigid identity categories- the legal codification of identity makes war and violence inevitable – (Clifford 2001, Michael, prof of philosophy @ Mississippi state, political genealogy after coucault, pg. 144-146)<br />
<br />
Alt- Vote negative to affirm our critique of legal reformism. The aff’s demand that our alternative have a blueprint forecloses the open-ended possibilities necessary for effective political action. Absent our critical left approach, legalism ensure the replication of domination. –Brown and Halley 2002 (Wendy, Prof of PoliSci @ Berkeley and Janet, Prof of Law @ Harvard, Left Legalism/Left Critique., pg. 6-7)<br />
<br />
The 1ac attacks symptoms rather than causes. Appeals to expand legal rights and representation maintain the structural economic inequalities and violence of liberalism. Radical politics demands dissent from the very system they seek to expand. (Smith 04, Paul, prof of cultural studies @ GMU, “Precarious Politics,” symploke 12.1-2, muse)<br />
<br />
Criticism today means nothing if it ignores capital – our alternative is crucial to challenge endless global wars –(Chowdhury ’06, Kanishka, Associate Professor of English at the University of St. Thomas, “Interrogating “Newness” Globalization and Postcolonial Theory In the Age of Endless War,” Cultural Critique, 62, ln)<br />

Text: The United Sttaes Congress, pursuant to its authority under the Militia Clauses, should organize and train each state’s militia as responders to domestic terrorist attacks as per Brook. Specifically, Congress should use financial incentives to garner compliance with federal requirements about the makeup and training of first responder.<br />
<br />
The fifty state legislatures and relevant United States territorial actors should enact legislation that declares gender-motivated violence a state crime and recognizes that gender-motivated violence is a civil rights issue by providing a civil rights remedy in state courts. The legislation should adopt a construction of animus as “an attitude that informs one’s actions” as per the 1NC Bonner evidence. The fifty state supreme courts and relevant territorial actors should uphold state civil remedies for gender-motivated violence. We will clarify.<br />

Microsoft will win now – key to tech sector<br />
Farrand, December 2006 (james, Computer and Internet Lawyer, www.arnoldporter.com/pubs/files/Farrand_Computer.pdf)<br />
In three controversial decisions in 2005... rulings seems likely.<br />
<br />
Justices perceive that an overturn of Quirin would drain their political capital with the president<br />
Segal et al, 2004 (The Effect of War on the U.S. Supreme Court, Global Law Working Paper, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/workingpapers/detail/documents/GLWP0304Segal.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.nyulawglobal.org/workingpapers/detail/documents/GLWP0304Segal.pdf</a>, p 22-23<br />
In raising this question... extant legal principles.<br />
<br />
Capital key to Microsoft win.<br />
1. Ruling in favor of Microsoft revokes existing AT&amp;T patent.<br />
Public Patent Foundation, 12/16/06, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pubpat.org/softwarepatentwatch.htm" rel="nofollow">www.pubpat.org/softwarepatentwatch.htm</a>)<br />
The Software Freedom Law Center announced today that...agreed to hear the case.<br />
<br />
2. Low political capital prevents court from striking down existing patents<br />
Epstien (OR Epstein: they spelt it the other way, i think this one’s right), 2005 (James, Case Western Reserve LR, Fall)<br />
The question of which doctrinal home is best... at much lower political cost.<br />

Tech sector key economy<br />
White House Press Secretary, 2000 (Press release, the US-China WTO Accession Deal: A Clear win for US high technology, greater openness and U.S. interests)<br />
Information Technology Has Helped... sector average.<br />

CONGRESS<br />
The United States congress should pass legislation mandating that all individuals detained as a part of hostilities that are of the “Global War on Terror” and individuals held in custody for trial before military commissions should be prosecuted for violations of the law of war under the Uniform Code of Military Justice’s procedure for courts martial, in proceedings comporting with all requirements and regulations of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1948. They should additionally legislate to explicitly deprive authority and jurisdiction for any other military tribunals without rules of procedure in compliance with all regulations and requirements of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. They should additionally amend 28 U.S.C. §2241 to establish federal court jurisdiction to hear writs of habeas corpus for individuals held in custody for trial before military commissions. <em>Enforcement guaranteed. The executive will not issue a signing statement. Congress will override any veto attemp(</em>their spelling mistake) <em>by the executive</em>.<br />

Case Args:<br />
Case:<br />
1. MacKinnon is wrong—relies on flawed view of privacy<br />
2. Aff doesn’t send a signal of pglobal protection against gender violence—<br />
3. SQ solves public/private dichotomy—Morrison was based on federal v. state authority, rape and gender violence are already criminal making them public, and int’l law has already fractured the private—<br />
4. SQ state action solves the case—<br />
5. Turn—women are deterred from relying on the public sphere—affs reliance ignores that all women are not fully entitled<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
Supreme Court Politics:<br />
Link: Kennedy pays attention to the Court’s net political capital—it’s a decisive variable in his decision-making<br />
And, kennedy is the perfect candidate for spillover—lane 2006<br />
<br />
Counterplan:<br />
Text: The fifty state legislatures and relevant United States territorial actors should enact legislation that declares gender-motivated violence a state crime and recognizes that gender-motivated violence is a civil rights issue by providing a civil rights remedy in state courts. This legislation should adopt a construction of animus as “an attitude that informs one’s actions” as per the 1NC Bonner evidence. The legislation should mandate arrest in instances where state officials have probable cause of gender-motivated violence and should establish a minimum four year statute of limitations for gender-motivated crimes. The fifty state supreme courts and relevant territorial actors should uphold state civil remedies for gender-motivated violence. We will clarify.<br />
Solvency—The counterplan solves 100% of the aff—Bonner, 2002<br />
And states can provide an effective civil remedy identical to the original VAWA—Bonner, 2002<br />
The counterplan’s interpretation of animus at the state level is key to solve—Bonner<br />

Comments: Spend more time in the 1AR on why the CP doesn’t solve, these are key to your framework args. Neg never answers the test case argument.<br />
<br />
ARGUMENT CITES<br />
Framework (Deontology Bad)<br />
Even deontological theories have to evaluate consequences to determine morality – Utility is best.<br />
HOEKMA, Right &amp; Wrong, St. Olaf, p. 79, 1986<br />
“Than any alternative… in moral judgment.”<br />
<br />
Bad consequences can check our imperatives to help others – there imperative ignore the option of partially fulfilling our duty.<br />
Michael Slote, Common-Sense Morality and Consequenstialism, p. 82, 1985<br />
“The fact of… in ethical discussions.”<br />
<br />
They’ll say you shouldn’t consider DA’s or backlash arugments. Considering DA’s is valuable in the de-segregation context.<br />
Alfred a Lindseth, Emory Law Journal Summer<br />
“Plaintiffs in desegregation… of white flight.”<br />
<br />
Endorsing consequences is not facially racist and it’s the only appropriate approach.<br />
Matthew Silliman, Theory and Research in Education – vol 1, 1/03/03<br />
“This brings me… continual moral civilization.”<br />
<br />
Consequences matter – the tunnel vision of moral absolutism generates evil and political irrelavence.<br />
Jeffrey Isaac, DISSENT, Spring 2002<br />
“Politics, in large… undermines poltical effectiveness.”<br />
<br />
Our ethic of consequences enables political responsibility and freedom. Their framework cannot be projected onto the entire world without denying the reality of poltics and human limitation.<br />
Michael Williams, The Realist Tradition and the Limits of International Relations, p. 174-176, 2005<br />
“A commitment to… imperative toward, responsibility.”<br />
<br />
Remidial Activism DA<br />
A. Issue-Specific Uniqueness – Remedial activism is constrained amongst conservative justices now – but could easily explode.<br />
William P. Marshal, University of Colorado Law Review, Fall, 2002<br />
“There is at least… of judicial restraint.”<br />
<br />
And, Roberts is more bound by precdent than a typical conservative judge.<br />
Terry Eastland, Weekly standard, September 26th 2005<br />
“As for just… approach to judging.”<br />
<br />
B. Links<br />
1. overruling any part of Milliken allows the conservative court to re-asses the balance between remedy-and-scope.<br />
<br />
2. If given an oppotuninty to create new precedent, Roberts would jack remedial schems for a host of liberal cuases.<br />
Patrick Leahy, U.S. Newswire, August 16th 2005<br />
“Those papers that… Reagan Justice Department.”<br />
<br />
C. impact<br />
First-this straight turns the case – these remedial schemes are the vital internal link to combating racism.<br />
Marc H. Morial, U.S. News Wire, September 21sst 2005, Lexis<br />
“The national urban… people of color.”<br />
<br />
Kritik<br />
Overruling Milliken allows the court and society to wash our hands of the violence of white supremacy – this erasure enables colofblind legal practice to perpetuate the violence of racial inequality.<br />
Sumi Cho, “Redeeming Whiteness in the Shadow of Internment: Early Warren, Borwn, and a Theory of Racial Redemption.” Third world Law Journal 1998<br />
“Racial redemption is… of colorblind idealogy.”<br />
The erasure of history and race conciousness from the law ensures judical co-option of the plan to perpetuate white supremacy – this evidence is better than generic “law is indeterminate.”<br />
Cho 98<br />
Politics<br />
<br />
CP – Limit to its facts<br />
Text: The USSC should limit “Milliken I” to its facts by recognizing that racial segregation is often a vestige of prior discrimination and creates a rebuttable presumption to this effect.<br />
The United States supreme court will hold that this ruling nullifies deferral to local control on the grounds that education is protected by the privileges or immunities clause of the 14th amendment.<br />
<br />
The CP solves<br />
Overruling in the context of Milliken is especially bad, as it calls into question the balcance of remedy and schope outside of segregation law.<br />
Stephen Locke, Hofstra Law Review, Winter 1992<br />
“Justice Marshall’s goals… fashion broader remedies.”<br />

1. Plan doesn't enact/ensure VAWA/similar legislation.<br />
<br />
2. Doesn't solve legal biasts.<br />
<br />
3. Doesn't solve –<br />
a. perpetrators have no assets.<br />
b. they have to go to third parties to get money, therefore there is violence.<br />
<br />
4. Doesn't solve –<br />
a. lower courts<br />
b. law enforcement bias i.e. police<br />
<br />
5. Signal already given and failed by VAWA, 13981 not key<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Language Kritik of using rhetoric of VOICE, SILENCE, AND CONTEXTUALIZING SILENCE AS “WITHOUT AGENCY.” See casey for ideas. Alternative is “reject neg”<br />
<br />
Here is the card and cite to all the cards they use…<br />
<br />
Rhetoric using the phrase speaking and voicing demands is historical vessel that oppresses deaf cuture – this rhetoric shapes reality.<br />
<br />
Douglas Baynton, 1996. Forbidden Signs.<br />
<br />
“my need … of the curtains.”<br />
<br />
Alternative = vote negative to reject offensive language.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Dispositional ICCPR Counterplan which<br />
a. had congress enact VAWA and Hate Crime Legislation (to solve our GLBT advantage).<br />
b. refused S.C. ability to admit test cases into cert in order to overrule the Congressional choices.<br />
<br />
3. Courts Politics with an internal perception link – (not political capital, the court hates itself when it rules liberally, so backlashes conservatively to calm itself), the impact is EPA v. MA<br />
a. be aware that they go for this argument often<br />
b. be aware that they sometimes claim that global warming increases violence and therefore women become oppressed.<br />
<br />
4. GOP Bad – wmd’s/proliferation impact.<br />
<br />
5. Federalism – calabresi genocide impact which turns case.<br />
<br />
Block Strategy:<br />
1. IN THE BLOCK, 1NR TAKES KRITIK AND MAKES IT A FLOATIN PIK – “do 1AC minus the silence language.”<br />
<br />
Here is their k overview verbadum:<br />
<br />
“Offense wins debates – they have no offense against our deafness argument – they can’t win this debate – Extend our Baynton Evidence – their use of terms like “voices” and “listen” is part of rhetorical baggage that grounds humanity in the will to speak – out 1AC evidence says this rhetorical practice to exclude the deaf – those words have historical baggage that grounds humanity in the will to speak – our 1AC evidence says this rhetorical practive attempts to destroy the value to the lives of deaf people – which means under their framework there is novalue to life and they can’t articulate a reason to vote aff – they’ve concede thae portion of our evi which says their rhetorical use of the word (voices/listen) constructs reality in a way to exclude deafness – this rhetorical impact has real world implications which extend beyond the debate round – voting aff or neg can never actually cause the plan to be implemented but we can take a stand against the rhetorical practice of excluding deafness – and they can’t win any offense – our criticism doesn’t take umbrage with their project as a whole – we can agree with their entire project and just argue that we should heed perspectives instead of “listen to voices” this sucks up the whole case without relying on exclusionary rhetoric. “<br />

<strong>*Counterplan- dispositional</strong><br />
<br />
Text: In a relevant test case, The US Supreme Court should clarify that reproductive freedoms restricting the legitimacy of coerceive contraception policies are based on a women’s right to selfhood. The court will expressly extend this line of reasoning (selfhood) to the welfare reform act of 1996, and denounce the components of that legislation that seek to pressure women into marriage and penalize them for having children.<br />
<br />
The decision will speak to state contracdeption practices and not abortion<br />
<br />
The counterplan solves:<br />
<br />
First their own 1AC card is not about abortion per se, but larger questions of reproductive freedom we capture their general evidence. This also explains our welfare reform solvency<br />
<br />
Caldwell (Anne- department of political science- University of Louisville- Hypatia- vol 17:4- project muse)<br />
<br />
In Irigaray’s words, women’s choices canot remain individual or private but must be guaranteed by law…if women had an explicitly defined civil identity, low income women might have clearer legal grounds for resisting the requirements of the 1996 reform.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second- opposing coercive contraception practices is vital- the reproductive health movement cannot view itself solely as an abortion movement<br />
<br />
Hooten 05 (Angela Hooten- associate director of policy and advocacy, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health American University Journal of Gender)<br />
<br />
We need a vision based oin the understanding that the denial of control takes different forms….the movement must continue to expand it’s agenda beyond abortion<br />

Judge Comments: No ink on remedial activism before 2ar. Not sure how they link to not solving case. Aff should focus on 14th amendment key. Args on the 14th amendment key. Need to delineate more between what plan and CP do. Need to make a much bigger deal about the overrule distinction. Could collapse the debate down on the CP and make arguments that you need to win on racialization. Make args about why their CP would functionally do nothing. Behind after the 1ar. Need to collapse down to address the key issues. Just go for CP doesn’t solve case in the 2ar, because most judges will spot them some sort of uniqueness case.<br />
1AR - 14th amendment and how the CP cant solve for that an the overrule. Collapse down to the arguments that are key. Here as well.<br />

Kritik<br />
Overruling Milliken allows the court and society to wash our hands of the violence of white supremacy – this erasure enables colofblind legal practice to perpetuate the violence of racial inequality.<br />
Sumi Cho, “Redeeming Whiteness in the Shadow of Internment: Early Warren, Borwn, and a Theory of Racial Redemption.” Third world Law Journal 1998<br />
“Racial redemption is… of colorblind idealogy.”<br />
The erasure of history and race conciousness from the law ensures judical co-option of the plan to perpetuate white supremacy – this evidence is better than generic “law is indeterminate.”<br />

CP – Limit to its facts<br />
Text: The USSC should limit “Milliken I” to its facts by recognizing that racial segregation is often a vestige of prior discrimination and creates a rebuttable presumption to this effect.<br />
The United States supreme court will hold that this ruling nullifies deferral to local control on the grounds that education is protected by the privileges or immunities clause of the 14th amendment.<br />
<br />
The CP solves<br />
Overruling in the context of Milliken is especially bad, as it calls into question the balcance of remedy and schope outside of segregation law.<br />

Judge Comments:<br />
<br />
Dropping theory is hard, clean that up<br />
Framing issues the negative needs to do a better job:<br />
There are only 4 cases<br />
You have lots of other things you can say<br />
They say err aff on T<br />
2nr needs to extend that there are lots of other ways to overrule<br />
<br />
Explain answers to arbitrary – explicitly overrule<br />
There is some arbitrariness as to whether it’s an express utterance<br />
But you have to deal with arbitrariness – it is less arbitrary to not write express overrule<br />
Aff is doing a little bit better education<br />
Put better arg in the ground – other grounds counterplan and that distinguish competes<br />
Implicit overrules bad – not depth of education, etc.<br />
We win rhetoric arg but that is outweighed by damage done to the affirmative<br />
<br />
Win loss of rhetoric, lose implicit overrule counterplans, not sure implicit overrule are good, it is better for neg to debate cases on their merits, they do the exact opposite of the holding<br />
<br />
Need to explicit legal holding – Shepard’s Citations only have cases expressly overruled because it could be confusing to those who study – more thorough articulation of warrant<br />
<br />
2nr needs to extend legal precision and explain what it means<br />
<br />
This arg is hard to win – doesn’t say express overrule, we chose not to write it in<br />
<br />
Clean up the line by line – and in the 2nr be cautious of the line by line, you’re not being as cautious and precise as you could be<br />
<br />
Legal education question – explain a reason why – that would be helpful<br />

VERSUS MILLIKEN – SECTION 5:<br />
<br />
Topicality – must overrule on original grounds<br />
A) Definitions –<br />
1) Must rule on exactly opposite grounds or else the plan reverses and does not overrule. Meghan M. Peterson, Creighton Law Review, April 2004. “The Lawrence Court…. The Fourteenth Amendement”<br />
2) Overrule must shatter previous precedent. ‘Lectric Law Library’s Lexicon 2006 “overrule – to annul… of binding authority”<br />
B) there are eight holdings in Milliken – None about Congress. Syllabus – Reporter of Decisions 1974 “Held: The relief… Detroit’s 276,000 pupils”<br />
C)<br />
1) limits<br />
2) grounds<br />
3) extra T<br />
D) topicality is a voter<br />
<br />
Topicality – must be explicit overrule<br />
A) Overrules must beexplicit – or else they are legally distinct from being an “overrule.” Roseanne R. Pisem, US District Court, 1985 (Brooklyn Law Review, Spring, Lawrev) “As a practical matter…note 46 supra.”<br />
B) Plan doesn’t explicitly overrule<br />
C) Reasons to prefer<br />
a. Ground<br />
b. Limits<br />
D) Voter fairness and education<br />
<br />
<br />
Stare Decisis:<br />
A) Roberts court will be restrained and will not overrule and precedents. Economist 7-1-06 (lexis) “Mature observers of …. Students in May.”<br />
B) Overruling jacks stare decisis. Particularly in Constitutional cases like the aff. Richard Lessner, PhD Baylor, 2003 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.frc.org/get" rel="nofollow">http://www.frc.org/get</a>//ar03c4.cfm)<br />
C) Stare decisis key to democracy. Thomas Healy, JD, 2001 (West Virginia Law Review 104 (43), Fall, lexis)<br />
D) Democracy solves extinction. Larry Diamond, Debbie Lai Loves Him, 1995, p. 6-7)<br />
<br />
Supreme Court Politics: We read overrule and Kennedy internal links.<br />
<br />
Remedial Activism:<br />
A) Remedial activism constrained now but could explode. William P. Marshall, Prof. of Law, 2002 (University of Colorado Law Review – Fall- lawrev) “Remedial activism there… of judicial restraint”<br />
<br />
And, Roberts is bound by precendence. Terry Eastland, Weekly Standard, 2005. (lexis) “As for how…approach to judging.”<br />
B) If given an opportunity, Roberts will jack remedial schemes for lots of stuff. Leahy, (lexis) “The National Urban…people of color”<br />
C) It hurts women – women good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Limit to the Facts CP:<br />
Text: The USSC should limit “Milliken I” to its facts by recognizing that racial segregation is often a vestige of prior discrimination and creates a rebuttable presumption to this effect. The United States Supreme Court will clarify in its decision that Milliken I facts did not speak to limitations on Congress’s power under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment in the US Constitution. The CP solves, without overruling. Stephen (NOT John) Locke, Lawyer, 1992 (Hofstra law Review, Winter, lawrev)<br />
<br />
Case args:<br />
<br />
Racism<br />
1. They’ll say you shouldn’t evaluate disad or ‘backlash’ args – we’ll analogize this to the poor strategy of liberals regarding White flight. Considering DAs is valuable in the desegregation context. Alfred A. Lindseth, Partner at Sutherland, Asbill, and Brennan 1993 (Emory Law Journal, summer, lawrev)”Plaintiffs in desegregation…of white flight”<br />
2. Endorsing consequences is not facially racist and it’s the only appropriate approach. Matthew Silliman, PhD, Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, 2003. (Theory and Research in Education, vol. 3. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://trc.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/1/3/303" rel="nofollow">http://trc.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/1/3/303</a>) “this brings me… continual moral revitalization”<br />
Bioterror<br />
A successful attack would be impossible for terrorists – uncontrollable factors llike weather will jack the, Walter Laqueur, Co-chair International Research Center, 1999. (The New Terrorism, p.244) “Ironically, the major… to state terrorism.”<br />
<br />
Solvency<br />
1. Aff can’t solve – too many controlling precedents since Milliken. Lia B. Epperson, Director of Education NAACP Legal Defense, 2004 (University of Pittsburgh Law Review, fall, lawrev) “Although Supreme Court…school desegregation plan”<br />
Plan is not sufficient –changing remedial scheme not enough. Mark Rahdert, Prof @ Temple U, 2004. (13 Temple Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 785, lexis) “Milliken I has … difficult to find”
