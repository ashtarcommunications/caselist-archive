<br />
1. Their own theory proves the irrelevance of the plan. The creation of absolute foes come from cultural sources and political interest. The distinction between legal and illegal combatant is a symptom of propoganda, absolute warfare, and anger at enemies. None of their evidence is reverse causal – treating the symptom doesn’t prevent political leaders and the public from turning legitimate enemies into absolute foes. The Moussaoui trial had everyone on their soapbox about the incomprehensibility and illegitimacy of terrorism and he wasn’t labeled as an illegal combatant.<br />
2. Turn – appeal to concept of humanity only way to prevent ideology of racial superiority, emnity sets the stage for ideologies worse than Nazism<br />
Hannah Arendt, 1945 (The Portable Hannah Arendt “Organized Guilt and Universal Responsibility,” Collection printed in 2K ed. Peter Baehr, p. 154-155<br />
For many years now we have met Germans who declare ... are capable of bring about.<br />
3. Basing politics in Friend-enemy releationship creates fascist relationships, refusing the simple logic of friend-enemy generates a responsible politics.<br />
Theodor Adorno 47., Minima Moralia, p. 131-132<br />
Passing muster. – For the so-called man of affairs ... such prescribed choices.<br />
4. Schmitt’s own examples prove enmity creates the most destructive wars.<br />
William Scheureman, 2004 (International Law as Historical Myth, Constellations 11 (4) p. 542-544)<br />
According to the concluding chapters of the ... on the European continent itself.<br />
5. That they have an impact disproves their theory of friend-enemy. Caring about the consequence of war implies care for human life in the abstract.<br />
William Scheurman, 2004 (International Law as Historical Myth, Constellations 11 (4) p. 537-538)<br />
Schmitt holds the universalistic aspirations ... pathologies described by him.<br />
6. Liberal universalism isn’t responsible for total war. Non-universalist states fought total wars.<br />
William Scheureman, 2004 (International Law as Historical Myth, Constellations 11 (4) p. 544-546)<br />
The most revealing divergence between Schmitt’s... legacy of liberal universalism.<br />
7. Turn – Enmity creates absolute foes that drive total war<br />
William Scheureman, 2004 (International Law as Historical Myth, Constellations 11 (4) p. 546-547)<br />
Second, Schmitt’s odd periodization obscures ... explain this silence.<br />
8. Their theory is circular and self-contradictory. Using enmity constructs pluralist democracy as absolute enemy.<br />
Chantal Mouffe, 1999 (The Challenge of Carl Schmitt, p. 4-6)<br />
It is important to emphasize that the political ... of our common endeavour.<br />
9. Turn – they demonize non enmity politics. More than liberalism, enmity prescribes a particular political form as the only legitimate one.<br />
Grigoris Ananiadis, 1999 (The Challenge of Carl Schmitt, p. 135-176)<br />
Schmitt’s project is directed against the ... of heir content.<br />
Sherman x<br />
<br />
10. Of course life is full of nasty conflicts – the question is not letting it stay that way all the time between all people. Their lines in the sand and total embrace leave us helpless to criticize racism and virulent nationalism.<br />
Most importantly – all their evidence is suspect – their theory confuses ought with is. When they say “things are the way they are” you should question whether that’s how they have to stay.<br />
William Scheuerman, 1994 (Between the Norm and the Exception: The Frankfurt School and the Rule of Law, p. 23-24)<br />
Because Schmitt’s anti-universalism prevents him ... should stay that way.<br />
11. Appeal to humanity doesn’t automatically collapse into total violence. Continually pressing the limits of what is defined as human generates revitalized democratic politics.<br />
Chantal Mouffe, 1999 (The Challenge of Carl Schmitt, p. 43-44)<br />
Contrary to those who believe in a necessary harmony ... of this constitutive paradox.<br />
<br />
<br />
2NC<br />
This turns their primacy of naming and framing claims. So long as we refuse to question their empirical and normative account we are left with a world of hatred and nationalism. Their affirmative is like the mantra of “post 9-11” world – repeat it enough to yourself and you’ll end up like Samuel Huntington. Maybe things are a bit more complicated and a bit more hopeful.<br />
They make democratic politics impossible. Freedom not to choose to see the world in black and white is true political freedom<br />
William Scheuerman, 1994 (Between the Norm and the Exception: The Frankfurt School and the Rule of Law, p. 194-195)<br />
If the concept ‘enemy’ and ‘fear’ do ... the everyday political universe.<br />
If their theory of politics as friend-enemy is true, the plan can only be a counter-productive adjustment of liberal law.<br />
Paul Hirst, 1999 (The challenge of carl schmitt, ed. chantal mouffe, p. 10-12)<br />
Schmitt may be an authoritarian ... situation actually exists.<br />
Liberal democratic politics doesn’t define enemies as permanent outsiders.<br />
Chantal Mouffe, 1999 (The Challenge of Carl Schmitt, p. 50-51)<br />
What leads Schmitt to formulate ... field of politics.<br />
Rule of law prevents moralization of conflict and creation of absolute enemies.<br />
William Scheureman, 2004 (International Law as Historical Myth, Constellations 11 (4) p. 540-541)<br />
In Schmitt’s reworking of Hobbes ... issues at hand.<br />
Romantacizing the dialectic necessity of friend-enemy romantacies facism<br />
univeraslizing elements of edmocracy are less dangerous<br />
