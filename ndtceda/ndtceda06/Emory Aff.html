The United States Supreme Court should rule that the Commerce Clause provides Congress the authority to enact 42 .U.S.C. §<br />
13981.<br />
<br />
Advantage one – rule of law<br />
<br />
The Morrison precedent is unpredictable – it allows judges to arbitrarily inject their political and economic philosophies with no regard for precedent<br />
Powers, 2002, 75 Temp. L. Rev. 163<br />
“The third purpose of following legal precedent…regulating interstate commerce.”<br />
<br />
Raich decision did not help matters. It leaves Commerce Clause jurisprudence in a state of confusion. The Court must adopt a<br />
clear universal standard or our federal regulatory regime will be based solely on the Justice’s policy preferences<br />
Kreit, 2006, 108 W. Va. L. Rev. 705<br />
“Raich leaves Commerce Clause jurisprudence in…results they think sensible.”<br />
<br />
This lack of judicial predictability is not just a domestic concern. Countries looking to emulate the political and economic<br />
success of the US will look to Supreme Court doctrine as their model<br />
Blaustein, 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0304/ijde/ijde0304.htm" rel="nofollow">http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0304/ijde/ijde0304.htm</a><br />
<br />
This judicial uncertainty undermines the rule of law and risks the global spread of violence<br />
Brahm 05, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/rule_of_law/" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/rule_of_law/</a><br />
“Particularly since the end of the Cold war, the rule of law has increasingly…assist countries construct a rule of law system.”<br />
<br />
This collapse of the rule of law places human survival in jeopardy<br />

Democratic consolidation prevents nuclear conflict<br />

“That Freedom House could count 120…may be still more remote.”<br />
<br />
Finally, the court must abandon Morrison if its decisions are to have any degree of predictability of consistency<br />
Powers, 2002, 75 Temp. L. Rev. 163<br />
“In United States v. Morrison, n358 the United States Supreme Court invalidated the civil remedy…sixty years preceding Lopez.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage Two – Environmental Leadership<br />
Morrison is a direct threat to federal environmental law. The conservative leaning of th Court has set the stage for the demise of<br />
environmental protections<br />
Gildor 2005, Preserving the Priceless, Ecological Law Quarterly<br />
“2. The future impact of Lopez and Morrison on Federal Environmental…law will come true.”<br />
<br />
The current voting pattern of the Court reflects hostility for ALL environmental protection. Morriosn has provided it the legal cover<br />
needed to rollback federal regulations<br />
Klein, 2003, The Environmental Commerce Clause, 27 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 1<br />
“In constrast to the willingness of the five justices…undue interference by the Supreme Court.”<br />
<br />
Morrison places our entire environmental regulatory regime at risk. It will stunt environmental governance by fostering a regime of<br />
overly narrow and parochial statues and regulatory interpretations<br />
Fischer 2004, Harnessing the treaty power in support of environmental regulation of activities that don’t “Substantially affect<br />
interstate commerce”, 22 va. Envtl. L.j. 167<br />
“The supreme court issued an abrupt and miserly delineation…purposes of constitutional justification.”<br />
<br />
Morrison’s constitutional shift undermines national and international cooperation – transactions costs will make reaching an<br />
agreement nearly impossible<br />
Aman, 2004, Indian Journal of Global Legal Studies 11.1 109-137<br />
“Chief Justice Rehnquist now speaks for a majority on a Court…democracy deficits and poverty.”<br />
<br />
Rollback of federal regulations will gut the institutional capcity of governments at all levels to sustain environmental protection<br />
<br />
Glicksman 2006, 41 Wake Forest L. Rev. 719<br />
“A above explored the reasons why state and local government…threats to public health and the environment.”<br />
<br />
This judicial dismantling of our regulatory regime will be modeled globally. US domestic response to environmental issues sends<br />
a global signal environmental regulations are unnecessary<br />
President’s Council on Sustainable Development, 1996, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://clinton4.nara.gov/PCSD/Publications/TF_Reports/amer-chp7.html" rel="nofollow">http://clinton4.nara.gov/PCSD/Publications/TF_Reports/amer-chp7.html</a><br />
“The future of the united states – its security, its prosperity…the great changes taking place.”<br />
<br />
Global environmental trends are at a dangerous crossroads. A rollback in US environmental laws will create a global<br />
environmental leadership vacuum that risks the collapse of our ecological system<br />
Worldwatch Institute, 2001, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mindfully.org/Air/Environment-Deangerous-Crossroads.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindfully.org/Air/Environment-Deangerous-Crossroads.htm</a><br />
“Global environment trends have reached a…economy in the new millennium?”<br />
<br />
Rapid deterioration of the global environment risk human extinction<br />
Brown 96, 5 dick. J. env. L. pol. 175<br />
“Globalization of markets and communications…including the human species.”<br />
<br />
And dismantling the domestic regulatory regime undermines the perception of the US as a reliable international partner. We will<br />
forfeit our international political capital and moral authority<br />
Walter, New York Times, 8-28, 2002<br />
“At present there is much talk about the unparalleled strength…option for American policymakers.”<br />
<br />
The ensuing power vaccum will inevitably result in a global nuclear catastrophe<br />
Ferguson 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html%21id=110005244" rel="nofollow">http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html!id=110005244</a><br />

<br />
2. Slipery slope erases precedent<br />
Meyer, 94, 61 U.Chi. L. Rev. 423, Spring<br />
“The Court has not maintained this positive…slippery slope it is traversing.”<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Distinguishing Morrison creates lower court confusion</strong><br />
Fischer, 2005, 10 Nexus J. Op. 99<br />
“The Court had not yet handed down its ruling…uniform approach to aggregation.”<br />
“Another way would be to distinguish Morrison and Lopez on their facts and find the intrastate activity at issue in Raich to fall “on the constitutional side of the line that separates the Lopez and Morrison case”<br />
“But for the Court to rule so narrowly would be regrettable, because this would fail to assist lower courts in future cases who find themselves in the impossible situation of attempting to respect the non-infinity principle and the aggregation principle. It would be more likely to perpetuate the Circuit split than to lead the Circuits toward a uniform approach to aggregation.”<br />
<br />
4. This takes out solvency and turns legitimacy<br />
Caminker, 94, 46 Stn. L. Rev. 817<br />
“Uniformity of federal law interpretation…we live under the rule of law.”<br />

Advantage 2: Legitimacy<br />
<br />
The court maintains its legitimacy by adhering to a doctrine of requiring special justification to overrule precedent<br />
Sellers, 06 (Mortimer, 54 Am. J. Comp. L. 67, “LEGAL HISTORY AND LEGAL THEORY: The Doctrine of Precedent in the United States of America”, Fall, lexis)<br />
<br />
Lawrence v. Texas gives a striking example of the limits of precedent as applied to liberty … &quot;special justification&quot; to justify the damage to settled expectations they inevitably represent. n171<br />
<br />
The Roberts Court is adhering to precedent<br />
The Economist, 12/16/06 (“Shrinking Supremes”, lexis)<br />
<br />
But is the court acquiring a taste for modesty? John Roberts … fierce battles—most notably abortion, the death penalty and religious freedom.<br />
<br />
Reversing the precedent set by the Morrison decision is a constitutional revolution that shreds court legitimacy- it reverses a “super precedent” which is a uniquely severe violation of stare decisis<br />

The US promotes polyarchy<br />
William Robinson, Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Tennesse, 1996, Promoting Polyarchy, p. 49-50<br />
<br />
What US policymakers mean by “democracy promotion” is the promotion of polyarchy … both “democratization” and “democracy promotion” literature.<br />
<br />
That leads to elite domination and stifles genuine forms of democracy.<br />
William Robinson, Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Tennesse, 1996, Promoting Polyarchy, p. 57-58<br />

In sharp contrast to polyarchy, popular democracy is concerned with both process and outcome … It is what Carl Cohen refers to as the “breadth, depth, range” of democracy.<br />

Contention One is Inherency:<br />
<br />
Initially note that the Court uses Milliken to create an ahistorical and restrictive interpretation of Congress’ 14th Amendment Section 5 powers.<br />

<br />
In fact, the quotations used by Justice Kennedy do not support his position… was impermissible because there only was proof of an intra-district violation. n63<br />
<br />
And, historically, the Court has recognized broad Section 5 powers for Congress, but now, the “New Federalist” Court has rejected this proposition in ALL of its Section 5 decisions.<br />

<br />
B. Section 5 Jurisprudence in the Civil-Rights Era (1960s-1980s) … little discretion to Congress when fashioning Section 5 enforcement legislation.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the Courts invalidation of civil rights legislation sends a powerful message that it is the exclusive arbiter of constitutionality. This a death blow to Congress’ Section 5 powers.<br />

The Fourteenth Amendment Mandates that Enforcement of Equal Protection Rights…, and they must be considered in conjunction with these equal protection principles. n206<br />

<br />
D. Milliken as an Illustration - The factors discussed above are illustrated by the situation… of school desegregation still has something to teach us about Section 5.<br />

Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974), by holding that Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment in the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to legislate inter-district school remedies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention two is Disease:<br />
<br />
First, Supreme Court restrictions of Congressional Section 5 powers undermines Congress’ ability to establish a federal public health policy to combat disease outbreak.<br />

In 1999 the Congress appropriated $121 million to the CDC… the infectious disease surveillance system in particular.<br />
<br />
And, despite current governmental efforts, a lack of coordination between state and federal bodies precludes an effective response to a bird flu pandemic. The only obstacle barring Congressional plans to integrate public health services is the Supreme Courts’ restrictive interpretation of Section 5 powers.<br />

<br />
This scenario, as frightening as it is… a 60 percent mortality rate is estimated.<br />

Important challenges remain… response efforts may be compromised.<br />

A stronger mandate from the federal government… well-coordinated response in containing it.<br />

Furthermore, economic collapse spurs nationalism, ethnic conflict, AIDS, and famine.<br />

Contention three is a Question of Balance:<br />
<br />
Supreme Court limits on Congress’ Section 5 powers are inconsistent with the core values of Federalism. In order to accrue the benefits of federalism we must replace the Court’s formalistic balancing act with our notion of federalism as empowerment.<br />

<br />
Secondly, the Court’s curtailment of Congress’ Section 5 powers plants the seeds for a combative relationship between Congress and the States that will eradicate federalism.<br />

Plan: The United States Supreme Court should rule that Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment in the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to legislate interdistrict school desegregation remedies<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 – Dignity<br />
<br />
Milliken held that decisions about the racial composition of a school are immutable private and local choices. It established a precedence that favored preservation of local autonomy over the pursuit of justice<br />
Bryant 97 – 96 J.D. @ Harvard Law School [Meredith Lee Bryant , Associate @ Sidley &amp; Austin, Washington, D.C., “Combating School Resegregation Through Housing: A Need For A Reconceptualization Of American Democracy And The Rights It Protects,” Harvard BlackLetter Law Journal, Spring 1997, 13 Harv. BlackLetter J. 127]<br />
<br />
The decision stigmitizes minority children by sending a message that they were defective and should be shunned. The Supreme Court has an obligation to address this harm<br />
Lenhardt 04 - Fellow @ Georgetown University Law Center [R.A. Lenhardt, Professor of Law @ Fordham University Law School “Understanding The Mark: Race, Stigma, And Equality In Context,” New York University Law Review, June 2004, 79 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 803]<br />
<br />
The court’s decision to leave school segregation unremedied normalizes a pervasive form dehumanization that sends the chilling message that some lives are NOT worthy of a dignified existence<br />
Andrews 03 - Professor of Law @ University of San Francisco [Rhonda V. Magee Andrews,“The Third Reconstruction: An Alternative to Race Consciousness and Colorblindness in Post-Slavery America,” Alabama Law Review, Winter 2003, 54 Ala. L. Rev. 483]<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s evasion of dignitary concerns ignores the fact that segregation primarily functions are to degrade, dishonor, isolate, and ostracize. It must actively affirm dignity to open space for substantive racial justice.<br />
Bracey 05 - Professor of Law @ Washington University School of Law [Christopher A. Bracey, “Race Jurisprudence And The Supreme Court: Where Do We Go From Here?: Dignity In Race Jurisprudence,” University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law, February 2005, 7 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 669]<br />
<br />
A doctrinal shift is of paramount importance because this denial of dignity destroys the value of life and outweighs all calculable impacts<br />
Berube 97 – Professor of Communication Studies @ University of South Carolina [David M., &quot;Nanotechnological Prolongevity: The Down Side,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/prolong.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/prolong.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
Subpoint B – Court Action Solves<br />
<br />
Acknowledging the corrosive and disabling impact of dehumanization is the 1st and final frontier in our pursuit of substantive racial justice. Only the Supreme Court’s can renew our commitment to acknowledging and affirming the self-worth and social value of dehumanized communities.<br />
Bracey 05 - Professor of Law @ Washington University School of Law [Christopher A. Bracey, “Race Jurisprudence And The Supreme Court: Where Do We Go From Here?: Dignity In Race Jurisprudence,” University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law, February 2005, 7 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 669]<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 – Section 5<br />
<br />
The Court uses Milliken to create an ahistorical and restrictive interpretation of Congress’ 14th Amendment Section 5 powers<br />
Chemerinsky 04 - Professor of Public Interest Law, Legal Ethics, and Political Science @ University of Southern California. [Erwin Chemerinsky, Exploring The History, Evolution, And Future Of The Fourteenth Amendment: Politics, Not History, Explains The Rehnquist Court, Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review, Spring 2004, 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 647]<br />
<br />
Its desegregation case law is a quintessential example of this ahistorical interpretation of Section 5. It gives the Congress the right and responsibility to desegregate schools through whatever means it deems appropriate.<br />
Levy 98 – 98 J.D. @ Boston University [Jared A. Levy, 98-99 Law clerk with The Honorable Patrick Michael Duffy, a U.S. District Court Judge in Charleston, South Carolina “Blinking At Reality: The Implications Of Justice Clarence Thomas's Influential Approach To Race And Education,” Boston University Law Review, April 1998, 78 B.U.L.

Your author concludes that even legal scholars would apply the structural necessity test differently<br />
<br />
Harsch, 2k1<br />
While the work of other scholars....discussion of the commerce power”<br />
<br />
Even if Harswh’s most specific points in his article the best definition of structural necessity forces an incredible amount of judge intervention in assessing if the states are “able” to do something and haven’t. the extreme vagueness of this, combined with our Inherency evidence Proves that the supreme court will always say the states are able to do legislation on the environment etc. but just haven’t, which means the CP’s overall effect on shifting the balance back to the Federal Government is Zero<br />
<br />
The scholarship behind the CP is absurd, its grounded in a 17876 Virginia Commonwealth Piece of legislation that was tied to the articles of confederation not even the constitution<br />
<br />
Rasch 2k1<br />
“the idea that the court’s commerce clause doctrine.....support for a “structural necessity” test.”<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Morrison represented the pinnacle of its attempt to curtail federal power—morrison went beyond the Lopez precedent to undermine the Rational basis test and prior precedent on the Commerce Clause<br />

228 prior overrules. Costello 1985 (11/29/05 CRS Report for Congress&quot; <u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/data/2005/upl-meta-crs%208231/RL33172_2005Nov29.pdf?PHPSESSID=e4b2fcc19fb8f1222a05b5ca4fe3f64b" rel="nofollow">http://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs//data/2005/upl-meta-crs 8231/RL33172_2005Nov29.pdf?PHPSESSID=e4b2fcc19fb8f1222a05b5ca4fe3f64b</a></u>)<br />
&quot;The Supreme Court has overruled 228 of its own decisions over the years&quot;<br />
<br />
2. More Overruling Coming. CSM 10-2-06 &quot;Constitutional scholars and other analysts are watching closely&quot; and<br />
&quot;they are likely to align with the court's conservative wing and that Kennedy will be in position to provide the decisive fifth vote&quot;<br />
<br />
3. The Court must overturn Morrison if its decisions are to be consistent. Powers 02 (Spring 2002 &quot;A retreat from clarity&quot; 519 US 598 (2000), Temple Law Review, Spring 2002, 75 Temple L Rev 163) &quot;The United States Supreme Court invalidated the civil remedy provision&quot; and &quot;a jurisprudence that served the Court, and more importantly the citizens of our United States for sixty years preceding Lopez&quot;<br />
<br />
4. Consistency key to legitimacy. Padden 94 ( 82 Georgetown Law Journal 1689, &quot;Overruling Decisions in the Supreme Court: The Role of a Decision's vote, Age, subject matter in the application of stare decisis after Payne v Tennessee&quot;, April, LN) &quot;If an inconsistency exists it is better for congress to clarify the law&quot; and &quot;it is preferable for the Court to explicitly overrule the precedent and reestablish certainty in the present state of the law&quot;<br />
<br />
5. Distinguishing precedent without rational grounds destroys court legitimacy. Barrett 2003 (74 U Colo. Law Review 1011, &quot;Stare Decisis and Due Process&quot;, Summer, LN) &quot;the ability to distinguish cases however either honestly or disingenuously&quot; and &quot;at least erroneous and at times preposterous&quot;<br />
<br />
6. Overrules increase legitimacy. Rehnquist 86 (66 B. U. L. Rev 345 &quot;The power that shall be visisted in<br />
a precedent: Stare Decisis The Constitution and the Supreme Court&quot; March, LN) &quot;The supreme court's legitimacy would be enhanced by an abandonment of stare decisis&quot; And &quot;prior rule serves none of the values underlying stare decisis and can claim &quot;legitimacy&quot; solely on the ground that it did not explicitly overrule precedent&quot;<br />

Emory HH—Morrison AFF<br />
<br />
Gender violence advantage:<br />
Morrison decision is a battle over the role international human rights law will play in guiding US domestic politics. Its appeal to exclusive local jurisdiction buffers the US law from international norms—Resnik 2001—Prof of Law @ Yale, feb. 8-10, 2001,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://home.nyc.rr.com/constitution2001/Jedlee" rel="nofollow">http://home.nyc.rr.com/constitution2001/Jedlee</a>; “The Constitution requires a distinction….for which democracy stands.”<br />
<br />
Morrison undermines the US’ ability to align its response to gender violence with the international consensus. Claims of unitary jurisdictional control of gendered violence are out of step with transnational human rights developments—Resnik 2002, “Engendering Democracy through Understanding Federal Family Law” The Good Society, 11.3 (2002), 79-83 “What is the difference between these many provisions…behavior naturalized through jurisdictional claims.”<br />
<br />
The Cout’s appeal to local jurisdiction undermines the importation and absorption of international human rights norms in the US. This stance prevents a realignment of US domestic politics with the agenda of int’l women’s rights movements—Resnik 06, 115 Yale L.J. 1564, “Introducing the many iterations of federalism…foreign sources will have…influence other countries”<br />
<br />
Stripping Congress of its responsibility and power to deal with gendered violence destroys international norms that prevent most violations of human rights—Copelon 2002, Women’s Rights in Theory and Practice…Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, May 21-22, 2002, pg. womenlaw.pdf, “This is a critical time in the United States…to imagine a world where all women have human rights—and to build it”<br />
<br />
US support for int’l human rights norm challenges ubiquitous barbarity against women that threatens millions annually—Fellmeth 2000, Human Rights Quarterly, 22.3 (2000), “Feminism and International Law…”; “In previous sections of this article…negotiated them…human rights activists while the ‘big boys’”<br />
<br />
Additionally continued US devaluation of a global human rights norm threatens collective survival—Copelon 1999, New York City Law Review, 1998-99, 3 N.Y. City. L. Rev. 59; “Although the UDHR has been…safety and security….shadow of the universal version…on both domestic and foreign policy”<br />
<br />
Federal Civil Rights Remedy is a critical component of this political reorientation . Because it primes high-powered federal actors to use their resources to protect women’s rights the civil rights remedy has tremendous symbolic value in reframing our national dialogue—Resnik 2002, Yale Journal of Law and Feminism, 2002, 14 Yale L.J. &amp; Feminism 393; “As enacted, VAWA was unmistakably a compromise…had symbolic resonance…as contrasted with national-legal requirements”<br />

- their answers to the court politics are Non unique Commerce clause increases court capital Kennedy would vote in minority or he loves the plan No spill over – Kennedy is key for 31 cases No impact – win doesn’t cause warming regs No impact – years to implement No impact – threat alone is key<br />
- in the 2ar - they went for the argument that the da links to the counter plan,non unique, and commerce clause link turn, and that threat of a suit isenough - Went for the argument that the counter plan doesn’t overrulelopez and thus doesn’t solve the same precedent - Went for a double bind that either the cp overrule swank and linksto the net benefit, or it doesn’t and then it doesn’t solve any of the case<br />

Plan – The United States Supreme Court should rule that section 5 of the 14th amendment provides Congress the authority to enact 42 U.S.C. Sec. 13981<br />
<br />
Morrison operated under the logic of categorical federalism – it delegated violence against women to the local sphere in which public lives cannot be regulated by the federal government – this not only ignores the instances of “legitimate” federal regulation that keeps women in the home, but prevents criticism of the gendered household<br />
Reznik 2001, Dec. , 2003, www.binghamton.edu/womhist/vawa/doc23.htm<br />
Moreover, national borders are not the only and was in press<br />
<br />
Using jurisdiction as a justification for inaction against gendered violence relies on fictitious boundaries between spheres of public, private, male, female, which preserve male control and shelter the government against protest<br />

Delineating between federal and states rights justifies binaries between nation and outside and upholds the boundaries of the nuclear family, both of which ensure the permanence of institutional power that prevents societal transformation<br />

Recognition of women’s civil identity is the condition of possibility for a radical transformation of the agency of women in both the public and private spheres – Morrison was the quintessential example of women’s rights being solely defined in relation to their contingent citizenship within a gender hierarchy<br />

we meet – Milliken was an equal protection decision where the court ruled that localities weren’t required to enforce desegregation because they were autonomous entities – the equal protection clause wasn’t sufficient to require a remedy for desegregation in interdistrict cases.

Milliken determined that the lack of intradistrict remedies isn’t a 14th amendment violation<br />

--evidence that says the constitutional reasoning for the holding was based upon something<br />
--emory really believes this: since all congress can do is enforce the 14th amendment, then ruling on section 5 is exactly the same thing as reversing the holding in the milliken decision about interdistrict remedies and equal protection.<br />

Plan: The US Supreme Court should rule that section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment in the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to legislate interdistrict school desegregation remedies.<br />
<br />
Case outline:<br />
Milliken held that decisions about the racial composition of a school are immutable private and local choices. It established a precedence that favored preservation of local autonomy over the pursuit of justice. Bryant 1997 at Harvard Law School<br />
The court uses Milliken to create an ahistorical and restrictive interpretation of Congress’ 14th Amendment Section 5 powers (1AC). Chemerinsky 2004 at USC<br />

Plans:<br />
(read vs. NU BW) The United States Supreme Court should rule that school district lines may be casually ignored because they entrench segregation.<br />
<br />
Other plans:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that the boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts are unconstitutional because they entrench segregation.<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that the boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts may be set aside by consolidating the separate units for remedial purposes or by imposing a cross-district remedy even if a constitutional violation is not identified.<br />

The Milliken decision is premised on legal fiction-Local governments are nothing more than bureaucratic mechanisms of state government. However, the Supreme Court’s appeal to an independent municipality will continue to have profound influence over the structuring of our society. The Milliken decision segmented our society in ways that make broad social responsibility irrelevant compared to the interests of local autonomy.<br />

<br />
Milliken is primarily responsible for the political and legal fragmentation of the city and its suburbs. The decision constitutes an abandonment of acknowledgement of and responsibility for deterioration of the inner-city.

This seperation of peoples, lack of public responsibility, and the demise of truly public spaces has rendered certain populations disposable and creates a militaristic society. Reinvigorating public spheres, particularly through education, and dismantling the current insulation of populations is necessary to prevent the powers that be from permitting and pushing for the death and suffering of countless humans.<br />

PLAN: THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD HOLD THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOUNDARIES TO INTERDISTRICT REMEDIES VIOLATE THE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT.<br />

This reinterpretation of 14th Amendment allows it to serve as a bridge to a post-subordination consciousness that will fundamentally transform humanity.

Revising 14th Amendment doctrine to address school segregation will integrate distinctly racialized communities into one human family.

Their backlash politics and claims of infeasibility constitute a morally and intellectually bankrupt rhetorical maneuver.

World in neoliberal economy- may be pretty bad but it’s not comparative- didn't contest the 1st advantage, Bearden and Khalizad say that neoliberalism exploits resources- results in global nuclear war- risk that it is not inevitable- conceded extinction- collapse is not inevitable- plan solves system collapse- affirmative would solve based on federal reserve policies- in a world where the aff solves doesn't matter- life is a pre-requisite to all neg claims- preventing the US from going into war- human rights claims- solve jurisdictional questions of public, local and national. Questions of ethics don't matter because extinction outweighs- cause US to withdraw- US withdraws from neoliberal order- 100% impact turn- we don't need evidence- the entire 1AC solves- not a reason as to why the affirmative would not solve. Worst instance of econ collapse- this is why their argument is disproved- and we bounce back. Mischaracterizes arguments- we should prevent people from skirting human rights obligations- case has nothing to do with economics- 100% solvency and how not dealing with neoliberal order leads to bad things- Copeland evidence- solves<br />

Nothing to do with civil remedy<br />

Something that deserves federal attention- nothing to do with an economic justification- dollar turn on violence against women<br />

The court’s decision to leave school segregation unremedied normalizes a pervasive form dehumanization that sends the chilling message that some lives are NOT worthy of a dignified existence<br />
Andrews 03 - Professor of Law @ University of San Francisco [Rhonda V. Magee Andrews,“The Third Reconstruction: An Alternative to Race Consciousness and Colorblindness in Post-Slavery America,” Alabama Law Review, Winter 2003, 54 Ala. L. Rev. 483]<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s evasion of dignitary concerns ignores the fact that segregation primarily functions are to degrade, dishonor, isolate, and ostracize. It must actively affirm dignity to open space for substantive racial justice.<br />
Bracey 05 - Professor of Law @ Washington University School of Law [Christopher A. Bracey, “Race Jurisprudence And The Supreme Court: Where Do We Go From Here?: Dignity In Race Jurisprudence,” University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law, February 2005, 7 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 669]<br />
<br />
A doctrinal shift is of paramount importance because this denial of dignity destroys the value of life and outweighs all calculable impacts<br />

<br />
Subpoint B – Court Action Solves<br />
<br />
Acknowledging the corrosive and disabling impact of dehumanization is the 1st and final frontier in our pursuit of substantive racial justice. Only the Supreme Court’s can renew our commitment to acknowledging and affirming the self-worth and social value of dehumanized communities.<br />

Advantage 2 – Section 5<br />
<br />
The Court uses Milliken to create an ahistorical and restrictive interpretation of Congress’ 14th Amendment Section 5 powers<br />

[Erwin Chemerinsky, Exploring The History, Evolution, And Future Of The Fourteenth Amendment: Politics, Not History, Explains The Rehnquist Court, Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review, Spring 2004, 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 647]<br />
<br />
Its desegregation case law is a quintessential example of this ahistorical interpretation of Section 5. It gives the Congress the right and responsibility to desegregate schools through whatever means it deems appropriate.<br />

We were neg and went for an environmental doomsdaying kritik (Buell). We also ran T-sub silentio not topical, Anticipatory Overrule CP, Democracy Promotion Bad DA, an Economy DA and defense on case advantages. Nothing particularly unusual about their answers; in the 2ar they went for a few framework arguments on representational kritiks, some Jervis evidence, and some no links and no alt solvency arguments.<br />
<br />
we were neg...1nc was topicality, lower courts counterplan with majoritarianism net benefit, kritik<br />
of environmental doomsaying representations, a sanctions case turn against their international law advantage, and bioD defense. 2ac analytically answered T and sanctions--read keystone species cards to answer bio D defense.against CP: theory-you can't fiat our agent, supreme court key to commerce clause jurisprudence (i don't know cites), no net benefit args, and some supreme court signal key to international law modeling advantage.Kritik-mostly framework arguments. they read a jervis card about how representations don't affect policy discussion and are irrelevant, made a bunch of abuse claims, then read a couple cards about how representational practices come from a place of privilege.

They had poor answers to court clog and the gay havens DA. They read a bioterror addon in the 2AC (which I believe one of the other emory teams reads as a 1AC advantage.. its in the casebook). Their response to the states CP was simply that we didn't create an international model.<br />

We went for T. Their strategy was basically to say PICs were bad, but the 2AR was bad on that. Its prolly cuz they're good.<br />

<strong>Morrison is still the controlling precedent even after Raich. The next case will determine the Court’s future direction</strong><br />

<strong>Morrison undermines the US’ ability to align its response to gender violence with the international consensus. Claims of unitary jurisdictional control of gendered violence are out of step with transnational human rights developments</strong><br />

<strong>The Court’s appeal to local jurisdiction undermines the importation and absorption of international human rights norms in the US. This stance prevents a realignment of US domestic politics with the agenda of the international women’s rights movements</strong><br />

<strong>Now is a KEY time. Stripping Congress of its responsibility and power to deal with gendered violence threatens to destroy international norms that prevent most egregious violations of human rights</strong><br />

<strong>Federal Civil Rights Remedy is a critical component of this political reorientation. Because it primes high-powered federal actors to use their resources to protect women’s rights the civil rights remedy has tremendous symbolic value in reframing our national dialogue.</strong><br />

<br />
As enacted, VAWA was unmistakably a compromise on many fronts and….relegate it to a somewhat lesser stature, as about local - as contrasted with national - legal requirements.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The federal civil remedy is critical to galvanize the human rights movement in the US. We must signal the national importance of addressing gender motivated violence in order to encourage women to take on the human right-defined identity</strong><br />
