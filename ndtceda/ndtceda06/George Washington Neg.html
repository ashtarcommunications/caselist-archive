<strong>We must aggressively problematize the legal system if we desire to have an impact on systemic racism. Working through current conceptions of integration and color blindness will only make the problem worse.</strong><br />

<strong>The conceptualization of racism as abnormal obliterates it from our collective consciousness, preventing progress. Not until we realize that we are all racists can we get passed the ‘innocent white victim’ defense that precludes a deconstruction of white privilege.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The very concept of equal protection makes false presumptions of fairness and justice that fail those most in need. While education is a laudable goal, the plan is analogous to trying to solve a homeless person’s hunger by giving them a small can of beluga caviar. The constitution will still fail to protect the needs of poor black schoolchildren and their families before and after the plan.</strong><br />

<strong>1. The effects of Milliken upon American schools are permanent. The Supreme Court has created barrier after barrier to ever achieving school desegregation, overruling it will change hardly anything. Circle and star this evidence.</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>The educational system is too racially biased for the idea of equal opportunity to ever come true for minority students. Curriculum, Assessment, Instruction and funding all ensure inequality will continue.</strong><br />

<strong>We must constantly speak in culturally significant ways. Every time we use the discourse of racial justice and legal equity we more deeply entrench the structures of oppression we must escape. Only utilizing cultural language through individual vocal protests and representations of a different social common sense can overcome racial differences.</strong><br />

Originalism DA<br />
A. The constitution is necessary to preserve liberty and to maintain a free government. To dismiss adherence to original intent by the courts destroys the essence of a fixed constitution, undermines the rule of law and subjects us to arbitrary usurpations of power<br />
Charles Warren Berger, <em>Government By the Judiciary</em>, 1977, pp. 289-299<br />
<br />
B. It's the affirmative's burdern to prove their plan is consistent with original intent. All of the evidence indicates the framers rejected an expansive view of the 14th amendment.<br />
Berger, pp. 16-19<br />
<br />
C. 1) Accepting the logic of judicial interpretation sets up a slippary slope where any constitutional violation is acceptable<br />
<br />
Berger, pp. 289-299<br />
<br />
2) Framework -- the Affirmative must justify their violation of the constitution before you can look at any of their impacts. It is an a priori issue.<br />
<br />
Steven Carter, 1987, <em>Brigham Young University Law Review</em>, &quot;Constitutionalism assigns enormous importance to process&quot;<br />
<br />
D. Alternative --- to avoid constitutional violations we must endorse the idea that constitutional change must come from article V and not from the courts.<br />
<br />
Berger, pp. 289-299<br />
