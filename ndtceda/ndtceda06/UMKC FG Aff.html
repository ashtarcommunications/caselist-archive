UMKC GF – Aff vs. Wake GL, Round 7<br />
1ac – casey, same as casebook<br />
2AC AT: Amendment CP<br />
CP destroys constitutional legitimacy turning solvency.<br />
Kent Greenwalt, 98 – “Symposium: Reflections on City of Boerne vs. Flors: Why Now is not the time for constitutional amendment,” 39 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 689<br />
“Our country has never…avoided when possible”<br />
Judicial reinterpretation destroys CP solvency – the 14th amendment proves<br />
David Strauss, 01 – “Commentary: the irrelevance of constitutional amendments,” 114 Harv. L. Rev. 1457<br />
“On these occasions the formal…in the South”<br />
We solve your link. The visual symbolic action of the court imposed by the plan will supercharge legitimacy.<br />
James Gibson, 06 – “The legitimacy o fhte united states supreme court in a polarized polity,” December 3<br />
“We presume that the…of the institution”<br />
The supreme court will interpret the amendment narrowly.<br />
Jeffrey Segal, 02 – <em>The Supreme Court and the Attitudinal Model,</em> p. 5<br />
“If action by Congress to undo…purpose of the amendment”<br />
The belief that Constitutional amendments are the only legitimate way to create new constitutional rights comes at the expense of courts reinterpreting rights as expansive. This encourages judicial decisionmaking that prevents progressive law and allows other branches of government to actively oppress groups by taking away rights<br />
Lynne Henderson, 91 – 66 Ind. L. J. 379<br />
“Monaghan, relying heavily…portions of the Bill of Rights”<br />
The notion that law can only function through stability and strict adherence to precedent is the root of authoritarianism – it prevents justices from creating progressive legal change that would prevent oppression.<br />
Lynne Henderson, 91 – 66 Ind. L. J. 379<br />
“Nowhere is an authoritarian…authoritarian arguments”<br />
2AC AT: Minimalism<br />
Strict adherence to stare decisis encourages absolutism in he law, justifying oppression and authoritarianism.<br />
Lynne Henderson, 91 – 66 Ind. L. J. 379<br />
“Erwin Chemerinsky began his foreword…human progress”<br />
Strict adherence to precedent promotes an inflexible view of the law, legitimizing racism, sexism, and violence<br />
Lynne Henderson, 91 – 66 Ind. L. J. 379<br />
“Recently, the words…opted for the latter”<br />
The most recent and convincing evidence concludes against the theory of judicial capital<br />
Paul Brace, 99 – “Judicial choice and the plitics of abortion,”<br />
“The power of courts to thwart…in strategic voting”<br />
2AC AT: Court Capital<br />
The independent judiciary does not concern itself with capital<br />
Louise Wienberg, 94 0 65 U. Colo. L. Rev. 887<br />
“The historical record is that…independent judiciary”<br />
Justice do not worry about capital.<br />
David Landau, 05 – 27 Geo. Wash. Int’l L. Rev. 687<br />
“Theoretically, attitudinalists…resting on the case”<br />

A2 CP<br />
Irigaray doesn’t create static identities or victimize women<br />
Whitford, 91 [<u>Luce Irigaray: Philosophy in the Feminine</u>, p. 11]<br />
“The complexity of her work…stand in relation to feminism?”<br />
We don’t link to Foucault’s repressive hypothesis. We actually link turn it.<br />
Zakin, 2007 [<u>Returning to Irigaray: Feminist Philosophy, Politics, and the Question of Unity</u>, p. 197]<br />
“This is not simply a reassertion…onto the body in virulent form.”<br />
No link: your authors wouldn’t classify our aff as republicanism<br />
Rubenfeld, 89 [“The Right to Privacy,” 102 Harv. L. Rev. 737]<br />
“We have seen that personhood…challenge to the personhood principle.”<br />
Rubenfeld’s commitment to methodological globalism leads him to overlook homosexual sodomy laws which are discontinuous with privacy cases such as abortion (i.e. the CP<br />
Thomas, 92 [“Beyond the Privacy Principle,” Columbia Law Review]<br />
“The commitment to methodological globalism…other, more substantive sources.”<br />
Gay protections form sodomy statues is key to avoiding violence &amp; societal homophobia<br />
Thomas, 92<br />
“To appreciate the ways …violence in particular.”<br />
Homophobia leads to genocide: legal protections are key<br />
Cohen, 2K [“More censorship or less discrimination? Sexual orientation hate propaganda in multiple perspectives,” McGill law review]<br />
“The above phenomena…anti gay hate propaganda.”<br />
The court would interpret personhood to include homosexuals: empirically proven<br />
Rubenfeld 89<br />
“Let us look carefully…and in the literature.”<br />
Privacy requires a denial of the body &amp; identity for an ideal but anonymous subject: this theory has multiple debilitating problems with it.<br />
Thomas 92<br />
“Defenders of the right argue…suffice to establish this contention.”<br />
Rubenfeld’s alternative/CP would continue to reinforce oppression and inequality and would even allow for abortion funding to be removed<br />
Olsen 89 [“The Supreme Court, 1988 Term: Comment: Unraveling Compromise,” 103 Harv. L. Rev. 105]<br />
“Drawing upon the ideas…the denial would be different.”<br />
A2 Cap<br />
Our aff reorients contract theory, taking away its supposed neutrality. Sexuate rights generate conditions for self definition. This changes the economic structures of the liberal state, alleviating the violence of capital<br />
Fermon 98 [<u>Diacritics</u>, p. 120-137]<br />
“Irigaray’s critique of liberal society…of a fully embodied existence.”<br />
A2 CRR<br />
<ol><ol><li>Double bind: either plan spills over, in which case CP doesn’t solve other ethics or no spillover, i.e. no link</li><li>If VAWA were revived, it’d be a new form based on selfhood, not SQ based on victimization.</li><li>SQ worse.</li></ol></ol><h3 id="toc19"><a name="Round the 3rd-UMKC FG Aff-Answers To Major Case Args"></a><strong><em>Answers To Major Case Args</em></strong></h3>

Impacts Not Quantifiable<br />
Violence Inevitable in a World Where Women don’t have rights<br />
All about the language of the decision<br />
Chi ’97<br />
All args are irrelevant – they are from the male perspective<br />
XXX<br />
We outweigh eugenics<br />
Eugenics now – we solve<br />
Technology as neutral now<br />
Gynecologists not unique – you don’t eliminate<br />
<br />
<strong>Capital D.A.</strong><br />
Court to Pass Judgement<br />
Regulations Illegal under clean air act<br />
Regulation of GHG has little effect<br />
Portrayal of Envt is Managerialist – undermines idea of humanity – mchorter ‘92<br />
Impact is destruction of the planet<br />
Xxx<br />
Aff solves – by using the law to eliminate gender differences – through eco-feminism<br />
CP<br />
They don’t solve the aff – way women define their imaginary<br />
Perm: DO Both – No Reason<br />
Racist Eugenics without the plan<br />
Rollback – s.c. will rollback<br />
We affirm abortion rights – key to solve<br />
<br />
<strong>K</strong><br />
Patriarchy Rising – Leads to Capitalist Domination<br />
Creates a Solv Def for the alt<br />
We are the only way to solve<br />
Pervis ‘92<br />
Schwab ’98 link turns your arg – only rights can solve your argument<br />
Xxx<br />
Caldwell in ’02 = no solvency – only way to create intersections to solve oppression<br />
Your argument assumes neutrality – this guts solvency<br />
Perm: DO Both<br />
Rights Key to Struggle Against Capitalism<br />
Framework – you need meaningful political action – pat maintained through materialism<br />
Without Cap Irrel.<br />
No impact to capitalism – the ability to subordinate women is the reason capitalism exists<br />

<br />
Ethics of guilt if we don’t eliminate managerialism – they drop the impact – the end of the life on earth – they don’t solve for this and the case outweighs<br />
We get other types of coalitions –<br />
Femalss get abortions now<br />
No warrant for tearning the case<br />
Impact doesn’t cause breast cancer<br />
Their alt causes material Dominaion<br />
Murray ’04 – repression of difference causes capitalism not the other way – capitalism masks sex change –<br />
Try to get reproductive reform is how we got here.<br />
We position women as subjects<br />
Scwab – radically change the law – the neg doesn’t do that – the permutation makes no sense – you cant win a link<br />
Way we relate to the movement is important to how we deconstruct<br />
You don’t completely withdraw, which mean you link just as much as<br />
The perm is net beneficial<br />

THE LAW HAS NULLIFIED WOMEN’S SELFHOOD THROUGH ITS MASCULINIZING OF THE SELF-AFTER COVERTURE WAS RESCINDED, REPRODUCTIVE LAW HAS BECOME THE SITE OF THIS DENIAL OF AGENCY<br />
Feminist Perspectives on the Self, 1st published June 28, 1999, substantive revision Jan 7, 2004; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.science.uva.nl/%7Eseop/entries/feminism-self/" rel="nofollow">http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries//feminism-self/</a><br />
“Feminist critiques, we have seen...gesture of self-renunciation.”<br />
<br />
THIS DENIAL OF SELFHOOD IS PIVOTAL TO AGENCY—MAKING THE MASCULINE THE NORM CREATES THE FEMININE AS THE OTHER, DEVOID OF PERSONHOOD, IDENTITY, THE LAW RENDERS WOMEN AS MERE BODIES<br />
Diana Meyers, Feminist Perspectives on the Self, 1st published June 28, 1999, substantive revision Jan 7, 2004; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.science.uva.nl/%7Eseop/entries/feminism-self/" rel="nofollow">http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries//feminism-self/</a><br />
“The topic of the self has long...these angles.”<br />
<br />
THIS EXCLUSION SACRIFICES WOMEN BY APPEALING TO A UNIVERSAL EQUALITY-IT’S VISION OF EQUALITY AND NEUTRALITY REQUIRES THE EXCLUSION OF MATERIALITY AND DIFFERENCE FROM CONSIDERATIONS IN THE POLITICAL REALM, FORCING POLITICAL BODIES TO SUCCOMB TO THE UNIVERSAL, ABSOLUTIST VISION OF POLITICS<br />
Anne Caldwell, 2002, Hypatia, 17.4, Transforming Sacrifice: Iragaray and the Politics of Sexual Difference, project Muse<br />
“How does Irigaray see...such as women.”<br />
<br />
THIS IDEAL OF EQUALITY REQUIRES A SUBJECT, MAN, TO BE POSITED AS NATURAL, AND DEFINED IN COMPARISON TO OTHER SUBJECTS BY DISAVOWING MATERIALITY. THE EQUAL SUBJECT REQUIRES THE EXISTENCE OF LESSER SUBJECTS TO JUSTIFY ITSELF. THE FREEDOM OF DEMOCRACY IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE MASTERY OF THINKING THAT EXCLUDES DIFFERENCE IN THE NAME OF AN AUTONOMOUS SELF<br />
Caldwell same cite<br />
“The formation of ideal citizen...autonomy of the self.”<br />
<br />
THE AFF SOLVES FOR SACRIFICE AND VIOLENCE WHICH REMAIN INEVITABLE UNLESS WE ADVANCE WOMEN’S IDENTITIES<br />
Margaret Whitford, 1991, <u>Luce Irigaray: Philosophy in the Feminine</u>, p 145<br />
“If identity is...sacrificial victim”<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey by ruling that the parental consent, informed consent, waiting period, and recordkeeping requirements permitted by the decision are unconstitutional because they violate women’s right to selfhood.<br />
<br />
THE PLAN IS A RADICAL BREAK WITH THE CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS OF EQUALITY AND LIBERTY THAT CURRENTLY UNDERLIE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS<br />
Caldwell same site<br />
“In Irigaray’s words...because of it.”<br />
<br />
CASEY’S REQUIREMENTS DENY WOMEN THE ABILITY TO DEFINE THEIR OWN IMAGINARY—IT RELEGATES WOMEN AS SUBORDINATE TO THE FETUS<br />
Susan Flood Pagliaro, July 2000, Sensible being: sexual difference air, and other universal matters in the thought of luce irigaray, pdf, proquest<br />
“The reduction of woman’s...makes the wrong decision”<br />
<br />
WORKING THROUGH THE LAW IS A CRITICAL STEP TO BROADEN THE RECOGNITION OF DIFFERENCE IN THE LAW-THE PLAN PLACES WOMEN WITHIN THE SYMBOLIC ORDER WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO FORMING COALITIONS<br />
Caldwell same site<br />
“Irigaray’s effort to transform...must repress difference.”<br />
<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE IS A RADICAL BREAK WITH TEMPORALITY—WE SHOULD VIEW THE PLAN AS OPENING A NEW SPACE/TIME THAT DOES NOT RELY ON PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS—THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO A POLITICS OF BECOMING<br />
Ewa Plonowska Ziarek, 1998, Diacritics 28.1 (1998) 60-75, Toward a Radical Female Imaginary: Temporality and Embodiment in Irigaray’s Ethics<br />
“Irigaray’s analysis of Descartes’s...spaces of freedom.”<br />
<br />
A FLUID POLITICS ONLY ASCRIBES IDENTITY TO A UNIVERSAL, WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT OUR ATTACHMENT TO THAT UNIVERSAL IS INCOMPLETE AND SINGULAR IN NATURE. THIS PREVENTS ANY SINGLE SUBJECT FROM NARCISSISTICALLY CLAIMING IT REPRESENTS THE WHOLE, OR IDEAL, SUBJECT<br />
Caldwell same site<br />
“Aside from fearing that...shaped by it.”<br />
<br />
OUR THEORY OPENS THE PATH TO RECOGNIZING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALL FORMS OF OPPRESSION, WHILE SOME MAY ESSENTIALIZE OPPRESSION TO A FEMININE/MASCULINE DICHOTOMY, WE NEED NOT<br />
Caldwell same cite<br />
“If a feminine universal can...necessary exclusion.”
