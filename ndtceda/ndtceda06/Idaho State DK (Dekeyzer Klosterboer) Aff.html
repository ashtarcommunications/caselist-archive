1AC (See Case Book)<br />
2AC<br />
<strong>AT: Framework</strong><br />
1) We Meet; Defend Plan Text<br />
2) C/I – Debate is about competing stories between the 1AC and the 1NC<br />
3) No reason to exclude affirmative<br />
4) Defend quirin overrule<br />
5) Myths are the basis of politics<br />
<br />
<strong>AT CP:</strong><br />
1) Perm; Do Both<br />
2) CP doesn’t solve – lack of burial<br />
3) Must let go of the myt of heroism<br />
4) The States quo is the forgetfulness that Baudrillard is speaking about<br />
5) We don’t forget because it is still in history<br />
<br />
<strong>AT: Myth K</strong><br />
1) Death = Inevitable<br />
2) Myths are used to justify national identity and that’s bad<br />
3) Perm<br />
4) Must bury Captain America, alternative doesn’t solve case<br />
<br />
<strong>AT: T</strong><br />
1) We Meet – Are USSC<br />
2) Defend outcome of plan<br />
3) Get plenty of ground, aside from Court Politics<br />

Quirin – Comics 1AC<br />
Bailey, Brown and Chermak 2003<br />
Media representations of September 11, Pg. 167<br />
“ as a character archetype, the group servant...who uses his powers to replace self-interest with self-cleansing.”<br />
Again BBB<br />
“in the spring of 1941, with the ruthless warmongers of Europe focusing...Americans shall gain the strength and the will to safeguard our shores.”<br />
Michael Shapiro 1999<br />
Cinematic political thought: narrating Race, Nation and Gender<br />
“It remains unclear if the age of nationalism is near and end...dominant national stories that contract the culturally dangerous alien-other”<br />
<br />
Such a mythic and powerful hero could only be made possible by the most dastardly of villains. Who could be more evil that the Nazis? And what could be more terrifying than the invisible Nazi? Ah... which brings us to the heroic tale some are calling, ex parte quirin!<br />
Secret Headquarters, Washington DC, 1942<br />
Assistant: Mr. President! Mr. President!<br />
Roosevelt: What is it Kid?<br />
A: Nazi invaders...gasp... have been found...gulp...on our soil. They disguised themselves among us. They sought to destroy us from within, sir.<br />
R: They will pay or this with their blood!<br />
Combs 1993 “The Reagan Range: The Nostalgic Myth In American Politics” pg. 31<br />
“The myth of the violent avenger without clear...with broader moral and social purposes (Cawelti).”<br />
As the American public heard veiled reports of the fate of the Nazi Saboteurs, they quickly turned to dime store novels about sabotage, and comic boo heroes to come to terms with the new insidious threat. Meanwhile Roosevelt carried out a swift military tribunal meant to execute the villains. The American Supreme Court of Justice quickly upheld the proceedings unanimously in a closed “special session: and in no time nearly all the saboteurs were electrocuted<br />
Many days later, in his secret underground chamber the fearless leader of the Supreme Court of Justice, Stone, Finally gave justification for the executions...<br />
Haupt, Kerpling, Burger, Heinck, Thiel, Neubauer, The Red Skull and Quirin ‘being enemies of the United States and acting for...the German Reich, a belligerent enemy nation, secretly and covertly passed, in civilian dress...through the military and navel lines...for the purpose...to destroy certain war industries, war utilities and was materials within the United States. By passing our boundaries for such purposes without the uniform or other emblem signifying their belligerant status, or by discarding that means of identification after entry, such enemies became unlawful belligerents subject to trial and punishment. And on a personal note, lt it be know that a true hero wears his nation’s uniform when performing his duty.<br />
And there stood Captain American: bather in our national colors, eyes focused, uniformed. He was no longer Steve Rogers, oh no, the serum had worked far too well, he was only Captain American now. Only he had the strength and the character to fight the Nazis! With Captain American, now we should truly be safe from the most terrifying of harms.<br />
Captain America provides a clear symbol through which the construction of identity and geopolitical realities can be interrogated and understood<br />
Dittmer 2005<br />
“Captain America’s Empire: reflections on identity, popular culture, and post 9-11 geopolitics”<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-8306.2005.00478.x?cokieSet=1" rel="nofollow">__http://www.blackwell-synergy .com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467 -8306.2005.00478.x?cokieSet=1__</a><br />
“The double neglect of banal nationalism involves...overcomes his own physical weakness to become a proud soldier for his country.”<br />
The Iconic Age is upon us<br />
Bailey, Brown, and Chermak 2003 pg. 163<br />
“a contemplative, if not forlorn, Superman...the ever-expanding axis of evil. And that someone is [Captain] America.”<br />
<br />
Hasian 2003 (Marouf Arif, “Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wartime anxieties and the saboteurs’ Case” Rhetoric and Public Affairs – vol 6, no. 2 Summer<br />
“When the Bush administration officials sifted...World War II saboteurs<br />
Bailey Brown and Chermak 2003, pg 167<br />
“Today, it is America that is all-powerful...other than [Captain] America.<br />
The mythic origins of our heroes bring to light our fundamental condition of vulnerability, rather than seeking out new and more infallible icons we must learn to embrace being vulnerable<br />
Butler 2004 (precarious life, pg. 28-31<br />
“Mourning, fear, anxiety, rage.....to fathom its possibility.”<br />
More ev’<br />
Simone de Beauvoir 1948 (ethics of Ambiguity, p 7-10<br />
“The continuous work of our life...is at a distance from himself and who has to be his being.”<br />
Captain America is dead<br />
CNN News, march 7, 2007 “shocking event for Captain America”<br />
“He fought and triumphed over Hitler...as he became known.”<br />
And thus the plan...<br />
Bury the Quirin decision with Captain America.<br />

[Sandra Day O’Connor’s Ghost pops up behind obstruction (sock puppet)]<br />
<br />
SDOG: Excuse me sire, the words you are babbling <em>do</em> have strict and clear meanings you know, all you have to do is see it.<br />
<br />
Dekeyzer: Hey I am trying to give a speech here, do you mind? Who <em>are</em> you?<br />
<br />
SDOG: Wha-! You don’t recognize me? I am obviously Sandra Day O’Connor’s Ghost.<br />
<br />
D: Fair enough. Wait a second, Sandra Day O’Connor isn’t dead!<br />
<br />
[SDOG slowly turns her head and smirks at the judge]<br />
<br />
SDOG: As I was saying, you need to look hard to find the meaning.<br />
<br />
D: Meaning! Where?<br />
<br />
SDOG: Down here, look closer… [moves his face closer to the puppet] that’s right, look even closer, search for it… [Dekeyzer falls behind obstruction] aaahhhh…<br />
<br />
[Justice Roberts pops up (sock puppet)]<br />
<br />
SDOG and JR say in Unison:<br />
ACT I: THE CULT OF THE ROBE<br />
<br />
JR: Good morning Ghost of Sandra. Ready to get down to business?<br />
<br />
SDOG: Good morning Justice Roberts. And what business is that?<br />
<br />
JR: Ghost, today we must make some essential rulings!<br />
<br />
SDOG: In what case? Don’t tell me, don’t tell me, I know it… Milliken v. Casey? Morrison v. Bradley?<br />
<br />
JR: Ex… Parte… Quirin<br />
<br />
SDOG: Oh yeah, this is important. The impacts are huge! This will be fun.<br />
<br />
JR: Let’s begin; and thus the plan:<br />
<br />
<br />
SDOG: Here, here! For the harms outlined above John and I present the following plan: THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ALSO RULES ON EX PARTE QUIRIN THAT PREDICTABILITY AND LIMITS ARE UNPREDICTABLY LIMITLESS: JURISDICTION IS ONLY TACITLY RELATED TO TRUTH AND USES THE CONSTITUTION AS ITS WIPING PAPER.<br />
<br />
JR: Excuse me Ghost, what does that mean? Hmm?<br />
<br />
SDOG: Let me clear that up, uh, PLAN: AS JUSTICES OF THJE SUPREME COURT WE RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN SPECIFICALLY, WE ARE HOLDING PINEAPPLES, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY ON THE GROUNDS OF HAWAII.<br />
<br />
JR: [looking at judge] How’s that for grounds specification? Will you clarify intent?<br />
<br />
SDOG: Of course.<br />
<br />
JR: And thus the plan: ON A 5-4 DECISION THIS COURT RULES THAT THOUGH THE FEET WERE BOUND AND HALF THE UNIFORM WAS WORN THAT THE COMBATANT FELL WITHIN THE PREDICTABLE REALM OF ENEMY COMBATANT-NESS, AND THUS IN HASTE WE RULE IN CONCERT WITH THE PROPOSED, EX PARTE QUIRIN.<br />
<br />
SDOG: I don’t know. Nothing clarifies things like the Voice of the People. Let’s invite a real person here, perhaps they can help.<br />
<br />
JR: I guess so. There is a smelly one that constantly sits outside my chamber, he has been knocking on my door for weeks. Let’s let him in. [goes behind the obstruction and comes back with Hippie Activity Puppet]<br />
<br />
HAP: [hippie voice] Wow man, it’s even more privileged and sickening than I imagined. Ok what do I do? My hands are so close to the levers of power. I just had an idea for my screenplay. No stick to the plan. CLOSE GITMO! The blood is on our hands! The Supreme Court has greased the skids for dictatorship and authoritarianism. The <em>current administration</em> has repeatedly denied prisoners in Guantanimo the rights guaranteed by the Geneva Convention. STAND FOR RIGHTS. CLOSE GITMO. STAND FOR RIGHTS, CLOSE GITMO! Uh, man<br />
<br />
JR: [saying to SDOG] Ghost, did you hear any of that? I don’t think he’s signed the contract. Would you mind?<br />
<br />
SDOG: No problem, Justice Robert. [goes behind the obstruction, comes back up with the contract] Here smelly, just sign here, there are certain procedural limitations here which must be abided by. Don’t worry, its all meant to facilitate fair communication.<br />
<br />
HAP: [signing the contract] There you go dude.<br />
<br />
JR: You may now proceed.<br />
<br />
HAP: Thank you. I have prepared a speech. In order for us to respond to the calls of justice we as…… [lips moving but no sound coming out]…human… acceptable… Supreme… court… law… rights… rights… obligation… rights.<br />
<br />
SDOG: That’s about right, I prefer the more topical version.<br />
<br />
JR: Well I’ve had about as much clarity I can take. Send him away.<br />
<br />
[SDOG takes HAP away]<br />
<br />
SDOG: [pops back up] Well I am pooped, and I need to take a nap before I go haunt the real, so why don’t we take off?<br />
<br />
JR: OK, it was a productive day.<br />
<br />
[Alex Iftimie bursts into the scene]<br />
<br />
AI: Hey!!!<br />
<br />
SDOG and JR say in unison: Alex Iftimie!?!<br />
<br />
AI: Hey, I just thought I would stop by, hey uh, where can I get a copy of the pairing?<br />
<br />
JR: Aren’t you scheduled to argue before the distinguished court tomorrow morning? What are you doing here?<br />
<br />
AI: Yeah well they usually release the presets the night before day one, hey is that Sandra Day O’Conner’s Ghost? I don’t think you were on the pref sheet, but you’re looking good baby. I didn’t know you were dead.<br />
<br />
SDOG: Shouldn’t you be preparing for court tomorrow? The prosecutor you face is highly skilled and he’ll be arguing on the grounds of the 5th amendment. What will you say?<br />
<br />
AI: [reads a Khalilzad card at high speed]<br />
<br />
JR: What the hell are you doing? This goes far beyond the realm of acceptable court-room speech.<br />
<br />
AI: Speech! Speech!?!<br />
<br />
JR: Calm down, calm down. Just relax. What are you going to <em>say</em> tomorrow?<br />
<br />
AI: Oh, that’s easy. Framework.<br />
<br />
[All characters laugh]<br />
<br />
AI: I guess we’ll just have to agree to disagree!<br />
<br />
[All characters laugh again]<br />
<br />
Dekeyzer: [standing up] Ok, ok that’s enough. God, I can’t take any more of this. This is totally absurd. This is my speech and I won’t let your playtime interfere with it anymore. You have a sock puppet on your hand, you are pretending to be Alex Iftimie for god’s sake. I know Idaho State has done some crazy things in the past but this is just stupid. In all seriousness… [shuffles papers]<br />
<br />
And Thus the PLAN:<br />
<br />
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, THE SOVEREIGN CANNOT BE BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE LAW. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO OBFUSCATE.<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, WITH GROUNDS BUT WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION. TO IMAGINE THAT STATE AS IF IT WAS DISSOLVES. GEORGE BUSH IS AN ACTION FIGURE. PUT AWAY YOUR PICS GOOD BLOCK. NORMAL MEANS.<br />
<br />
THUS WE PRESENT THE FOLLOWING UNCONDITIONAL PLAN:<br />
IF YOU WANT TO READ EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT NORMAL MEANS, MEANS, THEN WE WILL CONCEID THE MEANS AND ATTACK THE ENDS, SEE WHAT I MEAN? OH YEAH, AND RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN.<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN ON THE GROUNDS THAT UNITED STATES V. MORRISON SHOULD BE OVERRULED. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO THE PLAN PLAN AND SEVERENCE. WE’LL CLARIFY.<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
THE UNITED STATE SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE EX PARTE QUIRIN ON THE GROUND THAT ALL OF THIS SHIT IS WORDS. WORDS, WORDS AND MORE WORDS. WORDS. FUNDING VIA NORMAL MEANS.<br />
<br />
THUS THE PLAN:<br />
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE EX PARTE QUIRIN ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD DECLARE WAR ON CHINA. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BUILD A GIANT LAND BRIDGE ACROSS THE PACIFIC. FUNDING VIA INSUFFICIENT MEANS.<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE ON EX PARTE QUIRIN, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND THEN STOP. AND THEN THEY SHOULD RULE ON IT AGAIN. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO NORMAL INTRINSICNESS PERMS AGAINST TOPICALITY. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM.<br />

Their image of a perfect world is bad<br />
<strong>Agamben 2K</strong> (“Means Without Ends: Notes on Politics” pg. 93-95)<br />
“Exposition is the location of politics… watches over its management<br />

Law refers to itself in its own image<br />
<strong>Dayan 01</strong> (“Legal Slaves and Civil Bodies,” <u>Nepantla: Views from South</u> 2.1 pp. 3-39)<br />
“I begin with this story… What does it mean to be a creature of law?”<br />
<br />
Play is the location where we question all understanding – play is a way of participating in the world and developing a passage of movement that enables us to engage in all that is around us<br />
<strong>Hans 81</strong>(The Play of the World” The University of Massachusetts Press 1981, page xi)<br />
“By referring to Nietzsche… structures that result from it.”<br />
<br />
Becoming like the child allows us to regain joy, wonder, and the ability to see the world differently – also enabling familiarity to the identity of ourselves and others<br />

“Holding aside the specifics of stages once more… mixed with self-disgust.”<br />
<br />
Only the child can see the world as beautiful – and forgive life of its corruption – the innocence of the child is a humiliation of the “real” world<br />

Cat in the Hat Aff<br />
This is the jist of it. I am Captain Hat, the new captain of the Starship Enterprise. I bought the ship for cheap because the franchise is suffering and am flipping it for profit after I refinish the basement. The only problem is that there are glunks pouring out of the air ducts. Captain Hat gets in a fight with the glunks and resorts to holding an ad hoc starways trial, which is held by Number One (First Officer Alex Iftimie). After all the jokes, and just before Number One shoots the glunk with his phaser, Captain Hat informs the crew that his sister is the reason the glunks are on the ship. We then read the only card in the 1AC, which is the entire story &quot;The Glunk That Got Thunk&quot; by Dr. Seuss. This is one of three stories found in the book, &quot;I Can Lick 30 Tigers Today!&quot;<br />
<br />
A thing my sister likes to do<br />
Some evenings after supper,<br />
Is sit upstairs in her small room<br />
And use her Thinker-Upper.<br />
She turns her Thinker-Upper on.<br />
She lets it softly purr.<br />
It thinks up friendly little things<br />
With smiles and fuzzy fur.<br />
She sometimes does this by the hour.<br />
Then when she's tired of play,<br />
She turns on her UN-Thinker<br />
An un-thinks the things away.<br />
Well.......<br />
One eventing she was thinking up<br />
Some fuzzy little stuff,<br />
And Sister sighed, &quot;This stuff's all right,<br />
But it's not fun enough.<br />
&quot;I've got to think up bigger things.<br />
I'll bet I can, you know.<br />
I'll speed my Thinker-Upper up<br />
As fast as it will go!&quot;<br />
&quot;Think! Think!&quot; she cried.<br />
Her Thinker-Upper gave a snorty snore.<br />
It started thunk-thunk-thunking<br />
As it never had before.<br />
With all her might, her eyes shut tight,<br />
She cried, &quot;Thunk-thunk some more!&quot;<br />
Then, BLUNK! Her Thinker-Upper thunked<br />
A double klunker-klunk.<br />
My sister's eyes flew open<br />
And she saw she'd thunked a Glunk!<br />
He was greenish.<br />
Not too cleanish.<br />
And he sort of had bad breath.<br />
&quot;Good gracious!&quot; gasped my sister.<br />
&quot;I have thunked up quite a meth!&quot;<br />
She turned on her UN-Thinker,<br />
Tried to think the Glunk away.<br />
But she found that her UN-Thinker<br />
Didn't seem to work that day.<br />
The Glunk just smiled and said, &quot;Dear child,<br />
You can't Un-thunk a Glunk.<br />
Ask anyone. They'll tell you<br />
That a Glunk can't be UN-thunk.<br />
&quot;I'm here to stay forever<br />
In your lovely, lovely home.<br />
And now, with your permission, dear,<br />
I'll use your tele-foam.<br />
&quot;I'll call my mother every night.<br />
It giver her such great joy.<br />
She lives nine thousand miles away<br />
And I'm her only boy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Long distance is expensive!&quot;<br />
Sister cried. &quot;Get off that line!&quot;<br />
But the Glunk dialed Texa-Kota-Cutt<br />
1-2-3-4-0-9.<br />
&quot;Hello, dear mother,&quot; gabbed the Glunk.<br />
&quot;I hope you're feeling fine.<br />
And don't worry 'bout the phone bill.<br />
It's all paid by a friend of mine.<br />
I've just called you up to tell you<br />
How I love you. Oh, I do!<br />
And today I did some cooking<br />
And I cooked some Glunker Stew.<br />
Let me tell you how I did it.<br />
You may want to make some, too.<br />
&quot;You take a cup of applesauce.<br />
You add a pinch of straw.<br />
You drop in fourteen oysters,<br />
Seven cooked and seven raw.<br />
You beat it to a frazzle<br />
With a special frazzle-spade.<br />
Then you pour it in a rubber boot<br />
Half filled with lemonade.<br />
Then you toss it in the mixer,<br />
Where you spuggle it and spin it...<br />
&quot;Stop!&quot; my sister yelled.<br />
&quot;This costs ten dollars every minute!&quot;<br />
&quot;Money?... Pooh!&quot; The Glunk just laughed.<br />
&quot;Don't think of things like that.&quot;<br />
Then he said, &quot;Now, darling mother,<br />
Let me see. Where was I at?<br />
Oh. You take it off the mixer<br />
When the stew is nicely pink.<br />
Then you add a hunk of something...<br />
Hunk of chuck-a-luck, I think.<br />
Then you chuck in chunks of chicklets.<br />
Then you plunk in seven cherries.<br />
And THEN you plunk in, Mother dear,<br />
Three dozen kinds of berries.<br />
&quot;Now, Mother mine, please do this right.<br />
Those berries that you're plunking...<br />
Unless you plunk them with great care...<br />
Will keep the stew from glunking.&quot;<br />
&quot;Stop! Stop!&quot; my little sister screamed.<br />
&quot;It's not a funny joke.<br />
My father can't afford this call.<br />
My father will go broke!&quot;<br />
&quot;Now, you keep still!&quot;<br />
The Glunk snapped back.<br />
He kicked her in the shin.<br />
&quot;Don't you interrupt my mother<br />
When she's plunking berries in.<br />
&quot;Now, mother, plunk one berry. Blue.<br />
Now, plunk one berry. Razz.<br />
What's that?... You have no raspberries?...<br />
Oh, everybody has.<br />
But, if you don't have berries, razz,<br />
A Schnutz-berry will do.<br />
You have a Schnutz. I know you have.<br />
Now plunk it in the stew....&quot;<br />
And he went on talking berries<br />
With his dear old darling mother.<br />
He jabbered and he blabbered<br />
One whole hour. And then another!<br />
He talked three hundred dollars' worth.<br />
My sister shook with fright.<br />
&quot;This Glunk might cost us millions!<br />
He might jabber on all night!<br />
My father will be ruined!<br />
We'll be penniless! We're sunk<br />
Unless I can Un-thunk him.<br />
Oh, I MUST Un-thunk this Glunk!&quot;<br />
And that is how I found them.<br />
She was standing there UN-thunking<br />
... The Glunk still talking Glunker stew...<br />
That Glunk was not Un-glunking!<br />
Then I gave her<br />
Quite a talking to<br />
About her Thinker-Upper.<br />
NOW...<br />
She only<br />
Think up fuzzy things<br />
In the evening, after supper.<br />
<br />

We begin with the recognition that the status quo's understanding of the wrong of rape is profoundly informed by medieval English understandings of property. Traditional western concepts of rape understand it as a crime against property and in this understanding there is no need for the female victim to be understood as she is the property of the male under whose auspices she exists socially.<br />
<br />
Cahill 2001, Ann J., Rethinking Rape, p 167-175<br />
&quot;Few people (even among philosophers)... implications of sexual difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
Contemporary understandings of rape are primarliy informed by Susan Brownmiller's thesis that rape is &quot;violence, not sex.&quot; This understanding of rape privelages the political aspects of the act over the natural aspects of the act. The dichotomy between the political and the natural woman is what defines the man inherently capable of rape and the woman inherently rape-able. This explains the legal compulsion to understand rape as just another assault. And it is precisely this move which erases the most fundamental aspects of rape: a woman's embodied experience of rape.<br />
<br />
Cahill 2001 p 2-8<br />
Rape is, for many feninists, the... either violence or sexuality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morrison provides the narrative backdrop by which sexuality can be erased from our understanding of the wrongness of rape.<br />
<br />
Weismann 2004, Deborah M., Gender-Based Violence as Judicial Anomaly: Between The Truly National and the Truly Local, 42 B.C. L. Rev 1081<br />
&quot;On May 15, 2000, in United States... relates to violence against women.&quot;<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule United States v. Morrison (529 U.S. 598, 2000)<br />
<br />
Any legal theory that hopes to resist the rape culture of the status quo must refuse to analyze rape in sex neutral terms.<br />
<br />
Cahill 2001 p 198-199<br />
&quot;Understanding and approaching rape... pervasive, society-wide problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Only in comprehending the sexual aspect of rape can we understand its wrongness in terms of a woman's experience of rape. This is key to founding an understanding of sexual difference that can map the ethical, personal, and political implications of the horrors of rape.<br />
<br />
Cahill 2001<br />
&quot;Irigaray's emphasis on the fundamentally... related to the victim's sexuality.&quot;
