<h2 id="toc1"><a name="x-Geogia CL pre districts"></a>Geogia CL pre districts</h2>
<br />
Observation 1: Inherency<br />
<br />
First, the Supreme Court ruling in Milliken v. Bradley set a precedent that views de facto segregation and white privilege as an acceptable norm.<br />
McUsic ‘04 [Molly S., Visiting Professor of Law, Harvard Law School, J.D., Harvard University, (“BROWN AT FIFTY: THE FUTURE OF BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION: ECONOMIC INTEGRATION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS” 117 Harv. L. Rev. 1334)]<br />
&quot;Swann, however, was the highwater mark. ... and many districts reverted to neighborhood schools placed in segregated neighborhoods&quot;<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Whiteness<br />
A) The Milliken decision is a powerful display of white privilege, an affirmation of white supremacy.<br />
<br />
Lipsitz ’98 [George Lipsitz, Chair and Professor of American Studies, University of California, The Possessive &quot;Investment in Whiteness: How White People Profit from Identity Politics, p. 35]<br />
The power of white resistance and refusal to desegregate education... segregation in Detroit’s schools was caused by “unknown and unknowable factors.”<br />
<br />
B) This constructed whiteness manifests itself as a transparent normative model for racial perception and relations, reinforcing white privilege and superiority.<br />
Lopez ’96 [Ian F. Haney, White by Law: The Legal Construction of Race. New York University Press: New York]<br />
&quot;Transparency is due in part to the positional privilege, “White supremacy ... Whites rarely have cause to consider their own racial identity.&quot;<br />
<br />
C) Revealing the operation of whiteness is key to undermining structural inequality predicated upon white supremacist norms.<br />
Crenshaw ’88 [Kimberle Williams, Acting Professor of Law, University of California at Los Angeles J.D., Harvard Law School; LL.M., University of Wisconsin, 1988 (“Race, Reform, and Retrenchment: Transformation and Legitimation in Antidiscrimination Law” 101 Harv. L. Rev. 1331)]<br />
&quot;Formal equality significantly transformed ... appearance of neutral norms and formal inclusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
D) Dismantling racism and its manifestations is the last hope for the ethical and physical survival of the human race.<br />
Barndt ’91 [Joseph. Dismantling Racism: The Continuing Challenge to White America.] pp. 155-156]<br />
&quot;To study racism is to ... we dare not let it continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 3: Segregation<br />
<br />
The Court has normalized segregation in the law, legally sanctifying ongoing dehumanization.<br />
<br />
Andrews 03 [Rhonda V., Prof. of Law at Univ. of San Francisco, “The Third Reconstruction: An Alternative to Race Consciousness and Colorblindness in Post-Slavery America,” Alabama Law Review, Winter 2003, 54 Ala. L. Rev. 483]<br />
&quot;Finally, continued reliance on race leads inevitably ... more deserving of dignified nurture and development than others.&quot;<br />
<br />
The impact of dehumanization is beyond calculability.<br />
<br />
Berube ‘97 [David M., Prof. of Communication Studies at Uni of S. Carolina, “NANOTECHNOLOGY PROLENGIVITY: The Down Side, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cas.sc.edu/ENGL/faculty/berube/Nanotechnological%20Prolingevity.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cas.sc.edu/ENGL/faculty/berube/Nanotechnological%20Prolingevity.html</a>]<br />
&quot;This means-ends dispute is at the core ... lies a dehumanized image of [humans] ... (Montagu &amp; Matson, 1983. p. xi-xii).&quot;<br />
<br />
Observation 4: Solvency<br />
<br />
A) Ruling that segregation must be considered with the “dual-harm” standard overturns Milliken and provides remedies for meaningful de-facto desegregation.<br />
Brown ’04 [Kevin, Charles A. Whistler Professor of Law and the Director of the Hudson and Holland Scholars Program, Indiana University, (“The Road Not Taken In Brown: Recognizing The Dual Harm Of Segregation” 90 Va. L. Rev. 1579)]<br />
&quot;The state action requirement of the Equal Protection Clause ... justify broader remedial solutions in the subsequent school desegregation cases.&quot;<br />
<br />
B) The affirmative use of the dual-harm standard reorients the perceived impact of racism as damaging every human being, not just minority races, which is key to destroying racist structures and assumptions.<br />
Andrews ’04 [Rhonda V. Magee, Professor of Law, University of San Francisco, “Symposium: Vision And Revision: Exploring The History, Evolution, And Future Of The Fourteenth Amendment: Racial Suffering As Human Suffering: An Existentially-Grounded Humanity Consciousness As A Guide To A Fourteenth Amendment Reborn,” Spring 2004, lexis]<br />
&quot;Official society has never sought to repair the harm done to all of us ... of the world which undermine human potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
C) Desegregation has been empirically peaceful and positive overall, leading to substantial improvement in educational environments for all students.<br />
Liebman 90 [James, Prof. of Law at Columbia Univ., “DESEGREGATING POLITICS: &quot;ALL-OUT&quot; SCHOOL DESEGREGATION EXPLAINED,” Columbia Law Review, OCTOBER 1990, lexis]<br />
&quot;There is, moreover, empirical support for the ... rising percentage of young white adults entering college who favor busing has exceeded fifty percent.&quot;<br />
<br />
D) Desegregated schools provide greater access to social institutions and create the best environment for cross-cultural tolerance for all races.<br />
Epperson ‘05 [Lia B. Epperson, Assistant Professor of Law, Santa Clara University ,“TRUE INTEGRATION: ADVANCING BROWN'S GOAL OF EDUCATIONAL EQUITY IN THE WAKE OF GRUTTER,” ,Former Director of Education at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc, University of Pittsburgh Law Review, Fall 2005, 67 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 175]<br />
&quot;Perhaps most importantly, data also suggests that ... multiracial settings as adults.&quot;<br />
<br />
E) The affirmative’s use of jurisprudence will direct legal and social structures towards substantive racial justice through its recognition of equal humanity for all races.<br />
Bracey ‘05 [Christopher A. Bracey, Professor of Law at Washington University School of Law, “RACE JURISPRUDENCE AND THE SUPREME COURT: WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?: DIGNITY IN RACE JURISPRUDENCE,” University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law, February 2005, 7 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 669]<br />
&quot;Despite the mixed legacy of Brown, ... re-deploy them to rescue an increasingly unanchored jurisprudence.&quot;<br />
<br />
F) Publicly exposing subordinating structures foments a true paradigm of racial equality in all facets of society.<br />
Powell, ’01 [John, Marvin J. Sonosky Chair in Law and Public Policy, University of Minnesota Law School; Executive Director, Institute on Race and Poverty. 28 Hastings Const. L.Q. 655, lexis]<br />
&quot;If the public dialogue around choice were to shift toward such an exposure of privileging and subordinating structures, ... liberty over equality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Observation 5: Rebuilding Humanity<br />
<br />

Observation 1: Inherency<br />
The Supreme Court’s ruling in Milliken v. Bradley set a precedent that views de facto segregation and white privilege as an acceptable norm.<br />
Molly S. McUsic Visiting Professor of Law, Harvard Law School, J.D., Harvard University, 2004 (“BROWN AT FIFTY: THE FUTURE OF BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION: ECONOMIC INTEGRATION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS” 117 Harv. L. Rev. 1334)<br />
<br />
ADV 1 Whiteness<br />
A.) The Milliken decision is a product of white identity and a powerful display of white privilege.<br />
George Lipsitz. Chair and Professor of American Studies. University of California. 1998. The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: How White People Profit From Identity Politics. p.35<br />
<br />
B.) White identity perpetuates racism because it exists only in relation to the demonization of non-Whites.<br />
Lopez, 96. Ian F. Haney. White by Law: The Legal Construction of Race. New York University Press: New York.<br />
<br />
C.) Until we dismantle whiteness, movements will never be successful.<br />

Food Not Bombs. “Beyond the Whiteness - Global Capitalism and White Supremacy: thoughts on movement building and anti-racist organizing.” Colour of Resistance.<br />
<br />
D.) Taking a stand against racism is the most important thing in the round. If we surrender to pressure and lose our footing, we lose humanity and risk its survival.<br />
<br />
ADV 2 Transparency<br />
Because White identity is the norm, Whiteness is granted, through privilege, transparency.<br />
Lopez, 96. Ian F. Haney. White by Law: The Legal Construction of Race. New York University Press: New York.<br />
<br />
B.) Dismantling the White identity by challenging transparency is a prerequisite for racial equality.<br />

<br />
C.) We cannot be complicit in racism – to be ethical, we must reject it<br />
<br />
Adv. 3<br />
A.) Whiteness locks women into oppressive femininity, perpetuating and concealing sexism.<br />

Politics as usual predicates itself on fundamental human paradox of killing to save. We should act morally. Anything less than forces morality to sublimate itself to the rationalization of calculability, sidestepping and voiding value of life.<br />
[Bauman 1992, <em>Morality, Immorality and Other Life Strategies,</em> p. 207-8]<br />
“But one can….to escape it.”<br />

Shame/Quirin Affirmative<br />
<br />
We as American's have almost succeeded in externalizing the torture and abuse that currently drives our supposed War on Terrorism – the Bush Administration has carefully placed camps such as Guantanamo Bay outside of our borders yet we cannot be ignorant to the continued physical and psychological abuse that can only be described as heinous<br />
HYLAND 04<br />
[Julie, &quot;Britons release devastating account of torture and abuse by US forces at Guantanamo,&quot; WORLD SOCIALIST WEBSITE, 8/6/04, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/aug2004/guan-a06.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/aug2004/guan-a06.shtml</a>]<br />

Military Tribunals put to use interrogation techniques that can only be understood as immoral<br />
Rocky Mountain News 6 / 18 / 05 page lexis<br />
<br />
In spite of recent Hamdan decision, the Bush administration is asking Congress for broad authority to try detainees without the safeguards of the Geneva Conventions<br />
Halperin 8-6-06 (Morton, Senior Fellow of the Center for American Progress &amp; Director of U.S. Advocacy for the Open Society Institute ,San Diego Union Tribune)<br />
<br />
Quirin is the controlling case allowing for presidential establishment of military tribunals<br />
Ohio Northern University Law Review 02 (Modern Use of Military Tribunals: A Legal &quot;Can&quot; and a Political &quot;Should&quot;?)<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin by ruling that military tribunals are unconstitutional.<br />
<br />
Let us make this clear: we advocate this plan within the context of the rest of this affirmative not because we believe the U.S.S.C. will adopt it, nor because we hope to place a demand on the U.S.S.C. to adopt it. Rather we know it will not, both because it pays no attention to those of us here in this debate round and because the persons who comprise the U.S.S.C. have little incentive to do more than already exists, especially in the context of the War on Terror.<br />
<br />
In other words, this affirmative attempts to demonstrate the limits of debate and politics as a conventional set of discourses and to antagonize those discourses. We understand our plan as such an antagonism which Laclau and Mouffe define as:<br />
[ Prof. of Political theory at Univ. of Essex. Mouffe is below. Hegemony and Socialist Strategy. 1985. Pp. 125]<br />
<br />
The 1ac functions as a discursive act that exposes the limits of debate as a democratic-political activity, especially when thought through the lens of policy-making. Too often, debate identifies a harm only to focus the vast majority of debate on the mechanisms and procedures to solve that harm, rather than on discussions of how that harm serves to construct us as debaters and debate as an activity. By demarcating the ongoing crisis in Guantanamo Bay and other similar prison camps and coupling that demarcation with an advocacy that we know will never take place, the 1ac functions as an antagonism of the present political order, for it shows how the essential institutional dynamics of the liberal political order remain incomplete in the face of massive, sustained suffering. Criticism alone cannot offer the same benefit; antagonisms function by aligning with and working through liberal democratic processes while simultaneously exposing the structural incompleteness of democratic politics.<br />
Mouffe 1992. [Chantell. Teaches at College International de Philosophie in Paris. Dimensions of Radical Democracy. ] Pp. 131-132<br />
<br />
Through the process of antagonism we hope to reorient our relationship to the horrors of Guantanamo Bay not through the metrics of calculation and efficacy but rather through the means by which these horrors constitute us through shame. Let us be clear, here: shame is the primordial experience that comes from acknowledging the horrors that make our existence possible, and knowing simultaneously that escape from those horrors is impossible. Shame is not something one solves for with either a plan or a counterplan – indeed, the attempt to solve is precisely the attempt at escape that nullifies the experience of shame itself. Instead, shame offers us an ethico-political opening to our responsibility as agents who are part of a context and a world of international relations that is greater than ourselves.<br />
Murphy 2004. [Ann is currently a New South Global Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Philosophy at the University of New South Wales. She received her PhD from the University of Memphis, where she wrote her dissertation on the relationship between ethics and politics in Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and Foucault. &quot;The Political Significance of Shame&quot; Borderlands e-journal.

<br />
To reimagine politics from the question of shame rather than the comparison of net benefits is to acknowledge that subjectivity comes prior to practice, and that the relation to the other comes prior to the social construction of our identities. We believe that we must turn away from attempts to economize responsibility, and instead to open ourselves to shame, to the thinking of our subject positions as those who advocate on behalf of harms and horrors that will not be resolved by our advocacy. Doing so forces us to acknowledge our complicity with the horrors in the world around us and to act as if our responsibility to act in the wake of those horrors is infinite.<br />

<br />
And so we have a choice: We can either begin to think again our identities and practices in debate, giving ourselves over to the infinite responsibility of being-for-the-other or we can maintain business as usual limiting that responsibility by playing conventional politics or carving out exceptions under the name of strategy and net-benefits. The problem is that once you rationalize one limit or one exception, you open the door for any persuasive appeal and you arrive at a process of judgment more properly known as moral nihilism. We have all participated in this farce, inside and outside of debate, year after year. This is the farce of debate and politics. It is the fiddle we play while the world around us burns. Cultivating moral responsibility remains our only substantive redress.<br />

Most critics would argue, probably correctly, that instead of allowing underdeveloped countries to withdraw from the global economy and undermine the economies of the developed world, the United States, Europe, and Japan and others will fight neocolonial wars to force these countries to remain within this collapsing global economy.<br />

Vandevelde ’96 (Kenneth J., dean and professor of law at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego , “Thinking Like a Lawyer: An Introduction to Legal Reasoning”; Pg 104)<br />
First, the court may confine a prior case to its facts. This is, in effect, a relatively weak form of overruling. The holding in the prior case is treated as correct, and yet the court refuses to generalize from that holding to any future case.<br />

Uniformity of federal law interpretation across the nation ought to be considered equally important in preserving courts' perceived legitimacy<br />

Meyer ’94 (Linda, Assistant Professor @ Vanderbilt Law School, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 423 ln)<br />
The Court has not maintained this positive law version of precedent, however. As the next subsection reveals, in the cases following Teague the Court has not taken the view that the holding (or precedential force) of a case is derived from the actual words used in the opinion<br />

However, history suggests that while the barrier to creating new liberty rights has been lowered, the Court is reluctant to create new rights, even where no precedent stands in the way.<br />

Bradford ’90 (C. Steven, Assistant Prof of Law, University of Nebraska College of Law; 59 Fordham L. Rev. 39 ln)<br />

&quot;Of course&quot;? Whatever else one might think about such sentiments, they reflect a profound change in attitudes from what has historically been the case. Sometime in the past generation or so, constitutional history was recast—turned on its head, really—as a story of judicial triumphalism. The Supreme Court's monopoly on constitutional interpretation is now depicted as inevitable, as something that was meant to be and that saved us from ourselves. The historical voice of judicial authority is privileged, while opposition to the Court's self-aggrandizing tendencies is ignored, muted, or discredited.<br />

<br />
President George W. Bush's selection of John Roberts sends a clear message for those willing to hear it: Roe v. Wade is here to stay. The real questions are whether Roe will be hollowed out and made irrelevant, and what other issues will dominate the future.At his federal appeals court confirmation hearings in 2003, Roberts said Roe was &quot;the settled law of the land&quot; and he could &quot;fully and faithfully&quot; apply that precedent.

Current Abortion stance undermines Court Legitimacy – Only returning the issue to the states induces public debate<br />

Clarke D. Forsythe * and Stephen B. Presser (Director, Project in Law &amp; Bioethics, Americans United for Life) Fall 2005 Texas Review of Law &amp; Politics<br />
<br />
The Court's decision in Roe v. Wade has no legitimate authority in constitutional text or tradition, or any foundation in American law or history. The accumulating historical and legal data - which were presented to the Court in Roe and made more explicit in Webster and Casey - make this increasingly clear.<br />

Reva Siegel (Acting Professor of Law, University of California at Berkeley) JANUARY 1992 44 Stan. L. Rev. 261<br />
<br />
In assessing the social effects of restrictions on abortion, it is important to observe not only that such regulation compels women to perform the work of bearing and rearing children, but that it lacks any provision that would mitigate or offset the social consequences of enforced motherhood for women.<br />

Interest in regulating women's conduct to protect the unborn is most prominently focused on the issue of abortion, about which public debate has raged since Roe, but it is by no means limited to matters of abortion<br />

The post-Casey history of abortion litigation in the lower courts is reminiscent of the classic recurring football drama of Charlie Brown and Lucy in the Peanuts comic strip.

OVERTURNING ROE WOULD SINGLEHANDEDLY REALIGN THE HOUSE, SENATE, AND WHITE HOUSE AS DEMOCRATIC—THE MOMENT THEY GET TO OFFICE THEY WILL ATTEMPT TO PASS NATIONAL LEGISLATION CODIFYING ABORTION ACCESS<br />
<br />
Jeffrey Rosen (Law Professor, GW) 2006 The Atlantic Monthly<br />
<br />
If efforts at compromise failed, however, and a sweeping abortion ban somehow made it to the Senate floor, the Democrats might mount a filibuster (assuming it was still available for ordinary legislation). But whether or not the federal abortion ban progresses very far, the mere threat of its passage might be enough to push the Democrats over the edge in the 2008 elections, helping them to recapture at leastthe Senate and perhaps even the House.<br />
<br />
IF ROE V WADE IS OVERTURNED, THE GOP WILL BE MARGINALIZED—THERE WILL BE NO GOP PRESIDENT IN 2008 AND THE DEMOCRATS WILL CONTROL THE ENTIRETY OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE NEXT FORTY YEARS<br />

Jeffrey Rosen (Law Professor, GW) 2006 The Atlantic Monthly<br />
<br />
So there's a good chance, assuming Roe falls, that there will be a Democrat in the White House by 2009. If Congress, at that point, passed a Freedom of Choice Bill protecting early-term abortions, the president would sign it. And if Republicans attempted a filibuster, theymight marginalize their party for decades to come.<br />

<br />
In 1973, Roe v. Wade contributed to an emerging global understanding of women's reproductive autonomy as a basic human right. Today, in contrast, the global pro-choice movement is working to counter U.S. policies that deny women needed reproductive health care services. It should be increasingly clear to women in the U.S. that their own reproductive rights are not invulnerable. For this reason, and because pro-choice advocates overseas have little power to influence the decisions of American politicians, attacks on reproductive rights abroad should engender resistance and protest at home.<br />

[ Prof. of Political theory at Univ. of Essex. Mouffe is below. Hegemony and Socialist Strategy. 1985. Pp. 125]<br />
<br />
The 1ac functions as a discursive act that exposes the limits of debate as a democratic-political activity, especially when thought through the lens of policy-making. Too often, debate identifies a harm only to focus the vast majority of debate on the mechanisms and procedures to solve that harm, rather than on discussions of how that harm serves to construct us as debaters and debate as an activity. By demarcating the ongoing crisis in Guantanamo Bay and other similar prison camps and coupling that demarcation with an advocacy that we know will never take place, the 1ac functions as an antagonism of the present political order, for it shows how the essential institutional dynamics of the liberal political order remain incomplete in the face of massive, sustained suffering. Criticism alone cannot offer the same benefit; antagonisms function by aligning with and working through liberal democratic processes while simultaneously exposing the structural incompleteness of democratic politics.<br />
<br />
Mouffe 1992. [Chantell. Teaches at College International de Philosophie in Paris. Dimensions of Radical Democracy. ] Pp. 131-132<br />
<br />
Through the process of antagonism we hope to reorient our relationship to the horrors of Guantanamo Bay not through the metrics of calculation and efficacy but rather through the means by which these horrors constitute us through shame. Let us be clear, here: shame is the primordial experience that comes from acknowledging the horrors that make our existence possible, and knowing simultaneously that escape from those horrors is impossible. Shame is not something one solves for with either a plan or a counterplan – indeed, the attempt to solve is precisely the attempt at escape that nullifies the experience of shame itself. Instead, shame offers us an ethico-political opening to our responsibility as agents who are part of a context and a world of international relations that is greater than ourselves.<br />

<br />
To reimagine politics from the question of shame rather than the comparison of net benefits is to acknowledge that subjectivity comes prior to practice, and that the relation to the other comes prior to the social construction of our identities. We believe that we must turn away from attempts to economize responsibility, and instead to open ourselves to shame, to the thinking of our subject positions as those who advocate on behalf of harms and horrors that will not be resolved by our advocacy. Doing so forces us to acknowledge our complicity with the horrors in the world around us and to act as if our responsibility to act in the wake of those horrors is infinite.<br />

<br />
And so we have a choice: We can either begin to think again our identities and practices in debate, giving ourselves over to the infinite responsibility of being-for-the-other or we can maintain business as usual limiting that responsibility by playing conventional politics or carving out exceptions under the name of strategy and net-benefits. The problem is that once you rationalize one limit or one exception, you open the door for any persuasive appeal and you arrive at a process of judgment more properly known as moral nihilism. We have all participated in this farce, inside and outside of debate, year after year. This is the farce of debate and politics. It is the fiddle we play while the world around us burns. Cultivating moral responsibility remains our only substantive redress.<br />

Now is the critical time to change international perceptions about the US.<br />
Dunlap 06 (Charles, 9/7, The Deputy Judge Advocate General US Air Force, Congressional Testimony)<br />
The United States is… advocate of the rule of law.<br />
<br />
First, applying Geneva standards to detainees is the critical SIGNAL needed to regain Soft Power.<br />
The Observer 04 (6/6, l/n)<br />
THE CURRENT WHITE HOUSE administration… as much as the imprisoned.<br />
<br />
Specifically, extending Geneva protections is key to create COALITIONS to solve the most pressing issues of this day.<br />
Miami Herald 06 (7/12)<br />
This is a far better way… such a policy years ago<br />
<br />
In particular, the respect for customary and INTERNATIONAL LAW that would come from application of the Geneva Convention would restore US international credibility.<br />

Georgia ran a new case last round. It's a little confusing but the basic idea is to overrule Casey's reaffirmation of Roe and claim that that will cause the democrats to regain power for 50 years. They will pass a Right to free choice Act that will provide a much better protection for rights to access abortion. It goes like this:<br />
Observation One: Access to abortion is collapsing<br />
Restrictions are increasing<br />
Roe has been hollowed out -- merely a symbol now<br />

Observation Two Solvency<br />
Roe will go out with a bang or a whimper -- its demise is imminent, explicit overrule makes it a bang<br />
Will have no effect on the rate of abortions<br />
No state will pass sweeping anti-abortion legislation<br />

THE PROTECTIONS OFFERED BY ROE WILL END—EITHER WITH A BANG OR A WHIMPER—IF THEY END WITH A BANG, THE RESULTING BACKLASH WOULD BENEFIT MANY WOMEN.<br />

PLAN – The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin by ruling that military tribunals are unconstitutional .<br />
<br />
<br />
We as American’s have almost succeeded in externalizing the torture and abuse that currently drives our supposed war on terrorism – the Bush administration has carefully placed camps such as guantanamo bay outside of our borders yet we cannot be ignorant to the continued physical and psychological abuse that can only be described as heinous.<br />
Hyland 2004 – world socialist website 8-6-4, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/aug2004/guan-a06.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/aug2004/guan-a06.shtml</a><br />
“three Britons freed from guantanmo bay in march have released” … “psychological torture, including being held in isolation for weeks or months and threats to kill”<br />
<br />
Military tribunals put to use interrogation techniques that can only be understood as immoral<br />
Rocky Mountain News 6-18-05<br />
“are the critics’ assessments of guantanamo correct” … “open-ended pronouncements is that they raise the possibility the detainees could be imprisoned without charge for decades”<br />
<br />
In spite of recent hmadan decision, the bush administration is asking congress for broad authority to try detainees without the safeguards of the Geneva conventions<br />
Halperin 8-6-06 – san diego union tribune<br />
“in its recent hamdan decision”… “administration is still trying to find a way to have the unfettered ability to do what it wants with those it has seized”<br />
<br />
Quirin is the controlling case allowing for military tribunals<br />
Ohio Northern University Law Review 2002<br />
“quirin remains the controlling case for presidential authority for establishing military tribunals” … “president has some sort of congressional authority”<br />
<br />
<br />
PLAN – The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin by ruling that military tribunals are unconstitutional .<br />
<br />
Let us make this clear: we advocate this plan within the context of the rest of this affirmative not because we believe the ussc will adopt it, nor because we hope to place a demand on the ussc to adopt it. Rather we know it will not, both because it pays no attention to those of us here in this debate round and because the persons who comprise the ussc have little incentive to do more than already exists, especially in the context of the war on terror.<br />
<br />
In other words, this affirmative attempts to demonstrat the limits of debate and politics as a conventional set of discourses and to antagonize those discourses. We understand our plan as such an antagonism which laclau and mouffe define as<br />
laclau 1992 – hegemony and socialist strategy, 1985, p. 125<br />
“antagonism, far from being and objective relation” … “they constitute the limits of society, the latter’s impossibility of fully constituting itself”<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc89"><a name="x-Georgia CR-GEORGIA CR 1AC – QUIRIN – SHAME"></a>GEORGIA CR 1AC – QUIRIN – SHAME</h3>
<br />
<br />
The 1ac functions as a discursive act that exposes the limits of debate as a democratic-political activity, especially when thought through the lens of policy-making. Too often, debate identitifies a harm only to focus the vast majority of debate on the mechanisms and procedures to solve that harm, rather than on discussions of how that harm serves to construct us as debaters and debate as an activity. By demarcating the ongoing crisis in guantanamo bay and other similar prison camps and coupling that demarcation with an advocacy that we know will never take place, the 1ac functions as an antagonism of the present political order, for it will never take place, the 1ac functions as an antagonism of the presnt political order, for it shows how the essential institutional dynamics of the liberal political order remain incomplete in the face of massive sustained suffering. Crticism alone canot offer the same benefit; antagonisms function by aligning with and working through liberal democratic processes while simultaneously exposing the structural incompleteness of democratic politics<br />
Mouffe 1992 – dimensions of radical democracy, p. 131-132<br />
“the search for ‘guarantees’ can lead to the very destruction of pluralist democracy” … “establish the hegemony of democratic values and practices” … “hierarchy among political values”<br />
<br />
Exploring our subject-position requires that we antagonize more than the generic political order; it requires that we antagonize the fundamental policy-making conventions of debate, not because policy debate is bad, but because it has become myopic. The focus on competing plan mechanisms sidesteps and voids the larger, more systematic discussion of the harms that motivate advocacy. We spend our time deciding what to do, rather than asking who we are that we can even pretend to respond to those horrors and spectacles presented round after round after round. Through the process of antagonism we hope to reorient our relationship to the horrors of guatnanmo bay not through the metrics of calculation and efficacy but rather through the means by which these horrors constitute us through shame. Let us be clear, here: shame is the primordial experience that comes from acknowledging the horros that make our existence possible, and knowing simultaneously that escape from those horrors is impossible. Shame is not something one solves for with either a plan or a counterplan – indeed the attempt to solve is precisely the attempt at escape that nullifies the experience of shame itself. Instead, shame offers us an ethico-political opening to our responsibility as agents who are part of a context and a world of international relations that is greater than ourselves.<br />
Murphy 2004 – the political significance of shame --- borderlands vol 3 no 1<br />
“recent politics testify to the uncharitable and restrictive ways in which many chose” … “the responsibility that fills me with remorse if found” … “the responsibility to the other before who I feel shame exists prior” … “but rather that we canot be responsible enough”<br />
<br />
<br />
GEORGIA CR 1AC – QUIRIN – SHAME<br />
<br />
To reimagine politics from the question of shame rather than the comparison of net benefits is to acknowledge that subjectivity comes prior to practice, and that the relation to the other comes prior to the social construction of our identities. We believe that we must turn away from attempts to economize responisibility, and instead to open ourselves to shame, to the thinking of our subject positions as those who advocate on behalf of harms and horrors that will not be resolved by our advocacy. Doing so forces us to acknowledge our complicity with the horrors in the world around us and to act as if our responsibility to act in the ake of those horrors is infinite.<br />
Murphy 2004 – same cite above<br />
“the obsession with reason in politics that has motivated” … “the levinasian account of responsibility is ahistorical by virtue of its infinite and irrecusable nature, and surely not by virtue of any desire to deny responsibility for the past”<br />
<br />
And so we have a choice: we can either begin to think again our identities and practices in debate, giving ourselves over to the infinite responsibility of being-for-the-other or we can maintain business as usual limiting that responsibility by playing conventional politics or carving out exceptions under the name of strategy and net-benefits. The problem is that once you rationalize one limits or one exception, you open the door for any persuasive appeal and you arrive at a process of judgement more properly known as moral nihilism. We have all participated in this farce, inside and outside of debate, year after year. This is the farce of debate and politics. It is the fiddle we play while the world around us burns. Cultivating moral responsibility remains our only substantitive redress.<br />
Bauman 1993 – postmodern ethics p. 246-250<br />
“the moral crisi fo the postmodern habitat requires first and foremost” … “if in doubt – consult your conscience”<br />
<br />
<br />
Politics as usual predicates itself upon a fundamental humanist paradox: killing life to save life. This paradox functions through a murderous economy that must be avoided. We believe that life has value precisely because it cannot be reduced to a calculation and that we should act morally simply because we should act morally, regardless of idiosyncratic exceptions and minor justifcation to the contrary. Anything less forces morality to sublimate itself ot the rationalizations of calculability, effectively sidestepping and voiding the value of those very lives that reason purports to save<br />
Bauman 1992 – mortality, immortality an dother life strategies, pp 207-208<br />
“on can calso be ready to die for the other not” … “is a price which caring life, being caring life cannot and would not refuse to pay”<br />

Contention Two - Hegemony<br />
<br />
Now is the critical time to change international perceptions about the US.<br />
Dunlap 06 (Charles, 9/7, The Deputy Judge Advocate General US Air Force, Congressional Testimony)<br />
The United States is… advocate of the rule of law.<br />
<br />
First, applying Geneva standards to detainees is the critical SIGNAL needed to regain Soft Power.<br />
The Observer 04 (6/6, l/n)<br />
THE CURRENT WHITE HOUSE administration… as much as the imprisoned.<br />
<br />
Specifically, extending Geneva protections is key to create COALITIONS to solve the most pressing issues of this day.<br />
Miami Herald 06 (7/12)<br />
This is a far better way… such a policy years ago<br />
<br />
In particular, the respect for customary and INTERNATIONAL LAW that would come from application of the Geneva Convention would restore US international credibility.<br />
Sweeney 03 (Michael JD, adjunct professor of law and former Joseph R. Crowley Fellow in International Human Rights at Fordham University School of Law, Human Rights Magazine, Winter, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.abanet.org/irr/hr/winter03/detention.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.abanet.org/irr/hr/winter03/detention.html</a>)<br />
Despite claiming to respect the Geneva… world—and found wanting.<br />

And, the images and stories of US torture that have damaged our image can only be rectified by the plan.<br />
Kohl 05 (Senator Kohl, June 15 2005 (Senator Herbert Kohl, (D-WI), Federal News Service, Lexis-Nexis Universe)<br />

<br />
In Addition, our application of courts-martial proceedings is a legitimate means of restoring US international credibility.<br />

In last week’s decision, the Supreme Court… under the rule of law.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, this revival of soft power is critical to US hegemony.<br />
Daalder and Lindsay 03 (Ivo H. and James M., Senior Fellows in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, Summer,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/views/papers/daalder/20030814.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/views/papers/daalder/20030814.pdf</a>)<br />
The more others question America’s power… power will mean very little.<br />
<br />
And, US hegemony is key to preventing global nuclear war<br />
Khalilzad, 95 (Zalmay, Senior assisnant at RAND Institute and former U.S. ambassador Spring, 1995, The Washington Quarterly, Rethinking Grand Strategy, Losing the Moment? The United States and the World After the Cold War, l/n)<br />
Under the third option, the United States would seek… balance of power system.<br />

Today, the United States… losing the war.<br />

The Bush administration’s establishment of military commissions that violate international standard of fairness and human rights have planted the seed for future terrorist attacks upon Americans<br />
Lugosi 05 (Charles, Prof of Law @ St. Thomas University, Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review)<br />
The international message… attacks upon Americans.<br />
<br />
A revised approach to trying detainees will help the US gain allies to win the war on terrorism<br />
Dunlap 06 (Charles, 9/7, The Deputy Judge Advocate General US Air Force, Congressional Testimony)<br />
A revised approach to military… in our warfighting interests.<br />
<br />
And, international cooperation is key to solving instability and terrorism<br />
Heymann 03 Philip B. Heymann, prof law Harvard, 2003, “Terrorism, Freedom, and Security: Winning without War” p. 120-1<br />
To the extent to which… opposition and even terrorism.<br />
<br />
And – the unchecked abuse decreases the popularity of moderates who are necessary to check anti-Americanism and terrorism. The camp has become the most effective recruiting agent for future terrorists.<br />
Rose 05 David Rose, writer and investigative journalist, 2005, Guantanamo: The War on Human Rights p. 10-11<br />
Meanwhile, if Guantanamo has… written in blood.<br />
<br />
And, applying Geneva solves international law and restores US credibility with allies and hurts terrorism.<br />
Columbus Dispatch 06 (July 16th, “Applying Geneva Conventions to terrorism detainees positions United States where it belongs”, lexis)<br />
That is the moral case for applying… by international law.<br />
<br />
And – the timeframe is short - Terrorist use of WMD’s is the most immediate and enormous threat to the U.S.<br />
Sloan, 03 (Elinor, Asst. prof. international security in political science, Carleton, International Journal, March 2003 l/n)<br />
The Central Intelligence Agency… critical US infrastructures.<br />
<br />
And – terrorists have the motive and the means to acquire and use nuclear weapons<br />
Allison and Kokoshin 02 (Graham, Professor of Government and Former Director of the Belfer Center, Harvard University, Andrei Member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences and Member of the Board of Directors, NTI | “The New Containment” – the National Interest | Lexis)<br />
In sum: even a conservative estimate… victim of nuclear terrorism.<br />
<br />
Finally, Unchecked terrorism will lead to extinction<br />
Alexander ’03 (Yonah, professor and director of the Inter-University for Terrorism Studies in Israel and the United States, August 28, The Washington Times l/n)<br />
Last week's brutal suicide bombings in Baghdad… there is no survival.&quot;<br />
<br />
Contention Four – Solvency<br />

<br />
PLAN â€“ The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison by ruling that Customary International Law necessitates the Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act.<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 â€“ Treaty Powers<br />
<br />
International treaty commitments require the full authorization of vawa â€“ Morrison undermines the entirety of us firegn policy<br />
Askin et al. 1999 â€“ brief amici curiae on behalf of international law scholars and human rights experts in support of petitioners, 1999 u.s. briefs 5<br />
â€œthere is no inevitable conflict with the constitution, the obligation of the u.s. to respect and fulfill its international obligationsâ€ â€¦ â€œinternational treaty and customary obligations to the community of nationsâ€<br />

independently, treaties legitimze us military power and reduce balancing efforts against unilateral leadership<br />

â€œa stronger use of international law could help stabilize the current predominant positionâ€ â€¦ â€œepochs that have left many traces in contemporary lawâ€<br />

Finally, U.S. credibility in treaty law is key to leadership â€“ it stabilized us power, reduces backlash against unilateralism and increases overall credibility<br />
Krisch 2003 â€“ Uniltarealism and US Foreign Policy, ed Malone and Khong p. 62-63<br />

Contention One: Terrorism<br />
<br />
The current legislation will not comply with the Geneva Convention therefore sacrificing soft power and efforts against terrorism<br />
Washington Post, 2006 (9/22, “The Abuse Can Continue: Senators won’t authorize torture, but they won’t prevent it, either, p A16, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/21/AR2006092101647.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/21/AR2006092101647.html</a><br />

The current strategy is doomed to failure – an absence of attacks doesn’t prove we’re winning – only a shift in policy will solve<br />
Canberra Times, 2006 (9-12, It will take more than a war to bring an end to terrorism, lexis)<br />
Yet today it doesn’t… were united.<br />
<br />
The detainment of so-called “enemy combatants” absent court protections has increased anti-Americanism, squandered US credibility, and undermined international cooperation against terrorism<br />
Amnesty International, 4-9-04 “Undermining security: violations of human dignity, the rule of law and the National Security Strategy in “war on terror” detentions, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR510612004" rel="nofollow">http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR510612004</a><br />
However, the government’s disregard… undermining international cooperation.<br />
<br />

Heymann 03 (Phillip B., 2003 “Terrorism, Freedom, and Security: Winning without War” p 120-1)<br />

The unchecked abuse decreases the popularity of moderates who are necessary to check anti-Americanism and terrorism. The camp has become the most effective recruiting agent for the future<br />

<br />
Guantanamo bay interrogation techniques produce bad intelligence. There’s an incentive for “enemy combatants” to admit to false crimes to end the interrogation.<br />

<br />
And the timeframe is short – terrorist use of WMD’s is the most immediate and enormous threat to the U.S.<br />
Sloan 2003 (Elinor, International Journal March 2003, lexis)<br />
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has assessed… US infrastructures.<br />

Contention Two - Hegemony<br />
<br />
Now is the critical time to change international perceptions about the US.<br />
Dunlap 06 (Charles, 9/7, The Deputy Judge Advocate General US Air Force, Congressional Testimony)<br />
The United States is… advocate of the rule of law.<br />
<br />
First, applying Geneva standards to detainees is the critical SIGNAL needed to regain Soft Power.<br />
The Observer 04 (6/6, l/n)<br />
THE CURRENT WHITE HOUSE administration… as much as the imprisoned.<br />
<br />
Specifically, extending Geneva protections is key to create COALITIONS to solve the most pressing issues of this day.<br />
Miami Herald 06 (7/12)<br />
This is a far better way… such a policy years ago<br />
<br />
In particular, the respect for customary and INTERNATIONAL LAW that would come from application of the Geneva Convention would restore US international credibility.<br />
Sweeney 03 (Michael JD, adjunct professor of law and former Joseph R. Crowley Fellow in International Human Rights at Fordham University School of Law, Human Rights Magazine, Winter, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.abanet.org/irr/hr/winter03/detention.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.abanet.org/irr/hr/winter03/detention.html</a>)<br />
Despite claiming to respect the Geneva… world—and found wanting.<br />
<br />
And, the images and stories of US torture that have damaged our image can only be rectified by the plan.<br />
Kohl 05 (Senator Kohl, June 15 2005 (Senator Herbert Kohl, (D-WI), Federal News Service, Lexis-Nexis Universe)<br />
SEN. HERBERT KOHL (D-WI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman… safe from terrorist threats.<br />
<br />
In Addition, our application of courts-marshals proceedings is a legitimate means of restoring US international credibility.<br />
Silliman 06 (Scott, Prof of Law @ Duke, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2006/07/silliman_oped.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2006/07/silliman_oped.html</a>)<br />
In last week’s decision, the Supreme Court… under the rule of law.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, this revival of soft power is critical to US hegemony.<br />
Daalder and Lindsay 03 (Ivo H. and James M., Senior Fellows in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, Summer,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/views/papers/daalder/20030814.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/views/papers/daalder/20030814.pdf</a>)<br />
The more others question America’s power… power will mean very little.<br />
<br />
And, US hegemony is key to preventing global nuclear war<br />
Khalilzad, 95 (Zalmay, Senior assisnant at RAND Institute and former U.S. ambassador Spring, 1995, The Washington Quarterly, Rethinking Grand Strategy, Losing the Moment? The United States and the World After the Cold War, l/n)<br />
Under the third option, the United States would seek… balance of power system.<br />

Contention Three - Terrorism<br />
The US is currently losing the war on terrorism<br />
The Times Union 9-3-06<br />
Today, the United States… losing the war.<br />
<br />
The Bush administration’s establishment of military commissions that violate international standard of fairness and human rights have planted the seed for future terrorist attacks upon Americans<br />
Lugosi 05 (Charles, Prof of Law @ St. Thomas University, Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review)<br />
The international message… attacks upon Americans.<br />
<br />
A revised approach to trying detainees will help the US gain allies to win the war on terrorism<br />
Dunlap 06 (Charles, 9/7, The Deputy Judge Advocate General US Air Force, Congressional Testimony)<br />
A revised approach to military… in our warfighting interests.<br />

Contention Two - Hegemony<br />
<br />
Now is the critical time to change international perceptions about the US.<br />
Dunlap 06 (Charles, 9/7, The Deputy Judge Advocate General US Air Force, Congressional Testimony)<br />
The United States is… advocate of the rule of law.<br />
<br />
First, applying Geneva standards to detainees is the critical SIGNAL needed to regain Soft Power.<br />
The Observer 04 (6/6, l/n)<br />
THE CURRENT WHITE HOUSE administration… as much as the imprisoned.<br />
<br />
Specifically, extending Geneva protections is key to create COALITIONS to solve the most pressing issues of this day.<br />
Miami Herald 06 (7/12)<br />
This is a far better way… such a policy years ago<br />
<br />
In particular, the respect for customary and INTERNATIONAL LAW that would come from application of the Geneva Convention would restore US international credibility.<br />
Sweeney 03 (Michael JD, adjunct professor of law and former Joseph R.

Hegemony – The US needs soft power by applying Geneva Convention so detainees allow coalitions. Soft power is key to hegemony and a decline in hegemony leads to nuclear war.<br />
<br />
Terrorism – Terrorists recruits are increasing because of Guantanamo Bay and increase in terrorism leads to nuclear war.<br />
<br />
US/EU – The EU is mad at the US over Guantanamo Bay and that’s killing our relations. Relations are key to the global economy and economic decline leads to nuclear war.<br />

Reynolds 06 (Maura Reynolds. LAT. Sept 5, 2006<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-congress5sep05,0,5376452.story?coll=la-home-headlines" rel="nofollow">http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-congress5sep05,0,5376452.story?coll=la-home-headlines</a><br />
It's going to be &quot;Security September&quot;… terrorist suspects,&quot; Boehner spokesman Kevin Madden said.<br />
<br />
TEXT: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin by holding that trials of enemy combatants in military tribunals violates the Geneva Convention and holding that all enemy combatants will be guaranteed a trial through a courts martial in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice.<br />
<br />
Contention Two - Hegemony<br />
<br />
Now is the critical time to change international perceptions about the US.<br />
Dunlap 06 (Charles, 9/7, The Deputy Judge Advocate General US Air Force, Congressional Testimony)<br />
The United States is… advocate of the rule of law.<br />
<br />
First, applying Geneva standards to detainees is the critical SIGNAL needed to regain Soft Power.<br />
The Observer 04 (6/6, l/n)<br />
THE CURRENT WHITE HOUSE administration… as much as the imprisoned.<br />
<br />
Specifically, extending Geneva protections is key to create COALITIONS to solve the most pressing issues of this day.<br />
Miami Herald 06 (7/12)<br />
This is a far better way… such a policy years ago<br />
<br />
In particular, the respect for customary and INTERNATIONAL LAW that would come from application of the Geneva Convention would restore US international credibility.<br />
Sweeney 03 (Michael JD, adjunct professor of law and former Joseph R. Crowley Fellow in International Human Rights at Fordham University School of Law, Human Rights Magazine, Winter, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.abanet.org/irr/hr/winter03/detention.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.abanet.org/irr/hr/winter03/detention.html</a>)<br />
Despite claiming to respect the Geneva… world—and found wanting.<br />
<br />
And, the images and stories of US torture that have damaged our image can only be rectified by the plan.<br />
Kohl 05 (Senator Kohl, June 15 2005 (Senator Herbert Kohl, (D-WI), Federal News Service, Lexis-Nexis Universe)<br />
SEN. HERBERT KOHL (D-WI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman… safe from terrorist threats.<br />
<br />
In Addition, our application of courts-martial proceedings is a legitimate means of restoring US international credibility.<br />
Silliman 06 (Scott, Prof of Law @ Duke, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2006/07/silliman_oped.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2006/07/silliman_oped.html</a>)<br />
In last week’s decision, the Supreme Court… under the rule of law.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, this revival of soft power is critical to US hegemony.<br />
Daalder and Lindsay 03 (Ivo H. and James M., Senior Fellows in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, Summer,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/views/papers/daalder/20030814.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/views/papers/daalder/20030814.pdf</a>)<br />
The more others question America’s power… power will mean very little.<br />
<br />
And, US hegemony is key to preventing global nuclear war<br />
Khalilzad, 95 (Zalmay, Senior assisnant at RAND Institute and former U.S. ambassador Spring, 1995, The Washington Quarterly, Rethinking Grand Strategy, Losing the Moment? The United States and the World After the Cold War, l/n)<br />
Under the third option, the United States would seek… balance of power system.<br />
<br />
Contention Three - Terrorism<br />
The US is currently losing the war on terrorism<br />
The Times Union 9-3-06<br />
Today, the United States… losing the war.<br />
<br />
The Bush administration’s establishment of military commissions that violate international standard of fairness and human rights have planted the seed for future terrorist attacks upon Americans<br />
Lugosi 05 (Charles, Prof of Law @ St. Thomas University, Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review)<br />
The international message… attacks upon Americans.<br />
<br />
A revised approach to trying detainees will help the US gain allies to win the war on terrorism<br />
Dunlap 06 (Charles, 9/7, The Deputy Judge Advocate General US Air Force, Congressional Testimony)<br />
A revised approach to military… in our warfighting interests.<br />
<br />
And, international cooperation is key to solving instability and terrorism<br />
Heymann 03 Philip B. Heymann, prof law Harvard, 2003, “Terrorism, Freedom, and Security: Winning without War” p. 120-1<br />
To the extent to which… opposition and even terrorism.<br />
<br />
And – the unchecked abuse decreases the popularity of moderates who are necessary to check anti-Americanism and terrorism. The camp has become the most effective recruiting agent for future terrorists.<br />
Rose 05 David Rose, writer and investigative journalist, 2005, Guantanamo: The War on Human Rights p. 10-11<br />
Meanwhile, if Guantanamo has… written in blood.<br />
<br />
And, applying Geneva solves international law and restores US credibility with allies and hurts terrorism.<br />
Columbus Dispatch 06 (July 16th, “Applying Geneva Conventions to terrorism detainees positions United States where it belongs”, lexis)<br />
That is the moral case for applying… by international law.<br />
<br />
And – the timeframe is short - Terrorist use of WMD’s is the most immediate and enormous threat to the U.S.<br />
Sloan, 03 (Elinor, Asst. prof. international security in political science, Carleton, International Journal, March 2003 l/n)<br />
The Central Intelligence Agency… critical US infrastructures.<br />
<br />
And – terrorists have the motive and the means to acquire and use nuclear weapons<br />
Allison and Kokoshin 02 (Graham, Professor of Government and Former Director of the Belfer Center, Harvard University, Andrei Member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences and Member of the Board of Directors, NTI | “The New Containment” – the National Interest | Lexis)<br />
In sum: even a conservative estimate… victim of nuclear terrorism.<br />
<br />
Finally, Unchecked terrorism will lead to extinction<br />
Alexander ’03 (Yonah, professor and director of the Inter-University for Terrorism Studies in Israel and the United States, August 28, The Washington Times l/n)<br />
Last week's brutal suicide bombings in Baghdad… there is no survival.&quot;<br />
US/EU – The EU is mad at the US over Guantanamo Bay and that’s killing our relations. Relations are key to the global economy and economic decline leads to nuclear war.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Four – Solvency<br />
The US Supreme Court should overturn Ex parte Quirin as an illegitimate precedent that offends modern day rule of law<br />
Belknap, Danelski, Irons, and O’Donnell 06
