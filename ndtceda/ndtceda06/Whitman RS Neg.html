Counterplan<br />
Text:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that there are no federalism limits on Congressional Treaty Power, and not overrule Missouri v. Holland. The United States Congress should pass legislation explicitly implementing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including a federal civil remedy for gender violence modeled on 42 USC 13981, in the Violence Against Women Act, and should fully comply with the treaty, including refraining from any attempts to undermine the spirit or goals of the treaty. The legislation should include declarations to the court of congressional intent to exercise congressional authority to implement these treaties, including but not limited to the Treaty Power and Necessary and Proper Clause. The United States Congress should pass legislation stating that Customary International Law is binding on the United States and enforceable by United States Courts. The United States Congress should pass legislation adopting the ten step human rights agenda advanced by Human Rights Watch. The United States federal government should not pre-emptively attack Iran.<br />
Adopting the HRW 10 step plan would boost human rights cred.<br />
