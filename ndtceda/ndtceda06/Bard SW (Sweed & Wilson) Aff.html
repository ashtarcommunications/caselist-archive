Bard SW AFF<br />
The 1AC affirmed life itself: specifically love. It was a criticism of, among other things, God as a generator, people as machines and cows as steak.<br />
The 2AC argued that the role of the ballot should be to affirm life and love. The aff refused to lay out a framework for how a “debate” should be judged, but the 1AR later indicated that the judges should view the debate as two shows, and they should vote for the better show. Whether this means entertainment as the method of evaluation is unclear.<br />
The 1AR indicated that the notion of competition, or the need for negative “ground” (although that word was never used in the round), is perhaps to fill a personal void, or a place where love is lacking. The 1AR said to vote aff because the aff just wants to act like children, not robots.<br />
The 2AR said there is no impact in debate. The 1AR and 2AR pretended to spot a cow outside of the window and hugged.<br />

Upon Cross X, this means<br />
<h3 id="toc7"><a name="Round the 6th-Bard SW Aff-1ac w/ cites"></a><strong><em>1ac w/ cites</em></strong></h3>
<br />
1ac is an affirmation of the world around us through unconditional love.<br />
Reject knowledge of what love is; we know its not lust or labido but we still don’t know what it is<br />
A crucial distintion to embracing the world as it is around us is the strong / weak god perspective. A strong god prevents our understanding because we perceive it as empowering everything, when it is really a short circuit. The affirmative instead endorses a weak god.<br />
There’s some rap going on too<br />

We’ll affirm the resolution<br />
We are that love – deep affection<br />
We are not judges<br />
History isn’t right, because history isn’t at all<br />
The generator is god or can be<br />
God is a machine – he’s wired up to everything and gives them its power<br />
What if god was not the generator – what if he was the opposite?<br />
Love affirms without desiring it<br />
We affirm and let the resolution be<br />

<br />
Respect the alterity of the resolution<br />
Caputo 06 “The Weakness of God: A Theology of the Event” (All arguments come from this book)<br />
Prefer our babble to their babble – trying to get consensus is bad<br />
We defend the entirety of the resolution<br />
We affirm the resolution regardless of the lack of solutions<br />
Allow for all consequences<br />
We can’t control the future – leads to anxiety<br />
Anxiety destroys the value of life<br />
The logic of mastery creates violence<br />
The affirmative is an unconditional affirmation of everything – it's a permutation of everything<br />
This is a process - This is about weakness and not defining and trying to gain power<br />
Trying to control the world is an atrocity<br />
Can only get value to life happen when you avoid redemption<br />

2AC Overiview:<br />
Their Action is a reaction to anxiety. The negative proposal is a way to master the uncertainty of the future. The anxious individual demands that the life of this day be lost for the security of tomorrow- a security that does not exist- Tommorow belongs to god<br />

at districts they broke a new affirmative (or so I heard) pretty sure it was about unconditional love. It was in one of their affirmative debates day 1, either of those teams will know.<br />
