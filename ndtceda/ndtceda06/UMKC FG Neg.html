Risk assessment link<br />
Environmental regulations rely on risk assessment to justify penalties and conditions for intervention. This ignores that some groups are more vulnerable than others to environmental degradation. Risk assessments serves to prop up elites’ perspectives on nature<br />
Verchick, 1996, Harvard women’s law journal, lexis<br />
“risk assessments, which play an essential role in environmental…the measure of all things.”<br />
Ecofeminism breaks down all forms of domination and oppressive power structures<br />
Bile, 2005, ecology, feminism, and a revised critical rhetoric, p. online, august<br />
“the most recently emerging line of ecofeminist argument entails a unified…contemporary ecofeminist theory.”<br />
Environmental destruction is a symptom of the refusal to accept sexual difference – the attempt to unify and control the non-male makes violent<br />
Stone, 2003, continental philosophy review 36, 415-432, irigaray and holderlin on the relation between nature and culture<br />
“besides paraphrasing Heidegger, irigaray distances herself subtly from him…nature that he wishes to question.”<br />
Ir epistemology is based on power structures that affirm its homogenous “truth” while ignoring alternative perspectives<br />
Anupam pandey, 2006, forging bonds with women, nature and the third world<br />
“both traditional ir theory and its positivist basis…evidenced in nature.”<br />
Alt is gynecological eco feminism<br />
<h3 id="toc9"><a name="Round the 8th-UMKC FG Neg-Block Strategy:"></a><strong><em>Block Strategy:</em></strong></h3>
Environmental rhetoric idealizes calculation that is part of a hegemonic masculinity working to subordinate women<br />
Bretherton, 2003, global environmental politics, 3.2 103-119<br />
“paradoxically, the structural disadvantage suffered by women provides the basis…demanded by an ethic of care for the environment.”<br />
Masculine epistemology is self-referential and rationalizes its own reality of domination and control – ecofeminism introduces other forms of knowledge that is socially contextual and plural<br />
Bile, 2005, ecology, feminism, and a revised critical rhetoric, p. online, august<br />
“privileging modes of inquiry of, by, and for men, dominant modes…self-reflective and self-critical cast”<br />
Ecofeminist is critical to inject science and rationality with alternative ways of knowing that prevent domination and exploitation<br />
Anupam pandey, 2006, forging bonds with women, nature and the third world<br />
“yet another reason why women’s expertise is denied is because of the deep link…the positivist epistemology of JR.”<br />
Science is not as adequate as members of local communites at perceiving environmental harm<br />
Verchick, 1996, Harvard women’s law journal, lexis<br />
“if reference to local context enables activists to expand…real people who are being harmed.”<br />
Gynocentric ecology is an on-going process of thinking that conceives of nature in a situation of becoming, while refusing to believe that technology and objectity are permanent referents. This transforms science and environmental policy from a logic of domination to one of empowerment and mutually constituted relationships<br />
Glazebrook, 2005 ethics and the environment 10.2, 75-99<br />
“gynocentric ecologics take the Aristotelian point to heart in two ways…virtue of healthy logics of defference.’<br />
It is not that science is holistically bad, it is just only understood from perspective that allow masculinity to continue a colonialist/violetn project<br />
Cuomo, 2002, ethics and the environment, 7.2, 1-11<br />
“when we take ecofeminism to be primarily a theory of…as passive and inert.”<br />
Your managerialism/objectivity turns are not offensive – gynocentric ecology doesn’t seek to eliminate policy toward the environment<br />
Glazebrook, 2005 ethics and the environment 10.2, 75-99<br />
“ravi ravindra has argued that science can be a spiritual path…reductive objectivity and assault.”<br />
Ecofeminism is not essentialist – it recognizes the false nature of all dualisms<br />
Warren, 2002, ethics and the environment, 7.2, 39-59<br />
“for example, glazebrook correctly understands my response to critics…version of ecofeminist philosophy.”<br />
Our alternative solves intersections like race and sex<br />
Twine, 2001, ethics and the environment, 6.2, 31-58<br />
“ecofeminist writings are at the forefront of attempts to…novel coalitionary possibilities.”<br />
Ecological alternatives can unite women that inhabit all intersections – the rethinkin of our relationship to nature forces our ideology to confront the way that different women are affected by patriarchies grip on the environment<br />
Heller, 1992, synthesis/regeneration 3 spring, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.greens.org/s-r/03/03-06.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.greens.org/s-r/03 /03-06.html</a><br />
“an ecological feminist politics of health encompasses…certain women within our movement.”<br />
Sax’s public trust doctrine embedded in nearly all environmental law is a wrong and seriously flawed solution to environmental crisis<br />
Delgado, 1991, 44 vand. L. rev. 1209<br />
“sax proposed as simple, easily understood, and intuitively…protection for the environment.”<br />
AT: Perm<br />
The aff reliance on regulations assumes the self interested individual – ecofeminism assumes the opposite<br />
Anupam pandey, 2006, forging bonds with women, nature and the third world<br />
“the case-study demonstrates a special relationship…under the pretext of “objectivity.”<br />
The entire system of the aff is inherently inadequate – we are the opposite<br />
Anupam pandey, 2006, forging bonds with women, nature and the third world<br />
“both the neo-liberal and neo-realist paradigms in GEC are masculine…more holistic perspective.”<br />
Scientific objectivity in environmental claims is based on an epistemology that values the phallic at the expense of the feminism<br />
Glazebrook, 2005, ethics and the environment, 10.2, 75-99<br />
“likewise, I wish to provide a diagnosis and etiology…claims to be universal.”<br />
<br />
Epistemological questioning of our knowledge of the environment is key<br />
Cheney, 2005, ethics and the environment, 10.2, 101-135<br />
“what Shepard adds to lovibond’s argument…knowledge and truth.”<br />

Desegregation does not solve resource inequality.<br />
Feagin &amp; Barnett 2005<br />
Joe &amp; Bernice, “Success and Failure: How systematic Racism trumped Brown v Board of Education, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://home.law.uiuc.edu/lrev/publications/2000s/2004/2004_5/Feagin.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://home.law.uiuc.edu/lrev /publications/2000s/2004/2004 _5/Feagin.pdf__</a><br />
“To assess whether critical resources are… black schools as compared to predominantly white schools.”<br />
Court overruling Milliken wouldn’t change anything.<br />
Mark Rahdert 2004, “Symposium: Vision and Revision: Exploring the History, Evolution, and Future of the Fourteenth Amendment: Obstacles and Wrong Turns on the Road From Brown: Milliken v. Bradley..” 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 785, l/n<br />
“Without some fundamental changes in equal protection… is the key to student success.”<br />
Desegregation hurts minority communities financially and destruction of critical neighborhood social ties.<br />
Caldas and Bankston 2005 <u>Forced to Fail</u> p 11<br />
“Desegregation, as it has been practised.. shools in the name of equalization.”<br />
<h3 id="toc27"><a name="UMKC FG--Off Case Args:"></a><strong><em>Off Case Args:</em></strong></h3>
Test Case specification<br />
<u>T-overrule</u><br />
Definitions on caselist – violation – The Aff does not overrule the decision in Milliken. Rather they say that social science ev. Submitted to the court means residential segregation exists. This isn’t the original ? in Milliken and hence isn’t an overrule.<br />
<br />
Critique:<br />
The affirmative’s portrayal of the law creates it as an object that is separate and controlling of society. The patently Eurocentric thought creates dichotomies of order and disorder which can only be mediated by the legal system. This Eurocentric viewpoint is the key to the dominance of the west.<br />
Nunn 1997, <em>15 Law &amp; Ineq. J. 323</em>,<br />
“Dichotomous reasoning is a trait of Eurocentricity… no longer necessary to legitimate post-Enlighten-ment law:”<br />
Law is not an extension of one’s culture, but a creation of a culture. The Eurocentric expansion of the law relies on aggressive, competitive and individualistic drive for domination. This is the root of all racism, sexism, and genocide.<br />
Nunn 1997, same cite<br />
“Several schools of legal thought now exist… been formed in the European historical and cultural context.”<br />
Law cannot address segregation or racial inequality effectively. The law can only process bits and pieces of racial inequality. Ideas of equl protection or school desegregation never address the real problem of cultural hegemony and racial domination.<br />
Nunn 1997<br />
“Moreover, there are some issues and concerns that the law cannot address… the affirmative action debate is about politics, about power and ultimately about morality.”<br />
The affirmative’s attempt to relegate everything to knowable data and exclusion of everything outside of the easily quantifiable is an attempt to control and manipulate reality and exert power over the unknowable.<br />
Maria C. Cimitile &amp; Elaine P. Miller.<br />
<u>Returning to Irigaray</u> “A New Economy of Relations”<br />
“Etymologically, the word “economy” describes… . an information code or a computer program.”<br />
Calculus = zero point of the Holocaust<br />
Michael Dillon 1999 “Another Justice” Political Theory vol 27 No2 April<br />
“Otherness is born(e) within the self as an integral… integral to the lack constitutive of the human way of being.”<br />
Our alternative is to reject the affirmative’s reliance on visible, revealed, rational knowledge to shape politics; instead, we must embrace the invisible, unknown, irrational aspects of being as a site that opens a potential for transformation in the very parameters of invisibility.<br />
Maria Cimitle &amp; Elaine P. Miller, 2007<br />
