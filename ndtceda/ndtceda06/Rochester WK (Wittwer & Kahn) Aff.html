The US V. Morrison Decision prevents congress from legislating a civil remedy<br />
for violence against womyn Harper 06 (Gonzales v. Raich: Has New Federalism Gone<br />
Up in Smoke?” 57 Mercer L. Rev 1309, Summer)<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court used the rational basis test to create a new standard,<br />
determining that rape is non-economic activity and that it’s economic<br />
correlation is irrational Goldberg 01 (“Substantial Activity and Non_Economic<br />
Commerce: Toward a New Theory of the Commerce Clause,´9 J.L. &amp; Pol’y 563)<br />
<br />
Ben and I support and are Resolved: At the next available opportunity, the<br />
United States Supreme Court should overrule U.S. v. Morrison 529 U.S. 598 (2000)<br />
authorizing Congress to legislate the Federal Civil Rights Remedy of the<br />
Violence Against Women Act under the power delegated under the Commerce and<br />
Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. We’ll clarify.<br />

<h2 id="toc23"><a name="Morrison 1AC-Adv. 1 Categorization"></a>Adv. 1 Categorization</h2>
In Morrison the Court’s use of section 13981 established a categorization of<br />
the Federal Civil Rights Remedy as a criminal concern – this ideology was<br />
modeled through the media to the public<br />
Russell, JD from Yale Law School, 2003<br />
(Sarah, Michigan Journal of Gender and Law,)<br />
Why didn't the name &quot;civil rights remedy&quot; stick? … conceptualize the remedy as<br />
a discrimination law.<br />
<br />
This media perception of the decision outweighs the decision itself –<br />
communication through the media shifts public opinion on gendered violence<br />
Russell, JD from Yale Law School, 2003<br />
(Sarah, Michigan Journal of Gender and Law,)<br />
Proponents of the remedy hoped to change …editorials and commentary pieces.<br />
<br />
The categorization of the Civil Rights Remedy as criminal supports the current<br />
ideology of the public private dichotomy which constantly regulates violence<br />
against women to a separate sphere outside of public concern<br />
Russell, JD from Yale Law School, 2003<br />
(Sarah, Michigan Journal of Gender and Law,)<br />
The characterization of the remedy … other federal civil rights statutes, and<br />
proper for regulation under the Commerce Clause.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Shifting this categorization is essential to understanding gendered<br />
violence and educating the public<br />
Russell, JD from Yale Law School, 2003<br />
(Sarah, Michigan Journal of Gender and Law,)<br />
Drafters of the Violence Against Women Act …faced in state legal systems.<br />
<br />
Finally, Violence against women serves as the foundation for greater campaigns<br />
of aggression, the systemic slaughter of women’s material and psychic<br />
existence provides the context for the violence of the international system.<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, U of Michigan Law School, 2006<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard International Law Journal, winter page lexis, gjm)<br />
Acts of violence against women are mass atrocities, … while everyday life<br />
never ends.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc24"><a name="Morrison 1AC-Adv. 2 Commerce"></a>Adv. 2 Commerce</h2>
Though the Morrison decision sought to obscure this fact, violence against womyn<br />
is pervasively economic Ackerman 99 (from amicus curie brief<br />
cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/vaw/readings/library/profamicuspet.html)<br />
<br />
Economic transactions which are non-market and non-capitalist are not<br />
prioritized by the system. This leads to marginalization of femininity in the<br />
market The answer is to expand our notions of economic Gibson-Graham 96 (The end<br />
of capitalism (as we know it), HB 501 .6447 1996 260-261)<br />
<br />
Only by identifying violence as economic violence linked to the state can we<br />
resist extermination of populations- Any alternative fails to understand the<br />
state, society, or capital Althusser 73 (Lenin and Philosophy, Monthly Review<br />
Press NY pg. 138-140)<br />
<br />
The philosophical project of revealing economic violence is the essential<br />
foundation of the class struggle – Only by taking a position in this conflict<br />
can we expose hidden violence and resist it. Althusser 96 (Louis. Writings on<br />
Psychoanalysis: Freud and Lacan. Columbia University Press; New York. 1996. p.<br />
109-111)<br />

Civil Remedies repoliticize the law and challenge the relegation of womyn to the<br />
private and local spheres, sending a signal which break down gender, racial, and<br />
class domination Benedict 02 (“United States v. Morrison: Progressive<br />
Legislation is Down, but not Out,” 33 University of Toledo Law Review 411,<br />
Winter)<br />
<br />
Overruling Morrison on both Commerce and Equal protection creates an<br />
interpretation of the constitution which acknowledged the necessity of federal<br />
action in the struggle against gendered violence without creating a slippery<br />
slope to intervention in other areas. (MacKinnon, Catherine A. Prof. of Law at U<br />

<br />
<br />
Observation 1: Planned Parenthood v. Casey<br />
<br />
The Casey Decision is the Basis for Parental Notification and Consent Laws for Abortion—Forty Four States Have Adopted Such Laws as a Result, Punishing Minors for the Simple Fact of Their Age<br />
Dana M. Northcraft, J.D., City University of New York School of Law, BOOK REVIEW: A NATION SCARED: CHILDREN, SEX, AND THE DENIAL OF HUMANITY: A REVIEW ESSAY ON JUDITH LEVINE'S HARMFUL TO MINORS: THE PERILS OF PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM SEX, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 2004, p. lexis<br />
The battleground over abortion … lobbying power as well.<br />
<br />
These Laws Put Women in a Dangerous Situation—They Do Not Deter Women from Obtaining Abortions But Result in Domestic Violence and Deadly Unsafe Abortions<br />
Amanda C. Scuder, J.D. Candidate, American University, Washington College of Law, COMMENT: THE INAPPLICABILITY OF PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT LAWS TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF MIFEPRISTONE (RU-486) TO MINORS, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 2002 p. lexis<br />
<br />
In theory, parental involvement … an undue burden on minors. n196<br />
<br />
The Judicial Bypass Proceedings Allowed By Casey are Insufficient—They Exacerbate the Already Significant Difficulties and Are Sometimes Unavailable Altogether<br />
Jennifer Blasdelll, Staff Attorney, National Abortion Federation, SYMPOSIA: UNBURDENING THE RIGHT TO ABORTION: CASEY'S UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD MOTHER, MAY I?: RAMIFICATIONS FOR PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT LAWS FOR MINORS SEEKING ABORTION SERVICES, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 2002, p. lexis<br />
The judicial bypass procedure cannot … from government obstacles.<br />
<br />
Finally—We’ve Got Your Specific Solvency Right Here: The Status Quo Supports an Idealized Family and Child—The Supreme Court Should Overrule Casey, Indicating that Parental Involvement Statutes are Unconstitutional<br />
LEONARD BERMAN, J.D., University of Toledo College of Law, NOTE: PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY: SUPREME NEGLECT FOR UNEMANCIPATED MINORS' ABORTION RIGHTS, Howard Law Journal, 1994, p. lexis<br />
<br />
The Casey Court based its decision …must either consult a parent, guardian, or a local judge. n134<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court Should Grant Cert to a Relevant Test Case and Overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey 505 U.S. 833 (1992), Holding that Parental Notification and Parental Consent Requirements are Unconstitutional.<br />
<br />
Observation 2: The Myth of Youth<br />
<br />
The Construction of Youth in Parental Consent Laws is an Attempt to Depict the Young as Innocent Angels Who Must Be Protected From the Evils of Sexuality—Pregnancy Becomes a Punishment For Young Women Who Experience Sexual Desire<br />
Dana M. Northcraft, J.D., City University of New York School of Law, BOOK REVIEW: A NATION SCARED: CHILDREN, SEX, AND THE DENIAL OF HUMANITY: A REVIEW ESSAY ON JUDITH LEVINE'S HARMFUL TO MINORS: THE PERILS OF PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM SEX, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 2004, p. lexis<br />
Many laws seem to say that minors … often get in the way of truly making the intent a reality. n221<br />
<br />
Further, the Status Quo is Experiencing a Revival of the Suppression of Minor Women’s Sexuality—Parental Notification Laws are Part of a Crusade to Restore the Perpetually Lost Object of “Family Values&quot;<br />
J. Shoshanna Ehrlich Associate Professor of Law at UMASS Boston, SYMPOSIUM: SCIENCE, POLITICS, AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: FROM AGE OF CONSENT LAWS TO THE &quot;SILVER RING THING&quot;: THE REGULATION OF ADOLESCENT FEMALE SEXUALITY, Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine, Winter, 2006, p. lexis<br />
We are presently in an era of intense concern … federally funded abstinence-only education.<br />
<br />
<br />
But the Lack Which the Myth of Youth Attempts to Fill is Structurally Necessary, It Cannot Be Erased—We Must Take a Radical and Profound Responsibility For These Fantasies To Avoid Holocaust and War<br />
Jan Jagodzinski, Prof. at university of Alberta, Youth Fantasies: The Perverse Landscape of the Media, Palgrave MacMillan, 2004 p. 66<br />
History has judged that all those participants … takes on the utmost importance for future direction.<br />
<br />
This Conception of Youth Embodies a Fantasy of Erasing Differences to Achieve an Impossible State of Purity—Such a Recognition is Critical to the Grand Narrative of Progress<br />
Jan Jagodzinski, Prof. at university of Alberta, Youth Fantasies: The Perverse Landscape of the Media, Palgrave MacMillan, 2004 p. 33-34<br />
In Lacan's later writing the fantasy … anagogy and anamorphosis which elaborates an &quot;initial forgetting.&quot; (93)<br />
Such Discourses About the Sexuality of the Child are a Way to Support the Imperialist and Racist Projects of the State Through The Disavowal of Its Own Violence<br />
Jan Jagodzinski, Prof. at university of Alberta, Youth Fantasies: The Perverse Landscape of the Media, Palgrave MacMillan, 2004 p. 22-23<br />
