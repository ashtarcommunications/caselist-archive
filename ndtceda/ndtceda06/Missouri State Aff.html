This summary of the movie ‘Dark City’ helps us to illustrate that our perception of the world does not come to us innocently from the mere facts of events. Instead, something we call the Real mediates this perception. The Real is not the reality lurking beneath representations of the world, but instead an excess or lack introduced in the very act of representation, and indeed the very act of forming the social order. Our society lunches forward from crisis to crisis: nuclear war, ecological devastation, economic loss, etc., each time believing that each crisis is a historically specific situation that requires some minor corrective course of action. This perspective misidentifies the Real as a historically specific situation rather than a feature inherent in the social edifice itself. Lurking beneath every fantasy of peace, stability, and resolution is a threat of disorder and chaos. Catastrophe always hovers; such is the nature of our being.<br />
<br />
Zizek 04, Conversations with Zizek (78-9)<br />
<br />
Here I would agree with Laclau and Mouffe's notion that …..is something opposing you, but because of this purely formal, structurally inherent, self-blockade.<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to protect ourselves psychologically from the traumatic effects of this ever-present Real, we have all acquiesced to the spell of ideology. Ideology works by constructing a fantasy of reality in which it is possible to overcome the inevitable crises generated by the Real. As a result, we have entered into a cycle of distance and proximity to the Real in which we wait anxiously until catastrophe confronts us as “on the brink,” and then we take some small corrective measure thereby deferring our reconciliation with catastrophe until the next time the threat emerges. This process of constant deferral prevents us from ever fundamentally reordering the world, and instead moves us towards a New World Order which selectively constitutes groups of people to eliminate as barriers. In order to keep our fantasy functioning properly one thing we must do is keep minorities at a distance. The Supreme Courts decision in Milliken v Bradley selected a group based on the threat of racial minorities in our cities and schools and risks rather than accepts the intrinsically risky nature of the entire symbolic venture.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zizek 04, Conv. With Zizek, 12-3<br />
<br />
The central issue is one of proximity; of maintaining ….is rather something that can be seen to function as an implicit-­obscene ideological supplement in today's realpolitik.<br />
<br />
<br />
As if we were all characters in ‘Dark City’ attempting to escape the Strangers and searching for Shell Beach, Milliken vs. Bradley constructs a fantasy of reality by encouraging white flight to the suburbs and allowing a distancing between suburban and urban school districts. We fail to realize that Shell Beach really is nothing more than a billboard on a brick wall.<br />
<br />
Chemerinsky 2k3<br />
Erwin Chemerinsky, Professor of Public Interest Law, Legal Ethics, and Political Science, University of Southern California Law School August 2003 52 Am. U.L. Rev. 1461<br />
<br />
Thus, by the 1970s it was clear that effective …that in many areas, Milliken means no desegregation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in Milliken vs. Bradley (1974).<br />
<br />
<br />
Overruling Milliken v Bradley allows a break with the social edifice. A full immersion in law opens the possibility for hope and transformation by accepting love and rendering law a non-all.<br />
<br />
Jodi Dean (department of political science, Hobart and William Smith Colleges), 2006<br />
Zizek’s Politics, p. 164<br />
<br />
Zizek argues that Pauline love involves full ….non-all, available for use and transformation.<br />
<br />
<br />
The action of the overrule of Milliken v Bradley entails an identification with the excluded element breaking the contours of the capitalism system. The plan is a gesture of risk shattering conventional politics and guaranteeing a space for our freedom.<br />
<br />
Jodi Dean (department of political science, Hobart and William Smith Colleges), 2006<br />
Zizek’s Politics,p.200-202<br />
<br />
In his interview with Glyn Daly, Zizek …..for Zizek this absence of guarantees is the very space of our freedom.<br />
The district based barrier to integration created by Milliken v Bradley is the search for the Shell Beach of the suburbs, but the express train to Shell Beach never actually stops to pick up travellers. Only by recognizing the emptiness behind this motive for escape can we traverse the fantasy and create space for authentic,ethical political action.<br />
McGowan, teaches critical theory and film in the English Department at the U Vermont 2004 (Todd Lacan and Contemporary Film, Ed. McGowan and Kunkle, pg 155-69<br />
<br />
For all its ability to control both ….political act, one that eschews symbolic authority and authors a radical break.<br />

1AC (Missouri State JP)<br />
So here’s your plan: In the next appropriate test case the United States Supreme Court should overrule their decision in U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) by eliminating the “economic/non-economic” dichotomy for challenges to Congressional legislation in regards to the commerce clause.<br />
<br />
<br />
First,<br />
75% of women will be subject to violent crime, and more will die this year than were killed on September 11-but it’s not just about numbers. It’s about the lives destroyed in the process.<br />
Johnson 2003 (Privileged Justice Under Law: Reinforcement of male privilege by the federal judiciary through the lends of the violence against women act and U.S. v. Morrison, “every year…return to school”<br />
Overturning Morrison reconceptualizes law<br />
Goldfarb 2K<br />
<br />
Morrision isn’t about the endangered species act or terrorism-it’s about the loss of the only part of the VAWA that recognized the necessary steps to stop the classification of women as second-class citizens in the U.S.<br />
MacKinnon @K<br />
“To the ear…should survive”<br />
<br />
This creates a masking system of categorical federalism. It’s a away for the Supreme Court to naturalize anything which seems like a family or a crime issue into the exclusive property of state governance<br />
<br />
Resnik 2001<br />
(Categorical federalism: jurisdiction, gender, and the globe)<br />
“The supreme court…to the framework itself”<br />
<br />
Relegating violence against women to the state sphere upholds a system of categorical federalism that forecloses the opportunity for women to gain rights<br />
Resnik 2001<br />
“Categorical federalism…lawmaking”<br />
<br />
Categorical federalism undermines the ability to hold actors politically accountable for their decisions. It is a form of institutional essentialization that under complicates the process of social change. The existence of Morrison is a way of deferring to legal concepts of jurisdiction instead of contesting patriarchal control.<br />
Resnik 2001<br />
“My willingness…patriarchal control”<br />
<br />
Jurisdictional analysis in Morrison is an explicit denial of equal citizenship. This precedent serves to naturalize a specific national identity that confines gender subordination.<br />
Resnik 2002 (Feminist justice, at home and abroad) “in this volume…retreated from view”<br />
<br />
This system obscures a systematic and dehumanizing war of sexual victimization<br />
Ray 97<br />
“Because, as currently constructed…is experienced”<br />
<br />
Ignoring the ongoing war of violence against women-the violence committed against Christy in the name of state commerce is a salp in the face to women everywhere, and ignores the root cause of those “wars” that they use as excuses to let this war continue<br />
<br />
Reardon 93<br />
These impacts demand action. For Christy’s and all other women’s sake, the courts must act now to remedy discrimination and prevent further reinforcement of violence.<br />
Johnson 2003<br />
“Equality is our aspiration…now the court needs to follow suit”<br />
<br />
And, overturning Morrison reconceptualizes law. Christy and other women are no longer relegated to the private sphere-the law is put in her and every other woman’s hands to control.<br />
Goldfarb 2K<br />

Framework<br />
Our framework – debate should be a site for contest over political proposals. This requires that the affirmative present a predictable plan of action and defends that their policy should be adopted by the United States federal government<br />
<br />
B. Definitions<br />
1. Topic is defined by the phrase following the colon – the USFG is the agent of the resolution not eh idivdual debaters<br />
Webster’s Guide to Grammar and Writing, 2000<br />
“Use of a colon before…with a capital letter.”<br />
<br />
2. Resolved express intent to implement the plan<br />
AHD, 2000<br />
To find a solution to: solve… to bring to a usually successful conclusion<br />
<br />
3. Should denotes an expectation of enacting the plan<br />
AHD, 2000<br />
<br />
4. The USFG is the government in DC<br />
Microsoft Encarta Online, 2000<br />
<br />
Our definition excludes actions of smaller political groups<br />
Black’s Law Dictionary, 1999<br />
Federal government 1. A national government that exercises some degree of control over smaller political units that have surrendered some degree of power in exchange for the right to participate in national political matters.<br />
<br />
Use your ballot to ratify constraints on discourse to preserve a politically-enabling discussion<br />
Shively, 2000, political theory and partisan politics, p. 179<br />
“To put this point another way, it turns out…that we can give them.”<br />
<br />
Pre-conditions of agreemtn are necessary for your decision to have political value<br />
Gundersen, 2000, Political Theory, and Partisan Politics, 104-5<br />
“Indirect political engagement is perhaps…extent the same question.”<br />
<br />
Spending time in an insulated forum like debate is a necessary precursor to successful activism in actuality.<br />
Coverstone, 1995, online an inward glance: a response to mitchell’s outward activism turn<br />
“Debate teaches individual decision-making…teaching these skills is our virtue.”<br />
<br />
This education is important because post 9-11 responses to terror makes some government violence inevitable<br />
Ignatieff, 2004, Lesser Evils, p. 18-19<br />
“To insist that justified exercises of coercion…as to their correctness.”<br />
<br />
Social injustices such as gender discrimination are not the root causes of war<br />
Goldstein, 2001, war and gender: how gender shapes the war system and vice versa, p. 412<br />
“First, peace activists face a dilemma…to be empirically inadequate.”<br />
<br />
Abandoning the economic-non-economic distinction automatically eliminates systematic discrimination by putting women on equal footing as men in the economic sphere. Recognizing that women contribute to and effect the economy is a productive way of forcing th government to consider gender-based violence a legitimate concern.<br />
Johnson, 2003, 43, Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399<br />
“The distinction between economic and non-economic regulation…Now the Court needs to follow suit.”<br />
<br />
Perm – do both<br />
Resistence must embrace the contradictions of its context – spaces cannot be perceived apart from the system that generates them permutation exploits this connection, creating the most disruptive fissure<br />
Kershaw, 1999, The radical in performance: Between Brecht and Baudrillard, 154-155<br />
“I have been arguing that performance can…possession of repressive power.”<br />
<br />
Focusing on the way our impacts are represented ignores details about its creation and numbs us to violence, making war more likely<br />

<br />
Economics is inevitable – must manipulate market forces to achieve environmental goals<br />
Thompson, 2003<br />
“Environmental moralists may which…precepts or education.”<br />
<br />
AT: Terrorism<br />
Terrorism is evil. Our inability to aggressively fight it is morally bankrupt and causes global violence<br />
Hannity, 2-1, 2005, Deliver us from evil, 1-4<br />
“I decided to write this book because I believe…that furnish their lifeblood.”<br />
<br />
Censoring the word “terrorist” is a perverted linguistic act that fractures true political debates, disconnects us from reality, and rationalizes atrocities<br />
Investor’s business daily, 7-13, 2005<br />
“Most people agree words should have meaning…our democracy deserves better.”<br />
<br />
Using the ballot as punishment for supposedly harmful language is a form of ideological censorship that legitimates totalitarianism. This is the same kind of ideology that produces genocide and police states<br />
Lind, 1998, The origins of Political Correctness, Online<br />
“We call it “political correctness… freedom and our culture.”<br />

D. Predictability is the mother of business confidence.<br />
Universal News Service 11/16/1993<br />
&quot;Predictability is the mother of confidence, and we want government to provide a steady, growing economic environment in which we can develop our businesses with that confidence,&quot; the CBI conference in Harrogate was told yesterday (Monday) by Clive Thompson, chairman of the SE Region and group chief executive of the Rentokil Group. He added: &quot;We in the CBI are no longer on the outside looking in - we're right on the inside. But being on the inside demands we express our views responsibly and completely. It is insufficient to put the business view in isolation without thought or concern for the requirements of the other parts of the economy. &quot;We cannot ignore the demands of health, education, social services and transport on the public purse. Clearly, tax revenue directed towards business means less resources for other important requirements in the economy. Recognition brings responsibility.&quot; He went on to advocate government focusing on creating an environment in which business could create success. &quot;We don't want radical changes of policy and direction much loved by politicians. Peaks and troughs have done more to wipe out the confidence so necessary for investment in research and development, speculative new projects, and investment in plant and machinery than any misguided political dogma. &quot;Businessmen invest in their businesses and take risks in new ventures if they believe they will be working in a business friendly environment. Confidence is the key, and for those who have to invest in the future, predictability is the mother of that confidence.&quot;<br />

Walter Russel Mead (Policy Analyst, World Policy Institute) 1992<br />
Hundreds of millions--billions--of people have pinned their hopes on the international market economy. They and their leaders have embraced market principles--and drawn closer to the west--because they believe that our system can work for them.<br />
But what if it can't? What if the global economy stagnates--or even shrinks? In that case, we will face a new period of international conflict: South against North, rich against poor. Russia, China, India--these countries with their billions of people and their nuclear weapons will pose a much greater danger to world order than Germany and Japan did in the 30s.<br />

The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) by reducing the judicial role in designating Congressional regulation as “economic” if a rational basis exists for the regulation under the Commerce Clause.<br />

Overruling is key- Distinguishing would not reverse Morrison’s effect on prior rulings<br />

<br />
On the first point, Common Lawyers ordinarily think of precedents as constituting the law up and until they are overruled. Once overruled the later decision is (normally) given retroactive effect, so the law is changed for the past as well as the future. But when a case is distinguished it is not often thought that the law was one thing until the later decision of a court, and now another thing. The law will be regarded prior to the later decision as already subject to various distinctions not mentioned by the earlier court. Indeed part of the skill of a good common lawyer is grasping the law as not stated by the earlier court: learning that cases are ‘distinguishable’ is a staple part of common law education, and no common lawyer would be competent who did not appreciate that the law was not to be identified simply with the ratio of an earlier decision. Common lawyers do not, then, conceptualise distinguishing along lines analogous to overruling.<br />

Congress passed Title II under the 14th Amendment and the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Tennessee argues that Congress acted unconstitutionally when it invoked the 14th Amendment. States are also challenging the constitutionality of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause in other courts.<br />
This amounts to a double-barreled assault on the ADA-and on the 49 million Americans with disabilities whose rights the ADA now protects.<br />
The Supreme Court's previous rulings limiting Congress's power to regulate commerce are cause for serious concern that Title II's most important provisions-those relating to access to the court system, voting, marriage and family rights, education and institutionalization-might not be upheld under the Commerce Clause.<br />

I'd be happy to. Mo State MM ran an abortion bad affirmative. Advantages were feminism and heteronormativity. The internals to the feminism advantage had something to do with women being functions of their control over reproduction. The heteronormative story was really sketchy, arguing that the right to abortion encouraged casual sex that reinforces heterosexuality and allows heterosexuals to further demean homosexuals. The crux of this argument came down to one card that was largely rhetorical, employing some anecdote of a heterosexual female who had an abortion bashing her homosexual acquaintance at some point.<br />
<br />
They also read the card that says striking down the right to choose will ensure democratic victory for years in the future and had some kind of progressive reform advantage in the solvency contention<br />
<br />
We read casey link-turns arguing that abortion bans kill the pro-life movement and they seemed to hold up well, though we didn't go for them.<br />

They were aff - it's on the wiki. Their aff is Pro-Life Casey. They say that abortions are bad because:<br />
Adv. 1 - they'll be used as a form of eugenics to root gay people out of society. ie when parents use genetic mapping to discover their baby has the gay gene, they will abort it. and Adv. 2 - patriarchy - it's used as form or control over women.<br />
<br />
we said link turn - they claim that their overrule of casey will spillover to an overrule of Roe. We said that would mobilize the pro-choice movement, make abortion legal in most states, cause congress to pass legislation, a constitutional amendment, state court rulings, etc. all to legalize abortion.<br />

THE PRO-CHOICE IDEOLOGY THAT IS RAMPANT AS A RESULT OF UNITED STATE V. CASEY ENSURES THAT PREGNANCY CONTINUES TO BE TREATED AS A DISEASE IN NEED OF A MEDICAL CURE. THIS MANDATES THAT SCIENCE RATHER THAN THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN DIGNITY GOVERN OUR LIFE. Control is maintained by ignoring experience and emotion and reducing everything down to a few hard cases. This maintains domination, oppression, and control. Abortion is premised on the notion that the female system needs to be manipulated and cleaned out<br />

<br />
THE NOTION THAT ABORTION IS A “WOMAN’S RIGHT” OR NECESSARY FOR “EQUALITY” IS PREMISED ON THE IDEA THAT TECHNOLOGICAL MANIPULATION IS A NECESSARY COMPONENET OF PERSONHOOD. THIS ARGUMENT APPEALS TO THE TRADITION OF WOMEN TO VIEW THEIR BODY AS DISGUSTING. THIS IS THE WORST FORM OF DEVALUATION BECAUSE IT LITERALLY TELLS WOMEN THAT IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO HAVE ABORTIONS THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO EXIST. This stance creates women as victims, and reduces women to nothing more than a womb. The impact to our advantage is total annihilation of the self.<br />

The current policy of segregation is symbolic of deeper problems. It represents the desire to continue a policy of bracketing off certain members of society; condemning them to unimaginable and incalculable suffering. This need to portray others as less worthy than us provides a massive impediment to achieving a connection to the rest of humanity. A failure to achieve this connection results in a complete denial of a politics of love and hope. A refusal of this politics results in self-alienation and destruction of our very being.<br />

Our plan is an embodiment of faith in a new way of living. It represents opening ourselves to strangers who we have thus far cast as enemies, and also opening ourselves to a future which will be radically different from our past. This openness allows us to transcend nationalist, militaristic narratives and replace them with holy ones that refuse false gods in favor of peace<br />

The appeal to a positive re-working of the world is not a hollow call for instant change or quick eyes. Destroying racist boundaries is not merely a call for integration and diversity. It is not about survival or the extension of humanity. It is a call to a powerful form of ethics that allows us to move from survival into actually living by understanding that it is only when life becomes full of joy and richness that survival is given meaning<br />

There are 2 categories you should understand when voting aff. The sacred and the holy. The sacred is an ethical category that attempts to place something above the law, above criticism, and above debate. When something becomes sacred it becomes untouchable. In the United States v. Milliken the court attempted to make certain school districts sacred or free from inclusion.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, we have been given a way to challenge this negative use of sacredness. This method of challenge is called the holy. The holy is an ethical category that acknowledges there is something external and greater to ourselves. It is an understanding that our lives are not our only concern. The holy may indeed be risky.<br />
<br />
The holy is not about moral goodness, world peace, or ethical. Rather it is accepting that to touch something greater than ourselves we must put traditional understandings of pleasure and pain aside. To achieve this category is to achieve a new frame of mind. It is only from this new frame of mind that a serious challenge to violence can be mounted.<br />
<br />
Rudolf Otto, 2003, Idea of the Holy, p 5-7<br />
“Holiness—The holy—is a category…spirit’ must be awakened”<br />
<br />
<br />
A refusal of the SQ divisions is an acceptance of an ethic of holiness. Aligning our energies with this ethic is necessary to create a new world. This is the only path to freedom, because it allows us to resist existing limits and break out dependency on the state to mandate equality.<br />
<br />
Fasching, Narrative Theology after Auschwitz, 1992, p 155-6<br />
“This paradox is expressed in…dominate our technical civilization”<br />
<br />
<br />
The point of our affirmative is not to create a utopia. In fact it is exactly the desire to know with certainty what will happen that prevents a positive re-invisioning of society. Simply refusing the divided nature of society is not enough. We also need a new hope; a faith that can’t guarantee a connection to a better world. We find this faith in the gesture of the plan. The plan is a leap of faith; a negative action that leaves the fate of the future to itself. It is an expression of humanity that sees a world beyond this one. Although this world is not here yet, it is nonetheless possible.<br />

No doubt the negative will argue that the court is not necessary to achieve the goal of the aff. This could not be further from the truth. A court overrule creates a unique space from which a new politics can be produced. Make no mistake, out 1ac is not about the inherent goodness of law, but rather seeks to uncover the personal &amp; political benefit of a court overrule. This benefit is not something that can be calculated. It is something that must be experiences, only voting aff makes this experience possible<br />

Our argument is especially true in the context of academic debates-using multicultural categories is essential to foster citizens who can challenge the existing social order-absent this education all domination is allowed to continue<br />

“It is crucial for critical educators…struggle, empowerment, and possibility”<br />
<br />
<br />
The Aff enacts a form of life changing politics where critique meets action. Our 1ac allows difference to be read not as typical liberal politics, but rather as a space that can create critical democracy. This space is necessary to incorporate the stranger into meaningful discussion-to refuse these discussions collapses into racism and cements the structures that make domination possible-it is only through the use of multicultural categories that violence can be challenged<br />
<br />
Giroux 92 (same as above)<br />
“The language of critique is…and economic exploitation”<br />
<br />
<br />
The loving nature of our 1ac allows us to break out of the violent sacrificial logic of the law. This love will not be pleasurable and will require immense sacrifice that a space is created to transgress the violence of the law. The neg transforms law into something that must be changed only for enjoyment whereas the aff transforms it not for enjoyment but to embrace the excess of life through realizing that living for strangers is necessary<br />

THIS SUMMARY OF THE MOVIE ‘DARK CITY’ HELPS US TO ILLUSTRATE THAT OUR PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD DOES NOT COME TO US INNOCENTLY FROM THE MERE FACTS OF EVENTS. INSTEAD, SOMETHING WE CALL THE REAL MEDIATES THIS PERCEPTION. THE REAL IS NOT THE REALITY LURKING BENEATH REPRESENTATIONS OF THE WORLD, BUT INSTEAD AN EXCESS OR LACK INTRODUCED IN THE VERY ACT OF REPRESENTATION, AND INDEED THE VERY ACT OF FORMING THE SOCIAL ORDER. OUR SOCIETY LUNCHES FORWARD FROM CRISIS TO CRISIS: NUCLEAR WAR, ECOLOGICAL DEVASTATION, ECONOMIC LOSS, ETC., EACH TIME BELIEVING THAT EACH CRISIS IS A HISTORICALLY SPECIFIC SITUATION THAT REQUIRES SOME MINOR CORRECTIVE COURSE OF ACTION. THIS PERSPECTIVE MISIDENTIFIES THE REAL AS A HISTORICALLY SPECIFIC SITUATION RATHER THAN A FEATURE INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL EDIFICE ITSELF. LURKING BENEATH EVERY FANTASY OF PEACE, STABILITY, AND RESOLUTION IS A THREAT OF DISORDER AND CHAOS. CATASTROPHE ALWAYS HOVERS; SUCH IS THE NATURE OF OUR BEING.<br />
<br />
Zizek 04, Conversations with Zizek (78-9)<br />
<br />
Here I would agree with Laclau and Mouffe's notion that …..is something opposing you, but because of this purely formal, structurally inherent, self-blockade.<br />
<br />
<br />
IN ORDER TO PROTECT OURSELVES PSYCHOLOGICALLY FROM THE TRAUMATIC EFFECTS OF THIS EVER-PRESENT REAL, WE HAVE ALL ACQUIESCED TO THE SPELL OF IDEOLOGY. IDEOLOGY WORKS BY CONSTRUCTING A FANTASY OF REALITY IN WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO OVERCOME THE INEVITABLE CRISES GENERATED BY THE REAL. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A CYCLE OF DISTANCE AND PROXIMITY TO THE REAL IN WHICH WE WAIT ANXIOUSLY UNTIL CATASTROPHE CONFRONTS US AS “ON THE BRINK,” AND THEN WE TAKE SOME SMALL CORRECTIVE MEASURE THEREBY DEFERRING OUR RECONCILIATION WITH CATASTROPHE UNTIL THE NEXT TIME THE THREAT EMERGES. THIS PROCESS OF CONSTANT DEFERRAL PREVENTS US FROM EVER FUNDAMENTALLY REORDERING THE WORLD, AND INSTEAD MOVES US TOWARDS A NEW WORLD ORDER WHICH SELECTIVELY CONSTITUTES GROUPS OF PEOPLE TO ELIMINATE AS BARRIERS. IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR FANTASY FUNCTIONING PROPERLY ONE THING WE MUST DO IS KEEP MINORITIES AT A DISTANCE. THE SUPREME COURTS DECISION IN MILLIKEN V BRADLEY SELECTED A GROUP BASED ON THE THREAT OF RACIAL MINORITIES IN OUR CITIES AND SCHOOLS AND RISKS RATHER THAN ACCEPTS THE INTRINSICALLY RISKY NATURE OF THE ENTIRE SYMBOLIC VENTURE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zizek 04, Conv. With Zizek, 12-3<br />
<br />
The central issue is one of proximity; of maintaining ….is rather something that can be seen to function as an implicit-¬obscene ideological supplement in today's realpolitik.<br />
<br />
<br />
AS IF WE WERE ALL CHARACTERS IN ‘DARK CITY’ ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE THE STRANGERS AND SEARCHING FOR SHELL BEACH, MILLIKEN VS. BRADLEY CONSTRUCTS A FANTASY OF REALITY BY ENCOURAGING WHITE FLIGHT TO THE SUBURBS AND ALLOWING A DISTANCING BETWEEN SUBURBAN AND URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE FAIL TO REALIZE THAT SHELL BEACH REALLY IS NOTHING MORE THAN A BILLBOARD ON A BRICK WALL.<br />

THE ACTION OF THE OVERRULE OF MILLIKEN V BRADLEY ENTAILS AN IDENTIFICATION WITH THE EXCLUDED ELEMENT BREAKING THE CONTOURS OF THE CAPITALISM SYSTEM. THE PLAN IS A GESTURE OF RISK SHATTERING CONVENTIONAL POLITICS AND GUARANTEEING A SPACE FOR OUR FREEDOM.<br />

<br />
In his interview with Glyn Daly, Zizek …..for Zizek this absence of guarantees is the very space of our freedom.<br />
THE DISTRICT BASED BARRIER TO INTEGRATION CREATED BY MILLIKEN V BRADLEY IS THE SEARCH FOR THE SHELL BEACH OF THE SUBURBS, BUT THE EXPRESS TRAIN TO SHELL BEACH NEVER ACTUALLY STOPS TO PICK UP TRAVELLERS. ONLY BY RECOGNIZING THE EMPTINESS BEHIND THIS MOTIVE FOR ESCAPE CAN WE TRAVERSE THE FANTASY AND CREATE SPACE FOR AUTHENTIC,ETHICAL POLITICAL ACTION.<br />

<br />
NO DOUBT THE NEGATIVE WILL ARGUE THAT THE COURT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF THE AFFIRMATIVE. THIS COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. A COURT OVERRULE CREATES A UNIQUE SPACE FROM WHICH A NEW POLITICS CAN BE PRODUCED. MAKE NO MISTAKE, OUR 1AC IS NOT ABOUT THE INHERENT GOODNESS OF LAW, BUT RATHER SEEKS TO UNCOVER THE PERSONAL AND POLITICAL BENEFIT OF A COURT OVERRULE. THIS BENEFIT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CALCULATED. IT IS SOMETHING THAT MUST BE EXPERIENCED. ONLY VOTING AFFIRMATIVE MAKES THIS EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE.<br />
LITOWITZ 97 (DOUGLAS E., POSTMODERN PHILOSOPHY AND THE LAW PG 95)<br />
Derrida feels that justice cannot be fully present… need for justice to be infinite, beyond calculation..<br />
<br />
A REFUSAL OF THE STATUS QUO DIVISIONS IS AN ACCEPTANCE OF AN ETHIC OF HOLINESS. ALIGNING OUR ENERGIES WITH THIS ETHIC IS NECESSARY TO CREATE A NEW WORLD. THIS IS THE ONLY PATH TO FREEDOM, BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO RESIST EXISTING LIMITS AND BREAK OUR DEPENDENCY ON THE STATE TO MANDATE EQUALITY.<br />
Fasching, Narrative Theology after Auschwitz, 1992, p. 155-6<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE POINT OF OUR AFFIRMATIVE IS NOT TO CREATE A UTOPIA. IN FACT IT IS EXACTLY THE DESIRE TO KNOW WITH CERTAINTY WHAT WILL HAPPEN THAT PREVENTS A POSITIVE RE-ENVISIONING OF SOCIETY. SIMPLY REFUSING THE DIVIDED NATURE OF SOCIETY IS NOT ENOUGH. WE ALSO NEED A NEW HOPE; A FAITH THAT CANNOT GUARANTEE A CONNECTION TO A BETTER WORLD. WE FIND THIS FAITH IN THE GESTURE OF THE PLAN THE PLAN IS A LEAP OF FAITH; A NEGATIVE ACTION THAT LEAVES THE FATE OF THE FUTURE TO ITSELF. IT IS AN EXPRESSION OF HUMANITY THAT SEES A WORLD BEYOND THIS ONE. ALTHOUGH THIS WORLD IS NOT HERE YET, IT IS NONETHELESS POSSIBLE.<br />
Fasching and deChant, Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach, 2001, p. 19-20<br />
<br />
THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHEN VOTING AFFIRMATIVE. THE SCARED AND THE HOLY. THE SACRED IS A AN ETHICAL CATEGORY THAT ATTEMPTS TO PLACE SOMETHING ABOVE THE LAW, ABOVE CRITICISM, AND ABOVE DEBATE. WHEN SOMETHING BECOMES SACRED IT BECOMES UNTOUCHABLE. IN UNITED STATES V. MILLIKEN THE COURT ATTEMPTED TO MAKE CERTAIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS SACRED OR FREE FROM INCLUSION.<br />
FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A WAY TO CHALLENGE THIS NEGATIVE USE OF SACREDNESS. THIS METHOD OF CHALLENGE IS CALLED THE HOLY. THE HOLY IS AN ETHICAL CATEGORY THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THERE IS SOMETHING EXTERNAL AND GREATER TO OURSELVES. IT IS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR OWN LIVES ARE NOT OUR ONLY CONCERN. THE HOLY MAY INDEED BE RISKY.<br />
THE HOLY IS NOT ABOUT MORAL GOODNESS, WORLD PEACE, OR ETHICAL PURITY. RATHER IT IS ACCEPTING THAT TO TOUCH SOMETHING GREATER THAN OURSELVES WE MUST PUT TRADITIONAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN ASIDE. TO ACHIEVE THIS CATEGORY IS TO ACHIEVE A NEW FRAME OF MIND. IT IS ONLY FROM THIS NEW FRAME OF MIND THAT A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO VIOLENCE CAN BE MOUNTED<br />

First,<br />
<br />
75% of women will be subject to violent crime, and more will die this year than were killed on September 11- but it’s not just about numbers. It’s about the lives destroyed in the process.<br />

MORRISON Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review,]<br />
<br />
Every year in the United States,… plans to return to school. n11<br />
<br />
<br />
Christy’s plight didn’t end with no return to school- United States v Morrison isn’t about the endangered species act or terrorism- your federalism links are a cop out. Morrison’s about the loss of the only part of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) that recognized the necessary steps to stop the classification of women as second-class citizens in the United States.<br />
<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon ‘2k Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135<br />
<br />
To the ear of violated women, the same obligation in two different… one half of its people by the other should survive.<br />
<br />
This culminates in two impacts:<br />
<br />
First is the creation of a public/private dichotomy for women. Without the civil remedies afforded by the VAWA Christy becomes just another faceless name in a court decision twisted by male dominated politics. The court system is caught up in a public/private dichotomy that forces women to believe that the only place they belong is the kitchen.<br />
<br />
GOLDFARB 2K (SALLY F., PROF @ RUTGERS, VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND PERSISTENCE OF PRIVACY, OHIO STATE LAW JOURNAL, 61 OHIO ST. L.J. 1)<br />
<br />
In the words of one feminist scholar… to gain access to a full array of legal and political weapons to combat it. n10<br />
<br />
<br />
This public/private division obscures a systematic and dehumanizing war of sexual victimization.<br />
<br />
Amy Ray, US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 2-1997 American University Law Review<br />
<br />
Because, as currently constructed, human rights laws…Unless they have some claim of right to what is taken, no injury is experienced.<br />
<br />
Ignoring the ongoing war of violence against women- the violence committed against Christy in the name of state commerce is a slap in the face to women everywhere, and ignores the root cause of those “wars” that they use as excuses to let this war continue.<br />
<br />
Betty A. Reardon, Director of the Peace Education Program at Teacher's College Columbia University, 1993, Women and Peace: Feminist Visions of Global Security, p. 30-2<br />
<br />
In an article entitled &quot;Naming the Cultural Forces That Push Us toward War&quot; (1983), Charlene Spretnak… which even defines the major rifts in world politics. (Shelly 1983)<br />
<br />
The second impact is a denial of equal rights. Relegating violence against women to the state sphere upholds a system of categorical federalism that forecloses the opportunity for women to obtain equal rights on an international level.<br />
<br />
Judith Resnik, Arthur Liman Professor of Law, Yale Law School. December, 2001<br />
<br />
Categorical federalism has appeal… security from transnational lawmaking.<br />
<br />
The failure of the Morrison Court to view our international legal obligations as authorizing the VAWA damages the perception of the US and undercuts the effectiveness of US courts to act as a model for promoting rights<br />
<br />
Martha F. Davis 2000, Visiting Professor of Law &amp; Democracy at Albany Law School; Vice President and Legal Director, NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, 2000 64 Alb. L. Rev. 417<br />
<br />
United States courts' failure to situate… through reference to international law.<br />
<br />
By upholding equal rights for women the United States offers a clear victory for violence against all women in all countries, overturning Morrison becomes a key victory in establishing an equal world for women everywhere.<br />
<br />
Rhonda Copelon, Professor of Law, City University of New York, 2003, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 865<br />
<br />
While the international system can inspire… felt both domestically and internationally.<br />
<br />
So, here’s your plan:<br />
<br />
In the next appropriate test case the United States Supreme Court should overrule their decision in U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) by eliminating the “economic/non-economic” dichotomy established and in turn upholding the “substantial effects” prong in regards to the Commerce Clause.<br />
<br />
These impacts demand action. For Christy’s and all other women’s sake, the courts must act now to remedy discrimination and prevent further reinforcement of violence.<br />
<br />
Johnson 2003 [Jennifer R. Johnson Santa Clara Law Review2003 43 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399 COMMENT: PRIVILEGED JUSTICE UNDER LAW: REINFORCEMENT OF MALE PRIVILEGE BY THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND U.S. v. MORRISON Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review,]<br />
<br />
&quot;Equality is our aspiration, the goal in our culture… Now the Court needs to follow suit.<br />
<br />
And, overturning Morrison reconceptualizes the law. Christy and other women are no longer relegated to the private sphere- the law is put in her and every other woman’s hands to control.<br />
<br />

Overruling Morrison is necessary to achieve a national recognition of the right to be free of sexual violence, creating social change and substantive improvements in victim’s lives.<br />

<br />
Any issue is considered and framed in accordance with the social… with an attendant change in public values and concerns.<br />

<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE: GENDER VIOLENCE<br />
FIRST, GENDER VIOLENCE DEVASTATES THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF WOMEN EACH YEAR. RAPE AND DOMESTIC ABUSE IS THE MOST PREVALENT VIOLENCE CRIME – THE CONSENSUS IS ON OUR SIDE.<br />
MARTIN 2K (JIL L., UNITED STATES V. MORRISON: FEDERALISM AGAINST THE WILL OF THE STATES, LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO SCHOOL OF LAW)<br />
<br />
The VAWA represents Congress' response to a &quot;……. violent crime at some point during their lives. n27<br />
<br />
GENDER VIOLENCE PERMEATES EVERY ASPECT OF A PERSON’S LIFE. IT DICTATES WHERE THEY CAN WORK, LIVE, AND STUDY. IT CREATES MANAGERIAL BOUNDARIES OF CONTROL.<br />
MARTIN 2K (JIL L., UNITED STATES V. MORRISON: FEDERALISM AGAINST THE WILL OF THE STATES, LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO SCHOOL OF LAW)<br />
<br />
In total, the years of hearings and studies led Congress …..victims of gender-motivated violence equal protection of the laws. n56<br />
<br />
AND, THERE IS A MASS GENDER IMBALANCE IN TERMS OF VIOLENCE. RAPE, STALKING, AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO CLAIM WOMEN AS VICTIMS, THIS VIOLENCE CREATES A DIFFERENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF POWER WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF GENDER INEQUALITY. IT FUNCTIONS AS A UNIQUELY DAMAGING FORM OF SOCIAL CONTROL THAT RENDERS WOMEN’S LIVES MORE PAINFUL THAN MEN’S.<br />
GOLDFARB 2K (SALLY F., PROF @ RUTGERS, VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND PERSISTENCE OF PRIVACY, OHIO STATE LAW JOURNAL, 61 OHIO ST. L.J. 1)<br />
<br />
Violence is a pervasive and destructive force in the …..subordination of the targeted group. n64 In this way, violence against women is an instrument of social control.<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO: INVISIBLE WOMAN<br />
UNITED STATES V. MORRISON’S RULING THAT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IS A FAMILY ISSUE RELEGATES WOMEN TO THE PRIVATE SPHERE. ANY OPPRESSION WOMEN ARE SUBJECTED TO IS SIMPLY A DOMESTICATED ISSUE. THIS DECISION IS BASED ON AN INCORRECT NOTION OF WOMEN AS SOLELY NURTURING AND CARING.<br />

<br />
Why was the judiciary predisposed to subsume VAWA's …….although widely shared, is incorrect.<br />
<br />
AND, BREAKING DOWN THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE DICHOTOMY IS KEY TO ENDING GENDER VIOLENCE – IT SERVES TO MAKE WOMEN INVISIBLE<br />

<br />
CONTENTION TWO: SOLVENCY<br />
THE CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDY RE-CONCEPTUALIZES THE WAY WE VIEW GENDER BASED VIOLENCE. THIS RE-CONCEPTUALIZATION IS NECESSARY TO COMBAT PATRIARCHY AND OPPRESSION. THE AFFIRMATIVE OVERHAULS THE LAW FROM THE GROUND UP.<br />

<br />
The principal contribution of VAWA's civil …..violence against women as they see fit. [*510]<br />
<br />
VOTING AFF REFRAMES GENDER VIOLENCE AS AN ISSUE OR EQUALITY – THIS IS KEY TO STEMMING WOMEN’S OPPRESSION – IT IS KEY TO NATIONAL CITIZENSHIP – IT IS ALSO THE ONLY WAY TO STOP GENDER VIOLENCE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER LEGAL REMEDIES<br />

<br />
What was at stake in Morrison was nothing ……workplaces with fewer than fifteen employees. n319<br />

THE AFF CHANGES THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWS FOR GENDER VIOLENCE BY PLACING THE POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE WOMEN<br />

<br />
As a civil rather than criminal statute, VAWA's civil rights remedy …..gendermotivated violence. It remains to be seen how many of its strengths can be duplicated in other legislation. n333<br />

<ul><ul><li><strong>Invisible Man narrative about being invisible and almost killing someone</strong></li></ul></ul><br />
The Supreme Courts decision in US v Milliken caused America to abandon efforts to<br />
achieve racial integration. We have failed to end historic patterns of racial separation<br />
allowing continuation of politics of racism and invisibility.<br />
Rahdert, 04, LN<br />

Gewirtz 83 LN<br />

Vote to affirm ethical imperative of social equality. Dream into being world that allows<br />
recognition of diversity and preserves value to life.<br />
Seaton 04 “Ralph Ellison and the Raft of Hope: The Political Companion to Invisible Man”,<br />
p.24-34<br />
“Another premise is that the…unity-in-diversity of his oeuvre.”<br />
<br />
Politics as usual predicates itself upon a fundamental humanist paradox: Killing life to save<br />
life. This paradox functions through a murderous economy that must be avoided. We<br />
believe that life has value precisely because it cannot be reduced to a calculation. We<br />
should act morally simply because we should act morally, regardless of idiosyncratic<br />
exceptions and minor justification to the contrary. Anything less forces morality to<br />
sublimate itself to the rationalizations of calculability, effectively sidestepping, and voiding,<br />
the value to those very lives that reason purports to save.<br />
Baumen 97, Mortality, Immortality and Other Life Strategies, p.207-208<br />
“But one can also…to escape it.”<br />
<br />
Recognizing our responsibility to the other allows true ethical freedom. This allows us to<br />
construct a radically different future and provides hope for a transformation of society<br />

Philosophy, 192-203<br />
“THIS position gives a new…I have another chance.”<br />
<br />
Neg will attempt to persuade you that court not necessary, the decision in Milliken<br />
represented infusion of the Ultimate justice into legal reasoning. Instant of decision is<br />
most important, it is in that instant when we encode infinite justice into finite decision. We<br />
must experience the decision to open up new spaces for politics and introduce<br />
convergance of law and justice<br />

Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1947)<br />

The supreme court should overrule millken – no other solutions will be effective without court action<br />

“This narrative establishes…to consider ceilings.”<br />

<br />
The supreme court decis in milliken caused America to abandon efforts to achieve radical integration. We have failed to end historic patterns of racial separation allowing for a continuation of the poltics that allows for racism and invisibility.<br />

we believe that life has value precisely because I tcannot be reduced to a calculation. We should act morally simply to act morally, reguarless of exceptions. Anything less forces morality to sublimate itself to calcuablity. Voiding the value to life<br />
Zygmunt Baumen, 1997, p207-208, Morality, Immortality and other life strategies<br />
“but one case also be ready to die…to escape it.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The decision in milliken represented injustice into legal reasoning. The instant of the decision is the most important, for it is in this instant when we can encode infinite justice into a finite decision. We must experience the decision to open up new spaces for politics and introduce the convergance of justice and law<br />

“Derrida feels that justice cannot be fully…beyond calculation.”<br />

Recognizing our responsibility to the other allows true ethical freedom. This allows us to construct a radically different future. And provides hope for transformation of society.<br />

We can continue on a path of hatred or we can dismantle the institutions that allow for distrust between the races and create a world of love<br />

THE SUPREME COURTS DECISION IN US v. MILLIKEN CAUSED AMERICA TO ABANDON EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE RACIAL INTEGRATION. WE HAVE FAILED TO END HISTORIC PATTERNS OF RACIAL SEPARATION ALLOWING FOR A CONTINUATION OF THE POLITICS THAT ALLOWS FOR RACISM AND INVISIBILITY<br />

Vote affirmative to support a politics of love. A politics of love and a politics of fear are always in constant tension. A politics of fear is responsible for all militarization and exploitation. A politics of love is necessary to prevent endless wars.<br />
