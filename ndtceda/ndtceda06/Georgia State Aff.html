<br />
the supreme court ruled in united states v. morrison that the violence against women act was not a legitimate exercise of congress’ authority to enforce civil rights under section 5 of the 14th amendment because it failed the boerne test of ‘congruence and proportionality’<br />
the congruence standard as applied in morrison does not allow for a case by case examination of the nature of the violation and the intrusion of the remedy—it is essentially an arbitrary test that can be used to strike down otherwise legitimate excercises of congressional power<br />
Post and Sigel, professors of law at Yale Law School, 2000 (Robert and Reva, The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 110. No. 3, pg 441-526)<br />
Similar conceptual difficulties plague Morrison's holding that § 13981<br />
fails the ….. a careful and clarifying<br />
application of its own newly fashioned test.<br />
<br />
the abstract criteria of the boerne test threatens large stretches of anti-discrimination law and congress’ participation in the equal protection tradition<br />
Post and Sigel, professors of law at Yale Law School, 2000 (Robert and Reva, The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 110. No. 3, pg 441-526)<br />
The abstract criteria of the Boerne test invite courts to dismiss Section 5<br />
… t equal protection demands.<br />
<br />
Thus the plan…<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in United States v. Morrison. Specifically, the Court should rule that Section 5 of the 14th amendment permits Congress to pass expressive laws to affirm equal citizenship of all citizens. The Court should rule that the congruence and proportionality standard permits Congress to exercise its Section 5 powers against individuals as well as states and that legislation is properly remedial even when it targets facially neutral policies with disparate effects.<br />
advantage 1— gender based violence<br />
a. the plight of women is dire<br />
The decision in Morrison constructed a catastrophic new line between public and private. Post-Morrison, the private sphere only contains sexual inequality and infinite vulnerability to violence. Every act of gender violence is now private and out of the reach of law.<br />
Mackinnon, professor of Law at the University of Chicago, 2000 (Catherine, Harvard Law Review, Vol 114, Issue 1, Nov, ebscohost)<br />
The Morrison majority does not simply respect …<br />

statistics show this is a systemic problem and requires a systemic solution<br />

Violence Against Women in the United States<br />
MURDER. Every day four women die in this<br />
This public/private distinction creates ongoing, structural violence and prevents us from judging when and how we should use our power.<br />
Peterson 2000 V. Spike, prof of poli-sci @ U of Arizona, “Rereading public and private,” SAIS Review, 20(2)<br />
A related and crucial effect is the projection of different--public versus private—moralities… the objectification of &quot;woman, native, other.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
b. the plan solves<br />
<br />
The Affirmative’s framing of gender violence as an issue of systemic discrimination is a prerequisite to changing legal and social behavior. Our call for the VAWA civil remedy is part of a larger transformative struggle to end gender violence<br />

From this view, courts in important instances not only decide disputes. they [*211 also transform particular legal …assist larger socialpolitical movements.<br />
<br />
<br />
advantage 2: international human rights<br />
a. the current model of human rights promotion is dangerous<br />

and, the supreme court is contributing uniquely to this violence—upholding immunity federalism sends a signal that state sovereignty is absolute at the expense of individual rights--- this causes global wars by discouraging negotiated settlements<br />

An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with … potential permanently.<br />
B. the plan solves<br />
reinterpreting the congruence standard to mean section 5 legislation must meet the disparte effects test instead of the rational basis test solves ambiguity and strikes a balnce between deference to congress and ultimate judicial control over the meaning of 14th amendment<br />
Post and Sigel, professors of law at Yale Law School, 2000 (Robert and Reva, The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 110. No. 3, pg 441-526)<br />
<br />
The ambiguity in the ways that Kimel applies Boerne's congruence and<br />
proportionality test …. substantive meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.<br />
section 5 is the measure of what federal anti-descrimination legislation may be effectively enforced against states—the plan weakens the soveriegn immunity doctrine<br />
Post and Sigel, professors of law at Yale Law School, 2000 (Robert and Reva, The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 110. No. 3, pg 441-526)<br />
&quot;The contours of Eleventh Amendment immunity are extremely<br />

<br />
contention 1: civil rights in peril<br />
the supreme court ruled in united states v. morrison that the violence against women act was not a legitimate exercise of congress’ authority to enforce civil rights under section 5 of the 14th amendment because it failed the boerne test of ‘congruence and proportionality’<br />
Banks, Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Akron, 2003 (Christopher, Akron L. Rev. 42, lexis)<br />
<br />
In Morrison, the Court held that Congress did not have commerce or Section 5 authority to supply victims of gender-motivated violence with civil remedies in federal court through the Violence Against Women Act of 1994<br />
<br />
furthermore, The court is using the congruence and proportionality test to invalidate other instances of civil rights legislation enacted by congress<br />
Zietlow, Associate Professor, University of Toledo College of Law, 2002 (Rebecca, Federalism’s Paradox: The Spending Power and the Waiver of Sovereign Immunity, Wake Forest Law Review vol 37. April)<br />
However, in subsequent rulings, the Court has applied the Boerne test in a restrictive fashion to find that Congress lacked power under Section 5 to enact other civil rights legislation<br />
<br />
Taken together these decisions leave a civil rights enforcement vacuum that states are reluctant to fill<br />
Zietlow, Associate Professor, University of Toledo College of Law, 2002 (Rebecca, Federalism’s Paradox: The Spending Power and the Waiver of Sovereign Immunity, Wake Forest Law Review vol 37. April)<br />
The combination of Boerne, Kimel, Garrett, and Morrison has shifted the balance of power<br />
<br />
Thus the plan…<br />
The United States supreme court should overrule its decision in United States v. morrison. Specifically, the court should rule that article 5 of the 14th amendment permits congress to pass expressive laws to affirm equal citizenship of all citizens. The court should also rule that congress’ article 5 powers may be excercised against individuals as well as states and that the ‘congruence and proportionality’ standard is no longer required for legislation enforcing civil rights against states.<br />
<br />
advantage 1: gender based violence<br />

Mackinnon, professor of Law at the University of Chicago, 2000 (Catherine, Harvard Law Review, Vol 114, Issue 1, Nov, ebscohost)<br />
The Morrison majority does not simply respect a preexisting line<br />
between what is private and what is public<br />
<br />
This public/private distinction is the root of all violence. The status quo creates ongoing, structural violence and prevents us from judging when and how we should use our power.<br />
Peterson 2000 V. Spike, prof of poli-sci @ U of Arizona, “Rereading public and private,” SAIS Review, 20(2)<br />
A related and crucial effect is the projection of different--public versus private--moralities<br />
This division between public and private is the root of all sexual discrimination. Its rhetorical power controls life and death in the name of gender.<br />
Peterson 2000 V. Spike, prof of poli-sci @ U of Arizona, “Rereading public and private,” SAIS Review, 20(2)<br />
In addition, relegating women to an invisible private sphere lends authority and legitimacy to excluding women from political leadership<br />
<br />
Patriarchy is at the root of all violent conflict – must solve to prevent wars and violence<br />
Johnson, 1997 Allan G., prof of sociology Hartford College for Women, The Gender Knot: Unraveling our patriarchal legacy<br />

b. the plan solves<br />
overturning morrison on the basis of equal citizenship labels gener descrimination an equality issue highlighting the larger historically-rooted system of insult and degradation<br />
<br />
Amar, professor at the University of Pepperdine Law School, 2001 (Reed 28 Pepp. L. Rev. 601 lexis)<br />
<br />
In other words, VAWA is largely symbolic. That does not make it unimportant or unconstitutional. We live by symbols<br />

Mackinnon, professor of Law at the University of Chicago, 2000 (Catherine, Harvard Law Review, Vol 114, Issue 1, Nov, ebscohost)<br />
United States v. Morrison closed a crucial avenue of access to<br />

Despite the tenacity of historical beliefs and long-held misconceptions, an ongoing challenge to misguided values and practices<br />
<br />
the plan is the symbolic step needed for the equality of women everywhere. the supreme court’s acknowledgement that ‘promises have been made and broken” is a key societal symbol necessary to prevent brutality and discrimination<br />
