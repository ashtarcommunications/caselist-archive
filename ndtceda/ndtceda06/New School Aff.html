At the heart of the Casey Ruling is the collapse of sexual difference, where women become reduced through their sex to affirming material functions<br />
Cornell ’95 (Drucilla, The Imaginary Domain)<br />
“My addition here, is that the erasure of the uniqueness of the fetus . . . reduced of her “sex” to a container.”<br />
<br />
The eradication of sexual difference leads to a loss of self for women.<br />
Cornell ’95 (above)<br />
“To summarize, the way in which a fetus and the woman is . . . gives us in her discussion of abortion.”<br />
<br />
Without a political account of oneself, Casey turns women into marionettes of the state and “potential life”, devaluing their existence<br />
Myrsiades ’02 (Linda, “Split at the Root: Narrative Collapse in Abortion Jurisprudence”, Cultural Studies)<br />
“We have found in the juridicultural construction of the abortion story . . . . authority in abortion law and medicine.”<br />
<br />
PLAN: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey on the grounds that the undue burden standard violates the 14th amendment. Affirmative reserves the right to clarify intent.<br />
<br />
The Planned Parentood v. Casey decision struck a compromise that stifles narrative progress on the issue of women’s bodily integrity and abortion. Addressing Casey is key to reconceptualizing women in the public sphere.<br />
<br />
Myrsiades ’02 (above)<br />
“It is thus the Casey Court’s fate to have produced a decision . . . preserves unity within difference”<br />
<br />
In the wake of the collapsed narrative of Casey, we must start with the question of sexual difference to address the erasure of the feminine in law.<br />
Cornell, ’99 (Drucilla, Beyond Accommodation)<br />
“Resistance, in other words, is potentially silenced . . . invalidate in advance any conceptualization”<br />
<br />
Overturning Planned Parenthood v. Casey allows for women to regain their imaginary domain and powers of individualation, making possible a broad feminist recognfiguration of the law.<br />
Cornell ’95 (above)<br />
“Abortion should be protected as a right necessary . . . .both material reality and significance”<br />
<br />
Debate is full of absurd arguments, which do not attempt to determine what is right, but rather to win. This is a form of debate violence that we reject.<br />
Deleuze ’91 (“Coldness and Cruelty” in Masocism)<br />
“With Sade we witness an astonishing development of the demonstrative use of language . . . let us now put it to the test of practice.”<br />
<br />

O/t Casey allows for women to regain their imaginary domain and powers of individuation, making possible a broader feminist reconfiguration of the law. 1995 Drucilla Cornell Imaginary Domain (“Abortion should be protect ted as a rigt….what it means to end a pregnancy.”)<br />
<br />
Casey compromise stifles narrative progress, O/t key to reconceptualizing women in the public sphere. Myrsiades 02 (Split at the Root: Narrative Collapse in Abortion Jurisprudence)<br />
<br />
Including Women in politics is an a priori question, precedes consequentialism. Cornell 88 (At the Heart of Freedom, p.11)<br />
<br />
Fast claim debate with no warrants bad. Deleuze “Coldness and Cruelty” in Masochism<br />
