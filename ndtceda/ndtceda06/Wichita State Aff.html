OB 1<br />
CNTI: Inherency<br />
<br />
First, congress has authorized tribunals<br />
Flaherty 2006 (Anne, “Bush Wins backing for terror tribunals.” Sep. 29 2006. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.abcnws.go.co/Politics/wireStory?id=2507021" rel="nofollow">http://www.abcnws.go.co/Politics/wireStory?id=2507021</a><br />
<br />
President Bush can count…..techniques are permissible.<br />
<br />
Next, tribunals will still unfairly detain enemy combatants<br />
<br />
Boston Globe 2006 (“Soldiers versus Bush” Sep. 18)<br />
<br />
Neither Bush’s bill nor….their continued detention.<br />
<br />
Next, military tribunals are terrible – they destroy us credibility, cooperation with Europe, and our ability to fight the war on terror. Their existence alone is enough to alienate the rest of the world<br />
<br />
Neier 2002 (Aryeh. New York Book Review. “The Military Tribunals on Trial” Feb 14. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nyboks.com/articles/15122" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyboks.com/articles/15122</a> )<br />
<br />
Though it appear that a number of the issues…..are not our best choice.<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States supreme court will overrule ex parte quirin, 317 U.S. I (1942) on the grounds that military tribunals violate the Geneva conventions using all normal means. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
Advantage I: Soft Power<br />
<br />
First, soft power is at an all time low and use of military tribunals further tarnishes the United States Image<br />
<br />
Peale 2005 (Robert. “Combatant status review tribunals and the Unique nature of the war on terror.” Vanderbilt Law Review. Oct. 2005).<br />
<br />
The current procedures, even if well….the security of the country.<br />
<br />
Next Soft pwr is key to U.S. Leadership and fighting terrorism<br />
<br />
Nye 2004 (Joseph. The Decline of America’s soft power March)<br />
<br />
Anti-American has increased in recent….in international affairs.<br />
<br />
U.S. leadership is sweet. There is no alternative<br />
<br />
Fergesun 2004 (Niall “A world without power.” Foreign policy, Ebsco)<br />
<br />
Certainly, one can imagine the……not so new world disorder.<br />
<br />
Hegemony is key to prevent nuclear war<br />
<br />
Khalilzad 1995<br />
<br />
Execution of prisoners convicted by military tribunals creates martyrs fueling terrorism and anti-american sentiment<br />
<br />
Mcdonnel 2004 (Thomas. Vanderbilt journal of transnationl law. March)<br />
<br />
Making individuals martyrs by……for acts of terrorism.<br />
<br />
The impact is extinction<br />
<br />
Aledander 2003<br />
<br />
Next, put away your terrorism turns – civilian courts solve the advantages and still prtect intlligence – committee of federal courts<br />
<br />
Committee on Federal Courts 2004 (The record of the association of the bar of the city of new yrk<br />
<br />
As a practical matter….the executive branch.<br />
<br />
Foreign countries will filter their intelligence unless cooperation is high<br />
<br />
Radsen 2K5 (John. “Criminal law in minnsota: The Moussaoui Case: The Mess From Minnesota” William Mitchell law review. Lexis)<br />
<br />
The United States is one…….counter-terrorism policies.<br />
<br />
Advantage II US – EU relations<br />
<br />
First, US – Eu relations are crumbling now<br />
<br />
Hundley (Tom. “Survey says European support for U.S. falling” Sep. 7)<br />
<br />
America’s prestige among its traditional……German Marshall Fund<br />
<br />
Next, the threshold is now – Iranian perception of strong US Eu relations key to check prolif<br />
<br />
Radio Free Europe 2006 (“Iran: U.S., EU call For action now on Nuclear proposal.” June 21)<br />
<br />
Bush said Ahmadinejad appears o be trying to draw out the crisis over…and to negotiate.<br />
<br />
Next, Iranian proliferation leads to multiple scenarios of terrorism and nuclear war<br />
<br />
Kurtz 2006 (Stanley. National Review, “Our Fallout-Shelter Future.” Aug. 28)<br />
<br />
Rosen assumes……into nuclear confrontations.<br />
<br />
Ad II is Judicial Independence<br />
<br />
First, a strong signal from the court on national security isues is key to judicial independence<br />
<br />
Martin 1999 (Kate. “Brief of Center for national security studies.” www.fas.org/sgp/foi/weatherhead-amicus.html)<br />
<br />
These authorities illustrate that, far from…..foreign affairs decisions.<br />
<br />
Next, transitioning is inevitable – judicial independence will be modeled globally and is key to stable transition<br />
<br />
Center for justice and accountability 2003 (Amici brief al Odah v US)<br />
<br />
Many of the newly independent…..their actions on the United States.<br />
<br />
Democracy solves extinction.<br />
<br />
Diamond<br />
<br />
Strong judicial independence is key to growth<br />
<br />
Feld and Voigt 2003 (Lars. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/seminars/pegroup/feld_voigt.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/seminars/pegroup/feld_voigt.pdf</a><br />
<br />

<br />
Contention II: Solvency<br />
<br />
First, court action is eky – only by overruling the precedent of Quirin can we prevent future triunals<br />
<br />
Katyal and tribe 2002 (Neal. “Trying the Military Tribunals”)<br />
<br />
Finally, to the extent that Quirin…..in constitutional law.<br />
<br />
And Bush’s sole justification for tribunals is quirin<br />
<br />
George Lardner (“1942 Preceden Invoked by Bush against al Qaeda” The Washington Post. Jan. 13)<br />
<br />
The defendants were would…..as Ex Parte Quirin.<br />
