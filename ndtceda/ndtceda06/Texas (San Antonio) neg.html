On the neg we don't have set core arguments but we will most likely say<br />
normative legal thought is bad and read some Schlag. And the cites will most<br />
likely vary from round to round.<br />

1NC:<br />
<br />
Existentialism K<br />
<br />
Creating goals only makes sense in the world of transcendence. The inevitable confrontation with the absurd makes the aims of life meaningless. The completion of tasks and hope are useless. This is the question of the absurd, the ability to accept the futility of like and the realization that we are completely free without transcendence.<br />
<br />
Camus, 57 (the myth of sisphus and other essays 56-60<br />
<br />
The mechanical aspects of life are the very inhumanities that make life absurd. Because there is no real encounter with death, there can be no apriori ethic outside our own consciousness. Before we orient ourselves ethically, we must first question whether it is worth living in the face of the absurd.<br />
<br />
Camus, 57 p 14-16<br />
<br />
The aff is not a step in the right direction the dissent and criticism the system will allow are precisely that cant change it. Only if we start with entirely different assumptions can we escape oppression,.<br />
<br />
Quinney 78 (“the ideology of law”)<br />
<br />
What makes the absurdist hero victorious is the very knowledge of the absurdity of his position- by concentrating on ones own freedom and refusal to hope for something better, one can transform life. What makes this radical embracement transformative is the refusal to look to absolute- this world I can touch is all I know, so here my knowledge ends. The stunning implications of nothingness can stike at any time<br />
<br />
Bob Lane The Absurd Hero<br />
<br />
The most important question of the human consciousness is whether or not life is worth living. We have to confront the radical possibility that life is so absurd that philosophical suicide might be necessary<br />
<br />
Camus 57 p 3-6<br />
<br />
2AC:<br />
1. The logic of the 1NC is based on a tautological approach. The idea that life has no meaning or truth precludes any conception of ethics. It is a non-falsifiable claim. You cannot disprove with any premise, because you cannot prove that life has no meaning and that there is no value to life.<br />
<br />
2. Life is sweet. We should have faith that life is an affirmation worthy process that we should do. There are things that are intrinsically rewarding to life. Our Welch 1AC evidence says that when we endorse the notion that suffering is inevitable and that we should essentially do nothing, we doom ourselves to more suffering. We need to embrace a conception of hope that says that weven if suffering is inevitable, we can actually do something that can create less suffering.<br />
<br />
3. This notion of the ethics is the thing that justified the Holocaust. Hitler approached the extermination of the will to power. The group that had a desire to be in control could gain power. He believed that there was no value to life, aside from the people who were in power. Therefore, he was able to use the idea that suffering was evitable for the Jewish people and exterminate millions of them. You cannot tell me that these people did not have something to live for. (Read Kalish)<br />
<br />
4. When I am being sexually pleasured, you cannot tell me that life has no meaning. There are thins in life that allow people to have temporary enjoyment. The denial of that temporary joy and the abandonment of the idea that suffering is inevitable is the worst state of living. You must reject this to affirm a value to life.<br />
<br />
5. They do not have a conceivable reason to not vote for the affirmative. Make them prove that voting affirmative is a bad thing. Our claim is the affirmative ballot will crate the political and social change that will allow for the temporary joy that will not “doom” the lives of all oppressed people.<br />
<br />
6. Permutation – Do the plan and embrace the conception that absurdity and suffering are inevitable. This solves all of the offense. (Read Baynes)<br />
<br />
7. Unger (Imagination) is a good thing. Only through the act of imagination can we break free from the bonds of absurdity and actually do something that can have an impact on the value to life.<br />
<br />
8. This type of life and ontological that the negative speaks of is from a privilege position. Not everyone can simply say, I want to commit psychology and intellectual suicide.<br />

• Need a better defense of liberal reforms good<br />
• Need better answers to Quiney card<br />
• Doesn’t think that racism by the state hurts agency – finds it offensive<br />
• Thinks you should formulate the perm with the language of the link evidence<br />
