Contention one: then and now<br />
soldiers in quirin were punished by execution – the only criticism is that they were given too much justice for being Nazi scum and that not enough was being done to repair the trauma they had inflicted on American people<br />
Marouf Hasian, 03 – “Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wartime Anxieties, and the Saboteurs’ Case,” Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 6(2): 233-260<br />
Given this wartime cultural milieu,…and reached this nation’s shores<br />
Court ruled in Quirin that these Nazis violated international law and to punish them they utilized tribunals and executions. This initiated a practice of using the court to avoid public confrontation with trauma and pain<br />
Swift 9-25-06<br />
Finally, Congress has provided nothing to…would later have to be tossed out.<br />
History records this as the swift and effective calculation of Roosevelt and the Supreme court, however, contestations, disagreements, and turbulence surrounded the decision, but according to our contemporary narrative this was merely justice properly delivered<br />
Marouf Hasian, 03 – “Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wartime Anxieties, and the Saboteurs’ Case,” Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 6(2): 233-260<br />
Moreover, some of the German saboteurs…seemingly analogous to 9/11.<br />
The image of the Nazi that informs this narrative is that of the enemy reduced to an inhuman evil. The narrative of opposition we construct participates in a kind of fetishism designed specifically to expunge and avoid both the degree to which this figure frightens us and our own feelings of guilt at committing and condoning acts of horrific violence<br />
Dino – 3-29-01 – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.purdue.edu/guidetotheory/psychoanalysis/psychplansholocaust.html" rel="nofollow">__www.purdue.edu/guidetotheory /psychoanalysis/psychplansholoc aust.html__</a><br />
One strategy for not dealing with…horrors will not occur again.<br />
Contention 2: A monument to the past<br />
In the hands of the court this relationship to trauma is radically transformed. It becomes a monumental history, just like that of the Court, transforming the destruction of the Nazis into a celebratory element of our nation’s past thereby granting both the Court and Roosevelt auras of Symbolic authority. This is the official history, which above all blocks authentic experiences of trauma<br />
Petrakis 06 – “eric voegelin and paul ricoeur on memory and history”<br />
Blocked memory refers to a wounded or sick…”dare to give an account yourself!”<br />
The quirin precedent plays a vital role in this story by firmly establishing modern legal jurisprudences relationship to the law. The precedent itself dooms the court to a conscious compulsive repetition of this narrative, governed by Freud’s concept of the return of the repressed. This precedent merely repeats the monumental history of the Quirin decision while doing nothing to encounter its underlying trauma<br />
Felman 02 – juridical unconscious<br />
I will thus compare a work…reopen a traumatic history of trials<br />
Quirin thus reappeared as the justification for evidence production and trial structure in the most significant post-war trials of the century. Nuremburg is indicative of this.<br />
State of Israel Ministry of Justice 7-5-01<br />
Whatever may be the value of the…by no means avail the appellant.<br />
The international nature of this evocation demonstrates the significance and power of a monumental history for shutting down testimony in favor of static evidentiary narratives, which end any possibility of meaningful dialogue<br />
Felman 02 – juridical unconscious<br />
Part One: Death and the Language…to testify and bear witness.<br />
Testimony is the only effective means of engaging in a critical history and reversing this trend by beginning a process of working-through. Testimony ethical agency and fosters collective consciousness<br />
LaCapra 01<br />
The psychoanalyst and interviewer for the…polity in the present and future.<br />
The court is essential to this process. It is the sit of legal production and ethical negotiation. Through the power of speech and expression it follows in a “tradition of the oppressed” by allowing the failure of our words speak on behalf of those Jews who disappeared. Simultaneously, they are engaged in the process of constituting and challenging narratives making them a unique site for working-through this trauma. The power of legal citation ensures these legacies are maintained.<br />
Felman 02 – juridical unconscious<br />
Thus, the Eichmann trial puts on…to remain historically, eternally deferred.<br />
Contention Three: The Return of the Repressed<br />
Another strategy to dealing with trauma is to completely ignore it. The problem with this approach is that it invariably leads to the return of the repressed and the further traumatization of the subject<br />
Dino – 3-29-01 – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.purdue.edu/guidetotheory/psychoanalysis/psychplansholocaust.html" rel="nofollow">__www.purdue.edu/guidetotheory /psychoanalysis/psychplansholoc aust.html__</a><br />
The other way of dealing with…some later date in historically altered form.<br />
Contemporary invocations of quirin follow exactly this strategy. Quirin is constantly cited unproblematically to vindicate history as untraumatic, rational, and as calculated Court politics. This causes the repetition of a fatal error<br />
Marouf Hasian, 03 – “Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wartime Anxieties, and the Saboteurs’ Case,” Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 6(2): 233-260<br />
In this particular essay, I provide…developed in the past several decades.<br />
The need to respond to trauma is unlike any other earthly force. It causes scapegoating, victimization, sacrificial politics, instrumentalizes genocide, necessitates even nuclear war and jeopardize every life because it promises a life free of pain<br />
LaCapra 94 – “representing the holocaust”<br />
Both the Holocaust and the…elements that had disastrous effects.<br />
Paradoxically, this image causes an anxiety in the subject and induces the need to commit violence to stop violence. Repetition thus makes liberal democracies repeat the irrational and horrific acts they perceive in authoritarian states.<br />
Treanor 03 – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.inter.nl.net/users/Paul.Treanor/forget.html" rel="nofollow">web.inter.nl.net/users/Paul .Treanor/forget.html</a><br />
The city of Amsterdam has an…public support for the war.<br />
The plan is a necessary part of ethically being in the world in this moment. The quirin decision was the product of two traumas in our nations past: the crisis of the Nazi genocide and the war. We have, in effect, been repeating this trauma imparted on us by generations past for over a century. Quirin has been a lynchpin of this repetition which appears in the fight against communism, against the terrorist, against any figure of radical evil. Yet, it is not more avoidance we need, but rather a confrontation with trauma in the trial to begin an ethics of change<br />
Novick 99 – Introduction in the Holocaust in American Life<br />
Part of my puzzlement about how Americans…collective selfunderstanding and self-representation.<br />
Quirin, as a monumental history, is invoked for the purposes of specific manipulation that results from trauma. Trauma remains an ever present element of the quirin decision thus overturning the Quirin precedent is a prerequisite to change. Revisiting the case, retelling the story, changing it is the only method to begin the process of speaking<br />
Felman 02 – juridical unconscious<br />
Could the trial of the century be,…trauma, will (historically, traumatically) repeat itself.<br />
Endorsing the quirin decision constitutes a form of acting-out a fundamentally unproductive process. In contrast, the plan begins the process of working-through which utilizes social meaning to engage with the anxiety and trauma of our past experiences. This breaks us free of the constant process of repetition. Our mourning initates a critical process of thinking through difficulties and silences of living after Auschwitz<br />
LaCapra 94 – “representing the holocaust”<br />
Working-through requires the recognition…reflection on oneself and one’s own.<br />

The lie they tell themselves – future trauma after future trauma is invented to avoid dealing with the one that already happened. But these future traumas are a fantasy structured and constituted by past trauma as a means of obviating the need for mourning. The disad is nothing but a false attempt at narrative closures that ensures eternal return of trauma<br />

From Wake tournament<br />
The Bush administration’s fundamental fear from the threat of terrorism is that it may undermine democracy and give way to totalitarian politics. Thus, it is absurd that its response to this perceived threat is to enact exactly that which it condemns. Citing judicial deference and the ‘enemy combatant’ status mentioned in the Supreme Court’s Quirin decidion, it has eroded democracy and forgone an effective response to terror by denying individuals the rights to freedom and a fair trial and cementing unlimited sovereign power.<br />
Lon Troyer, Critical Asian Studies 35:2 (2003), Sovereignty, Law and Subjectivity, 259-276<br />
“Three months to the day after Timothy McVeigh…terrorists must be eliminated.”<br />
<br />
It is precisely these actions, however, that do more harm to democracy than terrorism could ever do. But because they are done in the name of protecting democracy from its enemies this suicidal politics is justified.<br />
Samir Haddad, PhD candidate in the Department of Philosophy, Northwestern University, September 2004, Contretemps, Vol. 4, p. 29-30<br />
<br />
The terminal impact is extinction – when the suppression of the enemy combatant and the other is seen as essential to the survival of democracy anything goes in terms of responding. What’s worse, however, is that even if that response works extinction via the abandonment of the law and democracy will result.<br />
Ivan Callus, lecturer in English and literary theory at the University of Malta, and Stefan Herbrechter, Senior Lecturer in Cultural Analysis at Trinity &amp; All Saints College, Summer 2004, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reconstruction.ws/043/callus.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.reconstruction.ws /043/callus.htm__</a>, accessed November 6, 2005<br />
<br />
It is fundamentally the fear of the Other that drives this politics. The concept of the ‘enemy combatant’ is the radical other for United States liberal democracy. We are all that the enemy combatant is not and the denial of international human rights standards to the combatant, such as the right to a fair trial is rendering invisible and a rejection of any form of responsibility to that other to preserve a secure self identity. This is the height of unethical action.<br />
Anne Orford, Professor, Faculty of Law, University of Melbourne, 2005, German Law Journal, Vol. 6, No. 1, p. 34-37<br />
<br />
This process is ethically bankrupt our responsibility to the Other is the very foundation of subjectivity itself, preceding questions of ontology and the utilitarian calculus they engage in – responsibility to the Other transcends all other impacts and obligations<br />
Amit Pinchevski, PhD candidate in the Graduate Program in Communications at McGill University, Montreal, Diacritics 31.2, Summer 2001, p. 77<br />
“In order to reencounter the Other…first word is ‘Welcome’.<br />
<br />
The only means b y which this logic can be reversed is to refused to play into the hands of the script of international law that allows the US to torture enemy combatants and abandon democratic principles to preserve democracy. Rather it should be held to a higher sovereign of international law that demands rights for all.<br />
Jacques Derrida, Directeur d’Etudes at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris, 2005, Rogues: Two Essays On Reason, p. 86-88<br />
“The expression ‘democracy to come’…autoimmunity of sovereignty in general.”<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the Bush administration has beat us to it. The means by which the modern sovereign maintains its power over the state of exception is through the partial and overlapping compliance with international law. This is particularly true of the Bush administration’s dealings in the War on Terror. While functioning within the coordinates of international reservations, understandings and holdings have created a system of international law whereby it is nothing more than a tool for the Bush administration to declare individuals like Hamdi and Hamdan life that is devoid of meaning by arguing that international law and the ICCPR are not binding.<br />

“The state of “Exceptionalism”:…lex specialis governing the prisoners.”<br />

In this logic of international law, anyone can be put to death by being removed from political life making massacres vital, teaches us who to kill, develops extreme racism, necessitates violent wars, and cares to death entire populations.<br />
Etienne Balibar, Emeritus Professor of Philosohy at University of Paris-X and Distinguished Professor of Humanities at University of California-Irvine, 2004, We, The People of Europe? Reflections on Transnational Citizenship, p. 126-29<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should hold that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits the use of the classification “enemy combatant.” We reserve the right to clarify.<br />
<br />
The enemies of international law have invaded the law itself, the only strategy of resistance in this world is to ensure that humans rights never be derogated or reversed out of, basing the plan on the ICCPR even though the treaty is not self executing ensures a reversal of the Bush strategy to use international law to undermine international law.<br />

<br />
And finally, This act is one of hospitality, a politically positive response to violence undertaken against alterity. An ethic of hospitality toward the Other should be prioritized over their disads and defenses of utilitarianism because literally no other value, even life itself, is possible without our prior relationship to the Other. While calculation is inevitable and useful, the incalculable MUST win out over calculation to act on our responsibility. Finally unconditional hospitality should not be confused for universal hospitality – we must actively condemn the forces that annihilate alterity. Even if this approach entails a measure of violence, this violence is irreducible from politics and is a condition of our responsibility.<br />

<br />
Your reliance on the childlike playfulness is the dream of capitalism. Childhood playfulness is a fantasmic object that conceals its raced, sexed, and gendered nature while facilitating the progressive narrative of modernity. The need to stay “forever” young defeats better struggles and enables capitalist domination. This evidence will torch them.<br />
Jan Jagodzinski, 2004. “Youth Fantasies: The Perverse Landscape of the Media” pg 33-34<br />
<br />
Their criticism is only half-right- even if they win all their arguments human rights are still an utterly indispensable tool for the articulation o different and more open futures- rejecting the language of human rights makes this emancipation impossible, only the perm solves. The plan begins a chain of equivalence with universal potential- human rights claims inspire further proliferation of demands, extending human rights claims to previously-excluded elements of society.<br />
Costas Douzinas, 2000. “The End of Human Rights: Critical Legal Thought at the Turn of the Century, p. 342 (gendered language in context)<br />
“The postmodern “best policy”…<br />
<br />
They engage in the politics of confessional, but exposing debate as inherently “meaningless” they utilize a certain form of moral panic to identify with this claim. In combination with their affirmation of childhood they effectively mask the racist and gendered nature of their speech act.<br />
Jan Jagodzinski, 2004. “Youth Fantasies: The Perverse Landscape of the Media” pg 133-136<br />
“Talk shows are where… intolerable deviant act.”<br />
<br />
Their appeal to playful childhood is nothing more than a desire to find an existence without lack. This search collapses into blind rage and institutes the worst forms of sovereignty, imperialism, and racism.<br />
Jan Jagodzinski, 2004. “Youth Fantasies: The Perverse Landscape of the Media” pg 22-23<br />
“The Romantic fantasy… progressive and forever young.”<br />
<br />
This contempt for life, or resentment, is the cause of fascism and Nazism- and a need to justify the other as evil.<br />

Quirin held that a person can be categorized as an “enemy combatant”<br />

During World War Two, … identifying themselves as enemy soldiers. 211<br />
<br />
Quirin based this holding on a simple calculus – first, the government has the authority to punish offenses defined by international law and second, “enemy combatant” is a recognized offense, just like spying<br />
Justice Stone, writing for the Majority in 1942, C.J., Supreme Court Justice.

The government asserts … definition of this term.<br />
<br />
The designation “enemy combatant” is deliberately used by the Bush administration to provide cover for abuse of detainees because it has no protections under international law, in particular it denies access to courts or legal redress for treatment in prison<br />

And, genocide and human rights abuses have killed more individuals than all previous wars combined AND more than any conceivable nuclear war<br />
R.J. Rummel Published in The Wall Street Journal (July 7, 1986). This was based on a pilot survey of possible sources of democide data. As a result of this study I applied for a grant from the United States Institute of Peace to do a much more methodical survey of democide, which eventuated in my <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM" rel="nofollow">Death by Government</a> and <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE5.HTM" rel="nofollow">Statistics of Democide</a>.

<br />
Thus, the plan :<br />
Thus our plan, the United States Supreme Court should rule that classifying detainees as “enemy combatants” is a violation of the UN Convention Against Torture.<br />
<br />
<br />
The CAT flips the politics before ethics position and specifically demands that no exceptions or derogations out of an ethical response to the other for the sake of politics or national security. It demands ethics.<br />

No exceptions … justification of torture.<br />
<br />
The CAT is futher appropriate because in the current political climate is more important than ever to refuse to abandon human rights and sovereignty, this must be accomplished through appeals to international human rights law.<br />

This change will … legitimize the decisions of United States courts in the twenty-first century by improving their decision-making process.<br />
<br />
And finally, This act is one of hospitality, a politically positive response to violence undertaken against alterity by the Bush administration and the Quirin deicision . An ethic of hospitality toward the Other should be prioritized over their disads and defenses of utilitarianism because literally no other value, even life itself, is possible without our prior relationship to the Other.
