Gender aff with the following:<br />
To the extent that war is possible- a society saturated by fender violence tends towards war and aggression. (Steans 1998, “Gender and International Relations: an Introduction” p. 100-102)<br />
“A feminist analysis of war…internal hierarchy”<br />
Courts don’t adhere to precedent- 130 decisions have been overruled (Gerhardt 2005, 7 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 903)<br />
“There are, however…yet claim permanence”<br />
Judges stick to ideology (Gerhardt)<br />
“Segal and Spach consider…and conservative precedents.””<br />
Judges can interpret precedent in whatever way they want. (Gerhardt)<br />
“These cases illustrat a related…reached in Adarand.”<br />
Raich decimated any judicial restraint on the CC (Farley, Seton Hall Circuit Review, 2006)<br />
“Based on the Supreme Court’s newest….Commerce Clause unchecked.”<br />
Raich allows any Congressional legislation as long as it is part of a larger regulatory scheme- creates a perverse incentive for congress to legislate broadly (Kreit 2006, 108 W. Va. L. Rev. 705)<br />
“At the most basic level, Raich’s…regulatory scheme.””<br />

<br />
In 1973 the supreme court created sweeping expansions of commerce clause authority in support of new deal legislation – combined with the 1960s holding that “moral and social wrongs’ were an explicit source of commerce authority, these expansions provided the foundation for every major 20th century federal civil and social protection<br />
Lens 2001 (Vicki, “The supreme court, federalism, and social policy: the new judicial activism” <em>Social Service Review</em> 75.2, june)<br />
“In 1937, this restrictive view of federal power…a particular problem and the national economy”<br />
<br />
Morrison’s exclusion of “moral and social wrongs’ from the base of commerce authority shreds the fabric of meaningful progressive constitutionalism – gender violence was far more economically sizable than 1950s southern racism – courts refusal to accept protections creates an impossible hurdle for civil and social transformation<br />
Mackinnon 2000 (114 Harv. L. Rev. 135)<br />

Vs. Bard<br />
Nothing new in their Morrison Gender Violence 1ac<br />
Cont. 1 – Gender Violence<br />
Vawa key judicial signal to stop social spread of gender violence<br />
Cont 2 – congress/Politics<br />
The left’s politics are constituted by refusal for political details, skepticism towards law, and withdraw. Only the right asserts control over established institutions guided by larger meta-narratives. The plan reverses that. The impossibly high Morrison standard stops an active congress. Atrocity and war is inevitable without political engagement of existing power structures.<br />

Contention One: Violence<br />
Morrison codifies the most hollow and sacrificial model of federalism -- it preserves authority over limitless economic activies but sanctions federal acceptance of rape, exploitation and violence in the name of abstract states rights<br />
Balkin, pf constitutional law -- yale, 2<br />

Relegation of authority to the states ensures unchecked exploitation -- every study concludes bias is ineradicable<br />

[Deborah, 42 Boston College L. Rev. 1081]<br />
Any issue is considered...public values and concerns.<br />

Contention two: politics<br />
Morrison shredded sixty years of court precedent -- it's substitution of judicial arrogance for politics insitutionalizes a conserviatve judicial revolution that upends the very foundation of public deliberation and legislative remedy<br />
Kramer, pf law -- nyu, 2k<br />
[larry, &quot;the arrogance of the court&quot;, washington post, 5/23]<br />
In 1994, after four...stakes not so high.<br />

<br />
Contention Three: solvency<br />
Economic test is inherently unclear- creates confusion and inconsistent results<br />

In fact, however, these...violence on women's equality.<br />
