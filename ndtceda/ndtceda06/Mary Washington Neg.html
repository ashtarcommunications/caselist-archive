1. Ground: The affirmative’s choice of test case is critical to negative ground, including disads relating to the specific facts of the test case and counterplans to rule on a different case or on different grounds that are at issue in the test case. The case must be named in the plan to ensure that counterplans compete and to maximize the value of negative pre-round preparation, which is especially important at the beginning of the year when strategies are not yet fully developed.<br />
2. Education: The Court never decides cases in the absence of a real controversy or on grounds that are not briefed by the parties as relevant issues in the case. Failure to require test case specification eliminates education about Court procedures.<br />

Test Case Spec<br />
A. Violation: The affirmative plan does not specify the test case in which the Court overrules [Casey, Milliken, Morrison, or Quirin]. The plan must name the test case and the affirmative must provide evidence that the grounds on which they overrule are at issue in the test case.<br />
B. Voting Issue:<br />
1. Ground: The affirmative’s choice of test case is critical to negative ground, including disads relating to the specific facts of the test case and counterplans to rule on a different case or on different grounds that are at issue in the test case. The case must be named in the plan to ensure that counterplans compete and to maximize the value of negative pre-round preparation, which is especially important at the beginning of the year when strategies are not yet fully developed.<br />
2. Education: The Court never decides cases in the absence of a real controversy or on grounds that are not briefed by the parties as relevant issues in the case. Failure to require test case specification eliminates education about Court procedures.<br />
