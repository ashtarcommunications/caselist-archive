<strong>We begin with the plan --</strong><br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule United States v. Morrison on the grounds that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights authorizes the civil rights remedy of the first Violence Against Women Act .<br />
<br />
<strong>And this is topical –</strong><br />
<br />
First, overruling includes using alternate grounds – this is based in the topic literature.<br />
<br />
Weinstein &amp; DeMarco, 2k4<br />
Philosophy Profs – Vassar &amp; Bergen, Winter, 10 Cardozo Women's L.J. 423<br />
Scalia also continually insists that ...which happens to show that the conclusion of the prior opinion is wrong.<br />
<br />
Second, decision refers to the final judgement NOT the holdings.<br />
<br />
West’s Law Encyclopedia in ’98 Online<br />
When referring to judicial matters ... for its determination made by the court<br />
<br />
Finally, this is the most limiting interpretation – basing topicality on the holding explodes the topic.<br />
<br />
Dunn, 2k3<br />
Nov, 113 Yale L.J. 493, Student Note<br />
Unlike the judgment, which uses a set number of words ... potential misunderstanding of that action's meaning<br />

<br />
Regional violence escalates into global nuclear war.<br />
<br />
Dean, Security Advisor – Union of Concerned Scientists, March/April in ‘95<br />
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists<br />
Left on its own, regional violence can lead to ... vulnerability of the United States to direct attack.<br />
<br />
And, specifically, the Morrison decision alienates the US from the global human rights regime which views gender violence in terms of human rights.<br />
