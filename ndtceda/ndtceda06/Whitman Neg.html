VAWA is just dormant – it goes back into effect if the court rules it constitutional<br />
<strong>Benjamin 99</strong> (“Stepping into the same river,” Texas Law Review, l/n)<br />

<br />
<h3 id="toc8"><a name="x-Whitman AC Neg-Case Args (Comparative Fault Turn):"></a><em>Case Args (Comparative Fault Turn):</em></h3>

Civil proceedings are worse than the criminal process for victims – they’re based on comparative fault which revictimizes women and fails to provide compensation<br />

<br />
This civil rights remedy is VAWA is nothing more than a red herring which diverts resources and attention from solving the problem – all of their signal arguments are an attempt to paper over their utter lack of solvency for gender violence with warm fuzzies<br />
<strong>Regan 99</strong> (“A Whole Lot of Nothing” Notre Dame Law Review)<br />

A: Violation – Aff fails to specify which justices in the overrule and which justices concur or dissent<br />
<br />
B: Standards<br />
-Education: the process by which the court acts is what we’re supposed to be learning about<br />
-Short-circuits solvency questions. Who makes the decision determines the implementation process, such as enforcement<br />
-Kills CP Ground – We should debate about the best way to overrule the precedent by advocating alternative coalitions<br />
-Kills DA Ground – court process arguments depend upon the way decisions are perceived through the positions of the justices<br />
-Aff Conditionality – clarifications create a moving target and allow them to shift out of core negative arguments<br />
C: Topicality is a voter for reasons of fairness, ground, education, and because the aff must unconditionally prove the resolution true<br />

<br />
Solvency:<br />
Distinguishing precedent has all the legal and societal advantages of overruling but avoids the links to the disads<br />
<strong>Smith 02</strong> (Texas Law Review, Activism as Restraint: Lessons from Criminal Procedure)<br />
“The end result after decades… real-world impact of the decision.”<br />
<br />
The performative act of overruling is what generates our link<br />
<strong>Dunn 03</strong> <a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1"></a><br />
“Every time the court engages… in the rhetoric of the act of overruling.”<br />
<br />
The content of the opinion is the key to maintaining legitimacy<br />
<strong>Dunn 03</strong> (“How Judges Overrule: Speech Act Theory and the Doctrine of Stare Decisis.” Yale Law Journal)<br />
“Both judges and academics have viewed the style… examined in Part V.”<br />
<br />
The explicit act of overruling creates the controversy<br />
<strong>Dunn 03</strong> (“How Judges Overrule: Speech Act Theory and the Doctrine of Stare Decisis.” Yale Law Journal)<br />
“If they can be seen to interpret law… performative utterance.”<br />
<br />
Distinguishing precedent is less controversial than overruling<br />
<strong>Spriggs and Hansford 02</strong> (The US Supreme Court’s Incorporation and Interpretation of Precedent, 36 Law &amp; Soc’y Rev. 139)<br />
“Based on these results… negative treatments.”<br />
<br />
CP increases the court’s legitimacy<br />
<strong>Gerhardt 91</strong> (The Role of Precedent in Constitutional Decisionmaking and Theory. The George Washington Law Review, November)<br />
“Sometimes, however, the Court can destroy… immune to overruling.”<br />
<br />
Distinguish comparatively better than overrule for court legitimacy<br />
<strong>Healy 01</strong> (STARE DECISIS AS A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT. West Virginia Law Review)<br />
“When a court is faced with a legal question… when the need arises?”<br />
<br />
The perm still links to the disad – our links are predicated on the explicit overruling of the precedent – none of our net benefit evidence makes a shielding claim, and the perm is worse for legal certainty<br />
<strong>Nolan 03</strong> (EMPLOYMENT ARBITRATION AFTER CIRCUIT CITY, Brandeis L.J. 853)<br />
“We know after Gilmer… prune back that decision.”<br />
<br />
Distinguishing doesn’t violate stare decisis<br />
<strong>Lafferty 94</strong> (“A Review of Piazza” 21 Fla St. U L. Rev. 1271)<br />
“However, a court may comply with stare decisis… precedent on either basis.”<br />
<br />
Upholding VAWA on equal protection grounds would be a gigantic break with all precedents – no court has EVER ruled anything close. This is the BIGGEST link.<br />
<strong>Pryor 99</strong> (Amicus Curiae brief in US v. Morrison, 1999 US Briefs 5, 1999 US S. Ct. Briefs LEXIS)<br />
“By any measure, it cannot tenably… than the laws invalidated in these cases.”<br />

Fundamentally, there is nothing compelling us to obey the law other than the fact it is law and we fear biolence. We obey senselessly obey, meaning that obeying the law can’t be compelled by something outside it. The psychoanalystic name for this type of injunction is superego. The superego compels us to enjoy—and when we give in to the law, with comrimising our desires, we feel a form of enjoyment. This is the case with the plan—although we enjoy consumption, the superego feels a certain enjoyment in its renunciation<br />

Plan flaw—Morrison struck down civil remedies; don’t overrule the similar issue; overrule means overrule a prior case not a new case; clarification makes the aff a moving target<br />
<br />
the plan literally cannot happen – for the court to hear a case about VAWA, the congress would have to re-pass it, then someone would have to sue and appeal it to the supreme court. Even if they win the court can call up any case it wants, they cant fiat that congress passing a new law for a test case. Vote neg on presumption<br />
at a minimum, this is a 100% solvency take out because no case will ever come before the court that enables them to rule on the VAWA<br />
Clarification is too late – it makes the add a moving target, jocks our links and allows them to spike out of all our ground by claiming that’s not what they meant<br />
Not topical – overruling requires a different issue, not the exact same case. T is a voter for jurisdiction, fairness and competitive equity<br />

The affirmative defaults to treating former ‘enemy combatants’ as ‘unlawful combatants’ this change is nothing more than a semantic gesture that retains the Terrorist’s status as homo sacer, life capable of being killed without the commission of homicide. The aff aligns itself with the latent liberal notion that US power is legitimate as a method of securing global peace, however, it is precisely this violent humanitarianism that is turning the globe into an ongoing state of emergency. Only by challenging the frame of the fantasy of American power, prestige, and pre-eminance can we shatter the ongoing reduction of all life to bare life.<br />
Slavoj Zizek, senior researcher at the institute of Ljubljana, “Are We At War? Do We Have An Enemy?,” London Review of Books, Volume 24, Number 10, 5-23-2002, pg. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n10/zize01_.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n10/zize01_.html</a><br />
<br />
The affirmative’s appeal to international human rights law while seemingly a positive method of rebuffing executive authority ultimately legitimizes the international state of emergency. International law is not the same as it once was and ultimately has become the basis of undermining domestic rights and authority. The discourse of international legal struggle merely supplements the biopolitical activities of the sovereign. Even the ICCPR and UNDR should treated as suspect when considering the adequate starting point from which to challenge state violence.<br />
Kim Lane Schleppe, professor of comparative law and sociology at the university of Pennsylvania, “The International State of Emergency: The Challenge for Constitutionalism After September 11th,” last modified, 8-28-2006, pg. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/cclt/documents/Scheppelebookproposal.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.georgetown.edu/cclt/documents/Scheppelebookproposal.doc</a><br />
<br />
Our alternative uses the idea of Whatever being as a radical way of reshaping human communities. Our engagement with the potentialities for human communities to exist without any claim to identity is a direct and effective way of challenging the distinctions and exceptions of sovereignty and the attendant values placed on life<br />

Topicality--overrule is to make a precedent null and void on the same question; Morrison was decided on Section 5 of the 14th Amendment; Plan rules on the entire 14th amendment; voids DA/CP ground; 2ac clarification is not sufficient makes the affirmative conditional<br />
<br />
Activism: Roberts is practicing restraint now; overrules rapidly spill over; spill over leads to unchecked death and puts us in an autocratic government; causes massive violence<br />
<br />
Bush appointments are trying to roll back environmental regulations now, but new appointments would allow lifting; Congress reacts to controversial decisions with new appointments; Bush’s appointments will roll back environmental regulation; causes extinction<br />

SUPREME COURT WILL VOTE WITH EPA AGAINST DUKE INSTALLING REGS WHICH ARE KEY TO PREVENTING ACID RAIN AND ASMA<br />
REUTERS, 2K6<br />
US COURT HANDS EPA A WIN IN UTILITY EMISSION CASE, A FEDERAL COURT HAS RULED… DISEASES LIKE ASTHMA<br />
<br />
A federal court has ruled that a big US utility must install costly pollution-reduction equipment at its aging coal-powered electric plants if it expands them, handing a victory to the US government in a case that could shape an upcoming Supreme Court ruling.<br />
<br />
The three-member 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago on Thursday ruled that Cinergy must install emission curbs at its coal-powered plants in the Midwest if it expands them to prolong their operating lives.<br />
The Environmental Protection Agency had sued the utility to force it to apply for an expansion permit, which would trigger emission-reduction measures.<br />
In a bevy of cases, US utilities are testing how far they can go to expand aging plants without triggering a section of the Clean Air Act known as &quot;New Source Review.&quot;<br />
Cinergy, which was bought by Duke Energy Corp. in April, argued that it could expand its plants without triggering regulations as long as the modifications did not increase hourly emissions.<br />
The court disagreed and said Cinergy's interpretation could &quot;open a loophole that would allow pollution to soar unregulated&quot; because annual emissions could rise even as hourly rates stayed level.<br />
The Bush administration has proposed a similar test for measuring whether plant modifications should trigger New Source Review requirements going forward, but the Supreme Court is reviewing the rules in a case brought against Duke Energy.<br />
The high court will hear arguments in the case on Nov. 1.<br />
&quot;We're hopeful that the Supreme Court's review will help to eliminate the confusion that exists in various jurisdictions on these issues,&quot; said Peter Sheffield, a Duke Energy spokesman.<br />
Duke will spend about US$2.4 billion on pollution-reduction equipment through 2008 regardless of the outcome of the case, Sheffield said.<br />
Environmental groups said the administration plan, if finalized, means US utilities can spew more nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide -- precursors of acid rain and smog linked to respiratory diseases like asthma.<br />

Definition the word ‘following’ before a colon means that the next items are further specifications of the preceding subject, which is “decision” meaning that the four cases are the entire decisions<br />

Overrule means to explicitly make void an entire decision over turn means to partly abolish a precedent<br />

Ground- we can’t read our “quirin” bad cards because they don’t defend overruling the entirety of the decision pics are core neg ground for inventive research and search for the best policy option<br />

ZIZEK GOOD K<br />
The affirmative defaults to treating former ‘enemy combatants’ as ‘unlawful combatants’ this change is nothing more than a semantic gesture that retains the terrorists’s status as homo sacer, life capable of being killed without the commission of homicide. The aff aligns itself with the latent liberal notion that us power is legitimate as a method of securing global peace however it is precisely this violent humanitarianism that is turning the globe into an ongoing state of emeregency. Only by challenging the frame of the fantasy of American power prestige and preeminence can we shatter the ongoing reduction fo ale life to bare life<br />

The primacy of the other in ethical decision making is nothing more than a ruse the other overwhelms us subjectivity is structured by thirds, levinasian ethics can never be the foundation of justice because responsibility to the other is inherently a violent cuitting into the mass of thirds to privilege one singular other.

The affirmative is traditional attempts at postmodern revolution. It criticizes the current structure that “harasses” the unique singularity of the other and declares our need to be responsible to it. This is an example of Lacan’s university discourse which rejects the master, but does not realize it’s own jouissance is predicated on the destruction of the other, the special relation of the other to the real. This discourse unifies the most violent aspects of bioplotocial administration with a humanist politics of responsibility for the other because both forsake the willingness of any single cause positiong a well lived life as the terminal goal of politics. We must save the life of the other for the life of the other. This masks the function of university discourse to ultimately constrain the possibility for politics and perpetuates the production of bare life<br />

the plan literally cannot happen – for the court to hear a case about VAWA, the congress would have to re-pass it, then someone would have to sue and appeal it to the supreme court. Even if they win the court can call up any case it wants, they cant fiat that congress passing a new law for a test case. Vote neg on presumption<br />
at a minimum, this is a 100% solvency take out because no case will ever come before the court that enables them to rule on the VAWA<br />
Clarification is too late – it makes the add a moving target, jocks our links and allows them to spike out of all our ground by claiming that’s not what they meant<br />

REUTERS, 2K6<br />
US COURT HANDS EPA A WIN IN UTILITY EMISSION CASE, A FEDERAL COURT HAS RULED… DISEASES LIKE ASTHMA<br />
<br />
A federal court has ruled that a big US utility must install costly pollution-reduction equipment at its aging coal-powered electric plants if it expands them, handing a victory to the US government in a case that could shape an upcoming Supreme Court ruling.<br />
<br />
The three-member 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago on Thursday ruled that Cinergy must install emission curbs at its coal-powered plants in the Midwest if it expands them to prolong their operating lives.<br />
The Environmental Protection Agency had sued the utility to force it to apply for an expansion permit, which would trigger emission-reduction measures.<br />
In a bevy of cases, US utilities are testing how far they can go to expand aging plants without triggering a section of the Clean Air Act known as &quot;New Source Review.&quot;<br />
Cinergy, which was bought by Duke Energy Corp. in April, argued that it could expand its plants without triggering regulations as long as the modifications did not increase hourly emissions.<br />
The court disagreed and said Cinergy's interpretation could &quot;open a loophole that would allow pollution to soar unregulated&quot; because annual emissions could rise even as hourly rates stayed level.<br />
The Bush administration has proposed a similar test for measuring whether plant modifications should trigger New Source Review requirements going forward, but the Supreme Court is reviewing the rules in a case brought against Duke Energy.<br />
The high court will hear arguments in the case on Nov. 1.<br />
&quot;We're hopeful that the Supreme Court's review will help to eliminate the confusion that exists in various jurisdictions on these issues,&quot; said Peter Sheffield, a Duke Energy spokesman.<br />
Duke will spend about US$2.4 billion on pollution-reduction equipment through 2008 regardless of the outcome of the case, Sheffield said.<br />
Environmental groups said the administration plan, if finalized, means US utilities can spew more nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide -- precursors of acid rain and smog linked to respiratory diseases like asthma.<br />
