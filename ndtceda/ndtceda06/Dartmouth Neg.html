Peter Wenz…above the debate<br />

Edith Pacillo, Fall, 1997, 6 Am. U.J. Gender &amp; Law 113, ln<br />
To a large extent…fremale reproduction<br />

Backlahs turns the case - -Empowering the Right Risks an absolute ban<br />
Graber, 1996, above, p. 152<br />
Nevertheless, pro-choice…procuring abortions<br />
<br />
Even without rollback, backlash turns the framework – lack of public support destroys any expansive interpreatation of rights<br />
Nicole Hart, Fall, 2004, 52 Buffalo L. Rev. 1417<br />
The crux of this…to go along<br />
<br />
Bush will placate conservative b/l by implemention severly anti-abortion foreign policies<br />

Reproductive Rights don’t spillover – starting with abovrtion prevents broad change<br />
Beth Jamieson, 2001, Real Choices: Feminism, Freedom, and the Limits of Law, p. 31-2<br />
The third way…reproductive capabilities<br />

Only the Counterplan solve s the aff – Court action legitimates social Regimes of the family, sex and Marriage<br />
Robin West, 2005, What Roe V. Wade Should Have Said, ed. Jack Balkin, p. 144-6<br />
The same is true…constitutional remedies<br />
<br />
And, We have Ev that proves the spillover from congress is the only way to reverse the tide – Court rulings cannot transcend the limited scope of abortion<br />
Robin West, 2005, What Roe….. p. 143-4<br />
No, why…facilitate both<br />
<br />
Only Congress alone can solve – Court action blocks effective reframing, and ensure enedning fights on Future loaws<br />
Robin West 2005, What Roe…. P. 256-7<br />
There is no…so understood<br />

Courts get in the way – Congress Mut be free to establish broad interpretative legislation on its own<br />

<strong>Civil Remedy is Bad - Gender</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
current criminal provisions allows restitution<br />
<br />
Amy J. <strong><u>Spinewell</u></strong>, M.A. @ McGill &amp; JD @ Yale, <strong><u>‘5</u></strong> (Fall, 17 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism 327, ln)<br />
Yet VAWA's criminal… necessitated by the abuse.<br />
<br />
<br />
the civil remedy creates hierarches of violence – legitimizing private gendered violence<br />
<br />
Kristin <strong><u>Bumiller</u></strong>, Prof of Women and Gender Studies @ Amherst, <strong><u>‘5</u></strong> (“Freedom From Gender Violence as a Human Right, “<br />

Furthermore, the… that demands redress.<br />
<br />
<br />
the civil remedies reliance relies on a system of white privlege – excluding women of color<br />
<br />
Adele M. <strong><u>Morrison</u></strong>, Prof of Law @ Northern Illiniois, <strong><u>‘6</u></strong> (March, 39 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1061, “Deconstructing The Image Repitoire of Women of Color, ln)<br />
The identity is fundamental… are white as well.<br />
<br />
civil remedy does not deter<br />
<br />
Robert Michael <strong><u>Doherty 2k</u></strong> (The Roanoke Times, June 6, ln)<br />
Another point not made…. Against Women Act standing.<br />
<br />
the civil rmedy reinforces the myth of the crazed rapist – justifying sexual violence<br />
<br />
Christina <strong><u>Wells</u></strong>, Prof of Law @ Univ of Missouri, Erin <strong><u>Motley</u></strong>, Attorney @ Missouri Senate Research, JD @ Univ. Missouri, <strong><u>‘1</u></strong> (81 B.U.L. Rev. 127)<br />
Sexual violence has received… concrete and serious harm.<br />
<br />
<br />
the turn outweighs the case – legal stereotypes are what enable sexual violence<br />
Susan F. <strong><u>Hirsch</u></strong>, Prof. of Anthro @ Wesleyan, <strong><u>’94</u></strong> (Law &amp; Social Inquiry 19:4, “Interpreting Reprsentations of a “Night of Madness,”: Law and Culture in the Construction of Rape Identities,” p. 3-4)<br />
<br />
Recent research maps….<u>&quot;</u>always, already&quot; victims.<br />
<br />
<br />
the civil rights remedy is net worse – it reinforces self-blame and prevents dynamic alternatives to sexual subordination<br />
<br />
Kristin <strong><u>Bumiller</u></strong>, Prof. of Poli Sci @ Amherst, <strong><u>’87</u></strong> (Signs 12.3, “Victims in the Shadow of the Law: A Critique of the Model of Legal Protection,” p. 438-9)<br />
The hostile image… <u>t</u>hemselves or the law.<br />

Curt <strong><u>Levey</u></strong>, Director of Legal and Public Affairs @ Center for Individual Rights, <strong><u>‘1</u></strong> (47 Loy. L. Rev. 535, ln)<br />
<br />

<br />
The reason a domestic… being victimized.<br />
<br />
attention to gendered violence in the courts undermines other reform efforts<br />
<br />
Deborah M. <strong><u>Weissman</u></strong>, Prof of Law @ UNC-Chapel Hill, <strong><u>‘1</u></strong> (42 B.C. L. Rev 1081, ln)<br />
These cultural practices… more difficult to achieve.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At: Public Private Advantage<br />
<br />
the civil remedy defers gendered violence to the local<br />
<br />
Deborah M. <strong><u>Weissman</u></strong>, Prof of Law @ UNC-Chapel Hill, <strong><u>‘1</u></strong> (42 B.C. L. Rev 1081, ln)<br />
<br />
The successes… remained unchallenged<br />
<br />
hibbs solves the advantage<br />
<br />
Allison K. <strong><u>Slagle</u></strong>, JD @ Capital Univ, <strong><u>‘5</u></strong> (Summer, 33 Cap. U.L. Rev. 869, Nevada Department of Human Resources V. Hibbs: Regulation or Simply Encouragement, ln)<br />
The two questions left ope after Morrison… quickly extinguished.<br />
<br />
this public/private question is useless in practice – it ignores the everyday concerns of gendered violence*<br />
<br />
Julie <strong><u>Goldschield</u></strong>, Prof of Law @ NYU<strong><u>, ‘3</u></strong> (11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol’y &amp; L. 417, ln)<br />

<br />
Sally F. <strong><u>Goldfarb</u></strong>, Prof of Law @ Rutgers, <strong><u>‘3</u></strong> (11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 251, ln)<br />
However, any… men and women<br />
<br />
breaking the public/private divide results in interventions against the wishes of the victim – destroys agency and targets women of color<br />

Renee <strong><u>Romkens</u></strong>, Professor in the Institute for Research on Women and Gender at Columbia, <strong><u>‘2</u></strong> (10 J.L. &amp; Pol'y 313, ln)<br />

Polemical debates within… discourse on the topic.<br />

the civil remedy’s symbolism provides comfort for academia while exasterbating the plight of the abused<br />
<br />
Christopher James <strong><u>Regan</u></strong>, JD @ Notre Dame, <strong><u>’99</u></strong> (75 Notre Dame L. Rev. 797, ln)<br />
That's it in a nutshell… sense, very comforting.<br />
<br />
<strong>TORT K</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
A. The civil remedy is a mockery to the majority of women – its theoritical goals are overwelmed by its classist premise<br />
<br />
Christopher James <strong><u>Regan</u></strong>, JD @ Notre Dame, <strong><u>’99</u></strong> (75 Notre Dame L. Rev. 797, ln)<br />
<br />
There are no CRR plaintiffs….. solvent wrongdoer. n44<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
B. the civil remedy exasterbates class inequality and radical liberalism – only those can have the resources to sue are valuable<br />
<br />
Richard L. <strong><u>Abel</u></strong>, Prof of Law @ UCLA, <strong><u>’81</u></strong> (British Jouranal of Law and Societ 8:1, “A Critique of American Tort Law,” jstor)<br />
It would be a mistake…. and what you do.<br />
<br />
<br />
C. a civil remedy enhances structural violence – relieving guilt while reducing the value to life<br />
<br />
Richard L. <strong><u>Abel</u></strong>, Prof of Law @ UCLA, <strong><u>’81</u></strong> (British Jouranal of Law and Societ 8:1, “A Critique of American Tort Law,” jstor)<br />

Funding Counterplan Against Gender cases<br />
<br />
observation one: the mandate<br />
<br />
the united states congress should provide funding for state programs that: enhance judicial education regarding the harms of gendered violence, create state domestic violence task forces, create transitional houses for victims of gendered violence, create shelters for victims of gendered violence, and create victim advocate programs. The united states congress should condition the reciept of the federal funds on the implementation of these programs.<br />

CP: The United States Supreme Court should rule that the Supreme Court erred in calling the Civil Rights Remedy “Section 13981” and hold a press conference discussing the importance of viewing gender violence as a civil rights issue but rule that Congress does not have Commerce Clause authority to enact the Civil Rights Remedy. The United States Congress should fund public service announcements, including radio, newspaper, and television announcements discussing the importance of viewing gender violence as a Civil Rights issue. The United States Congress should provide funding for federal and state programs that enhance judicial education regarding the harms of gendered violence, create domestic violence task forces, create transitional houses for victims of gendered violence, create shelters for victims of gendered violence, and create victim advocate programs. The United States Congress should condition the receipt of federal funds on the implementation of these programs.<br />

Rule of law necessary to combat oppression. Even if existing norms contribute to oppression that doesn’t mean we can do away with legal advocacy<br />
Andrew Altman, 1990, Critical Legal Studies: A Liberal Critique, p. 199-200<br />
“Liberal legal philosophers…far from a superfluity.”<br />

Legal norms are necessary in an extremely complex plural society. Rule of law guarantees space for negotiation over crucial political questions and nonlegal forms of life<br />

“Peller contends that semantic…destroy all legal institutions.”<br />

Our radical pragmatism that focuses on the need to address structural oppression avoids a new totalizing regime of truth. We should focus the debate on the question of what works. Their focus on abstract ideological systems ignores the self-correcting status of what works<br />

“As the Girouxs….philosophies of the state.”<br />

<br />
Dartmouth’s 1NC strategy<br />
<br />
<br />
First off – Commerce Clause Kritik<br />
<br />
A. Viewing VAWA as commerce clause legislation reduces women to economics at the expense of agency.<br />
Gleason ’01 (Summer-Fall – Women’s Rights Law Reporter – lexis)<br />
“By switching perspective to consider → incapable of being considered as economic actors”<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Reducing justice to commerce extends economic rationality to all thought – there is not meaning outside the market.<br />
Brown ’03 (Theory and Even – 7:1 – project muse)<br />
“the suffusion of both the state and the subject → no meaning outside the market”<br />
<br />
C. No meaning of life = bad -- Dillon impact<br />
<br />
Second off -- Abortion Disad<br />
<br />
A. Court will rollback Congress’s PBA Act now<br />
<br />
Seattle Times Oct 1st<br />
“The abortion cases scheduled → circumstances have not changed”<br />
<br />
B. Overruling Morrison results in the PBA Ban.<br />
<br />
Fein ’04 (June 4th – “Federalism Bow to Bush’s Abortion Agenda” – google)<br />
“it is clueless as to how a partial-birth abortion could implicate interstate commercial activity”<br />
<br />
C. Ban PBA = ends all abortion rights<br />
<br />
Wojceshyn ’03 (“Bush’s Attack on Partial Birth abortion is a scheme to outlaw all abortions” – google)<br />
“the real motive for banning partial-birth abortions”<br />
<br />
D. No abortion rights = extinction<br />
Sofia ’84 (Diacritics – vol 14, no 2, Summer p. 47-48)<br />
“the extinction question’s conspicuous absence”<br />
<br />
Third off -- Mass v. EPA disad<br />
<br />
The impact scenario is CAFÉ/fuel efficiency – Oil Peak impact card<br />
<br />
Fourth off -- Cplan – Public Health Emergency Plans (specific to disease advantage only)<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that Congress may amend the Public Health Services Act to establish a federal mandate regarding the minimum required content of state emergency public health response plans, and that Congress may make the receipt of grants under the Federal Response Act contingent on states developing comprehensive emergency public health response plans that are based on a coordinated national response<br />
<br />
Solvency author says that’s good<br />
Buchsbaum 02, 7 Mich. St. J. Med &amp; Law 1<br />
A Stronger mandate from the federal and resources at stake<br />
<br />
Dartmouth’s 1NC strategy cont’<br />
<br />
1NC A-to ESA<br />
-- If they’d distinguish Raich from ESA, they’d distinguish ESA from the plan. Analytic.<br />
-- No impact to biodiversity loss. card<br />
-- Courts w/n roll-back enviro laws. card<br />
-- Roberts w/n rollback. card<br />
-- Fed rollback = stronger enviro standards<br />
-- Takings Clause = Habitat destruction<br />
-- Rollback turn<br />
-- env rollback = environ amendment. card<br />
-- only an enviro amendment can solve. card<br />
<br />
2NC extensions (goes for takings clause and straight turns the Advantage)<br />
*cites below*<br />
-- Morrison only affect Section 9 of ESA<br />
-- Section Nine fails<br />
-- Section Nine never works<br />
-- ESA = non-cooperative behavior, hurts environment<br />
-- ESA fails<br />
-- ESA = net worse for the environment<br />
-- ESA not recovered a single species<br />
-- All Aff studies on this question all false studies<br />
-- Species recovery success pre-dates the ESA<br />
-- Recovery not the result of Section Nine.<br />
-- ESA ignores majority of endangered species, even if it does solve.<br />
<br />
<br />
A-to Disease Advantage<br />
-- no rollback disease stuff after 9-11. card from Aff author.<br />
-- No disease solvency.<br />
-- Fed control of terror gunk – despite state protests. Feds = blow-off now.<br />
-- Court decisions d/n hinder Feds.<br />
-- Bush will do whatever it takes to solve terror<br />
-- Spread of disease not bad<br />
-- no extinction – no virus could pull that off.<br />
-- Morrison d/n substantially affect Congress’s commerce power.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
There is no universal foundation for politics. Metaphorically substituting one psychic relation for all politics fails. Their reduction of politics to confronting the death drive closes off successful innovations in political strategy. Because we’re not dealing with a universal formation of capital or a universal formation of ideology the aff strategy is counterproductive<br />
<br />

The search for universal………..unite against capital<br />

Their grounding of political action in an ethical framework creates a totalitarian politics. They Produce a command and control ethics with their commitment to shaping society according to first principles<br />

Arendt appropriates heidegger’s…………modern antithesis of politics<br />

The 1AC grants you limitless authority for shaping society according to their ethical ideal. Ethical decisionmaking grants you the illusion of omnipotence at a time that we have no ground to stand on. Their discourse of ethics eliminates the need to test epistemology<br />
