Advantage_: Meltdowns<br />
<br />
Deferring to Congress on Commerce Clause grounds is key to stable electricity supply<br />
Dennis ‘03<br />
(Jeffrey S., U New Mexico Law, Natural Resources Journal, Spring, 43 Nat. Resources J. 615, Lexis)<br />
The U.S. Supreme Court passed on its first opportunity…open markets, then competition is unlikely.<br />
<br />
Electricity failures cause nuclear meltdowns<br />
EIJ ‘2K<br />
(Earth Island Journal, Winter, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.earthisland.org/eijournal/win2000/wr_win2000y2k.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.earthisland.org/eijournal/win2000/wr_win2000y2k.html</a>)<br />
The third type could happen if the electricity fails…the blackout lasted several weeks.<br />
<br />
Extinction<br />
Wasserman ‘02<br />
(Harvey, Senior Editor – Free Press, Earth Island Journal, Spring, www.earthisland.org/eijournal/new_articles.cfm?articleID=457&amp;journalID=63)<br />
The intense radioactive heat within today's operating reactors… the very core of our life and of all future generations must be shut down.<br />
<br />
Human rights credibility add-on<br />
Central Asia<br />
A. Human rights cred is critical to prevent war in Central Asia<br />
Fiona Hill, fellow – Brookings Institution, 2001, The Caucus and Central Asia: How the United States and Its Allies Can Stave Off a Crisis, Policy Brief #80, p. online<br />
In the next two years, the Caucasus and Central Asian… citizen participation in government and access to objective sources of information.<br />
<br />
B. Nuclear war<br />
Valery Tsepkalo, Belarussian ambassador to the U.S., March/April, 1998, Foreign Affairs, Lexis<br />
But abetting the continuing destabilization of Eurasia is not in the…perhaps resulting in loss of control over weapons of mass destruction.<br />
<br />
Terrorism<br />
A. Human Rights credibility gives us the influence to start modern movements and ensure necessary cooperation to stop terrorist attacks<br />
Tom Malinowski, Washington Advocacy Director, 7-7, 2004, Promoting Human Rights and Democracy, Human Rights Watch, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/07/07/usint9009_txt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/07/07/usint9009_txt.htm</a><br />
Having an effective and principled American strategy…America is seen to be compromising the values it has long preached, its credibility and influence are diminished.<br />
<br />
B. Global nuclear war results<br />
Patrick F. Speice, Jr., J.D. Candidate 2006, Marshall-Wythe School of Law, College of William and Mary, February, 2006 (Negligence and Nuclear Nonproliferation: Eliminating the Current Liability Barrier to Bilateral U.S.-Russian Nonproliferation Assistance Programs, 47 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 1427)<br />
The potential consequences of the unchecked…potentially triggering a full-scale nuclear conflict. 50<br />
<br />
Iran Module<br />
Iran<br />
A. Human rights promotion is critical to stem Iran prolif<br />
William W. Burke-White, Senior Special Assistant to the Dean, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Spring, 2004, 17 Harv. Hum. Rts. J. 249, Lexis<br />
The human rights-aggression link suggests alterations… efforts to engage with and assist Iran's NGO and academic communities.<br />
<br />
B. Nuke war<br />
Henry Sokolski, Executive Director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, 10-1, 2003, Taking Proliferation Seriously - Heritage Foundation, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.policyreview.org/oct03/sokolski_print.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.policyreview.org/oct03/sokolski_print.html</a><br />
If nothing is done to shore up U.S. and allied…It would be spring-loaded to go nuclear.<br />
<br />
Democracy<br />
A. Human rights promotion is critical to democracy<br />
Tom Malinowski, Washington Advocacy Director, 3-10, 2004, Federal Document Clearing House Congressional Testimony, Lexis<br />
Whether we agree with the President's policies…requires consistent leadership abroad and a sterling example at home.<br />
<br />
B. Extinction<br />
Larry Diamond, Hoover Institution senior fellow, co-editor of the Journal of Democracy, December 1995, A Report to the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict, “Promoting Democracy in the 1990s: Actors and Instruments, Issues and Imperatives,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm</a><br />
OTHER THREATS This hardly exhausts the lists of threats…security and prosperity can be built.<br />
<br />
Commerce clause add-ons<br />
<br />
Air pollution<br />
Certainty is critical to air pollution response<br />
Parmet ‘02<br />
(Wendy E., Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics, Summer, 30 J.L. Med. &amp; Ethics 201)<br />
<br />
But public health problems are not limited to outbreaks of bioterrorism or exotic…uniform federal standards. In some cases, a dominant federal role may be the only way to significantly reduce injuries or death.<br />
<br />
Extinction results<br />
Dreisen ‘03<br />
(David, Associate Professor, Syracuse University College of Law, Buffalo Environmental Law Journal, Fall/Spring, 10 Buff. Envt'l. L.J. 25, Lexis)<br />
<br />
Air pollution can make life unsustainable by harming the ecosystem upon which all life depends…sustainable development's meaning for air quality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Telecom<br />
<br />
Confusion over telecom jurisdiction will collapse the evolution of technology<br />
Douglas C. Sicker, Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Telecommunications, University of Colorado at Boulder, Spring, 2005, Article: The End of Federalism in Telecommunication Regulations? Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property, Lexis<br />
<br />
At this point, it should be rather clear that technical trends are eroding jurisdictional distinctions at all levels. Policymakers who ignore these…therefore less incentive to deploy new technology.<br />
<br />
That’s key to the economy<br />
Jeffrey Citron, CEO, Chairman, Vonage Holdings Corporation, February 24, 2004, Before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://commerce.senate.gov/pdf/citron022404.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://commerce.senate.gov/pdf/citron022404.pdf</a><br />
<br />
VoIP can spur a telecommunications industry rebound and economic recovery. The telecommunications industry, which once…and Motorola posted large stock price gains for 2003, partially due to increasing interest in VoIP equipment and services.<br />
<br />
Terrorism<br />
Predictability is necessary for sustainable terrorism remedies<br />
Scott T. Powers, partner, Hunter, Smith and Davis, Spring, 2002, Case Note: Commerce - A Retreat From Clarity: The Supreme Court Adds a Wrinkle to the &quot;Aggregated Effects&quot; Doctrine of its Commerce Clause Jurisprudence - United States v. Morrison, 519 U.S. 598 (2000), Temple Law Review, Lexis<br />
<br />
A second feature of the stare decisis approach is that it increases predictability as to how courts will decide a particular issue. 281 Judicial predictability facilitates…that require a uniform, national solution. 285<br />
<br />
Econ<br />
A. Predictability key to biz con<br />
John St John Cooper, Staff Writer, Universal News Service, November 15, 1993, Confidence Based on Predictability Essential to Success, Press Associate, Lexis<br />
<br />
Predictability is the mother of confidence, and we want government to provide a steady, growing economic environment in which…Confidence is the key, and for those who have to invest in the future, predictability is the mother of that confidence.&quot;<br />
<br />
B. Key to econ<br />
John Braithwaite, Australian Research Council Federal fellow, Australian National University and Chair, Regulatory Institutions Network, March, 2004, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences. 592 Annals 79, Lexis<br />
<br />
The challenge of designing institutions that simultaneously engender emancipation and hope is addressed within the assumption of economic institutions that are…that continues to this day (see also Barbalet 1993).<br />
<br />
1. No solvency – the Supreme Court will narrow the amendment<br />
Harold J. Spaeth, author, and Jeffrey Allan Segal, author, 2002, The Supreme Court and the Attitudinal Model Revisited, p. 5<br />
If action by Congress to undo the Court’s interpretation …language or purpose of the amendment.<br />
<br />
2. Turn – overruling decisions with amendments crushes the rule of law<br />
Kathleen M. Sullivan, Professor of Law, Stanford University, January, 1996, (Cardozo Law Review, Address: CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTANCY: WHY CONGRESS SHOULD CURE ITSELF OF AMENDMENT FEVER, 17 Cardozo L. Rev. 691, p. Lexis)<br />
Increasing the frequency of constitutional amendment would undermine…Supreme Court is worth remembering.<br />
<br />
Extinction<br />
Larry Diamond, Hoover Institution senior fellow, co-editor of the Journal of Democracy, December 1995, A Report to the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict, “Promoting Democracy in the 1990s: Actors and Instruments, Issues and Imperatives,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm</a><br />
OTHER THREATS This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security …liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.<br />
<br />
3. Perm – pass the amendment as per the 1NC and then have the Supreme Court do our plan in addition to ruling that on the grounds of the new amendment – enforcement is expected<br />
Brannon P. Denning, Assistant Law Prof, Southern Illinois Law, and John R. Vile, Chair, Department of Political Science, Middle Tennessee State, November, 2002, 77 Tul. L. Rev. 257, Lexis<br />
The Article V process is, as the Framers intended, rigorous…short-circuit (or play games with) Article V's procedural requirements. 129<br />
<br />
4. Fiating state compliance is a voting issue – it guts our ability to make states say no arguments, begs the question of agency, and is not rooted in the literature<br />
<br />
5. The CP spills over – crushing solvency<br />
Kathleen M. Sullivan, Professor of Law, Stanford University, January, 1996, (Cardozo Law Review, Address: CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTANCY: WHY CONGRESS SHOULD CURE ITSELF OF AMENDMENT FEVER, 17 Cardozo L. Rev. 691, p. Lexis)<br />
The very idea of a Constitution turns on the separation of the legal and the political realms…a few parking regulations thrown in.<br />
<br />
6. Perm – do the counterplan immediately and do the plan – normal means the decision is announced in June which will look consistent with the amendment<br />
<br />
7. Turn – lack of judicial involvement in the process destroys clarity<br />
Walter Dellinger, Professor of Law, Duke University, DECEMBER, 1983, (Harvard Law Review, ARTICLE: THE LEGITIMACY OF CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE: RETHINKING THE AMENDMENT PROCESS, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 386, p. Lexis)<br />
The spare language of article V leaves open…doctrines of congressional promulgation and political question.<br />
<br />
8. Turn – plan-specific amendments crush the enforceability and legitimacy of the Constitution<br />
Louis Mchael Seidman Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, and Virginia E. Sloan, executive director of the Constitution Project, 1999 Great and Extraordinary Occasions, p. 5<br />
Restraint is also important in order to preserve the Constitution. . . of too ticklish a nature to be unnecessarily multiplied.&quot;<br />
<br />
9. Kicking the counterplan is a voting issue – it skews 2AC time and strategy and artificially inflates the block/1AR ratio<br />
<br />
10. Turn – economy<br />
A. Amendments snowball to the balanced budget amendment<br />
Louis Michael Seidman Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, and Virginia E. Sloan, executive director of the Constitution Project, 1999 Great and Extraordinary Occasions, p. 5<br />
In recent years, however, there have been troubling indications…the past two centuries may be in danger of being forgotten.<br />
<br />
B. Collapses the economy<br />
Karen Paget, Soros open society institute Fellow, consulted state and local fiscal issues for the Ford Foundation and Twentieth Century Fund, 11.01.1996, “The Balanced Budget Trap,”<br />
The amendment would fundamentally alter the rules…both of which serve to deepen rather than moderate recessions.<br />
<br />
C. Extinction<br />
Chris Lewis, environmental historian, University of Colorado-Boulder, 1998, The Coming Age of Scarcity, p. 56<br />
Most critics would argue, probably correctly, that instead of allow-ing underdeveloped countries…worst-case scenario for the collapse of global civilization.<br />
<br />
10. Turn – SOP<br />
A. CP destroys SOP by depriving the Court of power<br />
Joan Schaffner, Associate Professor of Law, George Washington University Law School, August 2005, (American University Law Review, ARTICLE: THE FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT: TO PROTECT THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE OR DESTROY CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY?, 54 Am. U.L. Rev. 1487, p. Lexis)<br />
Through amendment, the legislative branch has the power …overrule a court decision and threatens separation of powers principles.<br />
<br />
B. Extinction<br />
Ray Forrester, Professor @ Hastings College of the Law, August, 1989, (George Washington Law Review, ESSAY: Presidential Wars in the Nuclear Age: An Unresolved Problem, 57 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1636, p. Lexis)<br />
On the basis of this report, the startling fact is that one man…in the discretion of one person.<br />
He Continues…<br />
And, most important, his…in general, probably would be unable to survive.<br />
<br />
AT: Distinguish<br />
1. No solvency – c/a Fischer – distinguishing Morrison only results in greater lower court confusion – this damns solvency<br />
Denise C. Morgan, Professor, New York Law School, Winter, 2006, Introduction: A Tale of (At Least) Two Federalisms, New York Law School Law Review, Lexis<br />
In truth, the Court's federalism jurisprudence was in flux…will continue to reverberate in the lower federal courts.<br />
<br />
2. Turn – clarifying that Raich overruled Morrison is critical to clarity<br />
Steven Bradford, Assistant Professor of Law, University of Nebraska College of Law, October, 1990, Fordham Law Review, Lexis<br />
The problem for lower courts is not that…state plainly the doctrinal changes it is making. 174<br />
<br />
3. Distinguished CP’s are a voting issue – they steal aff ground, distort reality, and have no evidentiary support – this guts predictable aff ground<br />
<br />
4. Isolating VAWA results in greater confusion<br />
Jason Johnson, JD Southern Illinois University, Winter, 2005, Southern Illinois University Law Journal, Lexis<br />
Although the Supreme Court did not explicitly overrule…led to the creation of individualized suspicion.<br />
<br />
5. Doesn’t solve the human rights advantage – implementation legislation is critical to human rights credibility – that’s Merico-Stephens – that solves Iran<br />
A. Human rights promotion is critical to stem Iran prolif<br />
William W. Burke-White, Senior Special Assistant to the Dean, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Spring, 2004, 17 Harv. Hum. Rts. J. 249, Lexis<br />
The human rights-aggression link suggests alterations…assist Iran's NGO and academic communities.<br />
<br />
B. Nuke war<br />
Henry Sokolski, Executive Director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, 10-1, 2003, Taking Proliferation Seriously - Heritage Foundation, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.policyreview.org/oct03/sokolski_print.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.policyreview.org/oct03/sokolski_print.html</a><br />
If nothing is done to shore up U.S. and allied…It would be spring-loaded to go nuclear.<br />
<br />
6. Kicking the counterplan is a voting issue – it creates a time skew, crushes 2AC strategy and magnifies the block-1AR ratio<br />
<br />
7. Distinguishing precedent without rational grounds destroys court legitimacy<br />
Amy Coney Barrett, Assistant Professor, Notre Dame Law, Summer, 2003, 74 U. Colo. L. Rev. 1011, Lexis<br />
The ability to distinguish cases, however, either honestly… she wants is &quot;at least erroneous and at times preposterous.&quot; 39<br />
<br />
8. Raich proves distinguish leads to confusion<br />
University of Hawaii Law Review, Winter, 2005, Gonzales v. Raich: How the Medical Marijuana Debate Invoked Commerce Clause Confusion, Lexis<br />
Because Raich and Lopez seem indistinguishable using Morrison's four-factor test…Congress' Commerce Clause power on a number of occasions without questioning their propriety. n252<br />
<br />
AT: Implicit overrule counterplan<br />
1. Perm – do the counterplan – having overrule in the plan text is not a reason why the word is used in the decision which is what their evidence assumes<br />
<br />
2. Clarity – the CP destroys it two ways<br />
A. Lower courts confusion<br />
Kornegay ’01 (Nancy R., Houston Law Review, Spring, Lexis)<br />
There appears to be a tendency on the part…when these laws should be applied.<br />
<br />
B. Clear signal<br />
Bratz ’84 (David C., Washington Law Review, December, Lexis)<br />
There are certain exceptions to the general mandate requiring lower courts … The remainder of this Comment will define the foundation for such action.<br />
<br />
The impact is our 1AC Salih evidence – the lack of clarity hurts fast response to the bird flu<br />
<br />
3. Implicit overrules CPs are a voting issue – they steal the aff, avoids substance of the cases, and encourage vague plan writing<br />
<br />
4. Net benefit links trades-off with solvency – their net benefit is based off of legal perception of precedent and our Lopez evidence indicates this is critical for change<br />
<br />
5. Perm – do the counterplan and then the plan – this solves the link to the net benefit<br />
Pintip Hompluem Dunn, associate in the Complex Contract &amp; Commercial Litigation, November, 2003, How Judges Overrule: Speech Act Theory and the Doctrine of Stare Decisis, Yale Law Journal, Lexis<br />
Thus far, we have examined how Justices stray from the traditional… it is no longer good law.n174<br />
<br />
Timeframe fiat is legitimate with a solvency advocate – it checks the infinite regressive nature of the theory<br />
<br />
6. Overrule is a “safe word” that promotes certainty<br />
Pintip Hompluem Dunn, associate in the Complex Contract &amp; Commercial Litigation, November, 2003, How Judges Overrule: Speech Act Theory and the Doctrine of Stare Decisis, Yale Law Journal, Lexis<br />
&quot;Overrule&quot; is a safe word. It does its job effectively, every time…misunderstanding of that action's meaning.<br />
<br />
7. Kicking the counterplan creates a time skew, moots 2AC offense and is a no cost addition – the damage has already been done to 2AC strategy<br />
<br />
AT: Lower courts counterplan<br />
1. Denying cert is a voting issue – it steals aff ground, is unsupported by the literature and avoids the process debate<br />
<br />
2. CP destroys the rule of law and threatens legitimacy – the plan avoids the link<br />
Evan Caminker, dean, Michigan Law, April, 1994, 46 Stn. L. Rev. 817, Lexis<br />
Respect for judicial authority. Bereft of &quot;influence…believe that we live under the rule of law. 157<br />
<br />
Extinction<br />
Larry Diamond, Hoover Institution senior fellow, co-editor of the Journal of Democracy, December 1995, A Report to the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict, “Promoting Democracy in the 1990s: Actors and Instruments, Issues and Imperatives,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm</a><br />
OTHER THREATS This hardly exhausts the…security and prosperity can be built.<br />
<br />
3. There is a spillover<br />
Evan Caminker, dean, Michigan Law, April, 1994, 46 Stn. L. Rev. 817, Lexis<br />
Second, even assuming a category of rare cases…overdeterrence is better than the alternative.<br />
<br />
4. Multi-actor fiat is a voting issue – it’s unpredictable which destroys education, begs the agency question and avoids procedural questions<br />
<br />
5. Turn --- predictability<br />
A. Predictability in law is critical to prevent response – that’s Salih – the CP destroys that<br />
Evan Caminker, dean, Michigan Law, April, 1994, 46 Stn. L. Rev. 817, Lexis<br />
In this section I briefly discuss the values that uniform judicial interpretation…even avoided altogether by voluntary settlement. 141<br />
<br />
B. That’s critical to the economy<br />
Center for Individual Freedom, 6-12-03, True Legal Reform Begins With Judicial Reform, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.centerforindividualfreedom.org/legal/judicial_reform.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.centerforindividualfreedom.org/legal/judicial_reform.htm</a><br />
Unless and until a concerted effort…U.S. economy will continue to multiply exponentially.<br />
<br />
C. Nuke war<br />
Chris Lewis, environmental historian, University of Colorado-Boulder, 1998, The Coming Age of Scarcity, p. 56<br />
<br />
Most critics would argue, probably correctly…worst-case scenario for the collapse of global civilization.<br />
<br />
6. Perm – do the plan and the counterplan<br />
<br />
7. Can’t overrule Supreme Court precedent-courts will backlash<br />
The New York Sun, December 11, 2002, “Court Backs Federal Death Penalty,” p. Lexis<br />
<br />
A federal appeals court yesterday…only the Supreme Court is authorized to make.&quot;<br />
<br />
8. Deference<br />
A. Rational basis is critical to restore Congressional deference<br />
Christy H. Dral, attorney, Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP, and Jerry J. Phillips, Professor of Law, University of Tennessee, Spring, 2001, Article: Commerce By Another Name: The Impact of United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, Tennessee Law Review, Lexis<br />
The Court should recognize this practical…restraints imposed by rules of law.&quot; n238<br />
B. Crushes democracy<br />
Larry D. Kramer, Samuel Tilden Professor of Law, New York University, November 2001, The Supreme Court 2000 Term: Foreword: We The Court, Harvard law review, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 4, ln<br />
While this may make the shift explicable…Constitution is to squeeze the life out of it.<br />
<br />
AT: Stare decisis disadvantage<br />
2. No link – c/a our Dunn evidence – using Raich as cover to overrule Morrison shields the Supreme Court from the negative effects of overruling – more evidence<br />
Pintip Hompluem Dunn, associate in the Complex Contract &amp; Commercial Litigation, November, 2003, How Judges Overrule: Speech Act Theory and the Doctrine of Stare Decisis, Yale Law Journal, Lexis<br />
<br />
This technique goes beyond an innocuous shifting…or interpreting (in the case of the present-day Court).<br />
<br />
3. No link and turn – there is no spillover in legitimacy from overrules and the plan would increase legitimacy – that’s Linton from the 1AC<br />
<br />
4. Turn – legal scholars want Morrison overruled<br />
Randy E. Barnett, Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory, Georgetown University Law Center, Summer, 2005, Can Originalism Be Reconciled With Precedent?: A Symposium on Stare Decisis: Trumping Precedent With Original Meaning: Not as Radical as It Sounds, Constitutional Commentary, Lexis<br />
In short, for nonoriginalists (and most everyone else), first comes…original meaning of the Commerce Clause? n15<br />
<br />
5. We solve the impact – stable and consistent law is critical to the rule of law which is the terminal impact to stare decisis – that’s our Powers evidence<br />
<br />
6. Clarity<br />
A. Overruling Morrison is critical to create clarity and consistency<br />
Scott T. Powers, partner, Hunter, Smith and Davis, Spring, 2002, Case Note: Commerce - A Retreat From Clarity: The Supreme Court Adds a Wrinkle to the &quot;Aggregated Effects&quot; Doctrine of its Commerce Clause Jurisprudence - United States v. Morrison, 519 U.S. 598 (2000), Temple Law Review, Lexis<br />
In United States v. Morrison, 358 the United States Supreme Court…citizens of our [*200] United States, for sixty years preceding Lopez.<br />
<br />
B. This restores legitimacy<br />
Amy Padden, J.D. Georgetown Law Center, April, 1994, 82 Geo. L. J. 1689, Lexis<br />
An intervening development in the law may require…overrule the precedent and reestablish certainty in the present state of the law.<br />
<br />
7. Public<br />
A. Plan massively popular<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor of Law, Rutgers University School of Law, Adjunct Professor, University of Pennsylvania Law School, Visiting Associate Professor, Harvard Law School, October, 2002, The Supreme Court, The Violence Against Women Act, and the Use and Abuse of Federalism, Fordham Law Review, Lexis<br />
Throughout the extended period when…lobbied actively for its passage. n46<br />
<br />
B. Public perception determines the effect of overrules on legitimacy<br />
James C. Rehnquist, late Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, March, 1986, The Power That SHallw Be Vested in a Precedent, 66 B.U.L. Rev. 345, Lexis<br />
Discussion of the Supreme Court's legitimacy is problematic…conceive of the Supreme Court's role in American government.<br />
<br />
AT: Minimalism<br />
1. Non-unique – Roberts-led minimalism breakdown is inevitable<br />
Economist, 12-16, 2006, Lexis<br />
Modesty is at the core of Mr Roberts's judicial philosophy…only be, if ever allowed, allowed as a last resort.&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Turn – the plan returns decision-making to the deliberative branch of the government – this is consistent with minimalism<br />
<br />
3. No internal link – it's the nature of the cases not Roberts that determines minimalism<br />
Jerry Zremski, buffalo news, 7-10-2006, Roberts' style conciliatory in steering deeply divided high court, ln<br />
Most of the unanimous rulings the court issued…get a sense of the relationships.&quot;<br />
<br />
4. Turn – the lack of clear standards allows for judicial subjectivity and activism – this will inevitably trigger the link– that’s Powers<br />
<br />
5. Turn – plan is minimalist<br />
Sunstein, professor of law and political science at University of Chicago, 2005 (Cass R., Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts are Wrong for America, pg 237-239)<br />
A theory, and not just common sense…long been considered legitimate.<br />
<br />
6. Turn – stare decisis results in maximalism<br />
Sunstein, Professor of Law and Political Science at University of Chicago, 1999 (Cass R., One Case at a Time: Judicial Minimalism on the Supreme Court, Harvard University Press, pg 19-20)<br />
The effect of width and depth is not merely a function of what the court says…many statements are mere “dicta” will drive prior cases in the direction of minimalism, whatever courts say in the initial cases.<br />
<br />
AT: Federalism disadvantage<br />
2. Spending clause makes federalism collapse inevitable<br />
John O. McGinnis, Reearch Professor, Northwestern Law School, and Ilya Somin, Assistant Professor of Law, George Mason University School of Law, Fall, 2004 (Federalism vs. States' Rights: A Defense of Judicial Review in a Federal System, 99 Nw. U.L. Rev. 89, Northwestern University Law Review)<br />
The Court has at least begun to revive judicial review of the Commerce Clause…so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Empirically denied – rational basis standards did not explode the federalism doctrine after Raich – that’s Hawaii Law<br />
<br />
4. Turn – economy<br />
A. Federalism collapses confidence<br />
John Kincaid, Robert B. &amp; Helen S. Meyner Professor of Government and Public Service, Director of the Meyner Center for the Study of State and Local Government, Lafayette College, Editor of Publius, The Journal of Federalism, former Executive Director of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, Summer, 1995, Foreword: The New Federalism Context of the New Judicial Federalism, Rutgers Law Journal, Lexis<br />

B. Destroys econ<br />
John Braithwaite, Australian Research Council Federal fellow, Australian National University and Chair, Regulatory Institutions Network, March, 2004, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences. 592 Annals 79, Lexis<br />
The challenge of designing institutions… of economics, a neglect that continues to this day (see also Barbalet 1993).<br />
<br />
C. Extinction<br />
Chris Lewis, environmental historian, University of Colorado-Boulder, 1998, The Coming Age of Scarcity, p. 56<br />
Most critics would argue, probably correctly…worst-case scenario for the collapse of global civilization.<br />
<br />
5. No spillover – all legislation changes the legal environment for the states<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor of Law, Rutgers University School of Law, Adjunct Professor, University of Pennsylvania Law School, Visiting Associate Professor, Harvard Law School, October, 2002, The Supreme Court, The Violence Against Women Act, and the Use and Abuse of Federalism, Fordham Law Review, Lexis<br />
It might be argued that even though VAWA's civil rights…only to the presence of a parallel federal civil rights remedy.<br />
<br />
6. Federalism is resilient<br />
Christopher P. Banks, Associate Professor of Political Science, 2003, 36 Akron L. Rev. 425, Lexis<br />
In this way the Rehnquist Court's approach to Section 5…constitutional wisdom in Section 5 cases.<br />
<br />
6. Public health<br />
A. Federalism destroys response to bioterror<br />
Lori L. Buchsbaum, Master's of Public Health, San Diego State University, and Director, The Border Health Initiative of Project Concern International, Fall, 2002, The U.S. Public Health Response to Bioterrorism: Need for a Stronger Legislative Approach, Journal of Medicine and Law, Lexis<br />
<br />
While public health has traditionally been…Fourteenth Amendment did not extend to the enactment of the Act. n58<br />
<br />
B. Extinction<br />
John D. Steinbruner, Brookings senior fellow and chair in international security, vice chair of the committee on international security and arms control of the National Academy of Sciences, Winter 1997, Foreign Policy, “Biological weapons: a plague upon all houses,” n109 p85(12), infotrac<br />

Since 2001, terrorists have found their targets on almost every continent, with bombings in Bali, London, Madrid, and elsewhere. Five years on, however, America<br />

Eliminating military commissions in their entirety is essential to gain international credibility and sustain cooperation in the war on terror.<br />
Koh, Editor of the American Journal of International Law, 2k2 [Harold Hongju, 96 A.J.I.L. 337, lexis]<br />
The use of military commissions potentially endangers Americans overseas by undermining the U.S. government's ability to protest effectively when other countries use such tribunals. But just as troubling, espousing military commissions undermines U.S. moral leadership<br />
<br />
Commissions undermine domestic and international support making effective coalitions impossible.<br />

Today, some states harbour terrorists in order to attack their enemies<br />

Military commissions prevent extradition of suspects, which is essential to prosecution and overall success of the war on terrorism.<br />

The blowback to the special military tribunals was almost immediate from<br />
<br />
Thus, the plan:<br />
<br />
In an appropriate test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in Ex parte Quirin by ruling that due process prohibits the trial of unlawful combatants in military commissions. We’ll clarify.<br />
Contention 2 – Democracy – see below<br />

<br />
Contention 3 – solvency<br />
<br />
Quirin held commissions constitutional<br />
Stone, 42 [Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1, 1942]<br />
From the very beginning of its history this Court has recognized<br />
<br />
<br />
Overruling Quirin is essential to stop the use of military commissions.<br />

A fortiori. A bad precedent, Supreme Court or otherwise,<br />

Quirin is bad precedent – overruling it would not harm legitimacy.<br />
Katyal and Tribe, law profs at Yale and Georgetown and law prof at Harvard, 2k2<br />
[Yale Law Journal, “Waging War, Deciding Guilt: Trying the Military Tribunals,” lexis]<br />
Finally, to the extent that Quirin did provide the President<br />

Legal historians uniformly conclude that Quirin should be overruled.<br />

Rumsfeld, Brief of Legal Scholars and Historians as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioner, p6-7]<br />
“The rule of stare decisis, though one tending to consistency<br />

Overrule is key – the mere existence of emergency powers encourages the government to create an atmosphere of fear so it can use them.<br />
Gross, law prof at U of Minnesota Law School, 2k3 [Oren, 112 Yale L.J. 1011, lexis]<br />
Accommodation of exigency considerations within<br />

We meet – the holding is either/or – 14th or commerce clause<br />
Area debate is inevitable – either kills aff flex or allows bad pics<br />
We meet – plan moots Morrison, we say overrule Morrison in plan text<br />
Moots casey – contradicting holdings<br />

Decision is part of the opinion necessary to resolve the dispute – “real estate law” p. 5-6, James Carp 2003 – a court will…susbsequent decisions<br />
Overrule means opposite results<br />
Dictionary of Modern legal usuage – p. 632 1995 – overrule; overturn; reverse…result in further proceedings<br />
Standards<br />
Provide ground – all affs results in opposite winner<br />
Literature basis – Court decisions are overrule in part not with the whole rational – empirically proven by Lawrence<br />
Reasonability – no unique right to particular DA, ground is all case specific, competing interps leads to race of exclusion<br />

We begin with the plan –<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should grant cert to a relevant test case and overrule the decision in the United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) by ruling that the rational basis test governs its evaluation of Congressional legislation grounded in the Commerce Clause.<br />

Future Commerce Clause cases will determine the applicability of the rational basis test<br />

<br />
Raich, however, does not mean carte blanche, … consideration of what it should look like.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – Economy<br />
<br />
The recent Raich v. Gonzalez decision has caused the Commerce Clause jurisprudence uniquely unpredictable and unstable – the existence of three rules, aggregation, Lopez, and the broader regulatory scheme allows for judicial subjectivity and policy making – only establishing a clear framework can restore stability<br />

The Morrison majority does not simply respect a preexisting line between<br />
what is private …the question whether a nation organized to preclude<br />
relief for the violation of one half of its people by the other should<br />
survive.<br />
The precedent set by Morrison provides little recourse for the sixteen<br />

Imagine a people routinely subjected to assault, rape, …outrage aimed at<br />
an intolerable status quo there is instead denial, and the largely<br />
passive acceptance of ‘the way things are’.<br />
Silence is complicity with oppression—constant vigilance against<br />
gendered violence is necessary to achieve societal equality<br />

Equally shocking is the fact that most gender violence not only goes<br />
unpunished but is tolerated in silence—the silence of society as well …<br />

humankind in its entirety.<br />

Thus, the Court struck down 13981 not because the harm was inappropriate<br />

What was at stake in Morrison was nothing less than the recognition<br />
that [*538] gender-motivated violence is not merely an individual<br />

The Supreme Court should assume a more deferential role because it more<br />
consistent with a history that respects …Court must shoulder the burden<br />
of demonstrating why the judgment of the Congress of the United States<br />
should not command our respect.&quot; n261<br />
Critiquing the system alone won’t solve; must combine theory with<br />
practice in order to change legal culture toward gender-based violence<br />
Deborah M. Weissman, Professor of Law @ UNC-CH, 2001, Boston College Law<br />
Review, 42 B.C. L. Rev 1081<br />
The Morrison decision thus relegated women to the very system that<br />
Congress determined was incapable of providing meaningful…everyone<br />
engaged in this effort, including theorists, practitioners, and<br />
litigants, are needed to transform the legal culture as it relates to<br />
violence against women.<br />

State legislatures have accepted Casey's…. but not so bad that you'll lose the bill altogether.<br />
<br />
The statues upheld by Casey empirically block access to abortions<br />

Equal protection standard replaces the undue burden standard with a strict scrutiny test and mandates government support for abortions.<br />

In Roe, the Court held that a state may not limit a woman's … right to equal protection and her fundamental right to bodily integrity and liberty.<br />

The Supreme Court of the United States should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, et al. v. Casey, Governor of Pennsylvania, et al.

Being born is always bad: The benefits of life will never outweigh the pain because the absence of pain is good even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone whereas the absence of pleasure is only bad if a subject is deprived.<br />
Benatar, associate professor of philosophy University of Cape Town, 97<br />
&lt;David, “Why it is Better Never to Come into Existence.” In Life Death and Meaning: Key Philosophical Readings on Big Questions. Pg 156-158&gt;<br />
As a matter of empirical fact … about not having had children, but not because the children which one could have had have been deprived of existence<br />
<br />
Even if being born isn’t intrinsically bad history shows that on average being born is worse then not never being born. Their disads will simply reflect the ongoing agony of existence. Giving birth is playing Russian Roulette with your child’s future.<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />
&lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 88-92&gt;<br />
Such is the strength of Pollyannaism, that the foregoing sort of pessimism… Russian roulette with a fully loaded gun—aimed, of course, not at their own heads, but at those of their future offspring<br />

What size population would he produced by principles … existence is not to bring anybody into existence<br />
<br />
There is a moral obligation not to bring others into existence that outweighs any possible suffering of those that currently exist.<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />
&lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 190-191&gt;<br />
Whether or not this is the case, there are some views … spare ourselves (even if there are more of us) that same fate.<br />

Every child is a generational iceberg of suffering<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />
&lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 6-7&gt;<br />
Nor is the harm produced by the creation of a child usually restricted to that child. … expect one’s descendents to do so.<br />
<br />
Self deception is the only reason we don’t regret our nonexistence, we have been brainwashed.<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />
&lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 64-69&gt;<br />
In fact, however, there is very good reason to doubt that … ourselves with those who are better off than ourselves, our self-assessments are less positive than they otherwise would be, but they do not usually cause them to become negative<br />

Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />

Those cases in which the offspring turn out to regret … we should not take the widespread contentment with having come into existence as a justification for having children.<br />

&lt;David, A Defense of Abortion, pg 129&gt;<br />
Moreover, if it were widely accepted that abortion was permissible … pregnancies wait until relatively later.<br />
<br />
This means we should take a pro-death view of abortion<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />
&lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 160-161&gt;<br />
My view that fetuses lack moral standing in the earlier stages … For such a failure allows somebody to suffer the serious harm of coming into existence.<br />
<br />
Even abortion of conscious fetuses is justified to prevent the suffering of existence<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />
&lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 150-151&gt;<br />
Although I think that Professor Tooley’s argument should be rejected, his view has a kernel of truth that can be endorsed. … consciousness and even some instances of infanticide may be morally desirable, if they prevent the continuation of particularly unpleasant existences.<br />

Contention One is Gender Violence:<br />
<br />
First, Morrison established a public/private dichotomy in response to Congress’s attempt to prevent gendered violence. This dichotomy is the most vicious attack on women’s equality in judicial history.<br />
<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon* Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, The University of Michigan Law School 2000114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, The Harvard Law Review Association Harvard Law Review November, THE SUPREME COURT, 1999 TERM COMMENT: DISPUTING MALE SOVEREIGNTY: ON UNITED STATES v. MORRISON<br />
<br />
The Morrison majority does not simply respect a preexisting line…<br />
…preclude relief for the violation of one half of its people by the other should survive.<br />
<br />
Second, it is impossible to separate the violence we allow to occur at home and the violence that occurs elsewhere in the world. The public/private dichotomy is moral hypocrisy and perpetuates societal patriarchy.<br />
<br />
Bunch 1997, Charlotte, Executive Director for Women’s Global Leadership at Rutgers, “The intolerable status quo: violence against women and girls,” The Progress of Nations 1997, unicef.org<br />
<br />
Further, in most countries today, domestic abuse is officially regarded as a private family matter….. Where is the woman who has not felt a whisper of fear in the face of male aggression—and limited her activities accordingly?<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, this gendered violence constitutes the world’s most pervasive human rights violation possible- eliminating this violence is necessary to create a new paradigm of human security to avoid war- human progress is impossible absent the plan.<br />
Bunch 1997, Charlotte, Executive Director for Women’s Global Leadership at Rutgers, “The intolerable status quo: violence against women and girls,” The Progress of Nations 1997, unicef.org<br />
<br />
Imagine a people routinely subjected to assault, rape, sexual slavery, ….and the largely passive acceptance of ‘the way things are’.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two is Congressional Deference:<br />
<br />
The lack of deference represented in Morrison establishes a frontier for judicial supremacy that crushes Congressional interpretation of the Constitution<br />
Rachel E. Barkow, B.A., 1993, Northwestern University, J.D., 1996, Harvard University, Associate Professor of Law, New York University School of Law, March, 2002, Article: More Supreme Than Court? The Fall of the Political Question Doctrine and the Rise of Judicial Supremacy, Columbia Law Review, Lexis<br />
<br />
The seeds for this vision of the Supreme Court's power can be found in Cooper v. Aaron…. the Court has opted for the course that aggrandizes its own power.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Subpoint A is Progressivism<br />
<br />
First, the status quo assures conservative takeover of the Constitution. Judicial supremacy over constitutional interpretation dooms progressive politics.<br />
<br />
West, February, 1990 88 Mich. L. Rev. 641 (Robin , Professor, University of Maryland School of Law)<br />
<br />
The gains for progressive politics would be no less tangible…. It is, however, a disaster in which progressive constitutionalists seem perversely willing to acquiesce.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, judicial supremacy should be sacrificed in order to free progressive politics from the restraints of adjudication. The plan re-establishes the Constitution as a progressive text.<br />
<br />
Robin West, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, Michigan LR, February 90 (Progressive and Conservative Constitutionalism, Lexis)<br />
<br />
I also argue, however, that for theoretical as well as strategic reasons, the long-range success,… a &quot;constitutional moment&quot; n20 and what Owen Fiss might call more dramatically an &quot;interpretive crisis.&quot; n21<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, this constitutional re-conceptualization is necessary to solve racism, sexism, and private domination.<br />
Robin West, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, 1994, (Progressive Constitutionalism: Reconstructing the Fourteenth Amendment, p 285)<br />
<br />
By way of conclusion, let me briefly characterize some of the gains of reorienting progressive constitutional discourse …by &quot;equal protection&quot; -- to protect the citizenry against the damaging effects of rampant social and private inequality.<br />
<br />
Subpoint B is Democracy<br />
First, the current trend of judicial supremacy threatens the model of American constitutionalism and separation of powers.<br />
<br />
Larry D. Kramer, Samuel Tilden Professor of Law, New York University, November 2001, The Supreme Court 2000 Term: Foreword: We The Court, Harvard law review, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 4, ln<br />
<br />
Which brings us to the Rehnquist Court. For as Part IV argues, …. threatened by a Court that truly sees the Constitution as nothing more than ordinary law. Judicial supremacy is becoming judicial sovereignty.<br />
<br />
Second, this trend will only get worse as time goes on. Failure to stop the court will result in a collapse of American constitutional democracy.<br />
<br />
Larry D. Kramer, Samuel Tilden Professor of Law, New York University, November 2001, The Supreme Court 2000 Term: Foreword: We The Court, Harvard law review, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 4, ln<br />
<br />
Yet it is precisely this fact that ought to concern us…. It may be early, but surely not too early, to take a good hard look at what the Rehnquist Court is up to and ask whether we should put a stop to it. Before it is too late.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Third, Supreme Court decisions and Constitutional interpretation are modeled worldwide<br />
Albert P. Blaustein, Professor of Law, Rutgers School of Law, March, 2004, The U.S. Constitution: America’s Most Important Export, Issues of Democracy, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0304/ijde/ijde0304.htm" rel="nofollow">http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0304/ijde/ijde0304.htm</a><br />
<br />
With the end of World War II, American influence was dominant in the preparation of the new basic charters…Conversely, the influence of the U.S. Constitution has been carried abroad by Americans who have been called upon to serve as advisers in the writing of other constitutions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fourth, constitutionalism is essential to promote an effective transition to democracy.<br />
Fareed Zakaria, managing editor, Foreign Affairs, contributing editor, Newsweek, November/December, 1997, The Rise of Illiberal Democracy, Foreign Affairs, Lexis<br />
<br />
Lang's embarrassment highlights two common, and often mistaken, assumptions …, Wilhelmine Germany, and Taisho Japan to those in today's newspapers , like Armenia and Azerbaijan and Milosevic's Serbia. The democratic peace, it turns out, has little to do with democracy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, the impact is extinction<br />
<br />
Larry Diamond, Hoover Institution senior fellow, co-editor of the Journal of Democracy, December 1995, A Report to the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict, “Promoting Democracy in the 1990s: Actors and Instruments, Issues and Imperatives,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm</a><br />
<br />
OTHER THREATS This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security and well-being….democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.<br />
<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that the United States Congress has power under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment to regulate the private activity in Section 13981 on the basis that Congress’ facts do not have to indicate a problem that exists in all, or even most, States.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Three is Solvency:<br />
Morrison should be overturned on equal protection grounds. State inaction encourages continued violence.<br />
Deena Hausner, lawyer at House of Ruth Domestic Violence Center, Spring / Summer, 2002, United States v. Morrison: A Critique of the Supreme Court's Restriction of Congress' Fourteenth Amendment Powers, The Boston Public Interest Law Journal, 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 261, ln<br />
<br />
Determining what constitutes state action is nebulous at best. …The civil rights provision of the Violence Against Women Act served as an &quot;ancillary remedy,&quot; providing women legal vindication in the absence of state action. 77<br />
<br />
Second, deference to political Constitutional interpretations improves Constitutional understanding and promotes dialogue<br />
Rachel E. Barkow, B.A., 1993, Northwestern University, J.D., 1996, Harvard University, Associate Professor of Law, New York University School of Law, March, 2002, Article: More Supreme Than Court? The Fall of the Political Question Doctrine and the Rise of Judicial Supremacy, Columbia Law Review, Lexis<br />
<br />
Placing some interpretive power with the political branches …Supreme Court appointment process is that the new theory of judicial supremacy has foreclosed other legitimate methods of resisting court decisions. n556<br />
The law will never cease to exist. Engagement in legal method and discourse is necessary for any transformative change.<br />
<br />
Lucinda M. Finley, Visiting professor of Law, SUNY Buffalo, 1989 [64 Notre Dame L. Rev. 886, “Breaking Women’s Silence In Law: The Dilemma of the Gendered Nature of Legal Reasoning.” P. lexis]<br />
<br />
So, what's a woman do? Give up on law, on legal language entirely? …there is no &quot;one truth&quot; of women's experiences, and women's own understandings of their experiences are themselves affected by legal categorizations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, the plan opens up a space from which we can redeploy the state progressively as a way to challenge hierarchies in the name of freedom. Oppression and coercion are inevitable absent this commitment to progressivism.<br />
West, February, 1990 88 Mich. L. Rev. 641 (Robin , Professor, University of Maryland School of Law)<br />
<br />
Second, for some progressives, the meaning of the good and the good life…By so doing, and only by so doing, can it further rather than frustrate the &quot;good life&quot; of the citizens over whom it unquestionably holds dominion.&gt;<br />

Second, it is impossible to separate the violence we allow to occur at<br />
home and the violence that occurs elsewhere in the world. The<br />
public/private dichotomy is moral hypocrisy and perpetuates societal<br />
patriarchy.<br />
Bunch 1997, Charlotte, Executive Director for Women’s Global Leadership<br />
at Rutgers, “The intolerable status quo: violence against women and<br />
girls,” The Progress of Nations 1997, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.unicef.org/pon97/women1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.unicef.org/pon97/women1.htm</a><br />
Further, in most countries today, domestic abuse is officially regarded<br />
as a private …The lesson is never forgotten.<br />
Finally, this gendered violence constitutes the world’s most pervasive<br />
human rights violation possible- eliminating this violence is necessary<br />
to create a new paradigm of human security to avoid war- human progress<br />
is impossible absent the plan.<br />
Bunch 1997, Charlotte, Executive Director for Women’s Global Leadership<br />
at Rutgers, “The intolerable status quo: violence against women and<br />
girls,” The Progress of Nations 1997, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.unicef.org/pon97/women1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.unicef.org/pon97/women1.htm</a><br />
Imagine a people routinely subjected to assault, rape, sexual slavery,<br />
arbitrary imprisonment, torture, verbal abuse, mutilation,… outrage<br />
aimed at an intolerable status quo there is instead denial, and the<br />
largely passive acceptance of ‘the way things are’.<br />
Contention Two is Congressional Deference:<br />
The lack of deference represented in Morrison establishes a frontier for<br />
judicial supremacy that crushes Congressional interpretation of the<br />
Constitution<br />
Rachel E. Barkow, B.A., 1993, Northwestern University, J.D., 1996,<br />
Harvard University, Associate Professor of Law, New York University<br />
School of Law, March, 2002, Article: More Supreme Than Court? The Fall<br />
of the Political Question Doctrine and the Rise of Judicial Supremacy,<br />
Columbia Law Review, Lexis<br />
Thus, even in the wake of Cooper, the Warren Court deferred to<br />
Congress's factual findings under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment<br />
and left questions of Congress's Commerce Clause power largely …Court<br />
must abandon either its theory of supremacy or the political question<br />
doctrine. It is hardly surprising that the Court has opted for the<br />
course that aggrandizes its own power.<br />
Subpoint A is Progressivism<br />
First, the status quo assures conservative takeover of the Constitution.<br />
Judicial supremacy over constitutional interpretation dooms progressive<br />
politics.<br />
West, February, 1990 88 Mich. L. Rev. 641 (Robin , Professor, University<br />
of Maryland School of Law)<br />
A constitutionalized progressive agenda would centralize progressive<br />
concerns and lend them far greater …however, a disaster in which<br />
progressive constitutionalists seem perversely willing to acquiesce.<br />
Second, judicial supremacy should be sacrificed in order to free<br />
progressive politics from the restraints of adjudication. The plan<br />
re-establishes the Constitution as a progressive text.<br />
Robin West, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center,<br />
Michigan LR, February 90 (Progressive and Conservative<br />
Constitutionalism, Lexis)<br />
the sense, and even more modestly the relevance of the progressive<br />
interpretation of the Constitution, depend not only on the merits of its<br />
interpretive claims, …and what Owen Fiss might call more dramatically an<br />
&quot;interpretive crisis.&quot; n21<br />
Finally, this constitutional re-conceptualization is necessary to solve<br />
racism, sexism, and private domination.<br />
Robin West, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, 1994,<br />
(Progressive Constitutionalism: Reconstructing the Fourteenth Amendment,<br />
p 285)<br />
if we were to recharacterize our progressive understanding of the<br />
constitutional guarantees …to protect the citizenry against the damaging<br />
effects of rampant social and private inequality.<br />
Subpoint B is Democracy<br />
First, the current trend of judicial supremacy threatens the model of<br />
American constitutionalism and separation of powers.<br />
Larry D. Kramer, Samuel Tilden Professor of Law, New York University,<br />
November 2001, The Supreme Court 2000 Term: Foreword: We The Court,<br />
Harvard law review, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 4, ln<br />
Which brings us to the Rehnquist Court…threatened by a Court that truly<br />
sees the Constitution as nothing more than ordinary law. Judicial<br />
supremacy is becoming judicial sovereignty.<br />
Second, this trend will only get worse as time goes on. Failure to stop<br />
the court will result in a collapse of American constitutional democracy.<br />
Larry D. Kramer, Samuel Tilden Professor of Law, New York University,<br />
November 2001, The Supreme Court 2000 Term: Foreword: We The Court,<br />
Harvard law review, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 4, ln<br />
Precedent gathers momentum slowly, but once things are rolling, an<br />
avalanche can be difficult to avoid…. to take a good hard look at what<br />
the Rehnquist Court is up to and ask whether we should put a stop to it.<br />
Before it is too late.<br />
Third, Supreme Court decisions and Constitutional interpretation are<br />
modeled worldwide<br />
Albert P. Blaustein, Professor of Law, Rutgers School of Law, March,<br />
2004, The U.S. Constitution: America’s Most Important Export, Issues of<br />
Democracy, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0304/ijde/ijde0304.htm" rel="nofollow">http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0304/ijde/ijde0304.htm</a><br />
With the end of World War II, American influence was dominant in the<br />
preparation of ….. of the U.S. Constitution has been carried abroad by<br />
Americans who have been called upon to serve as advisers in the writing<br />
of other constitutions.<br />
Fourth, constitutionalism is essential to promote an effective<br />
transition to democracy.<br />
Fareed Zakaria, managing editor, Foreign Affairs, contributing editor,<br />
Newsweek, November/December, 1997, The Rise of Illiberal Democracy,<br />
Foreign Affairs, Lexis<br />
Lang's embarrassment highlights two common, and often mistaken,<br />
assumptions -- that the forces of democracy are the forces of ethnic<br />
…democratic peace, it turns out, has little to do with democracy.<br />
Finally, the impact is extinction<br />
Larry Diamond, Hoover Institution senior fellow, co-editor of the<br />
Journal of Democracy, December 1995, A Report to the Carnegie Commission<br />
on Preventing Deadly Conflict, “Promoting Democracy in the 1990s: Actors<br />
and Instruments, Issues and Imperatives,”<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm</a><br />
Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons continue to proliferate… a new<br />
world order of international security and prosperity can be built.<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that the United States<br />
Congress has power under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment to<br />
regulate the private activity in Section 13981 on the basis that<br />
Congress’ facts do not have to indicate a problem that exists in all, or<br />
even most, States.<br />
Contention Three is Solvency:<br />
Morrison should be overturned on equal protection grounds. State<br />
inaction encourages continued violence.<br />
Deena Hausner, lawyer at House of Ruth Domestic Violence Center, Spring<br />
/ Summer, 2002, United States v. Morrison: A Critique of the Supreme<br />
Court's Restriction of Congress' Fourteenth Amendment Powers, The Boston<br />
Public Interest Law Journal, 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 261, ln<br />
The Morrison Court misunderstood the facts and circumstances supporting<br />
Congress' enactment … served as an &quot;ancillary remedy,&quot; providing women<br />
legal vindication in the absence of state action. 77<br />
Second, deference to political Constitutional interpretations improves<br />
Constitutional understanding and promotes dialogue<br />
Rachel E. Barkow, B.A., 1993, Northwestern University, J.D., 1996,<br />
Harvard University, Associate Professor of Law, New York University<br />
School of Law, March, 2002, Article: More Supreme Than Court? The Fall<br />
of the Political Question Doctrine and the Rise of Judicial Supremacy,<br />
Columbia Law Review, Lexis<br />
Placing some interpretive power with the political branches also insures<br />
…deference therefore helps to promote a dialogue between the Court and<br />
the political branches.<br />
The law will never cease to exist. Engagement in legal method and discourse is necessary for any transformative change.<br />
Lucinda M. Finley, Visiting professor of Law, SUNY Buffalo, 1989 [64<br />
Notre Dame L. Rev. 886, “Breaking Women’s Silence In Law: The Dilemma of<br />
the Gendered Nature of Legal Reasoning.” P. lexis]<br />
So, what's a woman do? Give up on law, …pursue trying to bring more of<br />
women's experiences, perspectives, and voices into law in order to<br />
empower women and help legitimate these experiences.<br />
Finally, the plan opens up a space from which we can redeploy the state<br />
progressively as a way to challenge hierarchies in the name of freedom.<br />
Oppression and coercion are inevitable absent this commitment to<br />
progressivism.<br />
West, February, 1990 88 Mich. L. Rev. 641 (Robin , Professor, University<br />
of Maryland School of Law)<br />
Second, for some progressives, the meaning of the good and the good life<br />
that the state ought to promote,…doing, and only by so doing, can it<br />
further rather than frustrate the &quot;good life&quot; of the citizens over whom<br />
it unquestionably holds dominion.<br />

Plan: In an appropriate test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in United States v. Morrison by ruling that the United States has the power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to regulate private acts of gender-motivated violence in 42 U.S.C. §13981<br />
