EX PARTE QUIRIN CREATES THE ENEMY COMBATANT DISTINCTION<br />
Lugosi, 2K3 [Rule of Law or Rule by Law: The Detention of Yaser Hamdi; AM. J. CRIM. K. 225]<br />
<br />
Indefinite detention is an exercise of sovereign bio-power that suspends international law and the human rights of the Other, globalizing a state of perpetual war.<br />
BUTLER, 2K4 [Judith; Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley; Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence; New York: Verso; 2004; p. 73-80]<br />
<br />
Sovereign bio-power uses threats as a mobilization for pre-emptive war, sacrificing expendable bare life in the name of protecting the population but ultimately placing the survival of everyone into question.<br />
SHAPIRO, 2K4 [Michael; Professor at the University of Hawaii; Methods and Nations; p. 180-182]<br />
<br />
Under indefinite detention, war and biopolitics re-structure time itself, making our future a future of infinite war and maintaining international law in a permanent state of exception that effectively suspends it forever.<br />
BUTLER, 2K4 [Judith; Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley; Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence; New York: Verso; 2004; p. 61-65]<br />
<br />
Thus we affirm the notion that the United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex parte Quirin [317 U.S. 1 (1942)] on the grounds that military commissions violate US obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Geneva Convention.<br />
<br />
A law suspended in the state of exception limits and conditions our agency (legal or otherwise), but using the law as part of a call for human rights at precisely the time ‘we think that (our so called enemies) have taken themselves out of the human community as we know it’ is part of a larger process of internationalism and cultural translation that constructs the global community. This is the only hope we have of interrupting a future re-structured by the state of exception.<br />
BUTLER, 2K4 [Judith; Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley; Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence; New York: Verso; 2004; p. 86-99]<br />
<br />
Our affirmation deconstructs the idea of the law from within. Our gesture is a way of challenging and changing who we are (as subjects) in relation to the law. Such acts of thought open up a new form of international subjectivity that is impossible under the prevailing frameworks of law that produce an indefinite repetition of the present.<br />
DERRIDA, 2K2 [Jacques; Negotiations; Stanford: Stanford University Press; 2002; p. 236-241]
