1. Schell game – there’s a nuclear war waiting around the corner. The DA is a fabricated political excuse to do the less difficult but less effective option – that’s Orfield<br />
<br />
2. Permanent underclass – a solvency deficit means <em>real people</em> – segregation creates unemployment – Blanchett<br />
<br />
3. Intent – the counterplan assumes that <em>trying</em> to solve racism is sufficient – this upholds binary risk assessment where is just yes/no question – that’s powell<br />
<br />
4. DA is written by structural conservatism<br />
<br />
5. risk segregation – the neg segregates the decision about the plan from other political decisions by assuming that the DA always and inevitably results from the plan<br />

<strong>Case outweighs business</strong><br />
Nuclear war is always around the corner – DA is a fabricated political excuse to do the less difficult and less effective option. Brown proves the need to prioritize the substance of a solvency deficit over politically expedient risk – that’s Orfield<br />
<br />
Permanent underclass—a solvency deficit means <em>real people</em>—that’s Blanchett. Politics should be about things that matter in peoples’ lives, not protecting privileged people from nuclear war.<br />
<br />
Risk is a political construction to uphold the dominant order<br />
Mythen 2004 <em>Ulrich Beck: A Critical Introduction to Risk Society</em>, pg 172<br />
As laid bare in Chapter 4 … administrators of happiness for a life to which nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Risk segregation—the neg segregates the plan from other political decisions by assuming the DA inevitably results from the plan. We don’t have to make binary choices – vote aff to desegregate risk.<br />
<br />
Inevitability – segregation leads to material deprivation and extermination, turning the DA – that’s Kenn. Nuclear war is inevitable because racism makes violence possible – that’s Tusabe and Weinstein<br />

THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE MILLIKEN V. BRADLEY (418 U.S. 717(1974)) BY RULING THAT PLAINTIFFS DO NOT NEED TO PROVE DE JURE SEGREGATION IN EDCATIONAL INTEGRATION LITIGATION WITH THE SPECIAL JUSTIFICATION THAT INTEGRATION HAS PROVEN UNWORKABLE WITHOUT INCLUSION OF SUBURBAN DISTRICTS.<br />
<br />
Case<br />
Overruling milliken ensures balanced integration – no risk of backlash or forced assimilation. Richard Thompson Ford, Stanford Law Review, July 1997, “This is a serious objection and deserves a careful”<br />
<br />
Normal means is incentives for desegregation, not busing. Gary Orfield, July 2k1, Schools More Separate, online “Desegregation levels for African Americans…magnet schools.”<br />
<br />
Normal means not busing. Christine H. Rossell, School Desegregation in the 21st Century, p. 68-9, “Green thus marked the end…been declared unitary.”<br />
<br />
Busing not permissible, but many other options. Thomson Legal Records, No Date, “US Constitution: Fourteenth Amendment” findlaw.com “Because current attendance patterns”<br />
<br />
Nuclear Deal 2ac<br />
Deal delayed until after lame duck then amended, kills deal. YP Rajesh, Reuters, 11-8, “we have repeatedly said we won’t allow”<br />
<br />
Bush is a lame duck. Telegraph, 11-11-6, House Bound, www.telegraphindia.com “Bush has been rendered lame by the”<br />
<br />
Their ev. assumes busing – plan is popular. Gary Orfield, July 2k1, Schools More Separate, online “there was a clear majority of white parents whose”<br />
<br />
Housing CP 2AC<br />
The I/It relationship precludes dialogue and risks annihilation. G. Tusabe, 1995, Social Reconstruction in Africa, online, “With regard to the co-existent character…levels of development.”<br />
<br />
Contact – A. the cp leads to proximity without contact, causing backlash. Jeffrey Dixon, Social Forces 84.4, muse, “According to group threat theory, a sizable minority population living”<br />
<br />
B. Plan key to contact – ensures ppl of different races actually interact in classroom.<br />
<br />
C. CP only integrates adults without kids – schools stay segregated. Nancy Denton, <em>In Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy</em>, p. 100-1 “By specifying the dynamic… complementary fashion.”<br />
<br />
D. Education funding – the cp trades off. Research Policy News, Aug/Sept 1999, “Education Appropriations Forecast” “if the appropriations situation does not change”<br />
<br />
The cp is inherently unstable. Maurice Munroe, Albany Law Review 2k “Today, prejudice continues to maintain segregation”<br />
<br />
Perm do the cp. Gary Orfield, <em>In Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy</em>, p.143-4 “Possible Uses of Housing Policy…integrated communities.”<br />
<br />
The cp overrules milliken. Derrick Bell, Race, Racism and American Law, 2k4 p. 353-4 “In an opinion written…to the present case.”<br />
<br />
Perm do both. Only the perm solves – absent the plan, the cp is rolled back. Raina Brubaker, Case Western Res., Winter 1996, lexis, “the tension between effective remedies”<br />
<br />
Educational achievement prerequisite to effective neighborhood contact. Keith Ihlanfeldt, and Benjamin Scafidi, 2k2 Urban Studies, V. 29 No. 4 online “We find that neighborhood contact affects”<br />

Court disads 2ac<br />
Controversial rulings now. NYT 10/2/6 “Roberts Court may be defined in second term” “If Year 1 was the transition for the new”<br />
<br />
Turn – Kennedy – if plan moves Roberts to the Right, that will push Kennedy to the left. Charles Franklin, 10-31-5 “Supreme Court will Shift only Slightly Right,” online “The key to any Court is the median voter, the decisive fifth vote”<br />
<br />
Special justification permits overrule under stare decisis. Lauren Vicki Stark, NYU Law Review, Nov. 2k5 “Despite the commands of stare decisis”<br />
<br />
Minimalism 2ac<br />
Plan is minimalist – the plan doesn't universally prescribe integration – leads to case by case solutions based on what is locally appropriate.<br />
<br />
Not unique – Garcetti, Jason Solomon, blog online, 6-7-6 “behind the talk of consensus, narrow holdings and humble”<br />
<br />
No spillover – Roberts will reestablish minimalism after plan. Sheldon Gelman, Geo. L.J., July 2k1, “Because every judge’s opinions have both minimalist”<br />
<br />
Minimalism is inherently conservative – lock in squo. Gelman, Geo. L.J., July 2k1 “Minimalism is different. Where originalism”<br />
<br />
The Nazis had minimalism. Gelman, Geo. L.J., July 2k1 “Deliberative democracy has a critical role in Sunstein’s”<br />
<br />
One overrule doesn't spillover. Thomas Healy, West VA Law Review, 2k1, “I acknowledge that even if stare decisis”<br />
<br />
One overrule doesn't open floodgates. Caleb Nelson, Va. Law Review, 2k1 “In the second situation, however, this fear is less acute.”<br />
