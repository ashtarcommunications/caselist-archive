Observation 1: The Status Quo<br />
THE COURT IS NOT MOVING TO OVERRULE CASEY NOW<br />
Amar and Amar in 2. Akhil and Vikram. “How should the Supreme Court weigh its own precedent?” Dec 13, 2002. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/amar/20021213.html" rel="nofollow">http://writ.news.findlaw.com/amar/20021213.html</a><br />
The most important…overruling the mistake<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey 505 U.S. 833 (1992), holding that requiring minors to obtain parental consent is an “undue burden” on women seeking abortions in the United States.<br />
<br />
Advantage 1: Judicial Bypass<br />
REQUIRING PARENTAL CONSENT DENIES CHOICE. ALLOWING JUDICIAL BYPASS HEARINGS THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF THIS RIGHT OPENS THE DOOR FOR THE STATE TO EQUALLY FORCE WOMEN TO HAVE ABORTIONS. EVEN SO-CALLED “IMMATURE GIRLS” HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CHOOSE<br />
Jamin B. Raskin. 2002. SYMPOSIA: UNBURDENING THE RIGHT TO ABORTION: CASEY’S UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD THE PARADOX OF JUDICIAL BYPASS PROCEEDINGS. American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law.<br />
Intriguingly, if we…defining life choice<br />
<br />
THE “BEST INTEREST” STANDARD BELIES IDEOLOGICAL TYRANNY. UNDER CASEY, JUDGES HAVE THE FINAL CALL TO DETERMINE IF A WOMEN IS “MATURE” ENOUGH TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY. ONLY JUDGES THAT INFUSE THEIR PERSONAL IDEOLOGICAL BIASES WOULD SUPPORT PARENTAL CONSENT PROVISIONS UNDER CASEY<br />
Jamin B. Raskin. 2002. SYMPOSIA: UNBURDENING THE RIGHT TO ABORTION: CASEY’S UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD THE PARADOX OF JUDICIAL BYPASS PROCEEDINGS. American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law.<br />
As a judge…private ideological tyranny<br />
<br />
EVERY INVASION OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY MUST BE REJECTED<br />
Petro 74<br />
<br />
LOOKING FOR THE BEST INTEREST IS IRRELEVANT. JUDICIAL BYPASS HEARINGS EXPLOIT TEENAGE WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE SOCIAL SHAMING, INTRUSIVE PROBING AND OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED HARASSMENT. CASEY PRESENTS A HOSTILE THREAT TO THE MOST VULNERABLE AND EXPOSED GROUPS OF WOMEN. THE PLAN REMOVES THE SCARLETT LETTER ‘A’<br />

If the presence…the female population<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Ageism (only run by ESU FT<br />
THE CREATION OF THE ADULT/CHILD DICHOTOMY ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH THE ADULT IS CONSTITUTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE ‘CHILD’ AND THE ADULT MAINTAINS POWER AND PRIVILEGE OVER THE ‘CHILD’-WE MUST QUESTION THESE BINARIES TO REDEFINE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A ‘CHILD’<br />
Ainsworth 95 (Janet. SYMPOSIUM—STRUGGLING FOR A FUTURE: JUVENILE VIOLENCE, JUVENILE JUSTICE: YOUTH JUSTICE IN A UNIFIED COURT: RESPONSE TO CRITICS OF JUVENILE COURT ABOLITION.)<br />
As I have shown…adult as well<br />
<br />
WE SHOULD REJECT THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CHILD/ADULT DICHOTOMY. AS INTENTIONAL ACTORS WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION.<br />
Ainsworth 91 (Janet. RE-IMAGINING CHILDHOOD AND RECONSTRUCTING THE LEGAL ORDER: THE CASE FOR ABOLISHING THE JUVENILE COURT.)<br />

OVERRULING CASEY GRANTS MINOR’S FREEDOM FROM AGEISM<br />
Elizabeth Scott. “The Legal Construction of Adolescence.” Hofstra Law Review. 2000<br />
These statutes are…of these conditions<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 Dangerous Abortions (only run by ESU DE)<br />
ADVANTAGE 2- DANGEROUS ABORTIONS<br />
<br />
A- DELAY- PARENTAL CONSENT LAWS DELAY ACTION. THIS MAKES WOMEN 100 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO INCUR MAJOR HEALTH DAMAGES AND 11 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE. THE LONGER THE DELAY, THE GREATER THE RISK.<br />
Rachel Weissmann, 2000 (Article: Constitutional Law what “choice” do they have?: protecting pregnant minor’s reproductive rights using state constitutions. Annual Survey of American Law, 1999)<br />
<br />
“the three familiar…later-term abortions.”<br />
<br />
B- PARENTAL CONSENT LAWS JEOPARDIZE WOMEN’S HEALTH, TURNING TO BACK ALLY &amp; SELF-INDUCED ABORTIONS<br />
NARAL, 2005 (“mandatory parental notice and consent laws burden the freedom to choose”. www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/Abortion-Access-to-Abortion-Young-Women-Parental -Consent.pdf)<br />
<br />
“parental consent and choice…for illegal abortion deaths since…1973)<br />
<br />
C- DOCTORS WHO PERFORM ABORTIONS BEFORE ROE V. WADE SEE THE DAYS OF ILLEGAL ABORTIONS ON THE HORIZON. WOMEN SEEKING ABORTIONS WILL RESORT TO EXTREME MEASURES…MANY WILL JEOPARDIZE THEIR LIVES, WHILE OTHERS WILL DIE.<br />
Eric Ferrero, sept. 8, 2005 (www.voiceofchoic.org/publications/press/9_9_05.shtml)<br />
<br />
“in a statement issued…end a pregnancy.”<br />

<br />
Observation 2: Solvency<br />
OVERRULING ON PARENTAL CONSENT IS THE REMEDY FOR ILLEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST AND WREAKS HAVOC ON THE LIVES OF UN-EMANCIPATED MINORS<br />
Berman 94. Leonard. NOTE: PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY: SUPREME NEGLECT FOR UN-EMANCIPATED MINORS’ ABORTION RIGHTS.<br />
The Casey Court…a local judge<br />
<br />
CONFIDENTIALITY IS KEY—INCREASING ACCESS TO ABORTION SERVICES REDUCES DELAYS AND MEDICAL RISKS—EACH WEEK IS KEY<br />

According to Leslie…after eight weeks<br />
<br />
BECAUSE ABORTIONS ARE INEVITABLE, WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE SAFE ACCESS<br />
Boonstra H. et al. “Abortion in Women’s Lives.” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/2006/05/04/AiWL.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/2006/05/04/AiWL.pdf</a><br />
It is likely…cause—unintended pregnancy<br />
<br />
MANDATORY PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT LAWS CAUSE DANGEROUS DELAYS THAT INCREASE RISKS OF LATE-TERM ABORTIONS. LAWS SHOULD ALLOW CONSULTATION WITH A BROADER RANGE OF ACTORS.<br />
Rachel Weissman. 2000. ARTICLE: CONSTITUTIONAL LAW WHAT ‘CHOICE’ DO THEY HAVE?: PROTECTING PREGNANT MINORS’ REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS USING STATE CONSTITUTIONS.<br />
While we may…minor may consult<br />
<br />
MEDICAL RISK OBJECTIONS TO ABORTION ARE RARE, IF NOT IMAGINARY. IN EVERY OTHER CASE, EVERY WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO ABORTION. HOWEVER, CASEY WAS WRITTEN DANGEROUSLY BROAD TO COMPEL CHILDBIRTH OVER THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE. WE SHOULD REMOVE JUDGES AS THE DECISION-MAKERS<br />
Jamin B. Raskin. 2002. SYMPOSIA: UNBURDENING THE RIGHT TO ABORTION: CASEY’S UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD THE PARADOX OF JUDICIAL BYPASS PROCEEDINGS. American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law.<br />

“The highest levels …during the 1990s”<br />
PLAN:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should, after granting writ of certiorari on the next relevant test case, overrule Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974), on the grounds that de jure or de facto segregation constitutes an abrogation of the 14th amendment of the United States Constitution.<br />
ADVANTAGE 1—WALLS<br />
<br />
SEGREGATION REINFORCES RACIST STREREOTYPES—IT HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON ALL STUDENTS, MAKING RACISM SEEM NATURAL AND INEVITABLE—THIS TYPE OF RACISM IS PARTICULARLY PERNICIOUS BECAUSE IT CREATES WALLS THAT REINFORCE THE SELF-CONCEPT ON BOTH SIDES<br />

RACISM WILL ACCELERATE AND RESULT IN VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION OF THE AMERICAN POLITY—EVEN IF THEY WIN A RISK OF A DISADVANTAGE OR SOLVENCY TURN, VOTE AFFIRMATIVE BECAUSE THE PLAN IS AT LEAST A POSITIVE INCREMENTAL CHANGE THAT WILL PREVENT ALL-OUT DESTRUCTION<br />
