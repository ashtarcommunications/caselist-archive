CONTENTION I: WE LIVE IN A WORLD WITH WALLS<br />
<br />
Segregation is on the rise along city limits. Metropolitan areas have become regions to isolate difference suppressing diversity.<br />

“We who support integration would profit by acknowledging… support for integration was hypocritical.”<br />

There are two key reasons that Roe's protections are vital globally –<br />

First, the legal reasoning of the Supreme Court is modeled in other countries providing a framework for reproductive rights – backsliding empowers anti-choice forces and leads to rollbacks.<br />

Observation One: 1972<br />
<br />
Casey's reaffirmation of Roe is an Orwellian illusion signaling the dismantling of strict scrutiny protections for the woman's right to choose an abortion.<br />

Observation Two: The Welfare State<br />
<br />
Globalization is driving a technological sea change in the biopolitical nature of reproductive rights. The question is where we will choose to seat control over procreation, with the state or the individual.<br />

Casey shifts the question of choice to the State. A strong commitment to reproductive privacy is essential to preventing forced sterilization of the &quot;undesirable&quot; at the fringes of legal discourse.<br />

<br />
The effect of the shift to state control can best be seen in the racist eugenics of the welfare system which coerces poor and minority women into sacrificing their right to control their bodies. Deemed unfit to parent these women are left isolated outside the political discourse of reproduction.<br />

Observation Five: Back to the Basics<br />

Additionally, the Supreme Court is the only potential actor – EVEN IF circuit courts had independent lawmaking ability to enact plan, other courts would still follow the hierarchal chain of precedent – multiple reasons<br />
