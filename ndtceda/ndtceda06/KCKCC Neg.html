Judge Comments: Aff doing more work on how they turn the Agamben criticism. No answer to pragmatic action, other than it still links. Not sure what the alternative looks like, the plan is crystal clear in what they are doing, and it may not deconstruct all of it, but they are able to articulate how they are the only hope we have in terms of specificity.<br />
<br />
Victimization K<br />
Black identity focuses on victimization – this war mentality magnifies oppression – we must reject collective identities and embrace individual initiative.<br />
Shelby Steele, The Content of our Character: A new Vision of Race in America. 1990<br />
“The point is… of its individuals.”<br />
<br />
The problem is not racism or school funding – black scholastic underachievement due to a cultural disincentive towards education.<br />
John McWhorter, Losing the Race: Self Sabatoge in Black America, 2000<br />
“Despite affirmative action… of serious consideration.”<br />
<br />
Alternative: We cannot let the collective subsume the individual – our victimization and subjective correlatives – regarding black oppression misplaces responsibility on society.<br />
Shelby Steele, The Content of our Character: A new Vision of Race in America. 1990<br />
“Whether a stigmatized… of our individuals.”<br />
<br />
Agamben<br />
Rights that are won further entrench us into the biopolitical order, pushing democracy to totalitarianism.<br />
Giorgio Agamben 1998<br />
<br />
The sovereign locks people within the sphere of bare life, where they are excluded from any kind of belonging and vulnerable to any kind of violence.<br />
Giorgio Agamben 1998<br />
<br />
Reject the affirmative to create a space between ourselves and the law.<br />
Giorgio Agamben 2005, state of exception<br />
<br />
Overrule Specification<br />
<br />
FIRST OFF CASE IS O-SPEC<br />
<br />
1ST THE AFF. HAS TO SPECIFY IN THE PLAN TEXT HOW THEY OVERTURN Milliken v Bradley<br />
<br />
2ND IS THE VIOLATION:<br />
THEY DON’T SPECIFY HOW MILLIKEN V BRADLEY GETS OVERTURNED IN FRONT OF THE COURT. THEIR SPECIFICATION OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OR GRANTING CERT TO A TEST CASE IS KEY TO OUR STRATEGY BECAUSE IT’S NECESSARY FOR COUNTERPLAN AND DISAD GROUND. THEY DON’T SPECIFY CERT OR JUDICIAL REVIEW.<br />
<br />
<br />
3RD ARE THE REASONS TO VOTE NEGATIVE:<br />
1ST IS GROUND—OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS LITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE PLAN IS THE ONLY WAY FOR US TO HAVE GROUND IN THE DEBATE. WE DON’T KNOW IF THEY CALL A TEST CASE BEFORE THE COURT AND IF THEY DO WHAT TEST CASE IT IS. OUR COUNTERPLAN GROUND GETS HIJACKED. ADDITIONALLY WE DON’T GET TO RUN JUDICIAL ACTIVISM OR JUDICIAL REVIEW DISADS SINCE THE PLAN DOESN’T ACT ON A CASE BEFORE THE COURT.<br />
2nd IS DEBATABILITY—WE HAVE NO WAY TO ACCESS CASE SPECIFIC LITERATURE AGAINST THEIR 1AC SOLVENCY WHEN THE PLAN DOESN’T SPECIFY HOW THE COURT EVEN RETHINKS MILLIKEN V BRADLEY. THE PLAN HAS TO ARTICULATE HOW THE COURT OVERTURNS MILLIKEN V BRADLEY FOR US TO GET CASE SPECIFIC NEGATIVE.<br />
<br />
<br />
IT’S A VOTING ISSUE FOR GROUND, DEBATABILITY AND COMPETITIVE EQUITY.<br />

1NC Offcase Arguments:<br />
Be as detailed as possible. Just saying &quot;Topicality&quot; isn't particularly helpful. There needs to be some indication as to what the violation is. Try to include an outline of each argument that includes a tag for every card. Whenever you hear an argument that you have not previously heard, you should get complete cites for that argument and include them here.<br />
Performance bad<br />
Switch side debate good<br />
Black Identity Victimization (integration kills modern definition of black identity which is key to solving for minority education) (they claim the blacks need to help themselves, the tour helping turns them into victims)<br />
