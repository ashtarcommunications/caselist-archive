2ac doesn’t separate arguments (tells judges to flow them all as one)<br />
We want to create an open space- everything is not divisible, 1ac says we should become and create identity and challenge, we should restore the pathos of existence, some of the norms (like flowing) is not really a best way to be<br />
Two ways we change- Crisis and Catastrophe<br />
Our world is a cancer, it’s a self replication of itself<br />
All hail the radical actions; our reproduction means we must look at the two sides of ourselves- the debate world is incestuous.<br />
We must value becoming- there is no self I should know. Debate is headed for a catastrophe, we should divert it to a Crisis.<br />
Debate tries to exchange itself, talking fast just makes people think we are ditzy.<br />
Push debate towards a crisis- restore a balance to the activity. Push it towards an activity of nothingness, fairness doesn’t mean participate in a game.<br />
No standards in 1ac are reasons to reject affirmative.<br />
Inversion of the values we’ll indicate that aligning with reason and rationality is flawed- we need a dual space, ballot has no meaning- the 1ac creates a rupture<br />
Charles ev- we don’t escape virtuality<br />
Conceded 1ac, world not a linear process<br />
Baudrillard 2002<br />
Gender equality- certain crises need addressed people are raped now, you don’t change anything with your conscious building, change never comes because we’re focused on the idea of change so we try to reorder the matrix of this, we must step outside the ideologies of capitalism<br />
1ac is only about debate; no question of whether gender equality is a truth- what about transgender? They oversimplify, they totalize, and exclude individuals, and return to haunt your kind of equal ethics<br />
This is capitalist because you want us to fight materialist oppression, liberation is flawed, all autonomies, freedom of circulation is formed. Violent history is history.<br />
Reconstructing the real is capitalist (answers Vine)<br />
Exchange my freedom for your freedom is flawed.<br />
We don’t deny concrete suffering; conceded system has types of agency.<br />
1NC serves to function as an apology<br />

<br />
Observation One: Dr. Feelgood<br />
<u><strong>Motherhood has always been a colonized concept, and today the womb continues to be a key site of colonization by a plethora of actors, agents and social forces. The colonizers of the womb are not adversaries who wage war against each other in an effort to individually secure the womb as a bio-geographical territory of their own, but rather allies which form inter-related systems of domination in order to uniquely oppress womyn across all intersections of the social body. We begin with a story; or rather two divergent stories of pregnancy which stem from different locations, follow different trajectories, and conclude in different abuses – yet share a similar theme of oppression.</strong></u><br />
<u><strong>Ehrenreich 1993</strong> (Nancy, Assistant Professor of Law, University of Denver College of Law. B.A., 1974, Yale University; J.D., 1979, University of Virginia; L.L.M., 1982, University of Virginia. THE COLONIZATION OF THE WOMB. Duke Law Journal. December, 1993)</u><br />
<u><strong>Underlying each of these stories of oppression we find a conception of hegemonic power which acts positively rather than negatively in producing the reality of oppression in each of the stories. One story of power is subtle and indirect, while the other is deployed in ideological terms, hence making it more obvious being that it is implemented through direct force. In the context of pregnancy, modern medicine constructs a medical model of reproduction which power cumulates in the act of the cesarean section.</strong></u><br />
<u><strong>Ehrenreich 1993</strong> (Nancy, Assistant Professor of Law, University of Denver College of Law. B.A., 1974, Yale University; J.D., 1979, University of Virginia; L.L.M., 1982, University of Virginia. THE COLONIZATION OF THE WOMB. Duke Law Journal. December, 1993)</u><br />
<u><strong>Cesarean sections have become the total embodiment of standard and legitimate medical birthing practices. The medical model of reproduction constructs a “normal” vision of pregnancy founded upon notions of technocratic and scientific rationality; ceding unquestionable Truth, knowledge and power over the physical body to medical authority under the guise of expertise. This model of reproduction asserts pregnancy to be a “pathological” disease managed through self-sacrificial gestures to the dominant ideology of interlocking white supremacy, patriarchy and capitalism. Failure to offer this gesture of consent to a cesarean section is viewed as irresponsible, hysterical and dangerous on behalf of the “bad mother” labeled according to the western dualisms employed by the medical model. This act of resistance in refusing to submit to a physician’s call for a cesarean section justifies overt coercion in the form of court-ordered cesarean sections issued from the legal system which derives its power from the same claims of objectivity, neutrality and Truth as modern medicine. Not only do these court-ordered cesarean sections represent a unique form of violence against the individual womyn subjected to the specific violation, but this act of judicial deference to medical authority creates a mutually reinforcing system of oppression which simultaneously reifies the legitimacy of both Law and Medicine. Placing the power of the state behind medical Truth creates a medico-legal juggernaut of bio-political control which obscures race, class, and gender oppression in denying individual resistance and alternatives to the hegemony of medico-legal tyranny with a mask of objectivity and neutrality. All of this was first made possible with the 1973 ruling of Roe v. Wade.</strong></u><br />
<u><strong>Ehrenreich 1993</strong> (Nancy, Assistant Professor of Law, University of Denver College of Law. B.A., 1974, Yale University; J.D., 1979, University of Virginia; L.L.M., 1982, University of Virginia. THE COLONIZATION OF THE WOMB. Duke Law Journal. December, 1993)</u><br />
<u><strong>Unfortunately, the Casey decision did nothing to alter this situation. While the decision increased restrictions on abortion, with provisions such as the 24 hour waiting period and informed consent, none of this applies in the context of Cesarean sections. Casey’s central holding which reaffirms Roe’s essential holding that the State has legitimate interest in the protecting the health of the womyn and fetus remains legitimate law.</strong></u><br />
<u><strong>Levine 1994</strong> (Eric M. B.S. from the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, and is a J.D. candidate at Albany Law School of Union University, Albany, New York. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF <a name="ORIGHIT_1"></a><a name="HIT_1"></a>COURT ORDERED CESAREAN SURGERY: A THRESHOLD QUESTION. Albany Law Journal of Science &amp; Technology)</u><br />
<strong>Plan:</strong><br />
<u><strong>The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (505 U.S. 833), ruling that the state has no legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child, on the grounds that court-ordered cesarean sections violate a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause in denying a competent individual's constitutional right to refuse treatment.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<strong>OBSERVATION 2- NO CLEVER TITLE...WE'LL CALL IT SOLVENCY__</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Plan issues from an alternatively informed set of understandings of the world that medicine claims to know. Viewing reproduction as a realm of social struggle, our act presents a revolutionary challenge to firmly entrenched distributions of power and static sets of meaning. Plan does not reproduce Truth, Law or a correct model of birthing; but merely opens a space for alternative conceptions of reproduction to emerge by disabling law in the direct enforcement of medical Truth. Within this realm, the refusal of a C-Section can serve both as an act of individual resistance and one of self-preservation in the fight for survival against the forces of patriarchy, capitalism and racism.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Ehrenreich 1993</strong> (Nancy, Assistant Professor of Law, University of Denver College of Law. B.A., 1974, Yale University; J.D., 1979, University of Virginia; L.L.M., 1982, University of Virginia. THE COLONIZATION OF THE WOMB. Duke Law Journal. December, 1993)<br />
<br />
<strong>We can overcome the hegemonic medico-legal juggernaut of patriarchy, capitalism and racism only by situating resistance across all fault lines, recognizing the mutually reinforcing nature of interlocking systems of oppression, and taking action which allow individuals to escape oppression. Failure to embrace a direct challenge to court-ordered cesarean sections allows us to be seduced into accepting the medico-legal picture of reality where coercion can always be justified and simultaneously shielded from recognition. This guarantees alternative strategies will be suppressed with naked power as we are lulled into complacency with oppressive dominant ideology.</strong><br />
