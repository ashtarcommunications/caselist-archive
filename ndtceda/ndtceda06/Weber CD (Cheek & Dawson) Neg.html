The aff is an attempt to shit politics from a management by state to a management of associations. The plurality of associations drives the sovereignty of decision underground and un-limits its potential for violence<br />
William Rasch, “Conflict as Vocation: Carl Schmitt and the Possibility of Politics”, 2k<br />
“But beyond merely replicating…..criminalizes opposition.”<br />
B. Their solution to terrorism and torture is a liberal extension of the human rights regime that invokes universal humanity. The enemy here is stripped of all political value and transformed into an inhuman enemy that can be completely annihilated<br />
Louiza Odysseos, 04, “Carl Schmitt and Martin Heidegger on the Line(s) of Cosmopolitanism and the War on Terror”, p 18-21<br />
“The second criticism…humanity and cosmopolitanism.”<br />
Overruling Quirin is the wet dream of liberalists who seek FINAL CONFLICT TO END ALL WAR. The perpetual peace of their cosmopolitanism only produces a new enemy by creating a category of non-political persons ensuring their total destruction.<br />
Odysseos, 4<br />
“This section examines….no more resistance.”<br />
The denial of the enmity creates a dangerous universalism that enables wars to be waged in the name of humanity; the elimination of conflict can only end in the elimination of politics of difference<br />
Tracy B Strong, Forweward to Carl Schmitt’s Concept of the Politics trans. George Schwab, U of Chicago Press, 96<br />
“Schmitt insists…is mixed.”<br />
The alterntive is to reject the aff by embracing a politics of enmity. This enables a more robust conception of tolerance and political rights informed by resistance. A true democracy must paradoxically embrace anti-democratic outcomes. Any other mode of democracy only paces the way for tyranny<br />

Pacifism gurantees annihilation<br />
Carl Schmitt, 996, “The Conept of the Politica;”, p 51-53<br />
“Where this distinction…..people will disappear.”<br />
The alternative signals a return to concrete, political enmity. Exposing and identifying the political other makes all enemies a lawful and equal participant in politics whereby peace can be made and war is limited, rendering unnecessary he abstract enemy in the war on terrorism that makes war permanent and potential enemies of everyone.<br />
Mikkel Thorup, 06, “In Defense of Enmity- Crituqes of Liberal Globalism”, p 300-3<br />
“Schmitt saw political….black holes etc.”The aff’s fixatinoo on survival makes the exclusion of all life possible, this internal link turns their aff<br />

The affirmative avoids the supreme political question of our time. what caused the holocaust? the modern era is scarred by the atrocities committed in the camp. the mere existence of the holocaust necessitates an endless interogation of our responsibility to committ to a politics of &quot;nerver again&quot; by understanding the discreet functions that make genocide possible. the 1ac is an act of denial that seeks to trivialize and forget. only an engagement of the causes of the holocaust can truly reconcile the violence of modernity. First, collectivism and self sacrifice caused the holocaust<br />

First, the 1ac is structured through the technologies of capitalism; their call for rights is situated in an ethic of justice that intensifies capitalist atrocity by failing to liberate desire. only an ethic of forgiveness can heal desire and counter the capitalist discipline.<br />

in the effort to...savage capialist.<br />
<br />
and, justice is at the core of the capitalist discipline, acting to restore balance by countering injustice with equal force, ignoring that we cannot erase injustice, we cant take away the atrocitieis at auschwitz or pretend that stalin didnt kill 20 million people. this irreversibility means that Justice is only a tool to get what is due<br />
