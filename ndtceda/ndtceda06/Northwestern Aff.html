Contention 1- the fallacy of local autonomy<br />
<br />
The 1974 Milliken decision created an urbanization model based on the rubric of local control—this relationship to jurisdiction inverted historic responsibility and created a narrative of white flight which creates the suburbs as autonomous regions which are “natural” enclaves for whites- as natural as racism<br />
Richard T. Ford, prof of law, Feb 99 (97 Mich L. Rev. 843)<br />
<br />
[*918] This use of… of revisionists squirm.<br />
<br />
Sharply demarcated “ethnic space’ in cities like Chicago make the neighborhoods we walk in seem autonomous, self determined, and entirely responsible for their fate- - This process of historic amnesia makes us aware of the multiplicities of differences while being blind to the way geographies of jurisdiction spatially and socially structure our lives- the city/suburb binary is the new American Apartheid<br />

Contention 2- the Institution<br />
Social expectations, vocabularies and imaginaries determine legal demands and how jurisdictional lines operate- Current institutional restreatin and jurisdictional fetishism creates a model of citizenship that is fundamentally passive<br />

Instead we need to use law to expose the history and continuous project of institutional punishment-<br />
Only the Supreme Court shapes the capacity of individuals to make meaning- determining models of relational and individual identity formation<br />

Answers To Off Case Args<br />
2AC Answers to Minimalistm:<br />
1. Case proves this is wrong—restrained judiciary is what sustains global sacrifice—unger evidence<br />
2. Rights turn—milliken will cause the overrule of brown—plan solves—Michael W. Combs, 1993 (36 How L.J. 139); “Overall, following the Milliken…Rehnquist led Supreme Court”<br />
3. Supreme Court has never reversed a right—collapse of legitimacy now<br />
4. Enforcing desegregation rights key—Peter M. Shane, U.Pitt. 1998, (Law and Contemporary Problems, V61 No21, Summer, Google); “Moreover, courts are targeted for scathing…interbranch intimidation”<br />
5. Major overrules important—Calabresi 2006, (55 ala. L. rev. 635); “I submit that the cases…practices and heresies are tossed aside”<br />
6. Brown proves that court desegregation opinions breathes life into our domestic and international democracy commitments—Brief of the Coalition to defend affirmative action…Bamn and UEAALDF in support of respondents, 10.10.2006; Nos 05-908, 05-915, in the supreme court of the u.s. parents involved in community schools v seattle school district no. 1 and Meredith v. Jefferson county board of education, etal, online; “Fifty years ago, this Court’s decision in Brown…inherently unequal education…”<br />
7. Only rejecting SCOTUS restraint redirects the impacts of globalization—Chantal Thomas, 33 U.C. Davis. L. Rev. 1451, “Over the past decade…globalization on poor urban minorities….policy in the globalization era”<br />
8. Unchecked neoliberalism destroys global demoracy and creates perpetual war—Henry Giroux, Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, 26.2; “In the United States, a silent war is being waged…force for a substantive democracy”<br />
<br />
2AC AT: Counterplan<br />
1. Socioeconomic status is inadequate and disgenuous—most recent studies supporting it and resegregation patterns prove—Brief of the Council of the Great City Schools Magnet Schools of America, Public Education Network, United States Conference of Mayors and San Francisco Unified School District as Amici Curiae in Support of Respondents, 10.10.06, No. 05-908… “Petitioners and their amici….orders terminating desegregation orders<br />
2. No integration scheme succeed without race as a tool—Kurt L. Schmoke, and Dark, and Francois, and Black, 10.10.06, No2. 05-908; submitted as amicus in support of respondents in parents involved in community schools v. seattle school district no. 1. and Meredith v Jefferson county board…. “the threat of school segregation….racial diversity”<br />
3. Failure to use race based remedies perpetuates white flight and residential segregation—Association of the Bar of City of New York, 10.10.06, same cite, online; “Nor is it feasible…such an imbalance”<br />
4. Socioeconomic criteria inadequate to produce racial diversity—recent studies prove-same cite “Recent analyses of school districts….race-neutral plan”<br />
5. Turn—lower court rollback—Milliken precedent has a chilling effect on lower court remedial capacity—Paul Gewirtz, Asso. Prof. of Law at Yale, Marche, 1983, 92 Yale L. J. 585, l/n; “Beyond its practical significance….flight were not a problem….an entire world must be remade…..judge will be driven at least to consider ceilings”<br />
6. CP is the status quo—milliken forced state constitional remedies to lead deseg—they’ve failed—Myron Orfield, 24 Law and Ineq J. 269, l/n “The recent half-century anniversaries…racism that rarely exists in reality”<br />
7. State courts alone are ineffective—Temple Political and Civil Rights Law Review, Fall 1999, Vol 9 No 1, Lisa M. Fairfax; “However, there are limits…compliance with Brown”<br />
<br />
2AC AT: K of Civil Rights<br />
1. No link—EP clause doesn’t simply provide protection on the basis of race—Fernandez proves—Ian Lopez, Calif. Law Review, Oct. 1997, 85 Calif. L. Rev. 1143; “With the additional assistance…in Jackson County”<br />
2. Can’t solve any of the case—denying race means denying remedies—Ian Lopez, 1997, 85 Calif. L. Rev. 1143; “It is worthwhile to disaggregate….confirms Latino/a inferiority”<br />
3. Perm—solvency—we don’t need to reject the idea that groups have been racialized to dispense with the concept of race as a means of conceptualizing groups—same cite; “For those who would attempt….his recent editorial”<br />
4. Race concscious multiculturalism actively precludes recognition of institutionally sponsored racism—Richard T. Ford, 47 UCLA L. Rev. 1803, “Worse yet, the goals of the reformed…disparate impact arguments”<br />
5. Cultural identity rights reduce racial subordination to a matter of hurt feelings—Same cite ‘many cultural identity rights…of the minority group”<br />

2AC Framework<br />
No impact- there arg is just to look at impacts our aff clearly outweighs- extinction is inevitable in a world where we refuse to make political commitments to stop perpetual social/spatial fragmentation and sacrifice- Giroux evidence<br />
Plan is prerequisite- making good decisions about integration is impossible in the status quo framework- our attachment to jurisdiction blinds us to the material and cultural cuases of segregation- necessarily limits response capacity- ford and unger ev<br />
The neg misunderstands how court decsionmaking works- while the courts decisions materially impact geographic space failure to evaluate how legal language sanctions segregation makes those impact inevitable- ford ev.<br />
This is a reason to vote aff- a visionary response is the only way to create genuine social justice/democracy- accesses you impacts- mccann, depaolotino and unger ev- mor ev- Unger ‘96<br />
“Lawyers have pictured law as reason….realists we must make ourselves into visionaries”<br />

“the current mantra of those” “eliminated is its success”<br />

ELEVATING UNIFORMED SOLDIERS AS PRIVILEGED COMBATANTS SERVES A DUAL PURPOSE – IT EVISCERATES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE CARRYING OUT VIOLENCE ON BEHALF OF NATION STATES WHILE REIFYING THE SOVEREIGN’S MONOPOLY OF FORCE.<br />

Congress<br />

Congressional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus still allows for judicial review<br />
Ekeland, 2005 (74 Fordham L. Rev. 1475)<br />
Habeas corpus did not emerge newborn… …surveyed in this Note. n343<br />
<br />
The CP does not prevent court intrusion into war making authority more broadly – this intervention collapses hegemony<br />
McKaig 2005 (Campbell law review, 28 Campbell L. Rev. 23)<br />

Non unique – Hamdi<br />
Siegel 2005, 103 Mich. L. Rev. 1951<br />
These are all different accounts… …appears to be in play<br />
<br />
This is methodologically flawed – Sunstein cherrypicks from 1 percent of all Supreme Court decisions inflating his results<br />
Siegel 2005, 103 Mich. L. Rev. 1951<br />
This spacious account of judicial… …the Court’s institutional position.<br />
<br />
Minimalism has no empirical backing<br />
Siegel 5, 103 Mich. L. Rev. 1951<br />
Similarly, viewing democratic deliberation… … theory of rights.<br />

Lawrence makes your disads non-unqiue – the Court decided a major decision with no respect for stare decisis<br />
Peterson April 2004 (37 Creighton L. Rev. 653)<br />
Finally, the Court did not properly utilize the scheme it established… …its own legitimacy<br />
<br />
This triggers the link to your legitimacy disad<br />
Ensign June 2006 (81 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1137)<br />
The second external argument… …unable to explain it.<br />
<br />
Non unique an dturn – extend katayal and Tribe<br />
A) The court has explicitly overruled itself<br />
B) No stare decision justification for Quirin<br />
<br />
And this type of overrule is critical to legitimacy<br />
Linton, 1993 (13 St. Louis U. Pub. L. Rev. 15<br />
The Court describes this first… …damage that credibility<br />
<br />
Our turns outweigh their link – failure to overrule political and arbitrary decisions causes.<br />
Pittman, 2002 (53 Ala. L. Rev. 789, Spring)<br />
However, as a critique of stare decisis… …more easily overruled.n150<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
2AC<br />
1) Social imagination of the Supreme Court as an institution that can produce educational and social equity solves the offense<br />
<br />
2) Aristotle does not advocate using ethos, pathos, and Lagos as tools to evaluate who debated better. They are simply mechanism that we inherently use to determine the quality of arguments. You should not evaluate 2/3 to determine who wins.<br />
<br />
3) MLK (I have a dream) illustrates how social imagination solves<br />
<br />
4) Research about Milliken decision is a method to achieve multicultural education (Allows to see differing perspectives and opens the eyes to social disparity)<br />
<br />
5) Louisville doesn’t solve institutional racism. The affirmative is the only advocacy that will produce social change.<br />
<br />
6) Plan = the brick by brick change that Barndt wants<br />
<br />
7) Without overturning the Milliken decision, we revert to the Plessy v. Ferguson era in which blacks were lynched and beaten<br />
a) Social inequality stories of the pre-Brown era<br />
b) You can’t tell me that the past 40 years have not been better than pre Brown<br />
<br />
8) a) The plan and our act of imagination are important -The distancing of Constitutional theory from the actual practice of lawyers and judges creates a divide between the academy and the law---your rearticulation of the law will never be translated into any meaningful legal change<br />
b) This marks the end of progressive change--- the most defining element of the alternative is its extreme correlation to the jurisprudence to Scalia---your project, , will leave actual policy decisions in the hands of the extreme right-wing<br />
J. M. Balkin, law at University of Texas, June 1992 (90 Mich. L. Rev. 1966)<br />
<br />
10) Extension of Welch 99 – Only the rhetoric of “hope” can produce change. The negative’s pessimistic rhetoric prevents policy changes.<br />
<br />
11) Counter Narrative<br />
a) African- American male from College Park, Georgia (90% black city)<br />
b) Worst Elementary School in county (Through Minority to Majority Program, able to change schools and be placed in an academic environment that was more conducive to my learning ability<br />
c) Father died at age 10, raised by mother, whose endorsement of multicultural education was able to “open my mind”<br />
d) Why should we value the struggles of the negative over those of mine<br />
<br />
12) There is no impact to not voting for Louisville<br />
<br />
13) Privileging ethos, pathos, or lagos over each other allows for the rise of someone like Hitler who excelled ethos and pathos. This justifies the persecution of Jewish people and the Holocaust.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
RFD:<br />
1) Judge conception of evaluation is inherently based on ethos, pathos, and logos<br />
2) Hitler argument<br />
3) Case offense (Unger, Welch, and Ford evidence) Case produces social transformation<br />
