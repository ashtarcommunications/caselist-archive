CERD CP: Text:<br />
<br />
The United States Congress should implement the Convention on the<br />
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination by legislating a<br />
prohibition of educational tracking and requiring interdistrict<br />
remedies, when needed, to remedy de jure and/or de facto school<br />
segregation. The Department of Education should cease federal<br />
educational assistance to districts refusing to comply. School district<br />
compliance should be monitored and enforced by the Department of<br />
Education's Office of Civil Rights. The Office of Civil Rights should<br />
submit an annual report on United State' compliance to the Committee on<br />
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The CERD prohibits both de jure and de fact school segregation. It can<br />
easily be applied to remedy inadequate educational opportunities<br />

<br />
A couple of times we read that DA with a CP to do the civil remedy at the state level<br />
<br />
Emory HH<br />
<br />
They read case turns - on Domestic Violence - the gender animus<br />
requirement in the VAWA suits reinforces the stereotype that DV occurs<br />
only when men hate women, which is too narrow; on Hate Crimes - hate<br />
crime laws cause greater enforcement against minorities and divide<br />
minority solidarity; hate crimes will cause a heirarchy of punishment<br />
to be created. They have a solvency argument that poor women won't get<br />
to sue because they are generally beaten by poor men so lawyers won't<br />
take the cases since they can't win big awards.<br />
<br />
CP to Overrule Morrison but require the CR cases be filed in state<br />
courts, but using the federal standards, causes of action etc; the CP<br />
also says that Morrison is distinguished from Hate Crimes laws.<br />
<br />
DA - State Courts - States currently effectively hear citizen<br />
environmental suits, the plan causes the Federalization of crime which<br />
causes a shift away from State courts; environmental suits are key to<br />
biodiversity<br />
<br />
DA - SC Legitimacy - judicial independence impact, diseases - this was<br />
not a net benefit to the CP - the link was overrule.<br />
<br />
New 2NC arguments - (1) the plan would trade off FBI resources with<br />
solving child trafficking (slavery impact); (2) federal judges are more<br />
biased than state judges, they care about other stuff post 9/11 and<br />
won't prioritize the VAWA suits; CWA scenario for extinction - Gulf of<br />
Mexico (this is just an impact extension off of the original<br />
environment impact).<br />
<br />
<strong>The CP was run dispositionally, the Aff straight turned the CP and<br />
didn't make any answers to the Legitimacy DA in the 2AC. The neg<br />
didn't try to go for the DA.<br />

<br />
we read morrison, gender violence. they read a counterplan to do the federal civil rights remedy in state courts- the solvency cards were really good. the net-benefits were a court-clog d/a with a terrorism impact and a litigation shift d/a with a biodiversity impact. the first da posited that court clog in federal courts would divert resources aware from war on terror cases and lead to the release of terrorist suspects. the second da argued that people would stop using the state courts for esa suits because of the CRR and that esa suits were key to solve biodiversity.<br />
they went for the cp and both das- the rest of the 1nc were generic case arguments.<br />

Text: In the next relevant test case, the United States Supreme Court should limit its decision in U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), to its facts by determining that gender violence in the aggregate does not have a substantial affect on interstate commerce. The Court should further rule that a rational basis test is the appropriate test when evaluating challenges to Congress’s authority to regulate under the Commerce Clause. The test should permit regulation when Congress has a rational basis to conclude that the regulated activity in the aggregate has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The Court will use this test to uphold the Endangered Species Act and deny subject matter limitations on treaty power.<br />

Overrule means to rule directly opposite of the earlier decision and remove its authority as precedent<br />
West’s Encyclopedia of American Law 2005 (p340 – Gale Virtual Reference Library, v7 2nd ed)<br />
OVERRULE<br />
The refusal by a judge to sustain an objection set forth by an attorney during a trial, such as an objection to a particular question posed to a witness. To make void, annul, supersede, or reject through a subsequent decision or action.<br />
A judicial decision is overruled when a later decision, made by the same tribunal or a higher court in the same system, hands down a decision concerning the identified QUESTION OF LAW, which is in direct opposition to the earlier decision. The earlier decision is thereby overruled and deprived of its authority as precedent.<br />
<br />
Not OR the earlier one if on different grounds<br />

On Cato they said that the value to life and valuing lives meant avoiding extinction and that Cato is irrelevant if the aff causes more violence (against individuals)<br />
<br />
On case they went for we need to kill terrorists, they’re going to attack us, they don’t care about civilians like the US does, and they will likely cause extinction (Alexander + Easterbrook)<br />
<br />
On images they said that their images of terrorist victims and people dieing accessed Wayne’s Butler analysis<br />

Then they went for war on terror is effective, displacing Taliban/Sadaam was good – people were starving, refugees, etc.<br />

NORMATIVE LEGAL THOUGHT KRITIK<br />
<br />
A. THE AFFIRMATIVE ENGAGES IN NORMATIVE LEGAL THOUGHT MAKING IT 1) INSOLVENT BECAUSE NOBODY FROM THE USSC IS BEING REPRESENTED IN THIS ROUND AND 2) DESTROY THE THOUGHT PROCESS USED BY NEVER BEING ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM NORMATIVE THOUGHT<br />

“Moreover, just as every social problem…….set in the state judicial arena”<br />
<br />
Judicial Federalism Das<br />
Domestic Violence training for decision makers in the civil system is key to break down the public private dichotomy<br />
Atkins, et all, 99 (Daniel G., spring, 14 wi. Women’s L.J. 69, Striving for justice with the violence against women act and civil tort action” lexis)<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, as long as judges…..victims of domestic violence.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nationalism and localism are inherently mutually exclusive – cooperative federalism screws both<br />
Greve, John G. Searle Scholar, American Enterprise Institute: Ph.D. in government from Cornell, 2000 (Michael S., 70 Miss. L.J. 557 lexis)<br />
<br />
Around 1980, the cooperative consensus gave way to a …… serious obstacles to the successful implementation o intergovernmental programs…<br />
<br />
<br />
Cooperative federalism destroys political accountability<br />
Greve, John G. Searle Scholar, American Enterprise Institute: Ph.D. in government from Cornell, 2000 (Michael S., 70 Miss. L.J. 557 lexis)<br />

Cooperative federalism compromises the constitution<br />
Greve, John G. Searle Scholar, American Enterprise Institute: Ph.D. in government from Cornell, 2000 (Michael S., 70 Miss. L.J. 557 lexis)<br />
Cooperative federalism, I have argued,……constitutional limitations on cooperative arrangements.<br />
<br />
Constitutional violations come first – any framework<br />
Levinson, prof. at law at U of Virginia, 2000 (Daryl, U of Chicago Law review, spring, lexis)<br />
<br />
Extending a majority rule analysis of….. if constitutional rights were never violated.<br />
<br />
Creating a federal civil cause of action in VAWA destroys judicial federalism<br />
Bassler, judge, United States District Court, District of New Jersey, Adjunct professor of Law, Seton Hall School of Law, 96, (William, summer, Rutgers Law review, lexis)<br />
Since domestic violence accounts for more injuries….any opinion as to the constitutionality of the VAWA.<br />
<br />
The VAWA is a model for cooperative federalism now, the plan destroys that<br />
Bassler, judge, United States District Court, District of New Jersey, Adjunct professor of Law, Seton Hall School of Law, 96, (William, summer, Rutgers Law review, lexis)<br />
The violence against women act exemplifies the….misallocation of federal judicial resources.<br />
<br />
Creation of a federal civil rights cause of action for gender based violence turns federal courts of general jurisdiction<br />
Bassler, judge, United States District Court, District of New Jersey, Adjunct professor of Law, Seton Hall School of Law, 96, (William, summer, Rutgers Law review, lexis)<br />
Professor Redish has succinctly noted….that such an interest is a fit for “federal guardianship”<br />
<br />
Unique link – the retreat from recognition of rights proves trend towards federalism<br />
Robert Williams, Distinguished professor of Law, Rutgers University School of Law, 2006 (Maryland law review, ln)<br />

Given that it is increasingly…. Conflict in the post-Cold war era.<br />
<br />
Judicial federalism allows for Human rights promotion, while avoiding cultural imperialism that causes violence<br />
John Kincaid, Robert B. And Helen S. Meyner Professor of Governent and public service; Director of the Meyner center FOR THE study of state and local government, Lafayette College, Summer, 1995 (Rutgers law Journal, ln)<br />
