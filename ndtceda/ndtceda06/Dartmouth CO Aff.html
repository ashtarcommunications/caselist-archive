ADV 1 – Deseg<br />
Same cards with a new one to start<br />
Milliken’s intent requirement is the most disastrous decision for race relations since plessy. The perpetual educational hierarchy created by miliken prevents desegregation in all areas.<br />
Yousef Jabreen, 46 Santa Clara L. Rev. 513<br />
“For example, segregated housing resulted largely from active… pervasive effects of segregation and the Jim Crow regime.”<br />
ADV 2 – Perpetrator Perspective (New )<br />
The ideology of intent enforces structural racism. Intent provides the symbolic outlet of white innoncence and limited responsibility-justifying limited response to racism.<br />
Charles Lawrence, 1987, “The Id, the Ego, and Equal Protection: Reckoning with Unconscious Racism” 39 Stan. L. Rev. 317<br />
“Second, the existing intent requirement’s assignment of individualized fault… charlatans, are themselves deluded.”<br />
Intent constructs the world according to the perpetrator perspective where whites are innocent and non-whites irrelevant. The white comfort zone lmits the scope of both problem and remedy.<br />
Cecil Hunt, 2006, 11 Mich. J. Race &amp; L. 477<br />
“Although it is rarely noted or emphasized… on one side of the color line or the other.”<br />
The perpetrator perspective reduces minorities to non-essential accessories to exclusion and extermination.<br />
Deborah Kenn, prof of law @syracuse , 2001, 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35<br />
“We are far from facing our racism as a nation and constructively creating successful solutions to the problem.. subtle ways those who are mere accessories.”<br />
Intent causes us to systematically underestimate the impact of discrimination in comparison to the unlikely negative consequences of social transformation. This justifies treating already disadvantaged groups as suitable victims necessary for our safety.<br />
Lu-in Wang, law @ pitt, 2006 <em>Discrimination by Default: How Racism Becomes Routine</em>, p. 90-97<br />
“Because counterfactual thinking influences our reactions to and explanations of negative events.. inforce the designation of those others as suitable victims.”<br />
We must not allow the fear of extinction to tyrannize our attempts to transform a discriminatory society. Overestimating threats to survival is a symptom of our need to justify unjustifiable conduct.<br />
Daniel Callahan, Ethics and the Life Sciences, <em>The Tyranny of Survival</em>, 1973, p. 91-95<br />
“The value of survival could not be so readily abused were.. imaginable under some circumstances.”<br />
Rejecting intent is an essential threshold requirement for achieving real racial equality breaking down the perpetrator perspective of the supreme court reforms how we assess the reality of discrimination.<br />
Hunt 2006<br />
“ The presumptive power of the White-centered perspective to determine… lacks any perspectival particularity at all.”<br />
Without challenging the intent decisionmaking re-entrench white supremacy even when they hope to end racial injustice. Our plan is a springboard for a transformative approach to structural racism.<br />
Barbara flagg, 91 Mich. L. Rev. 953<br />
„Each of these insightful articles, however, tends to align race... to provide the equal protection of the laws.”<br />
We Must Respond to the specific grievance of educational segregation and the discursive subtext of intent and white-innonce. Change must be both material and discursive n order to address racism.<br />
Eric Yamamoto 1997, 95 Mich. L. Rev. 821<br />
“Critical race praxis provides structure to justice. . dimensions of a critical race praxis.”<br />
Judges must confront their own complicity in constructing a criteria that justify the horrible impacts of continued racism. Take the step to decolonize your mind.<br />
Wendy Brown Scott, 1999, 2 J. Gender Race &amp; Just. 315<br />
“Judges and college and university faculty members, the majority.. it is the way to freedom for both colonized and colonizer.<br />

Problem re-creation – they fail to address underlying systems of privilege.<br />
John Powell, “Whites will be whites: the failure to interrogate racial privilege,” 34 U.S.F.L. Rev. 419<br />
“Much of the public language that is used to construct… is insufficient and over-expansive.”<br />
Transforming the habits of thought is more important than chooing a particular policy.<br />
Lani Guinier, Law professor AND Gerald Torres, 2002, “The miner’s canary: enlistic race, resisting power, transforming democracy, p. 159<br />
“For us, power-with must involve more than instrumentally choosing the best means to achieve a predictable and desirable conclusion.. the power that others hold.”<br />
Europe Add-On<br />
Europe Models US Courts – changing the intent standard is key to integrate the Roma.<br />
Bob Hepple, prof of law @ Cambridge, 2006, 2006 U. Ill. L. Rev. 605<br />
“In is obvious from this brief account that American precedents… arguments in this respect, found against them on a technicality.”<br />
Fair treatment of the Roma is key to preventing Balkan war.<br />
European Roma Rights Center, “declaration of the participants in the Balkan roma conference for peace and security” June 18-19 1999 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=817" rel="nofollow">__www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=817__</a><br />
“The conference agreed that the policy of prevention of further ethnic conflicts… the work initiated at the<br />
Conference.”<br />
Ethnic conflict causes a Balkan war.<br />
Robert Greenberg, 4/1/2001 “New Balkan policy needed” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/301" rel="nofollow">__http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/301__</a><br />
“In February 2001, Yugoslavia and the Republika Srpska… could lead to wider war in the Balkans.”<br />
World war results.<br />
Kalki Gaur, American Nuclear Weapon Doctrine, 2006 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://kalkigaur.googlepages.com/66" rel="nofollow">__http://kalkigaur.googlepages .com/66__</a><br />
“Three important areas, which could ignite the Third World War, are in Kosovo… Next Balkan War could destroy European Union.”<br />
Voting Rights Add-on<br />
Plan spills over to voting rights.<br />
Nathaniel R. Jones, 69 U. Cin. L. Rev. 435, Winter, l/n<br />
“The decision was hailed as a pivotal development in the battle against northern… precedents bear out their concerns.”<br />
Disenfranchisement dooms legitimacy.<br />
Pamela Karlan, Stanford Law Review, 4/1/2004<br />
“The legitimacy of criminal punishment, at least within our system… taints our politics.”<br />

Milliken creates an intent requirement for integration remedies—this<br />
precedent has caused a wave of resegregation<br />
Preston Cary Green, III, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Spring<br />

&quot;Since the Keyes decision, the Supreme Court…federal judiciary's<br />
remedial power.&quot;<br />
<br />
The court is on the verge of rolling back integration entirely<br />

&quot;One trend from last term which I really…tendency of having patterns<br />
of one-race schools.&quot;<br />
<br />
Milliken's intent requirement upholds structural racism by reducing<br />
segregation to individual torts, privileging local autonomy over<br />
school integration<br />
john a. powell, Professor, Law, Ohio State, 01, In Pursuit of a Dream<br />
Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy, p. 24-6<br />
&quot;One of the most significant and debilitating components…of educating<br />
poor, minority children.&quot;<br />
<br />
The intent requirement makes the 14th Amendment into an instrument of<br />
majoritarian convenience—it privileges economic liberty over race<br />
issues<br />

Segregation in urban schools is a microcosm for segregation in<br />
society—it is a form of structural racism<br />
Wanda Blanchett, Professor, Urban Special Education, University of<br />
Wisconsin-Milwaukee, et. al., Mar/Apr 05, Remedial and Special<br />
Education, Volume 26, Number 2, pp. 70-81(12), ingenta<br />

societal restrictions<br />
john a. powell, Professor, Law, Ohio State, 01, In Pursuit of a Dream<br />
Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy, p. 33-4<br />
&quot;The most common response to the failure…to dismantling racism in<br />
significant ways.82&quot;<br />

Segregation culminates in extermination—it marks people of color as<br />
nonessential and expendable<br />
Deborah Kenn, Prof of Law @ Syracuse, '1 (11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35, ln)<br />
&quot;We are far from facing our racism…ways those who are mere accessories.&quot; n39&quot;<br />

Overruling the intent requirement is key to break down colorblindness<br />
and de facto segregation<br />
john a. powell, Professor, Law, Ohio State, 05, School Resegregation:<br />
Must the South Turn Back?, p. 287-8<br />
&quot;Much of the legal language on the issue of… education system<br />
functions in racist ways.&quot;<br />

The intent standard shapes the language and consciousness of<br />
racism—breaking down the intent standard is key to denaturalize<br />
segregation<br />
john a. powell, Professor, Law, Ohio State, 01, In Pursuit of a Dream<br />
Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy, p. 19-20<br />
&quot;Part of the difficulty in adequately understanding…action when the<br />
harms are so great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Residential desegregation is inherently unstable now—only the plan<br />
changes attitudes so people are willing to live in diverse<br />
neighborhoods<br />
Gary Orfield, Professor, Educational and Social Policy, Harvard, 01,<br />
In Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy,<br />
p. 136<br />
&quot;Opponents of school and housing desegregation…public schools than the<br />
whites they replace.&quot;<br />
<br />
Integration breaks down racism—the effects spill over to other<br />
settings and other generations<br />
Amy Stuart Wells, Professor, Sociology and Education, Columbia, and<br />
Robert L. Crane, 97, Stepping over the color line : African-American<br />
students in white suburban schools, p. 340-1<br />
&quot;Perpetuation theory, as it has been…all white will remain so&quot; (p. 102-103).&quot;<br />
<br />
Integration fundamentally changes the structure of schools—it<br />
encourages critical thinking and validates the emancipatory potential<br />
of education<br />
Amy Stuart Wells, Professor, Sociology and Education, Columbia, and<br />
Robert L. Crane, 97, Stepping over the color line : African-American<br />
students in white suburban schools, p. 288-90<br />
&quot;When we set out to interview principals…change (Bell and<br />
Schniedewind, 1987; McLaren, 1991a; Sirotnik and Oakes, 1986).&quot;<br />
<br />
Integration has clear long-term benefits—research denying the benefits<br />
of integration is too narrowly focused on the short term<br />
Amy Stuart Wells, Professor, Sociology and Education, Columbia, and<br />
Robert L. Crane, 97, Stepping over the color line : African-American<br />
students in white suburban schools, p. 339<br />
&quot;As we mentioned in…sight of the original goals of desegregation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Supreme Court action is key—it's insulated from political pressure and<br />
better able to craft case-by-case remedies<br />
Peter Tolsdorf, JD candidate, 4/05, The George Washington Law Review,<br />
73 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 668, lexis<br />
&quot;The above model is detailed enough…with which to make a decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
Concerns about feasibility and political backlash should not prevent<br />
integration—the same concerns were proven false by abolition and civil<br />
right reform<br />
Gary Orfield and Susan Eaton, Harvard prof of education and social<br />
policy, Harvard prof of public policy, Dismantling Desegregation: The<br />
Quiet Reversal of Brown v. Board of Education, 1996, Pg. 334<br />
&quot;No significant policy initiative for urban school…well intensify the<br />
underlying problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Integration is essential to break down structural racism—changing<br />
racist attitudes is insufficient to change material conditions<br />
Richard Thompson Ford, Professor, Law Stanford, 01, In Pursuit of a<br />
Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy, p. 238-9<br />
&quot;Empirical study confirms the existence…is constantly used and<br />
constantly reinforced.&quot;<br />

Empirically integration doesn't cause private school flight<br />
