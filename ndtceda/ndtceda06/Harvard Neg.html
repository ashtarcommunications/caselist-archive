<h2 id="toc0"><a name="x-Harvard VAWA Neg"></a>Harvard VAWA Neg</h2>
<br />
1 maintaining the public/private distinction is necessary to respond to different types of violence—while both private and public violence are bad, conflating the two produces ineffective responses.<br />
Tracey E. Higgins, Fordham University School of Law, 2k<br />
(75 Chi.-Kent. L. Rev. 847)<br />
“The first and simplest reason for” “individual and policy level”<br />
2. Relying on judicial rejection of the public/private distinction would make the world worse for women-taking advantage of public power is the only way to end discrimination<br />
Tracey E. Higgins, Fordham University School of Law, 2k<br />
“Finally, there are practical reasons for maintaining the public/private distinction” “help to balance this private power through democratic means”<br />
3. MacKinnon’s critique is too totalizing—appeals to privacy are not inherently doomed. Rejecting all appeals does more harm than good---reorienting current approaches solves better than rejecting the distinction altogether<br />
Laura W. Stein, Associate Professor, New York Law School 1993<br />
(77 Minn. L. Rev. 1153)<br />
“It is not clear whether the feminist critique of privacy solely concerns privacy as a constitutional doctrine or whether it is directed more broadly at the entire legal, or even philosophical” “Feminists simply must be wary”<br />
<br />
Status Quo Solving Now<br />
Domestic Violence Courts—States Adopting them Now<br />
States adopting specialized domestic violence courts now<br />
Maine Law Review 2k4<br />
(Jennifer Thompson, JD Candidate, 56 Me. L. Rev. 407, p.426-7)<br />
“The solution adopted by some courts” “Judicial activism to creative court programs”<br />
<br />
State courts have developed specialized domestic violence courts—provides more comprehensive therapeutic approach<br />
Betsy Tsai, Domestic Violence Resource Coordinator, 2k<br />
(Fordham Law Review, March, 68 Fordham L. Rev, 1285, p.1286-7)<br />
“Those who work in the criminal justice system are often frustrated and embarrassed by their inability” “Commitment to providing comprehensive services”<br />
<br />
States increasingly adopting specialized domestic violence courts<br />
Betsy Tsai, Domestic Violence Resource Coordinator, 2k<br />
(Fordham Law Review, March, 68 Fordham L. Rev, 1285, p.1286-7)<br />
“As domestic violence gains increasing national attention, the number of states developing specialized criminal justice responses to such violence continues to expand” “Dade County, Florida, and the District of Columbia exemplify this approach”<br />
<br />
<br />
The Civil Rights Remedy Fails<br />
1. Federalizing the civil remedy encourages local authorities to ignore the problem—any signal is counterproductive<br />
Curt Levey, Director of Legal and Public Affairs, Center for Individual Rights, 2k1<br />
(Loyola Law Review, Spring, 47 Loy L. Rev, 535, p.551-2)<br />
“Whether it is different policy choices or people not being indicted when we think they should be, it is a far cry from evidence” “Department of Justice will look at it”<br />
<br />
2. The discrimination model backfires—judges are more likely to excuse violence under the guise of relationship then punish on account of gender.<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Assc. Prof Rutgers School of Law, 2k3<br />
(American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender society Policy &amp; L.251, p.265-7)<br />
“Despite these encouraging signs, it is important to remember” “overlook the possibility that such violence is discriminatory”<br />
<br />
3. Torts are not effective remedies—defendants have no money and they don’t deter<br />
C. Quince Hopkins 2k1<br />
(Associate Professor, Washington and Lee University School of Law, 9 Va. J. Soc, Pol’y &amp; L. 411)<br />
“Like criminal law, however, the law of tort, typically falls short as a tool for victims of abuse” “similar shallow-pockets problem”<br />
<br />
4. Inadequate Structure<br />
a. Civil Suits are expensive—most people don’t have adequate resources<br />
DePaul Law Review, 2k1<br />
(Jennifer R. Havan, JD Candidate) Spring, 50 DePaul L. Rev. 919, p.959<br />
“Title III represented the federal government’s response to a serious problem” “might be a costly and futile effort”<br />
<br />
b. Not enough lawyers who will litigate civil proceedings<br />
Freedman, Professor of Law, Rutgers 2k3<br />
(Ann E. American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol’y &amp; L. 567, p. 593-4)<br />
“The cost of legal services is a primary factor” “law litigants and potential litigants”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc1"><a name="x-Harvard Abortion Bad"></a>Harvard Abortion Bad</h2>
<br />
Harvard—Abortion Bad (Vs. Oklahoma)<br />
Frontline<br />
The best scientific and philosophical evidence proves that the fetus is a human being worthy of the right of life from the point of conception. All of their arguments to the contrary are based on an ignorance of science or a false functionalist view of personhood<br />
Irving 93<br />
“What then is a human being or person” “he or she is already a human being”<br />
2. If we win our scientific and philosophical claims that the fetus is a human life, we win the debate—ignoring this conclusion and insisting on the right to choice at that point would mean the end of all human rights, social justice, and prohibitions on mass murder, as well as a systematic death toll greater than warfare; they create a world in which there is no ethical basis for ANY prohibition on oppression<br />

“Abortion is the most frequently performed surgery” “would ultimately mean the end of all human rights and social justice”<br />
<br />
3. Abortion is a modern-day shoah which saps society of all ethics and respect for human life across the board. The philosophical underpinnings of abortion view humanity not as intrinsically valuable, but as hunks of meat to be disposed of at will. This paves the way for eugenics, racism, and mass murder<br />
Randy Alcorn, Doctorate of divinity, writer, and founder and director of Eternal Perspective Ministries, 2k<br />
(“Pro-Life Answers to Pro-Choice Arguments,” p. 278-279)<br />
“Abortion is a modern holocaust which is breeding unparalleled violence” “African Americans, the elderly, the disabled, and others”<br />
<br />
4. Abortion is rooted in a eugenic history which praises the elimination of so-called social undesirables like minorities and the poor through the elimination of their offspring. Pro-Choice advocacy is inextricably linked with racist social Darwinism and oppressive population management<br />
Randy Alcorn, Doctorate of divinity, writer, and founder and director of Eternal Perspective Ministries, 2k<br />

“It is the poor and minorities—not the rich and white” “the cause of upper-class white supremacy”<br />

FEMINISM<br />
Their argument that abortion on demand is a prerequisite to female liberation assumes that pregnancy and female biology are impediments to equality and must be eliminated. They strive for equality by surgically altering feminine biology to mold females into the image of man, rather than celebrating these distinctive aspects of womanhood. Only an ethic which acknowledges and rejoices in the distinctiveness of the feminine can achieve true equality<br />

Stare Decisis 2NC<br />
<br />
-Departure from stare decisis undermines SC legitimacy and eviscerates the social cohesion produced by the constitution<br />
Monaghan 88, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 723<br />
Precedent is, of course, part of our understanding…if not the viability of the constitutional order itself<br />
<br />

-Morrison was good constitutional interpretation even if it is bad policy- best response is to amend the constitution<br />
Westover<br />

<br />
That the meaning of a written constitution…be well-received by the public.<br />
<br />
-Reversing the precedent set by the Morrison decision is a constitutional revolution- it reverses a “super precedent” which is a uniquely severe violation of stare decisis<br />
Gerhardt, 90 Minn. L. Rev. 1204<br />
<br />
Political institutions, social movements, economic forces, and the American people…with the principle of Civil Rights Cases in mind.<br />
<br />
-Aff plan is unpredictable- NM for overruling a preceden like Morrison would involve years of incremental judicial challenges- the fiat of the plan overrides Morrison all at once, which destroys precedent<br />
Gerhardt<br />
Longstanding precedents, especially in important cases, are rarely overturned…achieve super precedent status.<br />

<br />
And the plan is a symbolic renunciation of Lopez- destroys fism. McGinnis, 2002 (Cal Law Review, March, LN)<br />
&quot;Because the law the Court invalidated so much more resonance with the public than&quot; and &quot;by invalidating it the Justices announced that constitutional federalism is back&quot;<br />
<br />
And the mere perception of judicial oversight established in Morrison deters Congress from overreaching<br />
Ernest Young 2004 (Texas Law Rev, Nov 2004, pp135-6) &quot;it is important to maintain some enforceable limits on the Commerce Clause&quot; and &quot;offer the most promising basis for challenging such legislation&quot;<br />
<br />
Allowing VAWA under the commerce clause allows complete federalization of crime. Jesse H Choper and John C Yoo, 2000, Oklahoma City University Law Review, Fall 25 Okla City U.L. Rev 843, pg 853)<br />
&quot;whether particular operations affect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the constitutional power of Congress to regulate them&quot; and &quot;it would concede to Congress the power to regulate all crime&quot;<br />
<br />
AT: COOP FISM TURNS<br />
<br />
Cooperative fism causes zero-sum decrease in state power—our link is linear. Roger Nell, Stetson Law Review, 1992, pg 490-1 &quot;Inherent equality of state and federal governments creates a zero sum power struggle&quot; and &quot;would necessitate a decrease in state power&quot;<br />
<br />
Pre-emp[tion proves our arg—gurantees that cooperation regresses into federal dominance. Adam Kurdland, Empry Law Review, Winter, 1996, 45 Eomory LJ 1) &quot;anything within the exclusive sphere of the federal government must<br />
be outside state authority&quot; and &quot;every expansion of federal power came at the direct expense of state regulatory or taxing authority&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
AT: RAICH NON<br />
<br />
Raich doesn't Nullify Morrison—The court took pains to craft it as a careful exception, not an overrule. Barnett, 2005 (Lewis and Clark Law Rev, Winter, LN) &quot;Raich looms large now because it came as such a disappointment&quot; and &quot;Morrison-cases that the Court took pains to leave in place despite the hostility towards them shared by at least&quot;<br />
<br />

1. Ground – the Affirmative will always win that the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract – we can only debate the merits of their framework if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation<br />

“As for moral perfectionism, this would be…thus respect for one right might lead us to betray another”<br />

2. Topical Education-by manipulating the topic to access their political project they skirt debate about implementation of policies by the government.

Overrule: “To overturn or make void the holding (decision); generally accomplished ina different or subsequent case, when a court renders a decision that is substantially opposite the decision made in a prior case”<br />

The 1AC presents a fantasy dream world in which everyone is accepted and any decision rests this merely on the brute fact of humanity – in this moment politics is evicerated: thou shalt not calculate, for you already have your responsibility given, you already know what you must do.

The fiction that the law can deliver us of this consequence is the substance of the very killing machine that the affirmative tries to wish away. The violence of the state of exception cannot be checked by a return to the normative, because the normative was never what gave the law its force in the first place. Unless we can innovate new forms of life that are not reliant on the law, we cannot stop the emerging global civil war fueling biopolitical violence<br />

In the legend…a new dimension.<br />

Continual reliance on courts to create a politics of racial emancipation is neither new nor easily explicable. After decades of failure this reliance serves not to create changte but to channel our impulses to believr in the world’s goodness and perfectability in the face of a problem that remains intransigent. Mediating our ethics through the law absolves us of facing the reality of our society’s desire for racism – the spirit of the law always serves to lead to its racist application at the level of the letter<br />

The language of a causal and linear relationship of time between past and present inscribes guilt onto the subject – this notion of time is the devaluation of life, the end of ethics and the destruction of freedom. This turns your aff. Werner Hamacher, 2k2, “Benjamin’s Sketch ‘Capitlaism as Religion’” <em>Diacritics</em> 32.3-4, 81-106, muse, “Everything that happens is guilt. This why”<br />
<br />
The ethical disruption of linear time allows us to counter the violence of metaphysics and counter the inscription of guilt. Werner Hamacher, 2k2, “Benjamin’s Sketch ‘Capitlaism as Religion’” <em>Diacritics</em> 32.3-4, 81-106, muse, “As nonexecution and nonaction…renewed beginning.”<br />
<br />
The 1AC’s engagement in mourning depoliticizes the left by surrendering the potentiality of the political in the name of fidelity with a particular state of injury. It is precisely this simplistic and cliche’ call to the other that makes us feel like we’ve done something positive, while all we’ve accomplished is divorcing our ability to radically alter the current political situation. Wendy Brown, 1999 Boundary 2, “Now why would Benjamin use…Marx, or movement.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The affirmative functions within a violent economy of sacrifice where the only means of becoming human is <em>to give oneself over</em> to an ethical imperative. The affirmative abstracts a mother’s gift to her child at a particular time and place, and turns it into a story of transcendence from the politics of everyday life. In this gesture, they repeat the scare tactics of those who would teach one not to be La Chingada or to love anoyone like that, taking the story, and making the gift a metaphor which other can follow.<br />
<br />
The moment of sacrifice is a moment of paralysis, and the only way we can act is to be instructed by a mystery or great secret which demands our fidelity and to which we pay tribute, to whom we owe. In this politics of the founding moment of the responsible self in sacrifice and debt, they reproduce the very politics they indict. Who decides who is responsible, what is one’s debt to society, have you paid it in blood, in responsibility to yourself and your community. The very women excluded in the status quo are those who are deemed irresponsible, unable to pay their debt to society. This gift of the affirmative is the gift of death. Derrida, <em>The Gift of Death</em>, 1995 p. 84-7 “If every human is wholly…more than a murder?”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The affirmative calls on you to sign your ballot over to sanctify the history La Llorona—this too only functions within a certain economy. Their political space is a spa e haunted by ghosts of the past, filled with emotions that our not our own but rather insisted upon by the aff as <em>inevitable</em>. Why feel guilty? Why mourn? Why insist that in order to make liberation possible that a sanctification, transgressive or otherwise, be bestowed on the ghost?<br />
<br />
Their canonization of La Llorona is not a special or unique gesture. The understanding of Abraham and his willingness to sacrifice his son before god is the founding moment of the religious legacy they position themselves as critics or. Derrida 95<br />
<br />
We can forget. History should not bind us to it by a series of gifts and counter gifts, debts and payments. There is no need for liberation to come from sacrifice, freedom from violence. Vote negative to make ethics an ethics of the self and the immanent rather than an ethics of command from on high. Derrida, <em>The Gift of Death.</em> 95, p112 “The moment the gift…without any object.”<br />

The affirmative addresses themselves to the world as managers of global danger. A planetary environment hangs in the balance. We must tweak our governmental model so the rest of the world understands how to behave.<br />
<br />
These are not neutral depictions but the active production of political reality populated by threatening others. The production of these threats to OUR security and OUR familiar order are the operative bases for BIO-POLITICS—the cleaving of the world as those who must live and those who must die<br />

Security is not benign or descriptive-rather it is productive of the subjects it is supposed to protect. It brings into being and maintains entire populations in the name of controlling a disordered, outside, evil enemy other. The unattainable desire for total security therefore justifies total slaughter in the name of rational organization and life necessity.<br />

Luke, 3-18-1997 (Professor of Political Science @ Virginia Polytechnic, The (Un)wise (Ab)use of Nature: Environmentalism as Globalized Consumerism? <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eddc.vt.edu.tim/tims/Tim528.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.eddc.vt.edu.tim/tims/Tim528.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
To avoid this collapse of ecological throughput, consummativity as consumptiveness must end. Human beings must slow their increasing mass populations, halt wasteful resource-intensive modes of production, and limit excessive levels of material consumption. All of these ends, in turn, require a measure of surveillance and degree of navigational steering beyond the powers of modern nation-states, but perhaps not beyond those exercised by some postmodern worldwatch engaged in the disciplinary tasks of equilibriating the &quot;net primary production&quot; of solar energy fixed by photosynthesis in the four systems to global consummativity as consummation. Natural resources in the total solar economy of food stocks, fisheries, forest preserves, and grass lands are rhetorically ripped from Nature only to be returned as consummationally-framed environmental resources, enveloped in accounting procedures and encircled by managerial programs. Worldwatching presumes to know all of this, and in knowing it, to have mastered all of its economic/ecological implications through its authoritative technical analysis to perfect consumption as the would-be warden of this planetary solar economy. By questioning the old truth regime of mere consumptive growth, a new regime of consummation for a much more sophisticated ecological economy stands ready to reintegrate human production and consumption in balance with the four biological systems.<br />
No longer Nature, not merely ecosystem, the terraforming of our world under this kind of watch truly reduces it to strategic spaces. As &quot;an environment,&quot; ringed by many ecological knowledge centers dedicated to the rational management of its assets, the global ecosystem is to be understood through the disciplinary codes of green operational planning. The health of global populations as well as the survival of the planet itself allegedly necessitate that a bioeconomic spreadsheet be draped over consummativity on Earth, generating an elaborate set of accounts for a terraforming economy of global reach and local scope. Hovering over the world in their scientifically-centered astropanopticon of green surveillance, the disciplinary grids of efficiency and waste, health and disease, poverty and wealth as well as employment and unemployment. Fusing geo-economics with geo-politics, Brown, Flavin and Postel declare &quot;the once separate issues of environment and development are now inextricably linked.&quot;80 Indeed, they are, at least, in the discourses of Worldwatch Institute as its experts survey Nature-in-crisis by auditing levels of topsoil depletion, air pollution, acid rain, global warming, ozone destruction, water pollution, forest reduction, and species extinction brought on by excessive mass consumption.<br />
Worldwatch terraforming would govern through things, and the ends things serve, by restructuring today's ecologically unsound system of objects through elaborate managerial designs to realize tomorrow's environmentally sustainable economy in the ecologically perfected objects of that environmentalized system. The shape of an environmental economy would emerge from a reengineered economy of environmentalizing practices vetted by worldwatching codes. The individual human subject of today, and all of his or her things with their unsustainable practices, would be reshaped through a consummational environmentality, redirected by practices, discourses, and ensembles of administration that more efficiently synchronize the bio-powers of populations with the geo-powers of environments. To police global carrying capacity, in turn, this environmentalizing logic would direct each human subject to assume the much less capacious carriage of disciplinary frugality instead of affluent suburban abundance. All of the world must come under this watch, and the global watch would police its human charges to dispose of their things and arrange their ends--in reengineered spaces using new energies at new jobs and leisures--around these post-consumptive agendas.<br />
Sustainability, like sexuality, would become another expert discourse about exerting power over life.81 What the biopower strategies of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries helped fabricate in terms of human sexuality now must be reimagined for humanity in worsening global conditions of survival as a perfected consummative survivalism. How development might &quot;invest life through and through&quot; becomes a new sustainability challenge, once biopolitical relations are established, in making these investments permanently profitable as consummational systems of objects.82 Thus, the Worldwatch Institute issues pamphlet after monograph after book on the supreme virtues of bicycles, solar power, windmills, urban planning, or organic agriculture to reveal the higher forms of consumer goods perfection attainable by the system of objects. Moreover, sustainability more or less presumes that some level of material and cultural existence has been attained that is indeed worth sustaining. This formation, then, constitutes &quot;a new distribution of pleasures, discourses, truths, and powers; it has to be seen as the self-affirmation of one class rather than the enslavement of another: a defense, a protection, a strengthening, and an exaltation...as a means of social control and political subjugation.&quot;83 Sustainable development means developing new consummative powers through defining a new model of green subjectivity organized around sustaining both new object worlds in a more survivable second nature and new consummational systems for their surviving subjects.<br />

Violence Against Who? As other identities fall out of view, so do other forms of domination A long history testifies to the fact that quick fix criminalization strategies to deal with gender violence don’t achieve justice – police enforce laws like VAWA with disproportionate aggression towards non-white communities. This dissuades people from reporting violence, promotes hostility that fuels more racism and limits the potential for meaningful change.<br />

Turn it’s their framework that denies agency. A rigid view of power relations reinforces domination and prevents creative tactics of resistence.

Extend the laides night link – in the world of the affirmative gender violence and violence against women are interchangeable concepts. Violence becomes gendered when it is directed at women. Women are gendered subjects – men are genderless subjects, the norm from which the feminine deviates. Our finely evidence explains how this construction of women circulates through legal discourse by repittions and eventual naturalization. The affirmative actively participates in this process – by lumping the perspectives and concerns of women into a single group facilitates the erasure of subaltern groups WITHIN the category of “women.” The codification of a single, knowable condition of womanhood and gender does more to fascilitate ractionary politics thatn it does to challenge systemic violence.<br />

The ensuing turmoil undermines long-term global economic growth. Martha Dragich, Assoc. Prof of Law at Missouri-Columbia, 2-1995, 44 Am. U.L. Rev. 757. “Stability in the law refers to the balance between continuity…stability in the law helps to ensure the continued vitality of the legal system itself.”<br />
<br />
Russia models US judicial independence. Cass Sunstein, Prof of Jurisprudence at Chicago, Federal News Service June 6 1995. “in the last several years, nations all over the globe…has been fast and foremost in the minds of the democratic reformers.”<br />

<br />
Independent judiciary in India key to prevent India/Pak nuke conflict. The Boston Globe, June 15 2002. “But although most analysts agreed on the need…is weakening the chances for a stable subcontinent.”<br />

Modeling the rollback in response to the plan is the greatest danger to democracy internationally. William Kelly, International Centre for Criminal Justice Reform and Criminal Justice Policy, 1996. An Independent Judiciary: The Core of the Rule of Law. “The history of the judiciary around the world demonstrates…must not be an ally or supporter of one of the contending parties.”<br />
<br />

State action doctrine impacts<br />
Totalitarianism<br />
A. Eliminating the state action doctrine wouldn’t just decrease autonomy – it would deny it’s very possibility. Tyranny and totalitarianism would be an inevitable result.<br />

B. This is the biggest impact – totalitarianism must be rejected at all costs – a new Hitler and Stalin would be the result.<br />

The beginning called for here… all human beings.<br />

<strong>2.</strong> <strong>Public/Private Good</strong><br />

<br />
Finally, <u>there are practical reasons… through democratic means.</u><br />

<strong>c.</strong> <strong>MacKinnon’s critique is too totalizing – appeals to privacy are not inherently doomed. Rejecting all appeals does more harm than good – reorienting current approaches solves better than rejecting the distinction all together</strong><br />

<strong>c.</strong> <strong>Discrimination model bad – judges are more likely to excuse violence under the guise of relationship then punish on account of gender.</strong><br />

Rather than the result … <u>in the lives of poor women</u>.<br />
<br />
<strong>6.</strong> <strong>Victimization</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>c.</strong> <strong>The link is inescapable – the only justification for a remedy to combat gender violence is the assumption that men are abusers and women are victims</strong><br />
<br />
Curt <strong>Levey, Director Legal and Public Affairs, Center for Individual Rights, 2001,</strong> Loyola Law Review, Spring, 47 Loy. L. Rev. 535, p. 549<br />

<br />
<u>The beginning</u> called for … of all human beings.</strong><br />
<br />
<u>The Links:</u><br />
The first one is Edelman specific –<br />
A. He rejects ALL politics as necessarily and inherently flawed –<br />
<br />
<strong>John</strong> Brenkman '2 <strong>Distinguished Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the CUNY Graduate Center and Baruch College (NARRATIVE, Vol. 10, No. 2, May)<br />
<br />
<u>For Edelman</u> the image of t…the death drive, depends&quot; (23).</strong><br />
<br />
B. This creates a double bind -- they must either defend the entire of Edelman's politics and the consequences of adopting his worldview, or else they cannot use ANY of his theories to indict our abortion bad turns on the other advantage, as they would be making a philosophical category mistake and conflating sexual politics with psychoanalysis<br />

<br />
Is the <em>practice</em> of queer sexualties…that queer post-politics imagines it could transcend.</strong><br />
<br />
2. Edelman's understanding of the politics is counter-productive – he conceives of subject as necessarily constituted by the symbolic<br />

On the psychoanalytic side of the… any narrative consistency&quot; (26; qtg. de Man 181).</strong><br />
<br />
<u>The Impacts:</u><br />
<br />
1. Totalitarian Violence –<br />
a. Their worldview denies all intrinsic value to politics and accepts the substitution of making for acting<br />
<br />
<strong>Frederick M.</strong> Dolan '95 <strong>Prof of Rhetoric and Political Theory, Berkeley(Political Theory, Vol 23., No 2, p. 330)<br />
<br />
<u>From Arendt's point of view</u>, …generated, found, or revealed, not made for a purpose.'</strong><br />
<br />
b. The result is inevitable violence and totalitarianism<br />
<strong>Hannah</strong> Arendt '58 <strong>(The Human Condition, p. 228-229)<br />
<br />
One thing, however, is noteworthy … means to pursue recognized ends.</strong><br />
2. Turns the case – their refusal to recognize queer within the political and citizen context makes discrimination and exclusion inevitable<br />
<strong>David</strong> Bell <strong>Professor of Cultural Studies at Staffordshire University</strong> and <strong>Jon</strong> Binnie '2k <strong>Department of Geography, Brunel University (The Sexual Citizen, p. 141-146)<br />
<br />
What we hope to have achieved … contributed to that process here.</strong><br />
<br />
<u>The Alternative:</u> Vote Negative.<br />
<br />
We should reject the affirmative's denial of the intrinsic value of politics through a recognition of natality as defining the human condition.<br />
<br />
1. It solves OUR impacts: only accepting the intrinsic value to politics can prevent totalitarianism<br />

<br />
<u>One rationale for…</u> dimension of green politics.</strong><br />
<br />
2. It solves THEIR impacts: conceiving of the human condition as defined by natality makes concern with futurism impossible – it accepts all politics as unstable and ungrounded – rather than forclosing, this OPENS UP spaces for resistance.<br />
<br />
<strong>John</strong> Brenkman '2 <strong>Distinguished Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the CUNY Graduate Center and Baruch College (NARRATIVE, Vol. 10, No. 2, May)<br />
<br />
I cited Claude Lefort at … <u>of our being the</u> <em>zoon politikon</em>.</strong><br />
<br />
AT: PERM<br />
Our commitment to natality is ontological – it's not just a way of being but rather a precondition. Even according to THEIR OWN arguments, this conception is the precondition for REAL and not just ontological violence – if they enact a violence against the world – then lets get real, they're part of the problem<br />
<strong>Frederick M.</strong> Dolan '95 <strong>Prof of Rhetoric and Political Theory, Berkeley(Political Theory, Vol 23., No 2, p. 330)<br />
<br />
<u>From Arendt's point of view</u>,…<u>of political action itself</u>.</strong><br />
<br />
AT: ZIZEK AND DALY<br />
BUT – defer to our evidence which is more comparative – zizek and daly's explanation of the real does not take into account Arendt's conception of the world – our evidence says that attempts to achieve depoliticization are the necessary prerequisites totalitarian ideology. To conceive of the possibility of the individual outside of the political – well that would just be DISASTROUS.<br />

It is in this pragmatism…<u>of tactics by dominant elites</u>.</strong><br />
Our argument is not the assimilation of the queer – rather than simply seeking a place at the table, a queer politics rooted in democracy and natality would transform the terms and nature of the debate<br />

Round 2 GSU<br />
Vs. aff: Louisville FW<br />
Judged by: Blake Abbott<br />
<br />
Case Args:<br />
t/ defining group identity essentializes and marginalizes -- x<br />
they don't overt/ all race neutralithy<br />
quirin isn't critical. Commerce clause and = prtxn key<br />
bipoower is bad.<br />
<br />
they delimit subjectivity and erase all politics. They refuse to consider logos -- 00<br />
our interp. Compare relative merits. Genocide example proves.<br />
better accesses their offense about education<br />
<br />
Stare Decisis Disad<br />
roberts will adhere to stare decisis -- 06<br />
link - overt/ing causes judicial turmoil -- x<br />
impacts - crushing stare decisis kills judicial independence -- x<br />
loss of independence is modeled worldwide -- 04<br />
turmoil u/m long term econ good -- x<br />
impact is world war -- mead 92<br />
<br />
Counterplan<br />
supreme court should hold that there is a compelling st interest by adopting a race conscious perspective<br />
this solves. Quirin here is doomed to solve -- 02<br />
<br />
Framework<br />
our fw is that the db8 should be about cite of pol proposal<br />
<br />
b. our interp is better<br />
they define the phrase -- websters 2k<br />
resolved -- x<br />
should = expectation -- x<br />
fg in wash dc -- x<br />
<br />
b. violation<br />
they claim colorblindness…quirin isn't key<br />
<br />
standards<br />
ground<br />
ground is key -- ignatieff 04<br />
w/out predictable db8, it becomes meaningless -- shively 00<br />
deliberation toward democratic engagement is key -- 00<br />
independent reason to vote neg -- shively 00<br />
<br />
ed<br />
by manipulating the topic, their education is mistrusting of institution. e/if noble, they lead to TOTO -- lewis 92<br />
ind reason to vote neg -- shively 00<br />
our interp solves. Policy debates is key to solve manipulation by powerful interests -- lutz 00<br />
uniquely important b/c of post 9/11. must engage these db8s to reject the worst forms -- ignatieff 04<br />
<br />
limits<br />
there are limitless ways they could advocate the plan. We limit and bring structure -- lutz 00<br />
exploding predictable limits makes their advocacy meaningless -- shively 00 (refusal to will)<br />
key to vote neg. Use your ballot -- shively 00<br />
<br />
Block Strategy<br />
The block answers the 2ac’s discussion of ethos, pathos, and logos separately, as well as the “stylicality” argument that style should come first.<br />
<br />
They also kinda extend the counterplan and the stare decisis disad.<br />
2NR Strategy<br />
<br />
Went for cp, counterinterp of ethos, pathos, and logos, and why the judge should evaluate a plan itself.<br />

<br />
<br />
Harvard MR Neg vs Q<br />
<br />
Stare decisis<br />
Crime impact – undermining stare decisis collapses legal certainty and causes rampant crime – Marth Dragich, American university law review 95 “Certainty in the law requires”<br />
Khalilzad<br />
<br />
Quirin link – plan is extremely unpredictable – normal means for overruling a precedent like Quirin would involve years of incremental judicial challenges - the fiat of the plan overrides Quirin all at once, which destroys precedent. - Gerhardt, Michael, Minnesota Law Review, 2k6 “I agree that time alone is not the measure”<br />
<br />
Unpredictable court decisions cause congress to bring the smack down. O’Scannlain, 2k1 online “is not expected to act on any person’s behalf”<br />
<br />
Plan circumvents pres authority which causes bush to declare war on jud. Independence. Mike Hersch, 2k6 online “the worse may be yet to come”<br />
<br />
Uniqueness – Roberts committed to stare decisis even for liberal decisions. Gerhardt 2k6 Minnesota Law Review “A possible explanation for the existence”<br />
<br />
AT: overrules all the time<br />
Recent decisions largely distinguish but not overrule. John Wallace, May 1994 Buffalo Law Review “all members of the current”<br />
<br />
Not true Micahael Gerhardt, 2k5 U of Pa Journal of Con Law “When the court overturns the constitutional”<br />
At: not unique<br />
U args are part of the sq path of general precedent stability – plan would reverse this trend through fiat – Gerhardt 2k5 “A final problem with the attidunal”<br />
<br />
Overruling like the plan is extremely rare – Gerhardt 2k5 “Nor is it possible to see how reversing”<br />
<br />
<br />
AT: Quirin last pro-tribunal case<br />
Their reading of Quirin is flawed – judges themselves thought they were limiting presidential power. Marouf A. Hasian Jr. 2k3 “One of the most fascinating illustrations of the polysemic nature of legal decisions comes from”<br />
<br />
<br />
Distinguish cp<br />
<br />
AT: AUMF = declaration of war<br />
Aumf does not authorize tribunals. John Paul Stevens 2k6 “Opinion of the Court, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,” online “The Government would have us dispense”<br />
<br />
Aumf not declaration of war – David Brahms, and James Cullen 2k6 Amicus Brief in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld online “This case implicates the constitutional separation of powers”<br />
<br />
AT: Overturn key<br />
1. hamdan solves impact – only justification authors give for overturning Quirin is that bush used it to justify detaining enemy combatants – they concede it has no other effects.<br />
2. from the end of the brief – Hamdan Amicus Brief “Quirin has lain largely dormant during the decades since”<br />
<br />
<br />
AT: Quirin precedent for detaining terrorists<br />
Nope – distinguishing solves - terrorists aren’t enemy combatants because they don’t follow the laws of war – Quirin not applicable.<br />
<br />
Topicality<br />
Topicality is a jurisdictional voting issue so if they don’t meet the best interpretation of the topic they lose automatically. Scalia 98 [SteelCo. V. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83,93-4 (1998), “We decline to endorse”<br />
<br />
Quirin ruled on basis of delegated war powers – ruling against current executive detention does not overrule Quirin whatsoever. Center for Justice &amp; Accountability et al, 1-4-2k4 “in Ex parte Quirin, this Court reviewed the executive’s decision to detain the defendants”<br />
<br />
Aff reverses Quirin, it does not overrule it. Words and Phrases 95 vol. 11A p. 31 “important difference between overruling”<br />
<br />
Their we meet args assume common law interpretation of statutes without a prior basis for decision – constitutional decisionmaking by the Supreme Court is wedded to precedent and not simply judgment. Michael Gerhardt, U of Pa Journal of Con Law “It should go without saying, however, that precedent functions”<br />

Choper &amp; Yoo 00 Ok City U LR<br />

<br />
Topicality – Overrule Morrison<br />
Topical affirmatives must reverse the SC stance on one or more of its holdings in a given case. IN the case of Morrison, topical affirmatives may hold that Congress derives authority to legislative the VAWA from the Commerce Clause or Section 5<br />
Epstein 99 US S Ct Briefs<br />
But this panel’s decision was set aside and subsequently overturned AND power was granted by this court<br />
<br />
Overrule a decision means to void or find the opposite of its holding<br />
Barron’s Dictionary of Legal Terms 2000<br />
Overrule: “To overturn or make void the holding (decision); generally accomplished in a different or subsequent case, when a court renders a decision that is substantially opposite the decision made in a prior case.<br />
<br />
A Decision is in the context of the USSC is both the decision and judgment<br />
Words and Phrase 1995 v11A p31<br />
“Decision” within constitutional provision permitting Supreme Court to review by certiorari decision of district court of appeal encompasses opinion and judgment and is determinative of case, not merely part of it. Zirin v. Charles Pfizer &amp; Co., Fla., 128 So.2d 594, 596.<br />
<br />
Violation: The USSC specifically avoided consideration of grounds besides Section 5 and the Commerce Clause – your aff is on-face extra topical<br />

Kritik<br />
A. Security is a performative discourse – rather than being a neutral description of the world, the 1AC is productive of the objects it is seeks to protect. To vote affirmative is to bring into being an entire ensemble of concepts and images deployed to harness entire population in the name of controlling a disordered, outside. The question of this round is not “what is to be done?” but “what it is it that we are producing? “What kind of thinkers are they asking you to be?”<br />
Campbell, 1998 (David, Writing Security, p. 199-202)<br />
Security and subjectivity are intrinsically... are all a part.<br />
<br />
B. This violent form of biopower claims to take responsibility for optimizing the life of the population. In combination with the destructive logic of sacrifice the has become the new norm of state conduct, the sovereign right to kill is transformed in to the right to let die in the name of collective life. Any amount of violence, no matter how potentially life annihilating, becomes justified.<br />
Mitchell Dean, 2001 (States of Imagination, 53-56)<br />
Consider again the contrastive terms ... of the modern state.<br />
<br />
C. Alternative –<br />
Vote negative to refuse the affirmative as an instance of the violent logic of security.<br />
<br />
This is not a refusal to ask after a way to avoid the destruction of forests or regional violence, it is a refusal to locate these questions with a framework which makes such impacts inevitable.<br />
<br />
By asserting our agency as political beings within the exclusionary field of international relations we can challenge the discursive dominance of security and open new possibilities for inter-subjective ethics. Don’t allow debate to be nothing more than a space for the ritual reptition of the tropes of statehood and sovereignty – vote not aff.<br />
Burke, 2002 (Anthony, Alternatives 27)<br />
It is perhaps easy to become despondent ... possibilities might be.<br />
<br />
Federalism<br />
A. Uniqueness – Supreme Court enforcing federalism nohw.<br />
Schapiro, March 2006 (Fordham Law Review, p.2136-7)<br />
In its recent federalism cases ... there must be lines.<br />
<br />
B. Link – the plan would overturn Lopez and set a precedent for total federalization of criminal law – that means the end of federalism<br />
Richard Epstein, 1999 (1999 U.S. Briefs 5;. 1999 U.S. S. Ct. Briefs LEXIS 315)<br />
No one can deny ... Congress’s commerce power.<br />
<br />
C. Impact – Supreme Court enforcement of US federalism key to global modeling<br />
Calabresi, 1995 (Steven G., Michigan Law Review, December)<br />
We have seen that a desire ... what is at state.<br />
<br />
Federalism stops global wars<br />
Ornstein, 1992 (Norman, The American Enterprise, v3, n1)<br />
No word in political theory ... new focus on federalism.<br />
<br />
<br />
COUNTERPLAN<br />
Text: The United States Supreme Court should adopt a new test for Commerce Clause jurisprudence by holding that the Commerce Clause establishes two distinct requirements: (1) Congress must be regulating “commerce” (2) which implicates commerce in more than one state.<br />
<br />
Further clarification as per the Nelson evidence.<br />
Grant S. Nelson, 2003 (55 Ark. L. Rev. 1213, A Commerce Clause Standard for the New Millennium: “Yes” to Broad Congressional Control over Commercial Transactions; “No” to federal legislation on Social and Cultural Issue.”<br />
The result of our quest... next millennium<br />
<br />
This solves all Commerce Clause confusion<br />
Nelson and Pushaw, 1999 (Grant S., Rober J., 85 Iowa L. Rev. 1)<br />
The chief advantage ... been deemed “local.”<br />
