Planned Parenthood v. Casey dismantled Roe v. Wade’s trimester framework in favor of a new interpretation of fetal viability: that women have a right to freedom from coerced motherhood until the fetus is able to, with or without technological assistance, survive outside the womb. New technology will make fetuses immediately viable, and will smother women’s liberty interests in favor of the state, posing a contradiction in the Supreme Court’s established jurisprudence.<br />
<br />
Son, Hyun Jee. Fall/Winter 2005. UCLA Women’s Law Journal. “ARTIFICIAL WOMBS, FROZEN EMBRYOS, AND ABORTION: RECONCILING VIABILITY'S DOCTRINAL AMBIGUITY.”<br />
<br />
<u>Casey dismantled Roe's n4 trimester framework</u> … surviving on its own outside the mother's womb<br />
<br />
Ectogenesis is the science of artificial wombs. It is on the horizon, and threatens to undermine a woman’s access to freedom from coerced motherhood by pushing the point of viability to conception. 41 states already have bans on freedom from coerced motherhood after viability, and the Bush administration concedes that the technology’s development will provide a powerful rationale under current Supreme Court doctrine to repeal women’s rights.<br />
<br />
Zimmerman 03 (Sacha, Fetal Position: The real threat to Roe v. Wade, The New Republic, August 18-25)<br />
<br />
Back in January, the abortion rights group naral Pro-Choice America … time pro-choicers start thinking of what they will say in response?<br />
<br />
<br />
The viability rule is a statement that the discourse of science can and should be used to trump the understandings, values and beliefs of women. This disrespect for womyn is inscribed into the constitution and validated by the Supreme Court in Casey’s viability rule. We cannot allow the state to denigrate the moral qualities and judgmental capacities of the womyn responsible for their fetus.<br />
<br />
Sheehan 01 (Katherine C., The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, 32 U. Tol. L. Rev. 229, Professor, Southwestern University School of Law)<br />
<br />
[*246] Thus, the Roe Court's ruling, reaffirmed in 1992 in Casey … these features demeans the value of human life and a mother's love<br />
<br />
<br />
The argument posited by the 1AC is not just ‘technology bad,’ rather, that the state’s shouldn’t force women to use ectogenesis because it removes the value of gestation and childbirth and reduces motherhood to the equivalent of genetic fatherhood—both parents contribute genetic material and wait for their bun to come out of their artificial oven. This process is the death of the womyn: the biological and social elements that give womyn a unique perspective towards childbearing are rendered useless. Once reproduction is displaced from womyn’s bodies, as it would be when the state forces use of ectogenesis, women will no longer have a means with which to negotiate the terms of their existence within patriarchy, and they will be eliminated.<br />
<br />
Eaton 05 (Sarah, A Womb with a View: Will Ectogenesis benefit women?)<br />
<br />
Judge Sorkow’s ruling reminds women that the Virgin Mary remains the standard of motherhood … reproductive reality what will women be expected to do in order to earn their keep<br />
<br />
<br />
The impact is global violence and suffering. The patriarchy is the mirror image of violence. We are not even prepared for what lies ahead—the final silencing of life, greed, imminent nuclear holocaust, hierarchies of supremacy, and unending violence. The hope of the world rests upon unmasking the blind constructions the Supreme Court’s viability standard. Supporting the patriarchy only aids this war against life itself, resulting in the rape of humanity and worldwide suicide.<br />
<br />
Hope 91 (Barbara, President and Executive Director for the House of Ruth in Pomona, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.salsa.net/peace/conv/8weekconv5-5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.salsa.net/peace/conv/8weekconv5-5.html</a>)<br />
<br />
<u>Why weren't we prepared for this - the imminence</u> … <u>chivalry or civilization. War is rape</u><br />
<br />
<br />
Because ectogenesis is a medical, rather than legal, concept, Casey’s viability standard will remain indeterminate. Advanced fetal development is required for a woman’s interest in debates about coerced motherhood and thus undermines the incentive to develop ectogenesis technology.<br />
<br />

C. Advanced Fetal Development as the Proper Object of … <u>not fetal independence from the mother's womb</u><br />
<br />
<br />
The 1AC provides a means to break the silence through our shared commitment to language. This act transforms our on-going struggle into a pathway to avoid annihilation. Our decision to be silent in the face of real world dangers is the ultimate threat to human survival from the daily tyrannies we each experience and the mockeries of separation that are forced upon womyn everywhere. Our ability to render the struggle visible and point out the vulnerability is our greatest strength.<br />

Affirmative Read: Casey<br />
<br />
Plan Text:<br />
Write out the affirmative's full plan text word for word. If the complete plan is already on a caselist or on a previous round report and hasn't changed, then you can simply indicate that.<br />
<br />
Overturn Casey “on the grounds that the substantive due process claim of states interest as per the viability standard in never compelling”<br />
<br />
Advantages:<br />
If a new affirmative is read or you hear a new advantage, you should get complete cites. Otherwise, just list the advantages that the affirmative claims.<br />
• Casey changes viability from trimester approach to technical viability<br />
• Science makes a fetus viable earlier and earlier<br />
• The viability rule is a statement that the discourse of science can and should trump the understandings, values and beliefs of women. We cannot allow the state to do this<br />
• State makes motherhood equivalent to generic fatherhood. This process ignores the woman and = death to her…..something about patriarchy<br />
• Impact is global violence and suffering<br />
• Hope rests upon us speaking out. supporting patriarchy only aids war against life itself.<br />
• “The 1ac provides a means to break the silence through our shared commitment to language. This act transforms our on-going struggle into a pathway to avoid annihilation. Our decision to be silent in the face of real world dangers in the ultimate threat to human survival from the daily tyrannies we each experience and the mockeries of separation that are forced upon women everywhere.

2AC Answers to Offcase Arguments:<br />
List the affirmative's answers to each offcase argument read. Get cites for any arguments that you have not heard before or don't have answers to.<br />
T overrule: counter interp – we overrule a precedent (I think they are topical but I’m not sure)<br />
<br />
CP: can’t capture speech act. The SC’s writing would make “break the silence” better.<br />
<br />
Fism: war is going on now. Discourse comes first. (no policy stuff)<br />
<br />
Aff Strategy Notes:<br />
If the affirmative straight turned a DA, read a kritik against a DA, or did anything else unusual, make a note of it here.<br />
<br />
They keep the distinction between advocacy and discourse very shady. The neg needs to clear up weather a CP captures the discursive advantages of aff. Also, be sure to attack the affs framework.<br />

Answers To Off Case Args<br />
Biz Con<br />
1. Neoliberalist thought leads to the logic of Giroux and ultimately extinction<br />
<br />
2. Courts have overruled many precedents<br />
<br />
3. Turn – economic considerations were used by the Dtriot School Board to justify Milliken – basing judicial practice on economic considerations makes class war and environmental destruction inevitable<br />
Wilson, 2000, 34 Akron L. Rev. 383, Lexis<br />
“An economic approach combining the insight-generating tools of microeconomics with the profoundly illuminating…powerful norms outside the courtroom.”<br />
<br />
4. Uniqueness overwhelms the link<br />
<br />
5. The Institutional change the aff enacts is a world revolution that will come into being piece by peace, without violence<br />
Unger, 2005 (What should the left propose? Verso, p. 164-166)<br />
<br />
Topicality – Total overrule<br />
1. We meet – invalidating local control to expand the scope of remedy negates Milliken’s precedential value<br />
Outlaws Legal Service, 2000, p.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.outlawslegal.com/refer/ch01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.outlawslegal.com/refer/ch01.htm</a><br />
“C. Stare Decisis. Stare decisis requires that the case before the court…the case is being tried”<br />
<br />
2. Local control precluded adequate scope of remedy<br />
Justice Burger, 1974 (418 U.S. 717)<br />
“The controlling principle consistently expounded…for an interdistrict remedy”<br />
<br />
3. Partial “overrule” is topic – invalidating a decision on a singal legal issue is sufficient<br />
Hill 2006, (The People’s Law Dictionary, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dictionary.law.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.law.com</a><br />
<br />
4. Counter interpretation – overruling a decision requires having the outcome be different based on the arguments from the dissent<br />
A. overrule requires that the prior holding is no longer precedent<br />
Hill 2006<br />
<br />
B. Overrule uses language from the dissent as basis for law<br />
Dunn, 2003 (113 Yale L.J. 493, 520-21, Lexis)<br />
“The Court’s power implicitly extends beyond creating…creating new law from scratch.”<br />
<br />
C. Decision is both holding and opinion – the dissent opinion can become law<br />
Judge Thompson, 7-2-2004, J.A.p. v. L.W.A., Alabama Appellate Courts<br />
“This court’s holding and opinion in J.A.P v. M.M., supra, became the law of the case…opinion in J.a.P. v. M.M., supra.<br />
<br />
4. we meet – the white and marshall dissent supported expanded district court power and a tighter plaintiff interest relationship<br />
Justice White, 1974 (418 U.S&gt; 717)<br />
<br />
5. Counter-interpretation superior<br />
a. predictability – the dissent evolves into the basis for overrule in the literature – all neg needs to do is look up the Milliken decision<br />
b. we solve offense – inclusion of “overrule” in the plan creates clarity about intent – neg gets core generic ground – neg interpret places an unfair burden on the aff<br />
Dunn, 2003, (113 Yale L.J. 493 511-12)<br />
“The predictable expression of the judgment helps to “control the meaning”…that action’s meaning.”<br />
c. interpretative communities – precedence has value not from the numerical outcome but from the evolving language of the decisions – only our interpretation accounts for the impact decisions have on norm-shaping – that’s impacted by our 1ac McCanin ev<br />
<br />
6. Overrule always requires special justifications outside the scope of the original decision<br />
George Costello, 11-29,2005, The Supreme Court’s Overruling of Constituional Precedent: An Overview)<br />
“Nonetheless, when justifying an overruling the Court usually looks for…major national controversy.”<br />
<br />
7. Topicality shouldn’t be an offense defense game – that causes a race to the bottom we just need to prove the counter interpretation is fine<br />
<br />
Minimalism DA<br />
1. The advantage is an impact turn to minimalism -<br />
<br />
2. Incorrect – the court works best when in it aggressively pursues remedies<br />
Peter M. Shane, 1998 (Law and Contemporary Problems, v61 no21<br />
“A relatively new attack on institutional remedies argues that…findings in school desegregation cases.”<br />
<br />
State Courts counterplan<br />
1. Turn – localization – Milliken was decided based on deferral to local authority – the Cp solves none of the case because it doesn’t change federal precedent or establish the legal and conceptual categories necessary to challenge the geographies of race – impact is wholesale sacrifice -ford and McCann ev<br />
More ev<br />
Carrion, 2005 (Educational Reform: Perpetuating Racial Idenitied Space Within Lawrence, Massachusetts in the Making of Community: Latinos in Lawrence, Massachusetts, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.necc.mass.edu/noncredict/wfdce/pdf/CommunityReport.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.necc.mass.edu/noncredict/wfdce/pdf/CommunityReport.pdf</a>.<br />
“Ford argues further that American jurisprudence…because “they are simply lines on a map”<br />
<br />
2. Overrule key<br />
A. In the legal process the replacement of world view is critical the CP is invisible – unger and Mc Canne v<br />
B. The Atypical speech act of overrule restablishes a new relationship between the court and the public – it is a creative act the cp is repetitive<br />
Yale law journal, November 2003<br />
“Judges sometimes perform a particular act of ruling…prudential or pragmatic considerations.”<br />
<br />
3. Perm do both<br />
<br />
4. Conditional PICs are illegitimate –<br />
A. Destroys neg ground – infinitely regressive<br />
B. Aff ground – all perms are severance which forces a straight turn<br />
C. Multiple worlds bad – justifies 50 Cps<br />
D – one dispo counterplan or one PIC<br />
E. VI for competitive equity<br />
<br />
5. Only changing the Milliken ruling radically reorients jurisprudence – CP leaves the books laws that paralyze desegregation efforts – fragmentation impacts inevitable<br />
Nathaniel Jones, 92 (61 Fordham Law Review 49)<br />
“I think that our jurisprudence would have been quite different if Milliken…moving toward the goal of a single society.”<br />
<br />
6. Turn – only the plan animates public imagination to confront radical right wing politics founded on racist violence<br />
Sumi Cho, February 2005, (7 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 809)<br />
“Granted, much of the “smirk and wink” approach…the courts of public opinion.”<br />
<br />
7. The CP is the status quo – Milliken forced state constitutional remedies to lead desegregation – they failed<br />
Myron Orfield, Summer 2006, 24 Law and Ineq. J. 269)<br />
“The recent half century anniversaries of the Brown decisions have produced much discussion….exists in reality.”<br />
<br />
8. State courts alone are ineffective – racist, non uniform and locally resistant to desegregation<br />
Temple Political and Civil Rights Law Review, Fall 1999 (Vol 9 No1<br />
“However, there are limits to the advantage of using the state court system…ensure complete compliance with Brown.”<br />

The “undue burden” standard in the Planned Parenthood v Casey decision<br />
marks the emergence of restrictions that functionally make abortions illegal<br />

Harms<br />
<br />
Advantage 1: Patriarchy<br />
<br />
Casey has empowered the state to accord the fetus more visibility,<br />
rendering the woman invisible, and forcing her to adopt the traditional<br />
heterosexist position of mother.<br />
Reilly 96 (Elizabeth A., 5 Am. U. J. Gender &amp; Law 147, The Rhetoric of<br />
Disrespect:<br />
<br />
Uncovering the Faulty Premises Infecting Reproductive Rights)<br />
The invisibility of women in abortion jurisprudence forces them to<br />
become passive participants in reproduction. She is seen as a bodiless<br />
shell lacking the substance it would take for her to be unduly burdened,<br />
and is therefore not of any real significance – she becomes<br />
nonexistent, and therefore worthy of neither a voice nor a life.<br />

The de facto ban on abortion creates illegal abortion syndicates that<br />
are run by a patriarchal worl that preys off of women<br />

<br />
Patriarchal domination is the root cause of all domination. Systematic<br />
dehumanization, ecological devastation, and annihilation are inevitable<br />
in a world of patriarchy<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Racism<br />
<br />
Anti-abortion legislation is driven by racism and disproportionately<br />
affects and targets women of color<br />
<br />
Spiezer, 2005 [California Western School of Law]<br />
<br />
If access to abortion is prohibited, poor women and women of color will<br />
suffer the most – it is already difficult for these women to exercise<br />
their right to reproductive choice<br />

<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood<br />
vs. Casey 505 US 833 (1992) by ruling that the “undue burden” standard<br />
is unconstitutional under the due process clause of the Fourteenth<br />
Amendment and defaulting to the “strict scrutiny” standard for abortion<br />
regulation<br />

Supreme Court action is critical to end the de fact ban on abortion<br />
itself and ensure privacy rights<br />

<br />
Reversion back to Roe would substantially challenge abortion restriction<br />
and allow them to be struck down as unconstitutional<br />
<br />
Jones, 2005 [Attorney for CFRR<br />
<br />
The beginning of Justice O’Connor’s opinion in Casey states that there<br />
is no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt. Against the assumption that<br />
legal reasoning will satiate our desire for justice, our affirmation<br />
validates a jurisprudence of doubt—one in which the perspective of women<br />
is reinvigorated in legal analysis not only in the simple preservation<br />
of her liberty, but also by realizing that the only way to change the<br />
discourses of power that the framers of the constitution developed is to<br />
take that power from those who wouldn’t relinquish it on their own. We<br />
must fight the invisibility of women in the law with a new legal order<br />
by disrupting the moral absurdity the law propagates in the portion of<br />
Casey that validates informed consent. We can not stay silent and watch<br />
as women still suffer from state coercion.<br />
<br />
Sheehan 97 (Katherine C., UCLA Women's Law Journal, Spring/Summer 1997,<br />
7 UCLA Women's L.J. 201, Toward a Jurisprudence of Doubt)<br />
<br />
Rejecting the language and framework of Casey will release us from the<br />
cycle of disrespect and conflict, preventing structural inequalities and<br />
violence. Respecting the woman as a competent decision maker leads to<br />
education, communication, and resolution.<br />
<br />
Reilly 98 (Elizabeth, The &quot;Jurisprudence of Doubt&quot;: How the Premises of<br />
the Supreme Court's Abortion Jurisprudence Undermine Procreative<br />
Liberty, 14 J. L. &amp; Politics 757)<br />
<br />
Our use of the legal framework is the necessary point to rethink revise,<br />
and reform<br />
<br />
The role of the ballot is to endorse the reinforcement of the right to<br />
an abortion. By voting affirmative you protect individual’s autonomy<br />
against the state and eliminate racial and ethic disparities.<br />
