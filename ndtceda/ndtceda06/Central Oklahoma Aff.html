Our affirmative does not read evidence per se. We play (in the Nietzschean sense) with the topic and with the star-spangled by Francis Scott Key. We distort and change the lyrics and add poetry of our own into it. There are selections of the lyrics in the 1AC come from Immortal Technique, and Sage Francis. We also sample random parts from Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus, in the very first pages of the book when we talk about desiring machines as well as examining transcendence. We also take parts of Nietzsche’s Thus spoke Zarathustra when playing with the ideas of life, love, authority, and ressentiment. We have a plan text which says: The United States Supreme Court should overrule ex parte Quirin.<br />
When faced with the question of why we should overrule said case we say because it is fucking sweet.<br />

<br />
Quirin is grounded in the herd mentality, in which the masses desire their own repression based on the fear of terrorism and national security. However this fascism is ignored by the public because they are grounded in the ressentiment that “terrorists” are evil and thus Americans are good. We however argue that this situation smells bad, and that we want a breath of fresh air.<br />
Deleuze and Guattari in ’72 (Gilles, and Felix, Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, p. XVI-II)<br />
<br />
Specifically the talking heads love to bombard us with the images of the sadistic pornography of the US military torturing the “non-American” prisoners. The security apparatus uses these images to scare the citizens into obeying without question the policies of the state apparatus. But the images serve another purpose, marking bodies designating them as subjected groups, “others” in which to be destroyed, while at the same time aiding in the endocolonization of the bodies which are marked “American.” The state then uses the law as a tool in which, the “Terrorist” body is marked as being an illegal enemy combatant, being outside the law. It is through this that ex parte quirin allows the US to turn the world into one giant panopticon.<br />
McClintock ’04 (Scott, Antioch university, Los Angeles, “The Penal Colony: Inscription of the subject in literature and Law, and Detainees as Legal Non-person at camp x-ray, Comparative Literature Studies 41.1 (2004) 153-167<em>avery)<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1(1942). People will ask us why we overrule this decision; our answer is that it is fucking sweet.<br />
<br />
It is time to take a breath of fresh air, politics is an experiment. It is time to abandon the subjected groups based on reactionary politics, and instead “roll the dice.” We are going on a strange journey and there will be no transcendence over us for comfort. We embrace the insecurity of not being able to understand what will ever happen. We are a constant becoming-revolutionary.<br />
May ’05 (Todd, Gilles Deleuze, p. 148-153)<br />
<br />
Finally we are the Pink Panther, living life like a rhizome, because for the nomad the adventure is in the journey and not the destination.<br />

Advantages:<br />

Non-Violence: somehow granting due-process ends the War on Terror, which users in non-violence (Tobias &amp; Ryan ’03; ??; Nobel Laureates ’00) offer peace or everything will be destroyed<br />
Militarism: Hastings ’04; COMD ’01 militarization is justification for all violence &amp; discrimination – must challenge &amp; resist the military concept itself<br />

2AC Answers to Offcase Arguments:<br />
List the affirmative's answers to each offcase argument read. Get cites for any arguments that you have not heard before or don't have answers to.<br />
Extra-T: decent block but it wen’t nowhere, the violation itself was never clear<br />
CP: give due process to anyone who wants it: PICs bad; no solvency; leaving loopholes gives Bush room to manipulate &amp; re-enact violence; due process isn’t a case-by-case basis thing; neg’s evidence is about refugee camps, not prisons; PERM<br />
Detention DA: no link, overturing Q doesn’t lead to retaining the Uighers; will be tortured in prison, this isn’t acceptable; small solvency for small # of people;<br />
Human Rights K (Speciesism): link of omission – voter for fairness; no link, non-violence assumes all of nature &amp; animals); cross-apply some case cards; extinction o/w<br />
Non-violence fails: non-violence AN transform the state &amp; solve for all world problems; be non-violent or we all die (some solvency card); Nagler ’82 cannot ever solve for violence with more violence; Wilson ’94 can confront privilege through non-violence – answer any claim to non-violence failing in reality to being an example of one movement that fell short, not evidence that it can’t work now.
