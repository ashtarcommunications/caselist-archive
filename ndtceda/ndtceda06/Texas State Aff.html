Contention 1 is Spatiality<br />
The court ruled in Milliken that interdistrict remedies to segregation were unconstitituion – this was based on a skewed perspective of jurisdictional boundaries and spatiality.<br />
<br />
Ford 2004<br />
(Richard T., Professor of Law at Stanford, “Brown at Fifty: Brown’s Ghost”, March, Harvard Law Review, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 1305, p. LN)<br />
<br />
&lt;Some would argue … had moved to the suburbs&gt;<br />
<br />
The Milliken decision upholds a spatially constructed apartheid based on support of a system of jurisdictional boundaries.<br />
<br />
Ford 1999<br />
(Richard T., Professor of Law at Stanford U., “Law’s Territory (a history of jurisdiction)”, Michigan Law Review, Feb. 97, Mich. L. Rev. 843, p. LN)<br />
<br />
&lt;South African apartheid was … most brash of revisionists squirm&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The government conception of space is misguided and based on an essentialist and deterministic view of the “urban underclass”. We cannot conflate locations with individuals and must recognize the difference in everyone. Existing systems perpetuate a system of racism, sexism, and classism that intersect and feed off of one another.<br />
<br />
Gilbert 2000<br />
(Melissa, Associate Professor of Geography and Urban Studies at Temple U., Gendering the City)<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt; In the mid-1960s … connections that could form the basis for political action&gt;<br />
<br />
The impact is omnicide<br />

Ford 1994<br />
(Clyde, Professor of Sociology at W. Washington U., We Can All Get Along, p. 186-7)<br />
<br />
&lt; Eliminating racism is not an isolated issue … ensuring the survival of humankind and the planet upon which we live &gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
We offer the following plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule the Milliken v. Bradley decision. Specifically, the United States Supreme Court should, using the standard of strict scrutiny, rule on the next available test case that the actions justified in Milliken v. Bradley do not meet strict scrutiny on the grounds that the current lese of space as opaque and/or transparent are inaccurate, and that political and social space, as well as an individuals’ spatiality, are vital to determine equality and must be encompassed in determining suspect classification in state policy. If you have any questions please ask. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 2 is Solvency<br />
The current conception of space sees it as divorced from social interactions. We must move toward a legal standard which recognizes spatial boundaries as the result of social interactions, ideological conceptions, and current legal doctrine, rather than natural and determinate constructions.<br />
<br />
Ford 1994<br />
(Richard T., Asst. Professor of Law at Stanford, “THE BOUNDARIES OF RACE: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY IN LEGAL ANALYSIS”, Harvard Law Review, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 1843, June, p. LN)<br />
<br />
&lt; C. Toward a Legal Conception of Space … need not be examined or justified. &gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Acknowledgement of spatiality is necessary to effectively solve social ills. We must add our voice to the criticisms that recognize the unique boundaries of urban women. Advocacy is key.<br />
<br />

<br />
Strict Scrutiny is the most appropriate standard to apply to the issue the affirmative deals with.<br />
<br />
Tolsdorf 2005<br />
(Peter, J.D., George Washington Law School, “If Separate, Then at Least Equal: Rethinking Brown v. Board of Education and De Facto Public School Segregation”, George Washington Law Review, April, 73, Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 668)<br />
<br />
&lt; The most demanding standard … under rational basis review. &gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
We must work through the system to achieve our desired goals. Utilizing the tools we have in the current system allows for us to break down the boundaries of oppression and power relations.<br />
<br />
Lopes de Souza 2002<br />
(Marca, Anthropologist, Z Magazine, “Some inductory remarks about a new city for a new society”, online)<br />
<br />
&lt; Of course, only on the basis of new social relations … “urban reform” can help us to prepare a new social order. &gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Social change must encompass and acknowledge spatiality to solve – policy change is key to reconstruction of spatiality.<br />
<br />
Uguris 2004<br />
(Tijen, socialist-feminist scholar, architect and political refugee from Turkey, PhD, University of Greenwich U.K., Space, Power, and Participation: Ethnic and Gender Divisions in Participation in Public Housing, p. 18)<br />
<br />
&lt; If space reflects social relations … whose full identity is a complex mix of all those identities. &gt;<br />
<br />
We must recognize the implications of jurisdictional boundaries – Discussion of spatiality and its construction in political-academic forums is key to change the statues quo and must be affirmed.<br />
<br />
Ford 1999<br />
(see above)<br />
<br />
&lt; A whole history remains to be … a failure to study the politics and legalities of space is a failure to map law’s territory &gt;<br />
<br />
A legal reconfiguration of spatiality is necessary for criticism to exist – failure to grasp the importance of place destroys political assembly and dissent.<br />
<br />
Zick 2006<br />
(Timothy, Associate Professor, St. John’s U. School of Law, “Space, Place, and Speech: The Expressive Topography”, April, George Washington Law Review, 74 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 439, p. LN)<br />
<br />
&lt; It is imperative, especially now, that courts and scholars engage “place.” … it has long been assumed to be in their respective fields of study. &gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The effects of spatiality must be seen as inseparable from legal discussion.<br />
<br />
Frankenburg 2002<br />
(Eric, Research Assistant at the Civil Rights Project of Harvard U., “The Impact of School Desegregation on Residential Housing Patterns”, Teachers College, Columbia U., August, p. online at www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/reseg02/frankenberg.pdf)<br />
<br />
&lt; As Delaney states … determined the question of remedial space to effect desegregation plans &gt;<br />

Perm- We must look to conventional and critical alts of resistance toward current systems of spatial subordination. We must embrace a vision of the thirdspace in which the firstspace and secondspace advocacies are combined and work together to solve.<br />

Legal examination of spatiality is key to break down hegemonic legal identity construction<br />
