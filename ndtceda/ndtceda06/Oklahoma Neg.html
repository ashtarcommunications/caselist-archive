1NC off case position #1: State Bad K<br />
<br />
1NC Structure and cites: Begins with a Malcolm X speech about how we need a “Do It Yourself Program”.<br />
<br />
Does a sweet rap which they wrote about why the state is bad<br />
<br />
Indites the state as being against Afrocentric view points.<br />
<br />
Argues that choice doesn’t mean access. Not everyone can afford an abortion.<br />
<br />
Says that the government just gives rights to make itself look good and then takes them back. It continues on to say that when rights are given; it stifles movements to gain more rights.<br />
<br />
Continues on to say that we must stand along side of the oppressed and that’s what pragmatic in the eyes of the oppressor isn’t always pragmatic to the oppressed.<br />
<br />
The alternative is to “Fuck the System”<br />
<br />
Key 2NC/1NR arguments and cites: Can’t be half in and half out “It’s like being an Oregon fan and an OU fan”<br />
<br />
They explain their movement as a series of Guerilla Attacks on the state. They give the example of a field slave versus a house slave. The house slave says “Hey, Masters done some good stuff it’s not that bad” while the field slave says “Fuck the system, we need to escape”<br />
<br />
Goes on to argue that the government can survey you and that they will shut down the movment if they find out about it.<br />
<br />
2NR: Extends these arguments. There are raps and Malcom X quotes throughout.<br />

Our argument is called the Fox News Exclusive<br />
<br />
The modern age is characterized by a disavowal of tragedy. The triumph of Socratic reason manifests in our attempt to resolve the chaotic aspects of life and avoid suffering. This requires the construction of an ideal “Real” world toward which our apparent world aspires. Enter the affirmative. In the modern drive toward certainty and security and in an attempt at renouncing disorder and insecurity, the plan labors to mold and order the world ot make it dupilicate our idealized image of order<br />
Paul Saurette, 1996 I Muststrust all Systematizers and Avoid them Neitzsche, Arendt and the Crisis of the Will to Order in International Reltionas Theory, MIllenium Journal of International Studies, Vol. 25, No. 1, 3-6<br />
According to Nietzsche, the philosophical foundation…philosophical principle of modernity<br />
<br />
The affirmative will always be able to locate some external threat to world order. It is not a coincidence that Breaking News occurs every fifteen minutes because einternational politics are unpredictable. The insecurities cited by the affirmative are not unique; international terrorism is an neighborhoods and there might just be poison in our children’s Halloween candy. The uncomfortable yet irresistible truth is that uncertainty and risk art part and parcel of human life. Rather than coming to terms with this, the affirmative encourages us to stay glued to the television screen, stocking up on duct tape and water. At issue here is not just life itself but what makes life valuable. We encourage indifference and carelessness in a world inherently characterized by insecurity in an attempt to reclaim joy from the affirmative’s world of paranoid tiptoeing.<br />

1NC: CP, environment management K, CRR turns<br />
<br />
CP:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that any restrictions on abortion violate a woman’s right to selfhood and are therefore unconstitutional.<br />
<br />
The civil rights remedy is inherently gendered – by focusing on simply remedying the injury, it glosses over the social and cultural contributions to violence &amp; disguises the intent to cause injury by many female perpetrators. The aff implicitly sanctions domestic violence against males, turning the case<br />
Linda Kelly, 3, “Disabusing the Definition of Domestic Abuse: How Women Batter men and the Role of the Feminist State” 30 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 791<br />
“Acknowledging the damage…for the ills of society”<br />
<br />
VAWA’s gender animus standard constructs a myth of the crazed male rapist, disguising other forms of motivations of violence. Rejecting the AFF is a pre-requisite to the emergence of different strategies that combat the sources of all violence<br />
Kelly 3<br />
“From the theoretical definition…housing and crisis intervention”<br />
<br />
The legal system and state gain much more from the plan than women gain from access to federal courts. The aff enmeshes women in a disciplinary and paternalist paradigm that leaves sexist institutions intact and unquestioned<br />
Elayne Rapping, 2K “The Politics of Representation: Genre, Gender Violence and Justice”<br />
“Here then we have a case…in general, are lived, gone?”<br />
<br />
We agree that the sexes difference and in certain cases this merits sexuate rights. Abortion is just such an example. The CP solves all of the case by grounding the right to abortion in a specific sexed civic identity for women. This shatters the neutrality, concerning abortion, which is an issue that can only affect women<br />
Caldwell, their author, 2<br />
“Not only does Irigaray…those of men infinitely less; and so on”<br />
<br />
B. Imperalism<br />
Do not be fooled – the aff’s championing of “universal” rights disguises their complicity in cultural imperialism. Their condemnation of cultural intolerance denies liberalism’s own attachment to cultural norms and values that are equally invested in violence.<br />
Wendy Brown, 2K6 <u>Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire</u>, p. 22-24<br />
“In short, in our time…neither tolerant nor tolerable”<br />
<br />
And, the attempt to mask liberalism’s participation in violence and oppression is no more evident than in issue of gender. Their call for U.S. promotion of freedom globally gains its legitimacy only by juxtaposing it with ‘intolerant” cultures in need of tolerance. This civilizational discourse whitewashes American gender oppression, turning the case<br />
Brown, 2K6, p. 188-90<br />
“Liberal tolerance discourse not only hides…liberalism with civilization”<br />
<br />
This civilizational politic makes war inevitable – the flipside of tolerance conferred upon deviant cultures is the power to withhold tolerance – to be intolerant ourselves. Societies not living up to the “international obligations” are construed as beyond civilization itself – barbaric enemy – others not worthy of protection, only elimination<br />
Brown, 2K6<br />
“That tolerance is preferable to violent…freedom of identity”<br />

Environment K<br />
The affirmatives view of the environment and capitalism is not as innocent as it appears. it represents a subjective knowledge of the world infused with a managerial ethos. this approach maintains the view that the environment as a natural resource for consumption. the plan legitimizes capitalist consumption. they do not strike a blow to neo-liberalism. they only strive for creative ways to maintain resources to consume.<br />

Before scientific disciplines...perhaps intensive utilization.<br />

The affs attempt to counteract environmental catastrophe through resource management techniques does not yield solutions- it is part of hte problem istelf. the desire to control only makes disaster inevitable. we must embrace a new thinking that abandons mastery and allows the world to show itself on its own terms.<br />

The Affirmative's use of the commerce clause commodifies equality by trying it to adequate repayment. this turns the aff- the logic of commensurability makes both victims and perpetrators abstract categories in symbolic exchange.<br />

And this elimination of moral passion from politics turns thier public/private arguments- By upholding rational equality in the public sphere, the affirmative maintains patriarchal liberalism, confining the everything &quot;irrational&quot; to the private sphere, turning the case.<br />

Visual metaphors are the constructions of a white, male, protestant discourse on the law. The aff’s selection of visual metaphors maintains the hegemony of this elite and directly disempowers marginal identities.<br />

“<u>The traditional visuality of</u> .....their particular experiences.”<br />
<br />
Visual metaphors invest the law in a phenomonology of sight. This turns the case. Visuality alienates and abstracts, it is ahistorical and objective. It presumes a detached, timeless and static law which governs universally and occludes particularity. In other words, the law’s association with sight is responsible for its inflexibility and its distance from all things human.<br />

<br />
Aural legal metaphors subvert traditional understandings of the law and allow for it to be theorized in new ways. The law articulated as voice unfolds as subjective, relational, concrete. It allows for an understanding of the situatedness of the law. Moreover, it allows for legal theory to examine the particularities and realities of lives affected by the law.<br />

1. Omission is deadly—in their effort to publicize the deaths of victims of US imperialism abroad they omit any consideration of the lives made unlivable tht they might be able to speak to us today. The aff devotes itself to a pet project while leaving more fndamental questions unresolved. Where are we? How did we get here? The 1ac fails to answer these questions and the question posed by Quirin. This abandonment of politics betrays a fundamental complicity on the part of the affirmative. They theorize identity, discourse, relationality but fail to come to terms with a prior material issue: we are and remain occupants of stolen land. Complicity guarantees that the aff can only reaffirm existing colonial structures.<br />
<br />
Ward Churchill, <em>From a Native Son</em>, 1996, p. 520-521<br />
<br />
2. The patterns of abuse documented by the aff in the WOT are only extensions of domestic experiments in imperialism gone horribly correct. The violence of the Bush administration is informed by the logic of colonialism that began in 1492 and continues in the hearts and minds of even seemingly radical political projects like the aff so long as they remain indebted to a system of colonialism which privileges academics at the expense of natives.<br />
<br />
Paul Street, March 11, 2004. “Those Who Deny the Crimes of the Past Reflections on American Racist Atrocity Denial, 1776-2004.” “It is especially important to appreciate the significance of the vicious…”<br />
<br />
3. Given the aff’s negligence, our alt is to prioritize land return 1st. this must come before engaging the aff, which abandons political questions in favor of theoretical gestures which only comfort cushions on which colonialism rests. Liberation of native land makes possible all other political struggles. Absent this priority, those other struggles only remake structures of domination which make possible the conditions the aff criticizes. The focus of social energy must be first and foremost “US off the planet.”<br />
<br />
Ward Churchill, <em>From a Native Son</em>, 1996, p. 524-525<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The aff is not a revolutionary rethinking of political conditions but the same old tired theorizing of identity and relationality which conveniently omits any consideration of the material forces that write people out of existence. The aff is a false start—their analyses of the discourses surrounding the WOT obscure a criticism of material conditions which makes war on differences inevitable.<br />
<br />
Paul Smith. “Precarious Politics.” <em>Symploke</em>. 12: 1-2-2004. “But things have changed even in the few months since the book’s publication…”<br />
<br />
<br />
Only such a reprioritization is capable of addressing, in any material way, international violence waged by the U.S. The violence done by the American nation state demands of us real political interventions that require real sacrifices. In a world where Bush declares openly that you are with us or against us, we should take him at his word. There is no third option—Americans may take up their historical responsibility for coming to terms with and preventing the violence carried out in their names, or they can remain complicit with the privilege that that violence affords them, trivializing politics to a matter of media analysis so as to ensure that the system remains the same.<br />

Nietzche<br />
<br />
The aff substitutes moralizing for true change. Their effort to establish racism as morally heinous in the law fixes the identities of both the perpetrator and victim, legitimizing law and cleansing it of its role in subordination. This fails to contest overall regimes of domination. Wendy Brown, <em>States of Injury</em>, 1995, 26-7 “There is a …hurt as the sufferer does.”<br />
<br />
The politics of inclusion and citizenship work as a legitimating mask for the state – inclusion reaffirms the hegemonic core while maintaining the dichotomy between inside and outside, turning the case. Rita Dhamoon, 2k5, Beyond Inclusion Politics: Reconstituting the Political Order, online “Inclusion is generally presented as if”<br />
<br />
The aff’s use of the economy as a yardstick of equality buttresses capitalism, turning the case. The “option” they extend to desegregate is a way of defining rational actors in the marketplace, absolving the state and the law of responsibility for violence. It also blocks deeper critique of the causes of violence by reducing solutions to instrumental calculation. Wendy Brown, Neo-Liberalism and the End of Liberal Democracy, <em>Theory and Event</em> 7:1, 2k3, “For our purposes what is crucial”<br />
<br />
Their focus on a shared responsibility and commensurate public spaces aggregates society, effacing difference and occluding alternative visions of politics, turning the case. Michael Shapiro, 1997 Bowling Blind, <em>Theory &amp; Event</em> 1:1 “Putnam offers some compelling observations; the data”<br />
<br />
Our Alternative is to pursue political struggle without recourse to the affirmative’s moralizing and debilitating gestures. Refusing the normative assumptions of the aff allows us to move toward one another, forging real human relationships grounded in now higher order and mediated by no external law. Wendy Brown <em>State</em> <em>of Inquiry</em>, 1995 p.48 “our alternative to reliance…modes of adjudication.”<br />
<br />
In the context of the resolution’s call to action, this means doing nothing we are unsure of to a blueprint for collective action toward “solving” separation, but we know that the aff’s call for regulation of human interactions and the naturalization of market domination is hardly worth it. Rest assured, no team or argument is capable of ending bigotry, however only rethinking political struggle can create the possibility for ethical responsibility to each other and ourselves. Zizek 2k4 <em>Iraq: The Borrowed Kettle</em>, p. 71-2 “The stance of…kind of activity.”<br />
<br />
We must distinguish theory from politics. Wendy Brown, 2k1 <em>Politics Out of History</em> p.41 “Stuart Hall once..paradox?”<br />
- - -<br />
The aff’s positioning of powerful system of oppression to which the powerless objects of control must respond is analogous to the Aryan sullying of the Judeo ethics that was a necessary prerequisite to the Holocaust – In other words, Nietzche eats babies args are not unique and linked turned – genocides and other atrocities are up now because of ethics and the reason is that ethical systems are incompatible – to erect one, we must eradicate the other. The impact is genocide – and their offense is not unique. Robert Wistrich, 2k3, <em>Hitler and the Holocaust</em> online “Throughout recorded time, there have been countless massacres”<br />
<br />
Perm doesn't escape the links – A. Mastery B. Sovereignty. William Connolly, <em>Identity / Difference</em> 91, p. 29-31 “With respect to….more cogently.”<br />
<br />
The aff’s privileging of the public sphere effaces spatial and temporal differences of modern poltics. Disenfranchised people are not looking for some place to engage in democratic politics, but are responding in their own life-worlds to the pressures of normalization of economic exploration. The political space that they seek is sanitized and surveilled, part and parcel of the techniques of administration and control that subjugate minority communities in the squo. Michael Shapiro, 1997 Bowling Blind, <em>Theory &amp; Event</em> 1:1 “The traditional liberal discourse on politics”<br />
<br />
<br />
Case debate<br />
<br />
Aff informed by white/non-white dichotomy while essentializing all experiences of people of color, preventing a particular investigation of oppression. Kristi Bowman, 2k1, The New Face of School Desegregation, Duke Law Journal, “White privilege is reinforced when racial and ethnic”<br />
<br />
The aff is social engineering that instrumentalizes racial identity and increases racism. John Lee, 1996, Suffolk Law Review “the Supreme Court reasoned that race-conscious measures were”<br />
<br />
We turn your aff – your approach to desegregation renders children of color invisible. The desegregation efforts of the 1ac make children pawns in a larger social chess game. Instead of focusing on what the children’s interests are, the aff defers these questions to their larger goal of a racially harmonious society. David Hall, 2k6, Boston College Third World Law Journal, “Black children were the primary intended beneficiaries”<br />
<br />
Spatial politics are good – their integration imperative is ideology par excellence. It crushes local autonomy and equality in blind allegiance to notions of progress. Their idea that desegregation produces a linear path to full equality is ethnocentric devalues local communities. John Calmore, 1996 <em>Race, Poverty, and American Cities</em> UNC Press p. 315-7 “It is now time to rethink integration and examine its fundamental”<br />
<br />
Integrated schools have harsher punishments for minorities. Derrick Bell, 1978, <em>Theory into Practice</em> 17(2), JSTOR “It is a paradox, but experience indicates”<br />
<br />
Their contact hypothesis is wrong and increases racism, turning the case. Faltz and Leake, 1996 <em>Beyond Desegregation</em> p. 240-1 “The major premise underlying…desegregation years.”<br />
<br />
The aff maintains the curriculum of American schools 2 ways: they create an investment in it as a tool of reform in politicians and they back racist segregated school officials into a corner that causes them to defend their cultural norms. Wendy Brown Scott, 1999 Journal of Gender Race &amp; Justice “Second, by failing to address the problem”<br />

Mathiesen argues that prisons still exist because… its continued existence.<br />
<br />
Prisons are exemplary of the logic of permanent war – the war on crime at home becomes the war on terror internationally<br />

Need a billion dollars a day…become brutal and coarse.<br />
<br />
It’s easy, in the midst of the brutality and lawlessness of the Bush administration to call for law to restore some sesen of stability. This call, however, is precisely what makes torture and concentration camps acceptable. The extenision of token constitutional rights only dresses up the war on terrorism and the right themselves become tools in further panoptic control<br />

It is difficult not to be disturbed… equally efficient elimination.<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s invovking of Constiutitonal rights and extension of even the most benevolent protections misunderstands the nature of the law itself. It reaffirms the logic of sovereignty, automtatically commencing the constiutiton of the border between the self and other, turning the case<br />

NIETZSCHE<br />
<br />
Our argument is called the Fox News Exclusive<br />
<br />
The modern age is characterized by a disavowal of tragedy. The triumph of Socratic reason manifests in our attempt to resolve the chaotic aspects of life and avoid suffering. This requires the construction of an ideal “Real” world toward which our apparent world aspires. Enter the affirmative. In the modern drive toward certainty and security and in an attempt at renouncing disorder and insecurity, the plan labors to mold and order the world ot make it dupilicate our idealized image of order<br />

According to Nietzsche, the philosophical foundation…philosophical principle of modernity<br />
<br />
The affirmative will always be able to locate some external threat to world order. It is not a coincidence that Breaking News occurs every fifteen minutes because einternational politics are unpredictable. The insecurities cited by the affirmative are not unique; international terrorism is an neighborhoods and there might just be poison in our children’s Halloween candy. The uncomfortable yet irresistible truth is that uncertainty and risk art part and parcel of human life. Rather than coming to terms with this, the affirmative encourages us to stay glued to the television screen, stocking up on duct tape and water. At issue here is not just life itself but what makes life valuable. We encourage indifference and carelessness in a world inherently characterized by insecurity in an attempt to reclaim joy from the affirmative’s world of paranoid tiptoeing.<br />

Genocide of low income women (x)<br />

BP control means exterminate full pops – must be rejected (Foucault)<br />
Alt: Reject the mkt model of choice (Freed 02 – the notion of choice must be expanded)<br />
The way we represent women – they represent as inhibited (Doty 96 – representations important aspect to life)<br />

Liberal De-Mystify: Women not hysterical – shifts the burden, structure of intelligibility<br />
They guar the (shift queerness to someone else, politics of signification, eliminate queerness, shine the cool light of reason)<br />
Hysteria is a model for general queerness, OS the frame of intelligibility (Matthew Shepard)<br />
Refuse the call for inclusion: embrace the hysteria of unintelligibility – they MT – another must come to fill (Edelman – the ongoing legitimacy, the norms of the social order do, in fact, change)<br />
Their choice model is futurity, which is bad (should and must define notions of civil order and futurity)<br />

2NC (K1 Choice)<br />
Juridical: Perry says power operates through women, defining some area = line where govt control is legit – carving a small space in the BP state<br />
Only ones seeking to expand the law – remove a barrier – ignores inability to make decision: all excluded, only once in the clinic<br />
Law shapes reality: generic ev, focus is only the end result of pregnancy (by starting at that point, the social calculations, look at RP – pro choice, priv not DA women)<br />
Make deviant sexuality act naturally<br />
Ties abortion to wealth and status (avoid the A-word and rights claims)<br />
Arg is confining to decision = ignore the social, economic and racial constraints – most women cannot get there, free from BP regulation, enforce other regulations<br />
Not fund alter the state, racial considerations<br />
Constrain and present women = ignores those unable to access it<br />
Next ev: excluded from RP rights, personhood: this conception not a fund right but refusal – baby makers view (personhood thesis, betrays political aspirations, the very premise, must defend BC self – defining her ID, the very purpose, only if viewed as natural – other grounds – fund act of self definition = motherhood assumption; BC avoiding a forced ID – the real flaw of the personhood account)<br />
Vand – link, grounded in choice and DM – abortion is restricted (Soldier 01 – supposed to be legitimate consumers, planning some groups as good and bad, choice driven, legal restrictions)<br />
Soldier: the radical right, eliminate one particular form: not speak about fundamental, hollow out particular RS – terror, legit other forms, liberatarians, GOP – informed consent and parent notification – they remain<br />
Rep are critical: further will be permanent (Doty 96 – structures in meaning, construction of meaning, ethical imperative, poltical states = get past or speak outside there –<br />
Perm: lacks a NB, we are not DC of law; their approach legit other forms; reformism OK but their reform UM effective reforms; good vs bad DM’s too<br />
Confines only to the individual, not view as hysterical (distort the reality of many women)<br />
<br />
1NR<br />
Went wrong when settled for inclusion, shifting the burden of deviance – the early black national mvmt – fuck up your entire social order<br />
Our point – this image is always imposed – the 1ac – take the advice of the reactionaries, shatters the fantasy of social wholeness – presume others WANT TO BE rationalized – Edelman, conceded L claim<br />
This link turn is assimilation: shine the cool light of reason on hysteria: expand intelligibility; keeps the figure, whoever else stands outside of meaning (Edelman 04)<br />
Perm’s acceptable of rationality is the link (x)<br />
Robinson is not specific to the pol move – specificity of evidence: cede to the figure of hysteria shatters the social order – calling B.S. can make us ALL seem hysteriacal – cannot have Dsicrm and partial govt (x)<br />
<br />
Their idea of inclusion keeps in place structures of unintelligibility – only ours – they might shine the cool light of reason, the figure is alive as a tomb for someone else to fill<br />

SAME DAMN CARD?<br />
<br />
Right to privacy refers to reproductive liberty as simply a matter of choice, which obscures the socioeconomic realities of women, masking the denial of access to abortion for poor women and women of color. The aff confines abortion rights to the individual<br />
Solinger 01 BEGGARS AND CHOOSERS p21-2<br />
Poor mothers … shortsightedness<br />
<br />
Focus on choice is “rights lite” – it ties abortion access to wealth and status<br />
Solinger 01 BEGGARS AND CHOOSERS p4-5<br />
During the late … unadulterated rights<br />
<br />
By framing abortion as a matter of choice, the “right” to abortion becomes restricted to those who have the resources to “choose” an abortion. Choice driven restrictions undermine equality for all women<br />
Solinger 01 BEGGARS AND CHOOSERS p6-7<br />
I use the term … legal abortion<br />
<br />
Confining abortion to the realm of privacy doctrine understands abortion only as a “choice” issue while obscuring racial class considerations that limit access to abortion<br />
Colker 94 PREGNANT MEN: PRACTICE THEORY AND THE LAW p188<br />
Tribe’s more recent … disadvantaged women<br />
<br />
Abortion should not be seen as a “fundamental” right that women exercise in defining their identity, but rather as the refusal of identities that are forced onto women as a result of pregnancy. The aff’s politics reinforces the same “fundamental” conception of women that posits them as baby-makers. This turns the entirety of the aff<br />
