Round #8 NDT<br />
Vs Team:Dartmouth HK<br />
Judge: Waldinger, Perkins, Watson<br />
<br />
Case Args:<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
T- Special Justification<br />
<br />
Sunburst CP<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should uphold its decision that military commissions are not unconstitutional on the basis that overruling would undermine judicial deference to reliance interests. Deploying the technique utilized in Great Northern Railway Company v. Sunburst Oil and Refining Company, the USSC will hold that a new rule is established dictating that in all future cases courts should hold that military commissions violate the due process clause of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution.<br />
The USSC will announce that the Quirin precedent is no longer reliable and that relevant parties should be on notice that the reliance interests which cause it to uphold the decision in this case will not apply to future challenges on the issue.<br />
The USSC will not deny certirori in challenges on the issue.<br />
For all cases except for Quirin, the USSC will not overrule any of its prior decisions for the duration of the term. The USSC will use the technique of “sunbursting” explained above, for all decisions which conflict with a prior Supreme court precedent.<br />
<br />
<br />
The cp solves the whole case while avoiding the disads – the new standard set up by our counterplan will be applied by the court in the future, solves all their uncertainty and confusion arguments better than the plan, and results in the plan in a future case without undermining stare decisis.<br />
Auerbach 91<br />
“Overruling refers to …it would otherwise be.”<br />
<br />
The cp spurs a quick test case to test the new rule and the court will uphold the new rule in that test case<br />
Robbers 68<br />
“There is one person…suffered a grave sacrifice”<br />
<br />
The cp doesn’t create uncertainty or confusion and it would be applied by the court in the future<br />
Steele 92<br />
“Commentators also are…the new rule is unrealistic”<br />

<strong>Counteradvocacy</strong> <u>– provide insurance for gendered violence and overruling Morrison bad<br />
<strong>The mandatory nature of the insurance policy solves and bolsters deterrence.</strong><br />
Wriggins 2001 (Jennifer, Prof of law @ Univ of Main school of Law, Southern California Law Review. 75 S. Cal. L. Rev. 121)<br />
“This Article offers a more effective approach……part of automobile insurance.”<br />
<strong>Overruling Morrison undermines federalism causing war and genocide</strong><br />
Calabresi 1995. (94 Mich. L. Rev. 752)<br />
“The prevailing wisdom is that the Supreme Court….importance of what is at stake.”<br />
<strong>The impact outweighs – civil conflict is the single greatest threat to humanity.</strong><br />
Lake and Rothchild. 98 (the international spread of ethnic conflict. P 539)<br />
“Today, there are more than thirty-seven…..a new world disorder.”<br />
<strong>Turns case – domination operates through division of people along identity categories. War is only possible when the strict lines are drawn on the map.</strong><br />
Clifford. 2001. (Michael. Political Geneology After Foucault. Pg 144-146<br />
“Perhaps all this sounds too playful for the serious business……other than what we presently are.”<br />
<strong>The aff goes to far – it grants congress police powers to regulate anything and undermines its own goals.</strong><br />
Curt Levey. (47 Loy L. Rev.535)<br />
“Let me get into a little more detail…..just cannot be right.”<br />
<strong>Federalism is better for liberal goals- particularly in the context of gender.</strong><br />
Curt Levey. (47 Loy L. Rev.535)<br />
“One last point about the Fourteenth Amendment…..think that is appropriate.”</u><br />
<strong>Personal is Political__</strong><br />
<strong>The aff’s transformation of the personal into the political is a bad form of resistance. It demobilizes structural approaches and trades off with political opposition and suffering.</strong><br />
Tonn 2005. [Mari Boor, Prof of Communication @ U Maryland. “Taking Conversation, Dialouge, and Therapy Public,” Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 8.3, project Muse]<br />
“Fourth, a communicative model that views public issues……citizens to “heal” themselves.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Debating in favor of state action is necessary to accomplish their political goals. Civil society depend on state reforms for existence and success.</strong><br />
Chandhoke 2002. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2002/2002chapter2.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts /global/Publications/Yearbooks /2002/2002chapter2.pdf__</a><br />
“on the other hand, global civil society…..looms especially large here.”<br />
<strong>Material changes are a prerequisite to liberation malleable discourses can justify the same oppression.</strong><br />
Murphy 1992 [“Domesticating Dissent: The Kennedy’s and the Freedom Rides” <em>Communication Monographs. Pg 32]</em><br />
“This problem plagues Condit’s…..fighting for a change.”<br />
<strong>Resistance strategies that couch critiques of the status quo in personal identity politics ensure social fragmentation and the wrost potentials of postmodern anything goes politics. Abandoning the focus on identity in favor of public deliberation in spaces like debate about collective political goals and strategies is the one way to achieve meaningful social change.</strong><br />
Brown 95 [Wendy Prof of Poli Sci @ Berkeley. <em>States of Injury.</em> Pg 49-51]<br />
“What post modernity disperses……taste for political argument.”<br />
<strong>Standpoint epistemology demands confessionality – the will to :tell the truth” of the experiences of the marginalized masks the disciplinary production of truth and insulates identity and experience from contestation. Privileging any single form of knowledge risks disastrous depoliticization universalism.</strong><br />
Brown 95 [Wendy Prof of Poli Sci @ Berkeley. <em>States of Injury.</em> Pg 41-43]<br />
“Indeed, those familiar with…..clamoring for position.”<br />
<strong>Alternatives that posit themselves outside the state backfire and fail. They abscure the best solution, debate their own agency, and reify what they critique.</strong><br />
Alison Mountz 2003. Antipode Vol 35 Page 622. obtained via Blackwell Synergy.<br />
“The state maintains the exclusive right to create….arrangement of social practices.”<br />
<strong>The role of the ballot is to adjudicate democratic deliberations about public policy – their combination of the ballot and personal experience erodes competition, which is a prereq to democratic contestation.</strong><br />
