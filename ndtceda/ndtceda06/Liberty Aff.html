Thus we offer the following plan<br />
The United States Supreme Court should grant certiorari to a relevant test case and overrule its decision in Ex Parte Quirin on the grounds that military commissions violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution.<br />

Using a relevant test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison 529 U.S. 598 by holding that section 13981 of the Violence Against Women Act (of 1994) is Constitutional based on power given to Congress in Article I, Section 8, Clause 10 of the Constitution.<br />

If the Supreme Court used Congress’ Offenses Clause power to evaluate 13981 the case would be overturned.<br />

Observation Two: The Advantages<br />
Advantage 1 – Bad Boys Bad Boys<br />
Parental consent legislation demoralizes waves of young women by forcing them to accept an inferior position in society. This is particularly true for younger women whose emotional and psychological development is dependent upon personal decision making. Failure to combat traditional stereotypes about women make full equality in society impossible.<br />

Advantage 2 is ABUSE<br />
Parental involvement laws commonly result in denial of the right to abortion. The alternative to this is women often die from illegal back ally abortions. Even when consent is given the resulting delays increase medical risks and costs.<br />

<strong>1. Inherency<br />
Despite desegregation requirements, U.S. public schools are resegregating rapidly, which is leading to unequal educational opportunities for children of color<br />
La Raza law Journal, 2004<br />
<br />
2. Plan Text<br />
- The United States Supreme Court should overrule Milliken v. Bradley on the grounds that it violates the Equal Rights Protection Clauses found in the 14th Amendment in the U.S. Constitution.<br />
- Funding and enforcement guaranteed. We reserve the right to clarify.<br />
<br />
3. Advantage 1<br />
- Significance<br />
- The current trend of resegregation is having a negative impact on the effectiveness of the U.S. educational system.<br />
- Orfield, 2006<br />
- Link<br />
- A strong educational system provides for a thriving and more stable economy<br />
- Paul, 1992<br />
<br />
- Terminal Impact<br />
- The U.S. economy is in a very fragile state. Because of this, the economy is vulnerable, and could suffer dramatically, even slip into a recession with just the slightest negative effect<br />
- Walker, 2006<br />
- Solvency<br />
- Desegregation will positively effect African-American education and help to increase learning, as well as raise test scores<br />
- Zahler, 1999<br />
4. Advantage 2<br />
- Significance<br />
- Segregation is still in practice, and as a result, African American children still receive education that is inferior to the education that white children receive<br />
Gross, 2001<br />
- Link<br />
- Segregation leaves African-Americans at a disadvantage for life because it sets them up for failure by enforcing and creating racial stereotypes, placing them at a disadvantage for a job, and ultimately hurting their value of life.<br />
Munroe, 2000<br />
- Impact<br />
-Racism is something that has become prevalent in the U.S. and must be dismantled. If we choose not to eradicate racism, we choose a world that is doomed for destruction.<br />
-Brandt, 1991<br />
- Solvency<br />
-Desegregation and racial integration will dramatically help at breaking down the racial boundaries and stereotypes created by a history of discrimination.<br />
-Seitles, 1996<br />
- Framework<br />
- Nuclear weapons demonstrate that focusing only on survival jeopardizes existence- we must risk extinction to uphold basic rights.<br />

Advantage Two: Desegregation increases hegemony.<br />

Other countries’ perception of our school segregation leads to a decrease in hegemony. Also, restricting students’ interracial interaction creates an ethnocentric bias which will show itself in the policies of the future.
