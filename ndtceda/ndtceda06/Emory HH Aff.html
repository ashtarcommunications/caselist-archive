Recognition of women’s civil identity is the condition of possibility for a radical transformation of the agency of women in both the public and private spheres – Morrison was the quintessential example of women’s rights being solely defined in relation to their contingent citizenship within a gender hierarchy.<br />
Caldwell, ‘2 [Anne, “Transforming Sacrifice: Irigaray and the Politics of Sexual Difference,” Hypatia, V. 17, No. 4, Fall, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/hypatia/v017/17.4caldwell.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://muse.jhu.edu/journals /hypatia/v017/17.4caldwell.pdf__</a>]<br />
Not only does Irigaray point…Changing result of relations with others.<br />
Civil rights for women are necessary for civil society – they are a key area in which contestation of gender and relationships to the state occur and the state resisted.<br />

Recognition of problems in the environmental is critical to developing an ethics of the environment that is critical to meaningful action<br />

An ethics of the…nothing will ensure.<br />

2AC – Representations Answers<br />
Arguing that representations determine reality destroys effective political action – embracing modernist truth claims is a vital starting point for action and avoiding relativism proves not prior to case.
