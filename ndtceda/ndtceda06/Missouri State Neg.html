<br />
The 1acs Insistence that rights or peace can only be attained through the proper geopolitical strategy is the ultimate acceptance of the global neo-liberal order of violence. This represents a form of ethical imperialism in which we are only free when provided a certain set of material circumstance<br />
Dasgupta 2k3<br />

According to current…possibilities of a situation<br />
<br />
They represent an outdated form of kantian morality- a categorical imperative to reduce danger and violence. The 1ac isn’t an act of solidarity with those in need but rather a spectacle of consumerist enjoyment. This corrupted form of policy making prevents us from risking ourselves inn the name of the good<br />

To Badiou’s mind…liberating approach<br />
<br />
This desire to avoid risk is a stabilization of our desires. Freedom and happiness are only attained after indulging the prescribed politics of the affirmative. This is nothing more than a variant of conservative ideology and represents more than anything a deep rooted need to dictate who is good and who is evil. In light of this our alternative is to reject the plan as a way of moving away from the conservative politics of the 1ac. This act of rejection is what allows an emancipatory politics that embraces the impossible and allows us to break away from the nihilism mandated by the affirmative<br />
Dasgupta 2k3<br />
Whether we think…ethic of truths<br />
<br />
The 1ac assumes to understand pain and suffering allowing evil to become the regulative principle of though thus any attempt to secure the globe becomes acceptable<br />

The Affirmative depicts a world in which overruling a supreme court decision will be necessary to preserve the value of the social order. Creating this social order becomes the focus of our desire and feelings of lack. The social order effects a radical change in our relationship to enjoyment and dissatisfaction.<br />
Todd McGowan, 2003, the end of dissatisfaction? Jaques Lacan and the emerging society of enjoyment, p. 15-17<br />
“It is important to remember … society of commanded enjoyment.’<br />
<br />
Our perception of the world does not come to us innocently from the mere facts of events. Instead, something we call the real mediates this perception. The real is not the reality lurking beneath representation of the world, but instead an excess or lack introduced in the very act of representation, and indeed the very act of forming the social order. Our society lurches forward from crisis to crisis: communities in decline, poverty, nuclear weapons, environmental destruction, etc., each time implicitly believing that each crisis is a historically specific situation that requires some minor corrective course of action. This perspective misidentifies the real as a historically specific situation rather than a feature inherent in the social edifice itself. Lurking beneath every fantasy of peace, stability, and resolution is a threat of disorder and chaos. Catastrophe always hovers; such is the nature of our being.<br />
Zizek 04, conversations with Zizek, p. 78-79<br />
“Here I would agree … inherent, self-blockade.”<br />
<br />
In order to protect ourselves psychologically from the traumatic effects of this ever-present Real, we have all acquiesced to the spell of ideology. Ideology works by constructing a fantasy of reality in which it is possible to overcome the inevitable crises generated by the Real. As a result, we have entered into a cycle of distance and proximity to the Real in which we wait anxiously until catastrophe confronts us as “on the brink,” and then we take some small corrective measure thereby deferring our reconciliation with catastrophe until the next time the threat emerges. This process of constant deferral prevents us from ever fundamentally reordering the world, and instead moves us toward a new world order which selectively constitutes groups of people to eliminate as barriers and risks rather than recognizing the intrinisically risky nature of the entire subjective venture.<br />
Zizek 04 Conversations with Zizek, p. 12-3<br />
“The central issue is one of … supplement in today’s realpolitik.”<br />
<br />
The affirmative attempts at reform will fail. They are not radical enough to remain caught in the coordinates of the current system and stuck in the constraints of capitalism.<br />
Zizek 99 (The Ticklish Subject, p. 71-2)<br />
“In States of injury, Wendy … is the ultimate Oedipal myth…”<br />
<br />
The Alternative is an absolute withdrawal from the plan – this negative gesture wipes the slate clear of the real which is a precursor to any positive gesture. This acknowledgement is key to opening the absolute contraction of subjectivity.<br />
Zizek 99, The Ticklish Subject, p.153-4<br />
“The critical thing here … emerged Master-Signifier.”<br />
<br />
In psychoanalytic terms, the decision to give up all hope is called traversing the fantasy, which allows you to recognize and alter the way that you respond to ideological influence. Traversing the fantasy offers no way out of our present conditions, but rather insists that you psychologically get over it – that the big other doesn’t exist means that no social harmony will ever succeed, but at the same time this recognition opens up the possibility of authentic political action beyond the infinitely regressive politics of ideology which endlessly rehearse the same failed deferral of confrontation with the real.<br />

We ran morrison. Our advnatages were violence against women and sovereign immunity bad<br />

<br />
They ran midterms. Plan is a win for GOP makes Bush think he is winning<br />
so he doesn't strike. Strikes good. i don't remember why honestly. But<br />
that disad will be dead after today.<br />
<br />
They ran federalism-- standard. Calbresis ethnic conflict impact<br />
<br />
They ran T must overrule a holding in morrison<br />
<br />
On case they impact turned our soverign immunity advanatge with<br />
democracy promotion bad (not sure why that applies but they were big on<br />
that in the block, must have read 20 cards)<br />
<br />
the gender advanatge they read a K that was a hodgepodge state bad,<br />
vicitmization bad business. This was very very shady. Pozzi undercovered<br />
it and it was the entire 1nr. they read a bunch of framework shit like<br />
reps come first and everything, new alt (reject that stuff) the whole<br />
shabang.<br />
<br />
This is what they went for. they are hella shaddy, don't blow off<br />
criticla sounding arguments they will go for them.<br />
<br />
the 2nc was<br />

politics (reading a bunch of new impacts even though we conceded the<br />
initial one)<br />

Their totalizing biopower claims are bad – the link from the democratic welfare state to that of mass murder and control is unfounded – while the logic may hold the potential for exploitation the democratic welfare state has constraints that their argument ignores.<br />

In short, the continuities between early twentieth-century biopolitical discourse AND modern societies with quite radically differing potentials.91<br />

The correlation between rationalization and authoritarian politics does not exist – there actually exists the potential for the opposite to be true.<br />

Ostroy Report. “What’s next for Roe v. Wade.” September 2005. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ostroyreport.blogspot.com/2005_09_01_ostroyreport_archive.html" rel="nofollow">http://ostroyreport.blogspot.com/2005_09_01_ostroyreport_archive.html</a><br />
The $64,000 question all last week, as Senators from both sides AND expectations of an entire generation of people.<br />

Overrules are widely noticed, due to their disruptive effects<br />
James E. Spriggs, Assoc Prof of PoliSci, and Thomas G. Hansford, assistant professor in the Department of Government and International Studies, University of South Carolina, The Journal of Politics, UC Davis, 2001<br />
The overruling of a precedent, despite its infrequency, is a significant political and legal event AND judges analyze them using the new legal rule.<br />
<br />
Quirin links<br />
<br />
Overruling Quirin would be a radical break with precedent and stare decisis<br />
Reid Skibell, “Seperation-of-powers and the Commander in Chief,” 13 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 183, 2004 lexis<br />
O'Connor's response is to cite as precedent AND formalism in a war powers context<br />
<br />
(Quirin) Court overrules of prior statutory interpretation are highly unusual, hurting separation of powers<br />
James E. Spriggs, Assoc Prof of PoliSci, and Thomas G. Hansford, assistant professor in the Department of Government and International Studies, University of South Carolina, The Journal of Politics, UC Davis, 2001<br />
One of the most frequently cited constraints AND rather than constitutional, interpretation.<br />
<br />
Overrules longer than 40 years would be unprecedented<br />
James E. Spriggs, Assoc Prof of PoliSci, and Thomas G. Hansford, assistant professor in the Department of Government and International Studies, University of South Carolina, The Journal of Politics, UC Davis, 2001<br />
The observed dependent variable in our analysis AND was overruled during the span of our data is 40 years.<br />

Courts rarely overrule without setting the stage through negative rulings<br />
James E. Spriggs, Assoc Prof of PoliSci, and Thomas G. Hansford, assistant professor in the Department of Government and International Studies, University of South Carolina, The Journal of Politics, UC Davis, 2001<br />
We further expect that the Court's prior AND the precedent will be overruled.<br />
<br />
Morrison links<br />

In point of fact, the Court never pauses to AND under Congress's Commerce Clause power.<br />
<br />
Casey links<br />
<br />
The Casey decision proves judicial adherence to stare decisis now - overruling Casey would eviscerate legitimacy and shatter stare decisis—this threatens the rule of law<br />

Overrulling Casey would slay legitimacy and a whole trend of upholding precedent<br />

Raich counterplan<br />

<a name="_Toc146202506"></a> 545 U.S. 1 (2005) overruled the holding in United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000). We’ll clarify.<a name="_Toc146202507"></a><br />
<br />
The counterplan would be a correct interpretation of Raich.<br />
James Leonard, Professor of Law and Co-Director, Disability Law Institute, The University of Alabama School of Law Syracuse Law Review, 2004 lexis<br />
Morrison both acknowledged the executive's interest AND fine-tuning of relator schemes something of a challenge.<br />
<br />
We don’t really have to prove that Raich overruled Morrison. The court regularly uses this technique to reverse decisions as a method of preserving its legitimacy. This counterplan is particularly successful because it is not an implicit overrule. It makes explicit a previous overrule WHILE linking out of the overrule disadvantages. Raich will provide cover to the Supreme Court in a way the affirmative cannot access. This card will also answer their normal means argument.<br />
Pintip Hompluem Dunn, Yale Law Journal, &quot;How Judges Overrule: Speech Act Theory and the Doctrine of Stare Decisis&quot; November 2003 lexis<br />
But the rhetoric that the Justices use allows for another AND interpreting (in the case of the present-day Court).<br />
<br />
Raich relegated Lopez and Morrison to a brief footnote – the follow-up to Raich would end the debate altogether – it solves the affirmative.<br />
Laura W. Harper, Mercer Law Review, “Gonzales v. Raich: Has New Federalism Gone up in Smoke?” Summer 2006 lexis<br />
Of the four factors established by the Court under Lopez and Morrison AND meet a higher burden in certain instances.<br />
<br />
Structural necessity test counterplan<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that to the extant that Gonzalez v. Raich suggests such a distinction, the SC will defer questions of interstate commerce to Congress if a structural necessity for federal legislation exists<br />
<br />
Harsch, SETON HALL LAW REVIEW, 2001<br />
&lt;the disjunction could be corrected if the Court adopts an inquiry into the “structural necessity” of the legislation it considers under the Commerc caluses….would permit Congress to pass legislation that addressing problems the federal government is uniquely situated to solve…..examples of legialtion that would likely meet with the Cour’s approval under an analysis of structural necessity…..organized crime…because its spanning of local jurisdictions…environmental issues&gt;<br />
<br />
Congressional attachment counterplan<br />
<br />
Text: The United States Congress should reenact the Violence Against Women Act struck down in United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) by labeling it as an amendment to the broader regulatory scheme of the Violence Against Women Act II.<br />
<br />
Raich allows congress to independently attach legislation to broader regulatory schemes<br />
Somin 2006 (Ilya- Assistant Professor of Law at George Mason University School of Law, “GONZALES V. RAICH: FEDERALISM AS A CASUALTY OF THE WAR ON DRUGS”, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY LAW AND ECONOMICS RESEARCH PAPER SERIES, June 31,<br />

Constitutional amendment counterplan<br />

An amendment to the constitution can overrule court precedent.<br />
Joan Schaffner. Associate Professor of Law, George Washington University Law School, American University Law Review, August 2005 lexis<br />
Because the judicial branch has the ultimate authority AND consistent with basic democratic principles.<br />
<br />
This slipper-slope argument is incorrect. The threshold will remain high.<br />
Stephen B. Presser, Raoul Berger Professor of Legal History, Northwestern University School of Law, &quot;Why the United States Congress Has a Duty to Pass the Flag Amendment&quot; 2006 google<br />
The objections to such an amendment that have been AND Indeed that is the way it should be.<br />

The counterplan rejuvenates participatory democracy – it would preserve liberty.<br />
Raoul Berger, Professor of Legal History, Northwestern University School of Law, and Professor of Business Law, Kellogg Graduate School of Management and Strategy, Northwestern University, Texas Review of Law &amp; Politics, &quot;Constitutional Amendments: Dangerous Threat or Democracy in Action?&quot; Fall 2000 lexis<br />
I agree with the argument of the authors AND Extraordinary Occasions seek to do.<br />
<br />
The perm would independently link to legitimacy – two reasons. First, the arbitrary nature of an overrule coinciding with an amendment. Second, the only reason left to overrule if an amendment is passed would be political.<br />
James C. Rehnquist, Boston University Law Review, &quot;The power that shall be vested in a precedent: stare decisis, the constitution and the Supreme Court&quot; March 1986 lexis<br />
A recurring argument is that overrulings of precedent AND the rule of stare decisis.<br />

Quirin counterplan<br />

Text: United States Supreme Court should grant cert to the next available test case and uphold Ex parte Quirin [317 U.S. 1 (1942)] by ruling that military tribunals are unconstitutional without explicit congressional approval. The United States Congress should pass legislation explicitly prohibiting military tribunals. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
The current policies do not follow Quirin – which enjoyed explicit authorization from congress. The Quirin precedent actually proves military tribunals to be unconstitutional.<br />

Hamdan counterplan<br />

Text: The United States Supreme Court should grant cert to the next available test case and confirm that Hamdan overruled the holding in Ex Parte Quirin.<br />
<br />
We don’t really have to prove that Hamdan overruled Morrison. The court regularly uses this technique to reverse decisions as a method of preserving its legitimacy. This counterplan is particularly successful because it is not an implicit overrule. It makes explicit a previous overrule WHILE linking out of the overrule disadvantages. Hamdan will provide cover to the Supreme Court in a way the affirmative cannot access. This card will also answer their normal means argument.<br />

The affirmative argument that the political is not the focus of the 1ac is the premise of our whole argument.

There is no rule of law. The idea that the court precedent can create an improved world resultis in the destruction of the self and creares a dangerous form of ordering.

Victims and violence are not the only productws of our increasingly traumatic modern world. Indeed, the process of speaking out and speaking against the sources of violence may very well be he defining theme of our age. These discussions, however, continually circulate toward the discussion of particular institutional practices and their mediation of our relationships. The Aff poses question of ethics only insofar as it relates to the domain of politics. Tying ethical reorientation of ourselves wiht the reorientaiton of our collective political spheres takes precedence and in the process produces these ethics and our relaitonship with others merely as a background for political transformations. The aff makes the question not how much we can change ourselves but instead how we can change our institutions to change ourselves. This process produces mediated relationship that maeks genuine ehical engagement makes impossible Zupancic 00 ETHICS OF THE REAL: Kant and Lacan, pp. 10=11 , March 2000 &quot;In other words, one cannot attain the realm of the ethical. . . faculty of desire as a priori.&quot;<br />
affirmative focus on the material conditions that create oppression and suffering presupposes that we are inherently alienated from each by these conditions. this forecloses all possibility of ethical relationships to ohers not mediated by violence Oliver 01 Hypatia, 16.3 (2001). &quot;Martin Jay in his comprehensive study of vision. . . light, air, and touch in vision&quot;<br />
the impact to the affirmative's conception of ethics is the imposition of violence ordering upon the globe. Oliver 01, Hypatia 16.3 (2001) The Lacanian gaze is not the look of another person or another subject . . . do not recognize that makes recognition possible.&quot;<br />
our problem with liberal notion of justice is genealogy of evil emaciated bodies. Cheapen life. Language of moral wrong seemingly reject all ethical ideology. Abstract suffering Cooppression demonic figures bureaucracy enables us to persevere<br />
aff use of legal reasoning and instuttions of argument are in and of themselves violent. Second, the affirmaive use of pressure and depictions of violence are in and of themselves violent. By overshadowing individual responsibility for ivolence the Aff enacts a form of ideological violence that weaves violence into the very fabric of our consciousness. by Kappeler, THE WILL TO VIOLENCE 95, pp. 6-7 &quot;This means engaging also with the discourses. . . pressure and blackmailrefuing to fight back.&quot;<br />
Our alternative is to divorce our ethical and political relationship to life and ohters from one that is premised on negation. This very process of our alternative enacts transofrmation that is integral to a reodering of the way global politics is made &amp; operates. The act of expanding the boundaries of Global compassion is a process of critical self-examination that is necessary complete challenge to domination and hierarchy. In short our alternative is the practice of freedom Oliver 01 Hypatia 16.3 (2001) Irigaray's suggestions about the possibility of loving looks. . . without giving up on one side or the other.&quot; love looks; posing love outside of domination.

Our perception of the world does not come to us innocently from the mere facts of events. Instead, something we call the real mediates this perception. The real is not the reality lurking beneath representation of the world, but instead an excess or lack introduced in the very act of representation, and indeed the very act of forming the social order. Our society lurches forward from crisis to crisis: communities in decline, poverty, nuclear weapons, environmental destruction, etc., each time implicitly believing that each crisis is a historically specific situation that requires some minor corrective course of action. This perspective misidentifies the real as a historically specific situation rather than a feature inherent in the social edifice itself. Lurking beneath every fantasy of peace, stability, and resolution is a threat of disorder and chaos. Catastrophe always hovers; such is the nature of our being.<br />
Zizek 04, conversations with Zizek, p. 78-79<br />
“Here I would agree … inherent, self-blockade.”<br />
<br />
In order to protect ourselves psychologically from the traumatic effects of this ever-present Real, we have all acquiesced to the spell of ideology. Ideology works by constructing a fantasy of reality in which it is possible to overcome the inevitable crises generated by the Real. As a result, we have entered into a cycle of distance and proximity to the Real in which we wait anxiously until catastrophe confronts us as “on the brink,” and then we take some small corrective measure thereby deferring our reconciliation with catastrophe until the next time the threat emerges. This process of constant deferral prevents us from ever fundamentally reordering the world, and instead moves us toward a new world order which selectively constitutes groups of people to eliminate as barriers and risks rather than recognizing the intrinisically risky nature of the entire subjective venture.<br />
Zizek 04 Conversations with Zizek, p. 12-3<br />
“The central issue is one of … supplement in today’s realpolitik.”<br />
<br />
The affirmative attempts at reform will fail. They are not radical enough to remain caught in the coordinates of the current system and stuck in the constraints of capitalism.<br />
Zizek 99 (The Ticklish Subject, p. 71-2)<br />
“In States of injury, Wendy … is the ultimate Oedipal myth…”<br />
<br />
The Alternative is an absolute withdrawal from the plan – this negative gesture wipes the slate clear of the real which is a precursor to any positive gesture. This acknowledgement is key to opening the absolute contraction of subjectivity.<br />
Zizek 99, The Ticklish Subject, p.153-4<br />
“The critical thing here … emerged Master-Signifier.”<br />

The potential for resistance lies not in bulding a few new spaces but deconding all of them. The constellation constituted by the symbiotic relationship between state and capital—the sort of sovereignty they want to oppose—can only exist on the base on an investment of desire. It is on that level we must intervene. Vote neg to refuse to be seduced by aff’s territroializations.<br />

DA<br />
<strong>1.) Intellectual strategies strip life—1AC<br />
2.) Must choose a world of life and love—Aff ethics begins love and solves internal links<br />
3.) Integration is happening now—so no uniqueness to these arguments.<br />
4.) Segregation is worse in the squo—No uniqueness.<br />
5.) You concede no value to life, meaning we outweigh.<br />
6.) Double bind—No signal in the status quo or there is a signal. Either way, you lose.<br />
7.) You don’t solve our impact, predicated off of overturning Milliken.<br />
8.) Their Schell and Washer CP ev indicates that housing solves everything so perm solves<br />
9.) Localities strike down the plan, we don’t have to defend segregation.</strong><br />
10.) Crisis focus corrupts scholarship and causes failure of progressive politics.<br />

<br />
CP<br />
<strong>1.) No negative fiat<br />
2.) Don’t solve the case—aff isn’t about solving integration<br />
3.) Perm—Vote no on Milliken both ways.<br />
4.) Must heed to the violence that exists in the inner cities<br />
5.) Moment of judicial decision is key—overrule is critical—1AC<br />
6.) CP is Moral evasion—extend Bauman evidence</strong><br />
7.) Aff is celebration of nonrationality—Gives life its meaning<br />
Bauman ’93 (“Postmodern Ethics p. 246-250)<br />

<br />
Framework<br />
<strong>1.) This interpretation is bad—forces us to be extra-T<br />
2.) Links to our offense about how overly focusing on public policy corrupts personal politics<br />
3.) Must suspend status quo ethics, so the framework can’t solve aff<br />
4.) Must base decision calc on principles not policies—causes reversal<br />
5.) Our interpretation leads to ethics principles, better actions—1AC<br />
6.) Don’t rely on segregation to solve the case—not offense.<br />
7.) Infinite amount of atrocities are possible—1AC</strong><br />
8.) Util is not sustainable—voids life of meaning and desire.<br />
Zizek ’00 Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan p. ix-xi<br />
“Alenka Zupancic book.. terms of future benefits.”<br />
9.) Must abandon consequentialism—The framework of pleasure and pain colonizes the mind and recreates violence. Ethical choice in the face of violence creates psychological change.<br />
Zupancic 00, Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan, March, p. 10-11<br />
“The situation described.. desire as a priori.”<br />
<strong>10.) Your paradigm for solving comparative ethics should be based on values—negative has no way to account for these</strong><br />
11.) Their framework = focus on survival perpetuates the idea that life can only be preserved through a politics of management—no value<br />
Zizek 00 (The Puppet and the Dwarf, 94-5)<br />
“Insofar as “death”… drink death like wine.”<br />
<br />
12.) Politics of prophecy—Negative’s attempt to fit ourselves favorably into a pre-determined destiny that we create so we can exploit and control the future. This eliminates ethical and political choice.<br />
Dublin ’92 (Futurehype: The Tyranny of Prophecy p. 12-13)<br />
“Divorced from the… encouraging us to follow.”<br />
<strong>13.) The only thing that is relevant to Milliken is whether lower courts will do it</strong><br />
14.) Creates paralysis<br />
