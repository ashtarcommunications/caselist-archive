Racism. Sexism. Homophobia. Environmentalism. The current political order is structuredto allow for the fight for multiple single-issue focused movements, but this very structure of particularisms are atomized reforms aimed at singular instances of oppression prevents us from questioning the horizon of global capitalism that sustains all oppression. Unless we attack capitalism directly, we are only playing a system that is rigged from the start from actual change. ZIZEK 2000<br />
<br />
The capital drive to return to a more balanced and equal civil society requires the production of the threatening neighbor as the permanent excess and the call on the Master to delimit a clearly defined oppressor is simply a repetition of the function that consolidated racism in the first place. Racism returns to the affirmative in the form of the phenomenon of stolen enjoyments. ZIZEK 1993<br />

The alternative is an ethic of universal revolution. Reject the Aff. ZIZEK 2000
