Ross evidence criticizes about being “fully human” 1ac ev to assume overrule Milliken<br />

Concede Agamben ev; they are an attempt to gain rights, DA about poverty is another example of this “increase property taxes”<br />

Spanos Kritik<br />
The Aff’s demand that we act as stabilizers of the international system locks us into a fantasy of total control. This ignores that fact that total control is never possible and forgets that the thoughtless deployment of humanist notions of being is what brought us to the brink of catastrophe in the first place.<br />
McWhorter, Asst. Prof of Philosophy at Northeast Missouri State U, 1992 (Ladelle, Guilt as Management Technology: A call to Heideggerian Reflection,” in Heidegger and the Earth, p. 3-4)<br />
When we attempt to think…than destroy the earth.<br />
<br />
The fantasy of international stability and control obliterates other types of knowledge. It is impossible to do both – the perm begs the question. Action itself is the thoughtless deployment of enlightenment ideals that caused the harm in the first place.<br />
McWhorter, Asst. Prof of Philosophy at Northeast Missouri State U, 1992 (Ladelle, Guilt as Management Technology: A call to Heideggerian Reflection,” in Heidegger and the Earth, p. 3-4)<br />
But it is only a dream…we may never dream.<br />
<br />
The inevitable result of unquestioned ontological being that is rooted in humanist ideals is totalizing violence.<br />
Spanos, (Prof of English at SUNY) 2000 (William V, America’s Shadow: Anatomy of Empire, pg. 191-192)<br />
The incommensuability between the United State’s…taken to a genocidal extreme.<br />
<br />
Thus we offer the following alt:<br />
<br />
Reject the aff’s call to action…Do nothing<br />
Frustrating though it may be, we must have the courage to reject the cal to action and think through the destructive impulses at the core of human being. This frustration is itself a launching pad for thought, criticism and alt understandings of what Heidegger calls the mystery of Being.<br />
McWhorter, Asst. Prof of Philosophy at Northeast Missouri State U, 1992 (Ladelle, Guilt as Management Technology: A call to Heideggerian Reflection,” in Heidegger and the Earth, p. 3-4)<br />
Heidegger’s work is a call …ways of being human.<br />
<br />
Great evil can be deployed in the name of supposedly neutral truth. The problem is that truth is never really innocent b/c it is always framed by a way of knowing, an ontological perspective. To grapple with being is to become deeply responsible and prevents us from reducing all life to meaningless standing reserve.<br />
Spanos, (Professor of English at SUNY) 2000 (William v, America’s Shadow: Anatomy of Empire, p. 191-2)<br />
In this historically resonant phrase…the spokesperons of “America.”<br />
<br />
Retreating into the guilt and the need for action, the need to save lives, is never in opposition to the fantasy of stability. The most stubborn part of the fantasy, the notion that we can finally restore balance to the system if we simply behave properly is the problem. We must release ourselves from this fantasy to open up new ways of thinking. In hopes that it will shatter the enlightenment ontology that is driving us to extinction<br />
McWhorter, Asst. Prof of Philosophy at Northeast Missouri State U, 1992 (Ladelle, Guilt as Management Technology: A call to Heideggerian Reflection,” in Heidegger and the Earth, p. 3-4)<br />
Therefore, when we react to….eventually is ourselves.<br />
<br />
Questions of ontology must be asked and answered first because they are the fundamental and inescapable basis for any line of thinking.<br />
Dillon, U of Lancaster, 1999 (Michael, “Another Justice,” Political Theory vol. 27, No. 2, April, p. 160-161)<br />
Heirs to all of this…of decision making.<br />
<br />
<br />
Business confidence frontline<br />
<br />
1. no solvency – they can only fiat that the court will adhere to their precedent in the future – this isn’t enough to solve business confidence – the raich decision proves that courts can rule essentially opposite ways without overruling precedent.<br />
2. turn – overruling decisions crushes business confidence and legal certainty.<br />
Healy, Law Clerk to Judge Michael Hawkins on the US court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, 2001 (Thomas, Article: Stare Decisis as a Constitutional Requirement, west Virginia L.Rev, 104 W. Va. L. Rev 43, In, Fall)<br />
The most frequent claim made on….ultimately be thwarted.<br />

<strong><u>Counterplan</u></strong><br />
Text: The United States Congress should reauthorize the provision of the Clean Water Act struck down in the SWANCC decision. The Supreme Court should uphold these provisions using the structural necessity test. In all future commerce clause cases involving federal environmental regulations the court should uphold these regulations using the structural necessity test. The court should apply the structural necessity test to all future commerce clause cases. The structural necessity test should be defined as follows – the Court should inquire whether the political structure of our system of government precludes the states from dealing with problems that federal legislation addresses. Additionally, the Supreme Court should uphold the provisions of the Hate Crimes Protection Act that provide sentence enhancements for violations of securities laws and other federal statutes that are already legal causes of action. This should be distinguished from all other legislation regulation hate crimes.<br />
The counterplan is conditional. We will read 2nc cp’s consistent with the structural necessity test in response to 2AC add ons.<br />
<strong>The cp solves the case and avoids the Das – the structural necessity permits federal legislation in areas whre our political structure makes states separately incompetent to address problems.</strong><br />

Observation One Counterplan text<br />
<br />
At the next available test case the United States Supreme Court should rule that “enemy combatant” cases should be evaluated using deferential review and that Rasul and Hamdi protections apply to long term detainees at overseas facilities.<br />
<br />
Observation Two Theoretical concerns<br />
<br />
1. The counterplan is unconditional – we will either go for the counterplan or a procedural argument.<br />
<br />
Observation Three Solvency and net benefits – the counterplan solves the case and avoids our terrorism DA.<br />
<br />
A. Solvency<br />
<br />
Even minimally intrusive federal review prompts massive internal change in military procedures ensuring adequate protection of individual rights. The counterplan works for three reasons. First, it strengthens the hand of internal officers who want reform, second it results in fear of outside review, and third it allows outside review when necessary.<br />
Martin, Warner-Booker Distinguished Professor of International Law University of Virginia, ’05 (David, 25 B.C. Third World L.J. 125, p. 154-5, twm)<br />
<br />
For administrative officers, including both those in charge… a more intrusive review process<br />
<br />
Supreme Court decisions in Rasul/Hamdi have created a framework of acoustic separation that will bolster the delicate balance between the need to fight terrorism and the need to preserve individual liberties. Continuing to use a deferential standard of review is key.<br />
Martin, Warner-Booker Distinguished Professor of International Law University of Virginia, ’05 (David, 25 B.C. Third World L.J. 125, p. 125, twm)<br />
<br />
In sum, deferential standards of review give rise to a salutary form of acoustic separation… longer-term U.S. detainees elsewhere in the world.<br />
