Case:<br />
They can never win their terminal impacts – all identity is built on exclusions, which means they cannot escape their biopower/calculation claims.<br />
Judith butler, prof of rhtetoric – 2001 – contingency, universality, hegemony pg.30-31<br />
”laclau’s most sustained discussion of universality in relation to the present political demands of… of all identity-constittution.”<br />
<br />
Their impact claim is a paper tiger – they can only articulate a link to a framework in which mass violence is possible, but this is entirely different than saying that the plan or the 1ac somehow causes them.<br />
Dean, dept of sociology at Macquarie university, 2000, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/dean.rtf,p.4,google" rel="nofollow">http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/dean.rtf,p.4,google</a><br />

attempting to use discrimination against the black community as a means to address and illuminate all forms of discrimination excludes non-black minority experience from legal jurisprudence creating an inexcusable exception that renders such non-black minorities invisible.<br />

1NC Offcase Arguments:<br />
Be as detailed as possible. Just saying &quot;Topicality&quot; isn't particularly helpful. There needs to be some indication as to what the violation is. Try to include an outline of each argument that includes a tag for every card. Whenever you hear an argument that you have not previously heard, you should get complete cites for that argument and include them here.<br />
<br />
LEGITIMACY<br />
1. Uniqueness (something with warrants describing Lawrence v. Texas)<br />
2. Overrules destroy legitimacy<br />
3. Legitimacy key to democracy<br />
4. Democracy prevents extinction—Diamond 95<br />

<strong>VERSUS MORRISON<br />
<br />
Judges spec – aff must specify which justices vote to overrule – a) core education, b) Solvency args, c) CP ground, d) DA ground, e) aff conditional because violate “resolved,” therefore not topical<br />
<br />
Legitimacy – stare decisis link – aff violates stare decisis<br />
Impact – democracy, Diamond<br />
Gibson and Souers, June 15, “The Legitimacy of the United States in the Supreme Court in a Polarized Polity”<br />
<br />
Midterms<br />
a. Senate = 5 dem pick ups now<br />
b. Link – aff increases GOP turnout<br />
c. Impact – Bush attacks Iran if there’s not a Dem Congress to block him → nuclear war<br />
<br />
States CP<br />
State legislatures and courts find that state constitutions require VAWA, like…. (CP covers territories of US too)<br />
<br />
Solvency turns:<br />
1) criminalilzation turn – increases violence when legitimizes state violence<br />
2) minority voices disadvantaged by binaries<br />
3) patriarchy turn – VAWA reinforces “good mother” model<br />

Judge - David Heidt (His only concern about the Milliken affirmative in this particular debate is that he doesn’t see the interaction between social imagination and the disadvantages. So for future debates, we must be clear on this interaction)<br />

<strong>1NC<br />
T – Resolved<br />
The USFG = the agent of action. The affirmative’s act of social imagination makes them the actor, no the USFG<br />
Ground Specification<br />
Framework – Consequentialism Good<br />
1) Discussion of imagination = bad<br />
2) Deontology leads to Consequentialism<br />
3) Don’t allow the affirmative to not talk about the consequences<br />
4) Must answer D/A’s<br />
5) Don’t solve extinction with imagination<br />
6) Must evaluate the actual impacts<br />
7) Voting affirmative leads to dogmatism<br />
8) Must defend consequences<br />
State Courts CP<br />
(Text the 50 states and territories should acknowledge the states role in segregation by amending their state constitution and institute a greater burden to protect a greater burden to protect plaintiff interest by nullifying deferral to local control.)<br />
1) States solve education matters best<br />
Politics D/A (Midterms)<br />
1. GOP will win now (maintain control of Congress)<br />
2. Judicial decision against Bush hurts GOP turn-out<br />
3. Bush will attack Iran to restore GOP lead<br />
4. Invade Iran escalates to global nuclear war<br />
Case<br />
1. The 1AC focuses too much on the issue of integration and doesn’t solve (Onwuachi 2005 “just another brother on the SCT?” 90 iowa L Rev. 931)<br />
2. Don’t solve the social stigma of minorities (Montgomery and rossi, 94 education reforms and students at risk: “becoming at risk of failure in America’s schools”…“Calls for community control…self worth and abilities”)<br />
3. Plan leads to a cycle of black inferiority (Thomas, Clarence, 95 Missouri v. Jenkins “in effect…constitutional principle”)<br />
4. Integration leads to a cycle of psychological trauma for black students<br />
5. A) Plan leads to a lack of culture identity (Guuswany and drywater 99 34 tulsa li 713)<br />
5. B) Lack of cultural identity = No Value to Life<br />
6. Bussing doesn’t solve (Richter, 98 “busings boston massacre” policy review no 92)<br />

3) Judicial decision not against Bush<br />
4) Leaving Milliken on books leads to political stagnation<br />
5) Affirmative solvency o/w (Solve biopolitics)<br />
6) Privileging political considerations makes desegregation impossible<br />
Case<br />
1) Case Overview<br />
2) Integration = critical to solve special issues<br />
3) Extend 1AC Welch (Hope = Good)<br />
