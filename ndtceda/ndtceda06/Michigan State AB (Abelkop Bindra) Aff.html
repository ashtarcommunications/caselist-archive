Maximizing life allows people to decide their own values- their alternative is totalitarian.<br />
Szacki ’96 “Liberalism After Communism.” 197<br />
“Liberalism does not say… conception to another.”<br />
Power and oppression circulate through institutions like the state- we must fight within these structures in order to challenge domination.<br />
Grossberg 92 “We gotta get out of this place: popular conservatism and postmodern culture.” P 390-391<br />
“But this would mean… to fight them.”<br />
Reinforcing the state is a strategic necessity- their alternative will either get violently crushed or result in even greater and less accountable tyrannies.<br />
Chomsky ’99 “The common good: noam Chomsky interviewed by david barsamian.” P 84-85<br />
“So Argentina is… that matter, to ourselves.”<br />
Every effort to improve the world is implicitly Utopian- giving up on this eradicates hope and human progress.<br />
Tallis ’97 “enemies of hope; a critique of contemporary pessimimsm.” P 378-379<br />
“This is a deeply disturbing conclusion… overall a better place.”<br />
Violent conflict blocks any transition to a new radical advocacy.<br />
Linklater ’99 “Beyond realism and marxism”<br />
“These theoretical disagreements with Marxism… extension of human community.”<br />
Their impacts rely on a glawed, totalizing account of biopower.<br />
Dickinson 2004 “Central European History.” P34-36<br />
“The need to theorize… logic of social engineering.”<br />

Lazarus, 3-6-07, online<br />
Back in the 1980s AND country and the world<br />
Aff generates capital for court – Congress is eagerly awating Morrison to be overruled<br />
Lazarus, fall 2006, 56 DePaul L. Rev. 1<br />
Little more was heard AND nonconstitutional authority<br />
<br />
<strong>Stare Decisis / Legitimacy Answers</strong><br />
Weak Stare Decisis Turn:<br />
Strong stare decisis bad – plan initiates transition to weak stare Decisis allowing court to overrule constitutional decisions that were wrongly decided<br />
Roland, 6-10-00, online<br />
There would appear to be AND component of any lasting reform<br />
Weak stare Decisis solves their offense and avoids our turns – promotes stability and rule of law while allowing overrules like the plan<br />
Farber, 2006, Minnesota Law Review<br />
Stare Decisis limits the extent AND constitutional visions<br />
Strong stare decisis unconstitutional<br />

New Decentralization Advantage (Indonesia)<br />
Morrison is the key symbol of the federalism revival- it had much more public potency than any other decision<br />
John McGinnis, 02, 90 Calif. L. Rev. 485, ln<br />
“Morrison deepens…..remains unchanged.”<br />
Raich hasn’t changed this signal for 2reasons-<br />
First, Raich was perceived as a drug case, not a federalism case<br />
John Parry, BIOPOLITICS AND THE COMMERCE CLAUSE IN GONZALES V. RAICH, Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review, 9 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 853<br />
“I’ll end this…..the next case.”<br />
Second, Raich was a substantive victory for New Federalism<br />
George Brown, 05, 66 Ohio St. L. J. 947<br />
“Nonetheless,…the New Federalism.”<br />
This signal is key<br />
David Bogen, Hastings Law Journal, December 03, lexis<br />
“Finally, American federalism has been…..viable form of government.”<br />
Anti-Americanism doesn’t stop modeling- other countries will continue to emulate the US<br />
The Times (London), 12/7/02, ln<br />
“Regrettably, the Romans…….of the War on Terror.”<br />
Court decisions that promote federalism undermines the process of decentralization- the relationship- the relationship is the opposite of what is commonly assumed<br />
Frank Cross, 02, Cardozo Law Review, ln<br />
“The most serious…….of those benefits.”<br />
This is specifically true in Morrison—which sends a precedent against decentralization<br />
Cross, 2<br />
“Simply examining……..benefits of federalism.”<br />
This distinction is crucial- federalism undermines the effective functioning of democracy<br />
Cross, 2<br />
“Finally, federalism….values of federalism.”<br />
DIAMOND, 95<br />
Independently, decentralization is key to effective public health services<br />
Cross, 2<br />
“The significant association…..organizational form.”<br />
New pandemic inevitable<br />
Dayton Daily News, 12/9/05, ln<br />
“World and National…….worldwide need).”<br />
Impact is the death of billions a year<br />
Satish Chandra, Global Security: A broader Concept for the 21st Century, 04<br />
“This scenario….rate is estimated.”<br />
Decentralization solves all the benefits of federalism without the down sides<br />
Cross 2<br />
“Yet another benefit…. presents the proof.”<br />
Specifically true in Indonesia- decentralization is key to stability, but transition to federalism undermines stability<br />
Hans Antlov, 99, “In Indonesia: Disentangling the Confusion about Federalism” 06/03<br />
“In order for…..less central supervision.”<br />
Indonesian instability crushes the global economy<br />
Rajan Menon, 2001, National Interest, Fall, ln<br />

<br />

Morgan, 2k5 (Denise, Professor, New York Law School. 05/06. 50 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 615. Lexis)<br />
These are the best of times and the worst of times to be writing about federalism. Over the past fifteen years, the U.S. Supreme Court has breathed life into what appeared to be a moribund, abstract, technical area of law. Federalism has become relevant and everyone has something to say about the proper balance of power between the federal and state governments. Improbable as it may seem, suddenly it is cool to be a federal-courts junkie. 1<br />

Economic collapses causes extinction<br />
Mead 92 (Walter Russell, Senior Fellow – Council on Foreign Relations, New Perspectives Quarterly, Summer, p. 30)<br />
The failure to develop an international system to hedge against the possibility of worldwide depression- will open their eyes to their folly. Hundreds of millions-billions-of people around the world have pinned their hopes on the international market economy. They and their leaders have embraced market principles-and drawn closer to the West-because they believe that our system can work for them. But what if it can't? What if the global economy stagnates, or even shrinks? In that case, we will face a new period of international conflict: South against North, rich against poor. Russia. China. India-these countries with their billions of people and their nuclear weapons will pose a much greater danger to world order than Germany and Japan did in the 1930's.<br />

Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because a world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts. Finally, U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.<br />
