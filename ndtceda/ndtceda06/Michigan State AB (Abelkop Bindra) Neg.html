Pursuant to its article 5 power, congress will pass and a sufficient number of states, not including New York, California, Tennessee, will ratify a constitutional amendment that military commissions are not lawfully constituted because their authority to impose the death penalty violates the Eight Amendment of the United States Constitution. The USSC should not overrule any of its prior decisions and should instead distinguish all decisions which conflict with a prior Supreme Court precedent by limiting the conflicting precedent to its fact.<br />

CP:<br />
Text: The United States Supreme Court should limit Milliken v. Bradley 418 U.S 717 to its facts by recognizing that racial segregation is often a vestige of prior discrimination and create a rebuttable presumption to this effect. The United State Supreme Court should hold that federal district courts have the authority to impose multidistrict remedies in instances where housing segregation has been demonstrated (via this rebttable presumption). The United States Supreme Court should not overrule any of its prior decisions and should instead distinguish all decisions which conflict with a prior Supreme Court precedent by limiting the conflicting precedent to it facts.<br />
