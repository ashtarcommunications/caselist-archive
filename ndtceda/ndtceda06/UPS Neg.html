UPS JR -- Baudrillard<br />
<br />
BAUDRILLARD<br />
RADICAL OPPOSITION TO THE SYSTEM AFFIRMS ITS EXISTANCE. OPPOSING DISCOURSES ALLOWS THE SYSTEM TO SIMULATE ITS OWN DEATH AND DELAY ITS COLLAPSE<br />
BAUDRILLARD IN 81<br />
SIMULACRA AND SIMULATION P. 18-19<br />
IT IS ALWAYS…OF ITS ALREADY DEAD.<br />
<br />
SPEAKING OUT AND RAISING AWARENESS IS PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE SYSTEM THEY CRITICIZE, BECAUSE IT IS INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE SPEECH WITHOUT CREATING CHANGE. INSTEAD, WE NEED TO ENGAGE THE SYSTEM THROUGH PASSIVE RESISTANCE, NOT ACTIV OPPOSITION<br />
BAUDRILLARD IN 81<br />
SIMULACRA AND SIMULATION P. 84-86<br />
THE SUBJECT-RESISTANCE IS TODAY UNILATERLLY…AND OF SPEECH.<br />
<br />
AS POWER IS CRITICIZED AND DISAPPEARS, IT SEEKS EVEN HARDER TO REAFFIRM ITS EXISTENCE AND DELAY ITS DEATH – THIS OVERFASCINATION WITH POWER IN SOCIETIES THAT ARE LOSING IT RESULTS IN FASCISM<br />
SAME<br />
P. 22-23<br />
AS LONG AS THE HISTORICAL…ITS MOURNING.<br />
