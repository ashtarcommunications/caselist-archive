A. Struggles for rights and liberties situate the individual deep within the folds of sovereign power. This dominance of biopower makes options within the biopolitical horizon increasingly meaningless as power comes to operate through all forms of management.<br />

C.

UTD -- Judicial Activism D/A<br />
<br />
A.) Recent rulings prove there is a decrease in judicial activism<br />
The Seattle Times, 7/30/06 (Lornet Turnbull, &quot;Gay-marriage advocates grapple with their next course of action,&quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003162590_gaystrategy30m.html" rel="nofollow">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003162590_gaystrategy30m.html</a>)<br />

<br />
B.) Unique Link- Despite Bush v. Gore the judiciary still holds onto its legitimacy. However, future rulings and suspicions of activism will severely strain the constitutional order<br />

Anomic Feast<br />
<br />
The Aff is the prime example of the anomic feast in which social hierarchies were disturbed but only within the confines of sovereign power. The sovereign’s authorization of the questioning of convention revealed a secret solidarity between the law’s agenda of domination and supposedly ‘progressive’ programs of social resistance. This collusion reveals liberalism’s goals of protecting an individual through the law as a method of actively constituting the subject of domination<br />
Giorgio Agamben, State of Exception, pg. 71-73<br />
“The secret solidarity….between law and life.”<br />
<br />
Their liberatory practices attempt to preserve the sovereigny of biological life. Such tactics allow the individual to retreat to the private sphere but this is also an arena of barelife where control is internalized. We cannot take back our biological autonomy through politics because the two have been sutured together. Attempting to do so would only further submit to the confines of sovereignty<br />
Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, pg. 187-188<br />
“It is on the basis of…unprecedented biopolitical catastrophe.”<br />
<br />
The act of overruling creates a paradox in which the court is both inside and outside the law. This arena of suspension is the state of exception in which the law rewrites its boundaries in order to pressure sovereign power. Because the sovereign inhabits this dual position, it is able to grant “freedom” while preserving the biopoltical environmenta of it monopoly to decide<br />
Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer: Sovereign power and Bare Life, pg. 15-19<br />
“The paradox of sovereignty….outside, an exception.”<br />
<br />
<br />
AT: Perm<br />
<br />
The seeming protections endowed by rights constitute the subject of sovereign power. Life may be separated into form along the lines of rights’ distinctions. These divisions of being are mutually exclusive to the indivisible form of life that is “whatever being”<br />
Anne Caldwell, Theory and Event, 2004, “Bio-Sovereignty and the Emergence of Humanity”,<br />
“Can we imagine another form…within sovereignty: homo sacer.”<br />

Anomic Feast<br />
<br />
The Aff is the prime example of the anomic feast in which social hierarchies were disturbed but only within the confines of sovereign power. The sovereign’s authorization of the questioning of convention revealed a secret solidarity between the law’s agenda of domination and supposedly ‘progressive’ programs of social resistance. This collusion reveals liberalism’s goals of protecting an individual through the law as a method of actively constituting the subject of domination<br />
Giorgio Agamben, State of Exception, pg. 71-73<br />
“The secret solidarity….between law and life.”<br />
<br />
Their liberatory practices attempt to preserve the sovereigny of biological life. Such tactics allow the individual to retreat to the private sphere but this is also an arena of barelife where control is internalized. We cannot take back our biological autonomy through politics because the two have been sutured together. Attempting to do so would only further submit to the confines of sovereignty<br />
Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, pg. 187-188<br />
“It is on the basis of…unprecedented biopolitical catastrophe.”<br />
<br />
The act of overruling creates a paradox in which the court is both inside and outside the law. This arena of suspension is the state of exception in which the law rewrites its boundaries in order to pressure sovereign power. Because the sovereign inhabits this dual position, it is able to grant “freedom” while preserving the biopoltical environmenta of it monopoly to decide<br />
Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer: Sovereign power and Bare Life, pg. 15-19<br />
“The paradox of sovereignty….outside, an exception.”<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The seeming protections endowed by rights constitute the subject of sovereign power. Life may be separated into form along the lines of rights’ distinctions. These divisions of being are mutually exclusive to the indivisible form of life that is “whatever being”<br />
Anne Caldwell, Theory and Event, 2004, “Bio-Sovereignty and the Emergence of Humanity”,<br />
“Can we imagine another form…within sovereignty: homo sacer.”<br />

A. Struggles for rights and liberties situate the individual deep within the folds of sovereign power. This dominance of biopower makes options within the biopolitical horizon increasingly meaningless as power comes to operate through all forms of management.<br />

“1.2. Karl Lowith was the first to define… we will have to learn to recognize.”<br />

B. This inscription within biopolitics is at the heart of violence allowing every ‘citizen’ to be devalued and eliminated in the name of sovereign management.<br />
Agamben 98 (Giorgio – Univ. Verona Philosophy professor, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, Stanford UP, p. 139-140)<br />

“3.3. It is not our intention here to take… biological body of every living being.”<br />

<br />
The Alternative: vote negative and accept whatever being.<br />

C. Whatever being is life that has no essence that can be separated from it, no capacity for the infusion of rights and yet no need for their illusive promises of “freedom.” Whatever being dissolves the bond that attaches the subject to sovereignty through dissolving the very basis of identity.<br />

Topic education – by manipulating the topic to access their project they skirt debate about the implementation of policies by the government – their education is distrusting of institutional study and pragmatic reform.<br />

Thus far, I have argued that… exclude those who reject civility and democracy<br />

Ground – the aff will always win that the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract – we can only debate the merits of their framework if they defend the specific consequences of political implentaiton<br />

As for moral perfectionism, this would…. Might lead us to betray another<br />

Without predictable ground debate is meaningless<br />
Shively 2000, pg 182-183<br />
The point may seem trite, as surely the ambiguists… implicit in the act of argumentation<br />
<br />
Vote neg – the fairness of the aff advocacy must precede consideration of its merits or shit sucks<br />
Shively 2000, pg 181-182<br />
The requirements given thus far are primarily negative… contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony<br />
<br />
This is a-priori reason to vote<br />
Shively 2000, pg 179<br />
To put this point another way… firm support that we can give them<br />

Deliberative implications of their advocacy are a good question – preconditions of agreemnt are necessary for oyur decision to have any political value<br />

UTD -- Appeals court cp<br />
<br />
Text: the 11 united states federal courts of appeal should rule that (plan). The united states supreme court will deny cert to future cases.<br />
<br />
Our counterplan is competitive by avoiding the disads to federal overrule and judicial process – having the appeal courts overrule necessary precudes Supreme Court action, making the perm impossible.<br />
<br />
Next, the counterplan solves – inferior courts should not be constrained by precedent – the best judicial model has the lower courts act as proxies to shield the Supreme Court<br />

Case – Terrorism<br />
The rhetoric of terror creates an us/them divide that legitimizes unlimited performances of violence and the Satanization of the Other which makes self-critique impossible and leads inevitably to total extermination<br />
Robert L. Ivie, 2002, www.indiana.edu/~ivieweb/profiling.htm<br />
“it is difficult to ignore the disturbing…immediate case in point”<br />
<br />
We must stop using terrorism as a sign of violence and be willing to see our reflection in the Other. Terror discourse is a dialectic that when recognized unrolls into a process of self-enlightenment that liberates and exposes the double image<br />
Anil Jain, 2003, “terror and the language of fear” www.power-xs.de/jain/pub/terroreng.pdf<br />
