OBSERVATION 1: INHERENCY<br />
<br />
1. Due to Casey, mandatory delay and informed consent laws now exist in about half of the states<br />
PPFA in 2005.  [“Impact of Abortion Restrictions.” Chris Hayhurst, 9.15, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ppfa.org/pp2/portal/files/portal/webzine/newspoliticsactivism/fean-050915-abortion-restrictions.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.ppfa.org/pp2/portal/files/portal/webzine/newspoliticsactivism/fean-050915-abortion-restrictions.xml</a>]<br />
<br />
2. Abortion legislation creates impasses that disable women from exercising reproductive rights.<br />
Feldt in 2004.  [Gloria, Former CEO of PPFA, War on Choice : The Right Wing Attack on Women's Rights and How to Fight Back. Westminster, MD, USA: Bantam Books. p 129-130., RifRaf.]<br />
<br />
THUS WE PRESENT THE FOLLOWING PLAN:<br />
<br />
RESOLVED: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey by holding that the mandatory waiting period, informed consent, and parental notification provisions unduly burden women's right to reproductive autonomy.<br />
<br />
Funding and enforcement guaranteed through normal means. We reserve the right to clarify. If you have questions, please ask.<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION 2: HARMS<br />
<br />
Advantage One – Ageism<br />
<br />
1. Casey espouses an ideology that affords minors no constitutional freedom or privilege, ensuring that they will never have full legitimacy.<br />
<br />
Berman in 1994  [JD U of Toledo, 1994 (Leonard, 7 How. L.J. 577 OTE: PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY: SUPREME NEGLECT FOR UNEMANCIPATED MINORS' ABORTION RIGHTS]<br />
<br />
2. The next step in minors rights is to give women constitutional parity in regards to abortion and privacy.<br />
<br />
Berman in 1994  [JD U of Toledo, 1994 (Leonard, 7 How. L.J. 577 OTE: PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY: SUPREME NEGLECT FOR UNEMANCIPATED MINORS' ABORTION RIGHTS]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. The plan begins the first step to initiating the discussion on youth liberation by admitting that ageism exists. Young people are taught that social dominance is ok at a young age, corrupting their ideology for the rest of their life.<br />
<br />
Dominick in 1997 [Brian A Dominick, youth activist and writer,”young and oppressed”, 1997, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zmag.org/0009.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zmag.org/0009.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
4. The adult/child dichotomy is the foundation for which all oppression exists.<br />
<br />
Dominick in 1997 [Brian A Dominick, youth activist and writer,”revolution kid style”, 1997, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zmag.org/0009.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zmag.org/0009.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: PATRIARCHY<br />
<br />
1. Mandatory waiting periods and informed consent requirements, both allowed under Casey, uphold patriarchal conceptions of women that deny their autonomy.<br />
SMITH in 2002. [Heather, Candidate for Juris Doctor, University of Colorado School of Law, 2002, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO LAW REVIEW; Comment: A New Prescription For Abortion;]<br />
<br />
2. Restricting abortion denies that women are fully human, and that they lack unique personal identity.<br />
Hanigsberg in 1995 [Julia, Columbia Law School MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW; Homologizing pregnancy and motherhood: a consideration of abortion, 1995]<br />
<br />
3. The court treats women as less than adults and unable to make their own decisions.<br />
Daly ’95 [Erin Daly, Assistant Professor Widner University School of Law, Reconsidering Abortion Law: Liberty, Equality, and the New Rhetoric of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/journal/lawrev/45/daly.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wcl.american.edu/journal/lawrev/45/daly.cfm</a>, American University Law Review, October 1995) ASH/LN/WIU<br />
<br />
4. Abortion restrictions reinforce the bias against women that is intrinsic to western society.<br />
Siegel 92  [Reva Siegel, Acting Professor of Law, University of California at Berkeley, “Reasoning from the Body: A Historical Perspective on Abortion Regulation and Questions of Equal Protection,” Stanford Law Review, January 1992, LexisNexis) PEH/WIU<br />
<br />
5. Parental consent legislation demoralizes waves of young women by forcing them to accept an inferior position in society. This is particularly true for younger women whose emotional and psychological development is dependent upon personal decision making. Failure to combat traditional stereotypes about women make full equality in society impossible.<br />
Schmidt, 1993  [Catherine, 68 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 597 WHERE PRIVACY FAILS: EQUAL PROTECTION AND THE ABORTION RIGHTS OF MINORS]<br />
<br />
6. This retrenchment of patriarchy risks extinction<br />
Reardon in 1993  [Betty, feminist author and peace activist, WOMEN AND PEACE: FEMINIST VISIONS OF GLOBAL SECURITY, 1993, p.30-1.]<br />
OBSERVATION 3: SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
1. Revoking 24-hour delays best ensures a well-reasoned decision without mental or physical anguish.<br />
Benshoof in 1993  [Janet, Associate Prof. of Law @ Harvard U &amp; founder and president of the Center for Reproductive Law &amp; Policy. Journal of the American Medical Association “Planned Parenthood v Casey: The Impact of the New Undue Burden Standard On Reproductive Health Care” pp 2249-2257, May 5, mitterbees]<br />
<br />
3. Ending paternalistic restrictions on abortion access is key to promote gender equality and female autonomy.<br />
Daly in 1995.  [Erin Reconsidering Abortion Law: Liberty, Equality, and the New Rhetoric of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The American University Law Review. (Assistant Professor, Widener University School of Law., October 1995, RifRaf.)<br />
<br />
4. Working towards an abortion jurisprudence centered on women’s autonomy is central to subverting patriarchy and stratification linked to the supposed roles of women.<br />
Reilly in 1995 [Elizabeth, Associate Dean and Professor of Law, The University of Akron School of Law, THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF GENDER &amp; THE LAW; The Rhetoric of Disrespect: Uncovering the Faulty Premises Infecting Reproductive Rights]<br />
<br />
2. General medical guidelines are sufficient in controlling abortion procedures – informed consent is not needed.<br />
Van Detta ’01 [Jerrey A. Van Detta, Associate Professor of Law, John Marshall Law School, Southern California Review of Law and Women's Studies, Spring 2001] LN/ASH/WIU<br />
<br />
5. Protecting freedom of reproductive choice is key to all human liberty and checks statist restrictions on personhood.<br />
Mariner in 1992  [Wendy K. , JD, Prof of Law @ Boston U. American Journal of Public Health. “The Supreme Court, Abortion, and the Jurisprudence of Class” 14, Novemeber 1992, mitterbees88]<br />
<br />
6. Anti-abortion policies sacrifice a woman’s individual rights to the potential rights of her fetus. We must fight all laws that restrict abortion to preserve individual rights.<br />
Woiceshyn in 2004   [Glenn, Writer for the Ayn Rand Institute. Capitalism Magazine “Ban on &quot;Partial-Birth&quot; Abortion Violates Women's Rights” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://capmag.com/article.asp?ID=3730" rel="nofollow">http://capmag.com/article.asp?ID=3730</a>, June 5, 2004, mitten]
