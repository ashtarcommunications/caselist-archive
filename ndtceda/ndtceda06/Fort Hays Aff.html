PERFORMANCE AFF- “We engage the poetry to make better supreme court decisions” claim that they use poetry to overrule the topic claims to overrule all 4 cases- not just one<br />
<br />
<br />
Condition will be failed, wake up from your dream, look about use your only chance. Don't care much about death. Calling you, you are lying motionless, think about your future, future will be back. My brother, I am worried about you, waking you up, but you don't listen, you will be so sorry- you will not understand. We are of a religion<br />
<br />
Amad L. Jabori<br />

Why do you inscribe our infancy in your gosford? Who acknowledges you? Help see whats wrong. Humbled, doesn't have a room, I know I have work to do- fight G-d try to save him- ease his mind time for him to go back home<br />
<br />
Lead to an appreciation of resistence- engender transformation- conceptualized parties into a sobering state- poetry is one practice that reframes global politics- transformative potential- poetry is a discoursive design- becomes more intertwined- significant transversal dimensions-poetry draws attention to objectification<br />
<br />
Linguistic interference with objectifications- socially entrenches<br />
<br />
Poetic sense avoids normalization of legal practice<br />
<br />
Leash through long process<br />
<br />
Avoids discursive formations<br />
Empowers social and political dynamics- a poem is open in space and time<br />
Even the agent becomes overwhelmed- cannot reduce a poem just to itself<br />
<br />
Influences tradition of societal<br />

<h3 id="toc11"><a name="x-Team Name Aff: Fort Hays SY-Plan Text"></a><em>Plan Text</em></h3>
During a long borring hour, establish countries without police- cannot attack consumers- create oceans I draw a new colored map poorer refugees go to the coast, switch afganastan, smuggle Kuwait from it’s boarder- keep the oil field intact. Transport Bagdad.<br />
<br />
Fhahid Alzauwi- he calls his poem- in his spirit high- we call our plan topical<br />
<br />
No courage- they are slaves- even in this cage- know greater freedoms<br />

Plan: We affirm the topic<br />
<br />
We affirm the ? in the zone of indistinction between inside and outside, belonging and abandonment – we define and perform the topological spikes of Quirin. This debate and SQ “War on Terror” – only thus performed and deformed is survival life thinkable. In performing spaces of debate turn an interrogation of Chinese biopolitics and detention.<br />
