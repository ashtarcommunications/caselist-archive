SUPREME COURT HAS OVERWHELMINGLY AFFIRMED THAT DETAINEES HAVE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO U.S. COURTS<br />
Erwin Chemerinsky, Alston &amp; Bird Professor of Law, Duke University, “Unanswered Questions,” GREEN BAG v. 7, Summer 2004, p. 324-325.<br />
In three cases … war on terrorism.<br />
<br />
HAMDI DECISION GRANTS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS TO U.S. CITIZENS CLASSIFIED AS ENEMY COMBATANTS<br />
Erwin Chemerinsky, Alston &amp; Bird Professor of Law, Duke University, “Unanswered Questions,” GREEN BAG v. 7, Summer 2004, p. 326-327.<br />
The other four … without any form of due process.<br />
<br />
COURTS MAKING AT LEAST SOME EFFORTS TO PROTECT CIVIL LIBERTIES IN THE WAR ON TERROR<br />
Steven R. Shapiro, National Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union, “Defending Civil Liberties in the War on Terror: The Role of the Courts in the War Against Terrorist: A Preliminary Assessment,” THE FLETCHER FORUM OF WORLD AFFAIRS v. 29, Winter 2005, p. 103.<br />
Three years after … an encouraging sign.<br />
<br />
RASUL DECISION ASSERTED COURT POWER AS THE PROTECTOR OF CIVIL LIBERTIES<br />
Steven R. Shapiro, National Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union, “Defending Civil Liberties in the War on Terror: The Role of the Courts in the War Against Terrorist: A Preliminary Assessment,” THE FLETCHER FORUM OF WORLD AFFAIRS v. 29, Winter 2005, p. 108.<br />
Seizing on these points… peacetime, for aliens as well as citizens.<br />
<br />
THE HAMDAN DECISION HAS REQUIRED TRIBUNALS CONFORM TO INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THAT COMMON ARTICLE 3 PROTECTIONS APPLY TO DETAINEES<br />
WASHINGTON TIMES 8/7/2006<br />
[“Justice for Jihadists”, p. ln <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
After the Supreme Court's June …Court standards.<br />
<br />
FIRST, OVERRULING DOESN’T SOLVE WAR ON TERROR PROBLEMS:<br />
A) OTHER PRECEDENTS EXIST<br />
WUERTH (Assoc. Prof of Law at Univ. of Cincinnati) 2004<br />
[Ingrind Brunk, “The President’s Power to Detain Enemy Combatants”, Northwestern Law Review, Summer p. ln</em> wyo-tjc]<br />
Although Quirin is said … by providing its advice and consent to that Convention.<br />
<br />
B) BUSH VIOLATES QUIRIN NOW—IT DOESN’T GIVE HIM HIS POWER<br />
ORENTLICHER &amp; GOLDMAN (Prof’s of Law @ Washington College) 2002<br />
[Diane &amp; Robert, “When Justice Goes to War”, Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy, Spring, p. ln <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
Much like the Supreme Court's … challenge the lawfulness of their prosecution before a<br />
<br />
C) QUIRIN SUPPORTS INTERNATIONAL LAW NOW<br />
JINKS &amp; SLOSS (Assoc. Professors of Law at Arizona State &amp; St. Louis Univ) 2004<br />
[Derek &amp; David, “Is the President Bound by the Geneva Conventions?”, Cornell Law Review, Nov, p. ln</em> wyo-tjc]<br />
By its terms, this provision … does not authorize their use.<br />
<br />
SECOND, CIVILIAN COURTS FAIL:<br />
A) THEIR INADEQUATE FOR TERRORISTS<br />
Amanda Schaffer, J.D. Candidate, Fordham University School of Law, “LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF TERRORISTS: AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S RIGHT TO CLASSIFY UNITED STATES CITIZENS SUSPECTED OF TERRORIST AS ENEMY COMBATANTS AND TRY THOSE ENEMY COMBATANTS BY MILITARY COMMISSION,” Fordham Urban Law Journal, v.30, May 2003, p. 1474-1475.<br />
Trying suspected terrorists …terrorist suspects.<br />
<br />
B) AL QAEDA IS A UNIQUE THREAT<br />
WEDGWOOD (Board of Editors) 2002<br />
[Ruth, “Military Commissions”, American Journal of International Law, April, p. ln <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
Good faith … the network's members.<br />
<br />
C) MILITARY COMMISSIONS ARE COMPARATIVELY BETTER<br />
Joseph P. Bielke, Staff Judge Advocate, Pacific Air-Forces Australia, “AL-QAEDA &amp; TALIBAN UNLAWFUL COMBATANT DETAINEES, UNLAWFUL BELLIGERENCY, AND THE INTERNATIONAL LAWS OF ARMED CONFLICT,” AIR FORCE LAW REVIEW, v. 55, 2004 p. 73-74.<br />
Similarly, when necessary, … against protected civilians.<br />
<br />
D) CAUSES DOMESTIC OVERSTRETCH, CAN’T RESPOND TO DISASTERS<br />
Cynthia Honssinger et al., Chief Council Office of Governor Bill Owens, State of Colorado, Brief Amici Curiae of the Honorable Bill Owens, Governor of the State of Colorado, and the Honorable Rick Perry, Governor of the State of Texas, in Support of Respondent United States, Shafiz Rasul et al., Petitions, v. George W. Bush President of the United States Et al., Respondents; Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad Al Odah, et al., Petitioners, v. United States of America et al., Respondents, Nos. 03-334, 03-343, 2003 U.S BRIEFS 334, March 3, 2004, npg.<br />
States often rely on … to domestic emergencies.<br />
<br />
THIRD, LEGITIMACY TURN<br />
A) GRANTING TERRORISTS POW STATUS DESTROYS THE POWER OF LAW, GRANTING LEGITIMACY TO TERRORIST ACTIONS, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS<br />
ZACHARY (J.D.) 2005<br />
[Shlomy, “Between the Geneva Conventions”, Israel Law Review, Winter/Spring, p. ln</em> wyo-tjc]<br />
Klabbers takes Rubin's … encourage the continuation of terrorism.<br />
<br />
B) THAT CAUSES EXTINCTION<br />
Harvey Gordon, Visiting Lecturer, Forensic Psychiatry, Tel Aviv University, “The ‘Suicide’ Bomber: Is It a Psychiatric Phenomenon?” PSYCHIATRIC BULLETIN v. 26, 2002, pp. 285-287. Available from the Wrold Wide Web at: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/26/8/285" rel="nofollow">http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/26/8/285</a>.<br />
Although terrorism throughout human history … destruction of life, including their own.<br />
<br />
FOURTH, LAW OF WAR TURN<br />
A) ELIMINATING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAWFUL AND UNLAWFUL ENEMY COMBATANTS LEADS TO COLLATERAL DEATH AND GREATER SUFFERING BY CIVILIANS.<br />
Joseph P. Bielke, Staff Judge Advocate, Pacific Air-Forces Australia, “AL-QAEDA &amp; TALIBAN UNLAWFUL COMBATANT DETAINEES, UNLAWFUL BELLIGERENCY, AND THE INTERNATIONAL LAWS OF ARMED CONFLICT,” AIR FORCE LAW REVIEW, v. 55, 2004 p. 7-8.<br />
Armed conflict places … for failing to do so.<br />
<br />
B) THAT CAUSES INDISCRIMINATE SLAUGHTER<br />
Joseph P. Bielke, Staff Judge Advocate, Pacific Air-Forces Australia, “AL-QAEDA &amp; TALIBAN UNLAWFUL COMBATANT DETAINEES, UNLAWFUL BELLIGERENCY, AND THE INTERNATIONAL LAWS OF ARMED CONFLICT,” AIR FORCE LAW REVIEW, v. 55, 2004 p. 13.<br />
If an opposing side is … compliance with LOAC.<br />
<br />
FIFTH, COURT DUCKING<br />
A) USING FORMAL LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THE SCOPE OF EMERGENCY POWERS NORMALIZES THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. VAGUENESS OF WHAT THE POWERS ARE IS A GOOD DETERRENT AGAINST ABUSE<br />
Mark Tushnet, Professor, Constitutional Law, Georgetown University, “Defending Korematsu? Reflections on Civil Liberties in Wartime,” WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW, 2003, p. 303-304.<br />
As I have emphasized, … beyond the period of the emergency.<br />
<br />

B) THE FRAMERS COULD NOT ANTICIPATE ALL SCENARIOS FOR EMERGENCY. LITERAL INTERPRETATIONS CANNOT SOLVE SECURITY AND ENCOURAGE DISTORTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW<br />
Mark Tushnet, Professor, Constitutional Law, Georgetown University, “Defending Korematsu? Reflections on Civil Liberties in Wartime,” WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW, 2003, p. 299-300.<br />
The first possibility is … in the face of a less substantial one.&quot;<br />

C) NOT HAVING THE SUPREME COURT DECIDE MATTERS INVOLVING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IS BEST—PREVENTS BAD PRECEDENT.<br />

3. MULTILAT KILLS HEGEMONY<br />
(A) CONSTRAINS ACTION AND CAUSES FREE-RIDING<br />
KAGAN (CEIP) 1998<br />

These balancing factors … soft-power premium.<br />

<br />
4. QUEST FOR LEGITIMACY IS A DANGEROUS GAME: WMD PROLIFERATION AND TERRORISM MAKES IT UNTENABLE TO WAIT FOR OTHERS TO SELFISHLY TRY TO CONSTRAIN US POWER<br />
KAGAN (Carnegie Endowment for Int’l Peace) 2004<br />

5. UNILATERALISM IS ESSENTIAL TO DETER WARS BEFORE THEY BREAK OUT—FORCE CAPABILITIES THEMSELVES AREN’T ENOUGH<br />
ABSHIRE (President CSIS) ‘96<br />
[David, Washington Quarterly, Spring, p. 39+, LN<em>mac-dch]<br />
I have in mind, too, a …. proactive; force is inherently reactive, coming into play when the peace is lost due to the failure effectively to use power.<br />

6. SOLVES TERRORISM<br />
(A) PREEMPTION IS NECESSARY TO DETER WMD PROLIFERATION BY ADVENTURIST STATES AND TERRORISTS<br />
KRAUTHAMMER (journalist) ‘03<br />
[Charles, “The Unipolar Moment Revisited,” The National Interest, Winter 2002/3, ASP]<br />
Now, those uneasy with American … a cost, a very high cost.<br />
<br />
(B) GLOBAL COOPERATION ON THE WAR ON TERROR WON’T SOLVE—BURDENS TO INTELLIGENCE COOPERATION OVERWHELM ANY BENEFIT<br />
MILLER (Dir., Int’l Security Prog., Belfer Center for Science &amp; Int’l Affairs, JFK, Harvard Univ.) ‘02<br />
[Steven E., Washington Quarterly, Winter, LN]<br />
No one can dispute that the campaign … from dubious sources?<br />
<br />
(C) COALITIONS ARE A LIABILITY AGAINST TERRORISM—THEY’LL USE OPERATIONS TO BRAKE US POWER, NOT FIGHT TERRORISM<br />
MILLER (Dir., Int’l Security Prog., Belfer Center for Science &amp; Int’l Affairs, JFK, Harvard Univ.) ‘02<br />

TEXT:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should grant cert to an appropriate test case and uphold Ex Parte Quirin 317 U.S. 1 (1942) by holding that the Court has a constitutional right to judicial review in cases of government detention and that enemy combatants may only be tried by military commission when pursuant to an act of Congress.<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Solvency<br />
<br />
A. BUSH’S DENIAL OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AND MODEL OF DEFERENCE IS NOT GROUNDED IN QUIRIN—HE IS IN BLATANT VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF QUIRIN RIGHT NOW<br />

FIRST, THE LINKS:<br />
A) THE AFFIRMATIVE’S CRITIQUE HAS FUNDAMENTALLY MISSED THE POINT—THE CAMPS ARE NOT THE PERMANENT RENDERING OF THE EXCEPTION OUTSIDE OF LAW, BUT THE EXCESS OF LAW ITSELF<br />
JOHNS (Univ. of Sydney, Faculty of Law) 2006<br />
[Fleur, “Guantanamo Bay and the Annihilation of the Exception”, European Journal of International Law, Vol. 16, No. 4 wyo-tjc]<br />
Is Guantánamo Bay, Cuba… interrogation and resistance.<br />
<br />
B) CONCEPTUALIZING EMERGENCY POWERS AS THE SUSPENSION OF LAW FETISHIZES AND REDEEMS LAW AS A SAVIOR-POWER THAT STANDS OUTSIDE OF POLITICS, ERASING AND STRENGTHENING IT’S HISTORICAL FOUNDATIONS IN ENFORCING THE SOCIAL ORDER OF MODERN CAPITALISM. THIS DESTROYS THE RADICAL POTENTIAL OF THE AFFIRMATIVE, AS THEY SETTLE FOR THE ‘GOOD-ENOUGH’ GESTURE OF THE PLAN<br />
NEOCLEOUS (Politics &amp; History @ Brunel University) 2006<br />
[Mark, “the Problem with Normality”, Alternatives, no. 31 <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
To criticize the use … fabrication of social order.<br />
<br />
C) THEIR MODEL OF POLITICS, NO MATTER HOW SUBVERSIVE OR RADICAL, FUNDAMENTALLY EXAGERATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FORMAL INSTITUTION OF POLITICS AND POWER—THIS CONSTRAINED HORIZON IS NO ACCIDENT BUT PROOF OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE HAS INFECTED YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN ITSELF<br />
HARNECKER 2000<br />
[Marta, Dir of MEPLA, Links, p. online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dsp.org.au/links/back/issue16/harnecker.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsp.org.au/links/back/issue16/harnecker.html</a></em> wyo]<br />
To think about the construction … that has to be built.<br />
<br />
SECOND, THE IMPACTS:<br />
A) TURNS THE CASE COMPLETELY—<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE’S ATTEMPT TO REPROJECT LAW INTO THE WAR ON TERROR PRESUMES THAT LAW IS THE ABSENCE OF THE EXCEPTION, MISTAKING THE INTRINSIC LINK BETWEEN LAW AND SOVEREIGNTY. THIS RENDERS SOVEREIGN POWER INVISIBLE, ALLOWING FAR MORE INSIDIOUS EXTENSIONS OF THE STATE OF EXCEPTION<br />
KOHN (Prof. Poli Sci at Univ. Florida) 2006<br />
[Margaret, “Bare Life and the Limits of Law”, Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 9, No. 2<em> wyo-tjc]<br />
Agamben's critique …and legitimizes marginality and exclusion.<br />
<br />
B) OUTWEIGHS IT: THE AFFIRMATIVE’S LEGAL APOLOGISM NOT ONLY EXTENDS THE VERY PROCESSES THEY OPPOSE BUT ALSO DESTROYS CRITICAL ENERGIES NECESSARY TO RESIST GLOBAL SOURCES OF OPPRESSION AND VIOLENCE<br />
JOHNS (Univ. of Sydney, Faculty of Law) 2006<br />
[Fleur, “Guantanamo Bay and the Annihilation of the Exception”, European Journal of International Law, Vol. 16, No. 4 </em>wyo-tjc]<br />
In arguing against Agamben and ot…the exception in these terms.<br />
<br />
THIRD, VOTE NEGATIVE:<br />
A) A TRUE ALTERNATIVE BEYOND THE STATE OF EXCEPTION IS INEVITABLY IN THE OFFING, BUT ONLY IF WE REJECT THE AFFIRMATIVE’S REPRESENTATION OF THE GUANTANMO CAMPS AS STANDING OUTSIDE THE ORDER OF LAW—SUCH REPRESENTATIONS NECESSARILY CONSTRICT THE UNIVERSE OF ACTION AROUND WEAK CALLS TO REASSERT LAW, WHICH IS THE PRIMARY CONDITION FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE EMERGENCY STATE IN THE FIRST PLACE. ONLY BY REFUSING TO WORK WITHIN THE LAW WE CREATE THE TRUE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND DISMANTLE THE SYSTEM<br />
NEOCLEOUS (Politics &amp; History @ Brunel University) 2006<br />
[Mark, “the Problem with Normality”, Alternatives, no. 31// wyo-tjc]<br />
The question to ask,…the rule of law.<br />
<br />
B) A NEGATIVE BALLOT TO DENY POWER TO LAW IS THE FIRST STRIKE AGAINST THE STATIST IMAGINARY, EXPOSING IT’S VIOLENT IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION. THIS METHOD IS CRITICAL TO ESTABLISH NEW POLITICAL HORIZONS BEYOND THE STATE’S FAULTY UNDERSTANDING OF IDENTITY.<br />

YOUR CLAIMS OF RADICAL EMANCIPATION ARE A FARCE—ABORTION RIGHTS ARE MERELY A TOOL FOR THE ELITE CLASSES TO MAINTAIN EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO A RACIST, UNJUST SYSTEM THAT CREATES YOUR SCENARIOS IN THE FIRST PLACE<br />
ZAVARZADEH (Dept of English @ Syracuse) 2002<br />
[Mas’ud, “The Labor Theory of (Anti)Abortion”, Red Critique, Sept/Oct, p. online wyo-tjc]<br />
Pro-choice feminists have … women continues to be restricted.<br />
<br />
TO CLAIM THAT ABORTION RIGHTS HOLD THE KEY TO EMANCIPATION IS AS DANGEROUS AS IT IS DELUSIONAL—SUCH CLAIMS ONLY LOCALIZE THE ABORTION ISSUE, SERVING AS AN IDEOLOGICAL SMOKESCREEN FOR THE ENTRENCHMENT OF CAPITAL—ONLY THE RADICAL ALTERNATIVE OF LABOR CAN GET US OUT OF THIS DEADLOCK<br />

ANTI-ABORTION IDEOLOGY IS HISTORICALLY DETERMINED BY THE RELATIONS OF PRODUCTION AS MEANS OF MYSTIFYING SYSTEMS OF EXPLOITATION AND REINFORCING THE NUCLEAR FAMILY AS THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF A CHEAP LABOR FORCE. THE SUDDEN EMERGENCE OF ‘LIFE AT CONCEPTION’ ALONGSIDE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISM EXPOSES THEIR ANTI-ABORTION REPRESENTATIONS FOR THE WHAT THEY ARE: A FALSE CONSCIOUSNESS MEANT TO LEGITIMIZE THE ECONOMIC BASE<br />

MCVEY 2001<br />

REPRESENTATIONS OF THE SANCTITY OF LIFE FALSELY ABSTRACT MATERIAL INEQUALITY, MERELY REPLICATING CAPITALIST EXPLOITATION IN WORSE WAYS<br />
ZAVARZADEH (Dept of English @ Syracuse) 2002<br />
[Mas’ud, “The Labor Theory of (Anti)Abortion”, Red Critique, Sept/Oct, p. online wyo-tjc]<br />
The pro-life movement also … not a cultural or legal matter.<br />
<br />
PRO-LIFE REPRESENTATIONS MERELY HIDE BEHIND CLAIMS OF THE ‘SANCTITY OF LIFE’ TO ERASE AND MASK MATERIAL INEQUALITY—THIS RADICAL CONSERVATIVE PROJECT SEEKS ONLY TO INCREASE THE LABOR POOL, DEPRESSING WAGES AND MAXIMIZING PROFIT<br />

THE DETERMINISM OF CAPITAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INSTRUMENTALIZATION OF ALL LIFE—IT IS THIS LOGIC THAT MOBILIZES AND ALLOWS FOR THE VIOLENCE HIGHLIGHTED BY THE 1AC<br />
DYER-WITHERFORD (professor of Library and Info. Sciences at the U of Western Ontario) 1999<br />
[Nick. Cyber Marx: Cycles and Circuits of Struggle in High Technology Capitalism.]<br />
For capitalism, the use of … backfired is all too obvious.<br />

SECOND, HISTORIES WORST ATROCITIES ARE NOT BORN OUT OF A FAILURE TO APPRECIATE LIFE, BUT CAPITALS PROFIT LOGIC, WHICH MAKES ANNHILATION A REGRETTABLE NECESSITY<br />
Joel Kovel, Alger Hiss Professor, Social Studies, Bard College, THE ENEMY OF NATURE: THE END OF CAPITALISM OR THE END OF THE WORLD, 2002, p. 141.<br />
Capital produces egoic…regrettable necessities.<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN ETHICAL ACTION THAT STANDS OUTSIDE OF POLITICS—YOUR ETHICAL DEMAND TO COME PRIOR TO THE STRUCTURAL NEGATION OF CAPITAL IS THE LARGEST VIOLATION OF ETHICS<br />

Vote Negative to validate and adopt the method of structural/historical criticism that is the 1NC.<br />
<br />
THIS IS NOT THE ALTERNATIVE, BUT IN TRUTH THE ONLY OPTION— METHOD IS THE FOREMOST POLITICAL QUESTION BECAUSE ONE MUST UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING SOCIAL TOTALITY BEFORE ONE CAN ACT ON IT—GROUNDING THE SITES OF POLITICAL CONTESTATION OR KNOWLEDGE OUTSIDE OF LABOR AND SURPLUS VALUE MERELY SERVE TO HUMANIZE CAPITAL AND PREVENT A TRANSITION TO A SOCIETY BEYOND OPPRESSION<br />
TUMINO (Prof. English @ Pitt) 2001<br />
[Stephen, “What is Orthodox Marxism and Why it Matters Now More than Ever”, Red Critique, p. online wyo-tjc]<br />
Any effective … masquerades as social theory.<br />
<br />
AND NEXT, RESISTANCE TO CAPITAL MUST BE A TOTAL NEGATION OF THE SYSTEM FROM OUT-SIDE OF GOVERNMENT—WHILE SOME INSIDE POLITICAL GAINS ARE POSSIBLE, THEY ARE TRUMPED BY THE ABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO USE REFORMS TO RESTABILIZE CAPITAL AND MARGINALIZE LABOR AS A SOCIAL ALTERNATIVE<br />
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 1995<br />
[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, wyo]<br />
p. 738<br />
Thus the role of labour’s … the massive extra-parliamentary power of capital.<br />
<br />
AND SO MUCH FOR YOUR PERMUTATION—CAPITALISM IS AN INERTIAL SYSTEM—ANY VESITAGE LEFT REMAINING BY THE PERMUTATION WILL INEVITABLY SPIN BACK UP. LIKE A MANY-HEADED HYDRA, IT WILL REGENERATE WITH EVERY ATTEMPT THAT ATTACKS THE INSTRUMENTS AS OPPOSSED TO THE SYSTEM ITSELF***<br />

FINALLY, METHODOLOGY IS THE FOREMOST POINT OF DEPARTURE TO ANY POLITICAL QUERY. YOU SHOULD EVALUATE EPISTEMOLOGY FIRST BECAUSE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT PROBLEMS DETERMINES HOW YOU RESPOND TO THEM AND THE CONSEQUENCES THEY ENGENDER<br />
