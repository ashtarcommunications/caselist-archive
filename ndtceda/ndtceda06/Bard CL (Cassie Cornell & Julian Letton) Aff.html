1. WHILE THERE IS NO STATE THERE IS STATIST BEHAVIOUR ON THE PART OF INDIVUALS. THE ONLY WAY TO RESOLVE THE SOURCES OF OPPRESSION IS TO FULLY ENGAGE IN A MICRO-P\OLITICS<br />

“the state is really…sexism and nationalism”<br />
2. ANHILATION OF THE OTHER IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE WORLD OF THE AFF, B/CUZ IT WOULD NECESSARILY ANNHILATE THE SELF. WE VALUE COMPETITION WITH THE OTHER, NEVER RELATIONS OF POWER<br />
HATAB, 2K2 (“Why we can still be nietzscheans” Journal of Nietzsche, p. muse)<br />
“We can begin…instrinsically social activity”<br />
3. OUR F/W IS THAT WE SEE THE INDIVIDUAL AS ALWAYS FREE TO SELF GOVERNANCE. ANY ATTEMPT TO CAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL TO FOLLOW A PRE-DETERMINED PATTERN IS DEHUMANIZING B/CUZ IT VALUES ENDS OVER THE HUMAN WILL. THIS THEN LEGITIMATES THE WORST KINDS OF VIOLENCE<br />

2AC CASE DEBATE:<br />
1. WE ARE NOT NIHILISTS BECAUSE WE DO NOT GET RID OF ALL RULES AND LEAVE THE GAME, BUT WE CHANGE THE RULES AND REINVENT THE GAME. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE REINVENT OUR OWN GAME IN ORDER TO FREE OURSELVES FROM DEBATES LAWS WITHOUT CEASING TO CARE OR BELIEVE IN LIFE<br />
JOHNSTON, 99 (Ian, “theres nothing Nietzsche couldn’t teach ya about the raising of the wrist: a lecture in liberal studies”<br />
“hence we arrive…limited human beings”<br />
2. LIFE IS INSTRINCALLYY DESTRUCTIVE AND UNJUST, AND ESTABLISHING UNIVERSAL LAWSA TO PREVENT STRUGGLE ONLY BRINGS ABOUT DEMORALIZATION AND HATRED OF LIFE<br />
NIETZSCHE, 1956 (birth of tragedy, p. 208)<br />
“no act of violence…reign of nothingness”<br />
3. TABOOS CAUSE THE BAD THINGS THEY PROHIBIT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY INCITE US TO DISOBEY FOR THE SAKE OF JOUISSANCE<br />

They broke a new affirmative (which is below) at Districts where they overrule Casey and claim the law is a simulation. They read Baudrillard and Nietchze. The don't defend the tags and the 1ac as a normative statement that is an endorsement of the resolution but rather a playful engagement of words<br />
<br />
<br />
God is dead, the law cannot have any absolute meaning. Unless the legal system claims a transcendent god it must be utterly arbitrary<br />
<br />
The modern condition is such that the influx of laws and rules in our everyday lives make us nothing more than slaves in a prison who imagine ourselves to be free.<br />
<br />
Rationalism that sees no limit to its power wi8ll soon become a maniacal dictatoer over evey instant of social interaction<br />
<br />
Campos ‘98, Jurismania: the madness of American law p.153, 34, 11<br />
<br />
Following laws just because they are already there removes any joy in life and the possibility for excellence making us conformists instead of thinkers, and thus incapable of living meaningful lives.<br />
<br />
Johnston ‘99 “there’s nothing Nietzsche couldn’t teach ya about the raising of the wrist: a lecture in liberal studies”<br />
<br />
Politics is about the mastery of simulated space not real space. Recognizing the seduction of politics is the only way to break down the power it holds over us.<br />
<br />
Baudrillard ‘90, Seduction p. 65<br />
<br />
Our legal system is nothing more than a meaningless competition among different political and partial criteria backed by force.<br />
<br />
Berkowitz ’05, the gift of science p. 4<br />
<br />
Power does not exist. It is only a seduction to the people and if it is not responded to then it disappears.<br />
<br />
Seduction is ubiquitous, it is in every discourse, every aspect of life. WE cannot fight it but we can recognize it. This is the revenge of the repressed, of the reality behind all our interactions.<br />
<br />
Baurdrillard “90, pgs 45,54<br />
<br />
Thus we affirm the resolution: The United States Supreme Court should overrule planned parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992)<br />
<br />
We affirm the going over of rules in the literal sense. We need to renounce the power that rules have over us, and engage in a process of questioning and crating our own rules. We affirm the overrule of Casey because we believe we should be free from laws that exert power over our bodies as well as our minds, but we do not need the 9 justices in Washington to take this action for us. We affirm overrule as the going over of this rule, which is an action we can and should take for ourselves, in order to take the stance that we can determine our own moralities. We go over the rule of casey, and we go over the rule that the court must do the ruling for us. Our overrule goes over the rule and it also goes over the rule of who must rule. This establishes us as the rulers of our won individual beings, as well as the rulers of our own rules. Our mission is to affirm our radical freedom from the limitations that are placed upon us every day by meaningless laws. Voting affirmative means that you affirm our resolve to go over the law and liberate our uique potentials for creativity and deep thought, unrestricted by anyone else’s arbitrary interpretations of how we should act or think. You need not affirm that debate is bad; far from hurting the game of debate we allow for the maximum amount of thought and education if thought and education are living the fullest of our potentials.<br />
<br />
We consider monitoring abortion rights to be a despicable practice of imposing ones will on another. We advocate a worldview in which each person denies his or her own laws and beliefs, and no person is subject to the belief system of another. This affirmation of free life must be taken up by each unique human being, thus we do not need nine justices to bestow this freedom upon us.<br />
<br />
Dolan ’03, “Symposium: Nietzsche and legal theory: niezsche’s gnosis of law. 24 Cardozo L. Rev. 757 January 2003.<br />
<br />
The ability to create life under one’s own terms is essential to what it means to be human – living under someone else’s laws causes the state of humanity to degenerate and have less worth.<br />
<br />
This means creating our own, new game.<br />
<br />
The reasons to follow the rules of the game are false and trivial, there is no ultimate truth to the rules because they have only been made up fictitiously to limit our actions.<br />
<br />
We do not leave the game and we are not nihilists. The nihilist does not play the game but removes to the sidelines and thus ends the game; we stay within the game and only change the way we act inside it.<br />
<br />
Johnston, same as above.<br />
<br />
Real education is the opposite of normalized debate. We see the most important education as a process of self-expansion and striving toward excellence, which is not possible in an environment where predictability and an aversion to newness are valued.<br />
<br />

*It is not enough to assume the legitimacy of an ethical claim. Any ethical claim is not fact and thus depends on the existence of some metaphysical conception of morality or human virtue. If this does not stem from the existence of some form of God then we must question from where our belief in ethics stems.<br />
