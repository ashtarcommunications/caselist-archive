&quot;Q Mr. President, your administration&quot; [...] &quot;they try to attack us. &quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention One: Apocalypse Sometime Soon</strong><br />
<strong>George W. Bush cynically deploys threats of apocalypse to maintain a global state of emergency in the defense of his ‘war on terror.’ Reducing complex geopolitics to the</strong> <u>i</u><strong>nfantilizing language of religious apocalypse and millennialist logic, Bush deploys archetypal notions of “good versus evil” to mobilize American imperium in pursuit of global domination. The ever-present threat of terrorist attack looms over the lives of millions subjecting all to ontological hysteria or permanent fear of imminent annihilation. This dichotomous logic of “us versus them” enables the expansion of a fascist state.</strong><br />
Peter <strong>McLaren,</strong> Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, University of California at Los Angeles, 20<strong>02</strong>, “George Bush, Apocalypse Sometime Soon, and the American Imperium,” <em>Cultural Studies : Critical Methodologies</em>, Vol. 2, No. 3, p.327-333<br />
<u>Under the sign of the [...]</u> <u>attempt to defend it.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>The power to secure life from the ever-present apocalypse mobilizes the conditions necessary for a “total” war against alterity</strong><br />
Peter <strong>Coviello</strong>, Assistant Professor of English at Bowdoin College. <strong>2000</strong>, Queer Frontiers: Millennial Geographies, Genders, and Generations. &quot;Apocalypse from Now On.&quot; p.40-41<br />
Perhaps. But to claim that [...] <u>scarcely be done without.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>While pervasive, this fear rhetoric is not an inherent characteristic of political life. Recognition and resistance reformulate the role of rational discourse snatching power from conservative elites.</strong><br />
Elisabeth <strong>Anker</strong>, PhD candidate in political theory at the University of California, Berkeley, 20<strong>05</strong>, “The Only Thing We Have To Fear...” Theory and Event, 8.3<br />
Robin argues that <u>in [...]</u> <u>grounded in hope</u><br />
<br />
<strong>Contention Two: Did Somebody Say Totalitarianism?</strong><br />
<strong>The Supreme Court decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfield simply requires Congress to sign onto Bush’s tribunals</strong><br />
Jack M. <strong>Balkin</strong>, Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment, Yale University Thursday, June 29, 20<strong>06</strong> “Hamdan as a Democracy-Forcing Decision” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/06/hamdan-as-democracy-forcing-decision.html" rel="nofollow">http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/06/hamdan-as-democracy-forcing-decision.html</a><br />
The key to understanding <u>Hamdan [...]</u> necessarily a bad thing.<br />
<br />
<strong>And, that is exactly what Congress did</strong><br />
William <strong>Neikirk and</strong> Andrew <strong>Zajac</strong>, staff writers for the Chicago Tribune, September 28th, 20<strong>06</strong>, Chicago Tribune, “Senate passes bill allowing military tribunals to try terror suspects,” p.ln<br />
After a long and bitter dispute [...] on clear rules of law,&quot; Swift said.<br />
<br />
<strong>This reduction of separation of powers to Congressional rubber-stamping makes violent states of exception possible: the force of law is radically separated from law</strong><br />
Giorgio Agamben, professor of philosophy at the University of Verona, September 21st, 20<strong>03</strong>, State of Exception, p. 38-39<br />
This type of <u>confusion [...]</u> force in the state of exception?<br />
<br />
<strong>The Quirin holding crystallizes the state of exception – it turns the rule of law into shadow judiciary for permanent suspension of law</strong><br />
Lee <strong>Troyer,</strong> doctoral candidate in political science at the University of California, Berkeley, 20<strong>03</strong>, “Counterterrorism: Sovereignty, Law, and Subjectivity,” Critical Asian Studies, 35.2, p. 259-276<br />
<u>In the course of legal [..]</u> <u>purposes of counterterrorism</u><br />
<br />
<strong>Also, the state of exception allows sovereign determinations between political qualified and bare life ceding to the state the ability to calculate and control existence</strong><br />
Giorgio Agamben, professor of philosophy at the University of Verona, Homo Sacer, 1998, pg. 142-143<br />
Here it becomes clear how Binding’s [...] sovereign seem to exchange roles.<br />
<br />
<strong>Thus the plan:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942) on the grounds that the “enemy combatant” classification violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</strong><br />
<strong>Contention Three: Solvency (is a State of Mind)</strong><br />
<strong>Challenging Bush’s political power recharges democracy by examining the community created through the discourse of fear. Fighting on the plains of the war on terrorism repoliticizes our society and fosters a culture of political responsibility on a global level. The plan articulates a notion of the way politics should be – this progressive vision sparks transition to a political community founded on a notion of shared hopes rather than fears.</strong><br />
Henry A. <strong>Giroux</strong>, professor of Education and Cultural Studies at Penn State University, April 20<strong>02</strong>, “The Politics of Emergency Versus Public Time: Terrorism and the Culture of Fear,” <em>Culture Machines</em><br />
<u>As a wartime president [...]</u> <u>of a realizable democracy.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>Overruling Quirin shatters the foundation of Bush’s Order and erodes the groundwork upon which the war on terrorism is built. The plan uses the Supreme Court’s power of judicial review to muzzle Bush.</strong><br />
Tanja <strong>Korpi</strong>, J.D. candidate at the College of William &amp; Mary, April, 20<strong>06</strong>, “QUERIES FROM QUIRIN: GUANTANAMO TRIBUNALS AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE,” William &amp; Mary Bill of Rights Journal, p.ln<br />
This Note analyzes [...] <u>threats of the new millennium</u><br />
<br />
<strong>Law is formed by its ‘subject’s’ – it has no external legitimacy other than what we encode it with. Our relationship to law is reversible - we can rearticulate the way the law “should” be rather than the way it is. Our strategic engagement with the law ruptures its normative operation</strong><br />
Judith <strong>Butler</strong>, professor of rhetoric at the University of California at Berkeley, 19<strong>97</strong>, “Gender is Burning” in Dangerous Liaisons: Gender, Nation, and Postcolonial Perspectives, editor Anne McClintock, p.381-382<br />
In Louis Althusser’s [...] <u>any intended referent.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, this debate is not about the implementation of overturning Supreme Court decisions but the discursive advocacy thereof. Traditional policy analysis constrains us into the political sidelines, making day to day resistance impossible.</strong><br />
Michael <strong>Traynor</strong>, J.D., Harvard Law School, President - The American Law Institute, Spring, 20<strong>06</strong>, “Citizenship in a time of Repression,” Stetson Law Review, p.ln<br />
<u>Today's governmental assault [...]</u> profession's great leaders. n155<br />
<br />
<strong>identification with the court allows us to subvert the ideological hegemony of the system</strong><br />
Slavoj <strong>Žižek</strong>, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 19<strong>92,</strong> <em>Looking Awry : An Introduction to Jacques Lacan Through Popular Culture</em>, p.140<br />
<u>There is</u>, perhaps, [...] the existing social order.<br />

Contention One: Apocalypse Now and Forever!<br />
George W. Bush cynically deploys threats of apocalypse to Otherize our enemy in the war on terrorism. This logic globalizes the state of exception and individualizes ontological hysteria<br />
Peter McLaren, Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, University of California at Los Angeles, 2002, “George Bush, Apocalypse Sometime Soon, and the American Imperium,” Cultural Studies : Critical Methodologies, Vol. 2, No. 3, p.327-333<br />

“Perhaps. But to claim that American culture […]initiative that can scarcely be done without.”<br />
<br />
The valorization of survival neutralizes life by turning it into the disciplined object of social management.<br />

“An ideal or standard form of death, ‘natural’ […]consumption in social input and output?”<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Did Somebody Say Totalitarianism?<br />
The Supreme Court decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfield did NOT put limits on tactics for Bush – it merely requires Congressional collusion with the Executive<br />
Jack M. Balkin, Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment, Yale University Thursday, June 29, 2006 “Hamdan as a Democracy-Forcing Decision” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/06/hamdan-as-democracy-forcing-decision.html" rel="nofollow">http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/06/hamdan-as-democracy-forcing-decision.html</a><br />
“The key to understanding Hamdan is […]history, that's not necessarily a bad thing.”<br />
<br />
And, conflation of executive and legislative authority is the defining characteristic of the state of exception.<br />
Giorgio Agamben, professor of philosophy at the University of Verona, September 21st, 2003, State of Exception, p. 38-39<br />
“This type of confusion between […]force in the state of exception?”<br />

<br />
<br />
Contention One: Apocalypse Now and Forever!<br />
George W. Bush cynically deploys threats of apocalypse to Otherize our enemy in the war on terrorism. This logic globalizes the state of exception and individualizes ontological hysteria<br />
Peter McLaren, Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, University of California at Los Angeles, 2002, “George Bush, Apocalypse Sometime Soon, and the American Imperium,” Cultural Studies : Critical Methodologies, Vol. 2, No. 3, p.327-333<br />
“Under the sign of the Stars and Stripes, […] democracy in their vainglorious attempt to defend it.”<br />
<br />
The power to secure life from the ever-present apocalypse mobilizes the conditions necessary for a “total” war against alterity<br />
Peter Coviello, Assistant Professor of English at Bowdoin College. 2000, Queer Frontiers: Millennial Geographies, Genders, and Generations. &quot;Apocalypse from Now On.&quot; p.40-41<br />
“Perhaps. But to claim that American culture […]initiative that can scarcely be done without.”<br />
<br />
The valorization of survival neutralizes life by turning it into the disciplined object of social management.<br />
Jean Baudrillard, professor of philosophy of culture and media criticism at the European Graduate School, 1993, Symbolic Exchange and Death, Sage Publications: London, p. 162-163, 173-174<br />
“An ideal or standard form of death, ‘natural’ […]consumption in social input and output?”<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Did Somebody Say Totalitarianism?<br />
The Supreme Court decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfield did NOT put limits on tactics for Bush – it merely requires Congressional collusion with the Executive<br />
Jack M. Balkin, Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment, Yale University Thursday, June 29, 2006 “Hamdan as a Democracy-Forcing Decision” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/06/hamdan-as-democracy-forcing-decision.html" rel="nofollow">http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/06/hamdan-as-democracy-forcing-decision.html</a><br />
“The key to understanding Hamdan is […]history, that's not necessarily a bad thing.”<br />
<br />
And, conflation of executive and legislative authority is the defining characteristic of the state of exception.<br />
Giorgio Agamben, professor of philosophy at the University of Verona, September 21st, 2003, State of Exception, p. 38-39<br />
“This type of confusion between […]force in the state of exception?”<br />
<br />
The Quirin holding crystallizes the state of exception – it turns the rule of law into shadow judiciary for permanent suspension of law<br />
Lee Troyer, doctoral candidate in political science at the University of California, Berkeley, 2003, “Counterterrorism: Sovereignty, Law, and Subjectivity,” Critical Asian Studies, 35.2, p. 259-276<br />
“In the course of legal […]for the purposes of counterterrorism.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, the state of exception allows sovereign determinations between political qualified and bare life ceding to the state the ability to calculate and control existence<br />
Giorgio Agamben, professor of philosophy at the University of Verona, Homo Sacer, 1998, pg. 142-143<br />
“Here it becomes clear how Binding’s […]seem to exchange roles.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision Ex parte Quirin , 317 U.S. 1 (1942).<br />
<br />
We’ll defend normal means.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Three: Solvency (is a State of Mind)<br />
Challenging Bush’s political power recharges democracy by examining the community created through the discourse of fear. Fighting on the plains of the war on terrorism repoliticizes our society and creates a culture of political and ethical responsibility on a global level<br />
Henry A. Giroux, professor of Education and Cultural Studies at Penn State University, April 2002, “The Politics of Emergency Versus Public Time: Terrorism and the Culture of Fear,” Culture Machines<br />
“As a wartime president Bush […]the promise of a realizable democracy.”<br />

Supreme court decided casey wrongly, the decision in casey manifest in stare decisis holdings, was a mistake. He idea of precedent alone cannot be an arg in and of itself, the logic chipping away at Roe contradicts the blind nature of stare decisis, the separation of Roe into divisible conclusions makes stare decisis an ideology and not a guiding light for the law, and this erroneous principle has extended through cases decided since casey.<br />
Dissent of Casey, “the joint opinion discusses several stare..overrule under fire””<br />
<br />
Casey reinforced the idea that stare decisis should be followed<br />

<br />
<br />
Plan – the United States Supreme Court should overrule the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision holding a stare decisis justification for maintaining Roe v. Wade.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only an explicit supreme court overrule can solve. Legitimacy and stare decisis are not protected by upholding Roe – it is all a joke<br />
Dissent “The sum of the joint..such an effort.”<br />
<br />
Precedent must be scrutinized and attached specific justification<br />
Mortimer Sellers, 06, 54 Am. J. Comp. L. 67<br />
“The use of precedent by courts in the…they inevitably represent.”<br />
<br />
We must overrule case for that is where the supreme court explained the doctrine of stare decisis. It evaluated Roe on the 4 criteria outlined for Stare Decisis 1. workability 2. reliance 3. inconsistency 4. societal understanding and concluded that roe was upheld through stare decisis<br />
Pintip Dunn, 03, “How Judges Overrule”, Yale Law Journal<br />
“Each act of overruling potentially challenges…what is required for a just society.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Justices have a moral/ethical obligation as argument scholars to judge and justifiy positions because of the reality that they create with the rhetoric of their decisions.<br />

( ) More specifically, the Supreme Court of the United States decided Casey wrongly. The decision in Casey, manifest in its stare decisis holdings, was a giant mistake for multiple reasons. The idea of precedent alone cannot be an argument in and of itself, the logic chipping away at Roe contradicts the blind nature of stare decisis, the separation of Roe into divisible conclusions makes stare decisis an ideology and not a guiding light for the law, and this erroneous principle has extended through cases decided since Casey.<br />
Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justices White, Scalia, and Thomas 1992 (The decision of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern PA v Casey, 505 U.S. 833(1992) dissenting in part)<br />
