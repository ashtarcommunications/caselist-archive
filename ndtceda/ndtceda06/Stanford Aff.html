The Administration Relies on the Ex Parte Quirin decision to justify the detainment of so-called &quot;unlawful combatants&quot;<br />
Ramasastry 02 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/08/columns/fl.ramasastry.detainees/" rel="nofollow">http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/08/columns/fl.ramasastry.detainees/</a> last accessed 9/22/06)<br />

<br />
Detainees are routinely subjected to torture. Listen to the following excerpts of the story of Shafiq Rasul and Asif Iqbal, two British citizens captured in Afghanistan and detained in Guantanamo Bay from 2001 to 2004<br />
(<u>America's Disappeared: Secret Imprisonment, detainees, and the War on Terror.</u> Edited by Rachel Meerpol 2005)<br />
We were kept captive, unlawfully by U.S. forces....Yours sincerely, Shafiq Rasul and Asif Iqbal<br />
<br />
Mozzam Begg was also detained in Guantanamo from 2003 to 2004. After the Hamdi decision of 2004, Moazzam sought to make hish voice heard and establish the rights he had been promised. Listen to the following excerpt of his story:<br />
(<u>Enemy Combatant: My imprisonment at Guantanamo, Bagram, and Kandahar</u> Moazzam Begg, published 2006. p. 259-261)<br />
Later that month, I heard from Sergeant Foshee...London, Gareth Peirce.<br />
He continues..<br />
I went on to detail how I had been.....over to your legal department, if you don't mind<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, while Hamdi provided for some rights of habeas corpus for citizens, it also reaffirmed the enemy combatant distinction established in Quirin, allowing detention to continue. Despite this obstacle, Moazzam felt that the need to engage the legal system on the chance that his voice could be heard was imperative. Nevertheless, it soon became apparent that the enemy combatant distinction was allowing the government to avoid real change. Moazzam Begg's story continues...<br />

I was pretty anxious as I worte all these letters....belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities<br />

&quot;It was clear to me that hte US government....to try and present my arguments&quot;<br />
&quot;The officer pre-empted any questions....giving me an opportunity for any legal recourse&quot;<br />

These tribunals and detentions violate international law. Muslims are disproportionately targeted and detained, spurring a vicious cycle of otherization<br />

IHRC is deeply concerned at....this deadly assault on civil liberties<br />
IHRC notes that there is a lack of legal precedent....attorney client conversations and interview foreign visitors<br />

<br />
We have a choice: stop this vicious process of otherization by listening to the other's stories and adopting their perspectives to criticize our own culture, or continue down the path of totalitarian dominance that will culminate in the apocolypse<br />

<strong>Plan</strong>: The United States Supreme Court should overrule the Ex Parte Quirin decision by holding that the law of war provides no basis for the use of the classification of &quot;enemy combatant&quot;, and thus that all persons currently held under that classification are entitled to the due process protections guaranteed to citizens under the United States constitution.<br />

The sharing of stories as the basis of our human rights advocacy allows for the creation of coalitions for the creation of a new public order of human dignity and hospitality to the stranger<br />

CONTENTION ONE: THE SACRED AND THE HOLY<br />
<br />
THE SACRED AND THE HOLY ARE TWO OPPOSING PRINCIPLES IN THEOLOGY. SACRED ORDERS SEE THEMSELVES AS ABSOLUTE TRUTH, AND SELF-PERPETUATE BY ERADICATING DIFFERENCE, WHILE HOLY COMMUNITIES ASSERT THE PRIMARY VALUE OF HUMAN DIGNITY AS THEY MAINTAIN AN OPEN-ENDED COMMITMENT TO SELF-TRANSCENDENCE. THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE SACRED AND THE HOLY IS THE BASIS OF OUR CRITIQUE OF THE STATUS QUO.<br />
FASCHING AND DECHANT IN 01 <em>Comparative Religious Studies: A Narrative Approach, p. 16-19</em><br />
Why do we wish to separate sacred moralities from various....treating one's sacred way of life as beyond all criticism.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR IS A MANIFESTATION OF THE SACRED. THE WORLD IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A FACE OFF BETWEEN ISLAMIC FORCES AND AN UNRESTRAINED AMERICAN MILITARY DETERMINED TO ANNIHILATE DIFFERENCE, BOTH CULTURALLY AND PHYSICALLY. THE AIM IS TO SECURE ONE'S IDENTITY BY REMAKING THE WORLD IN YOUR IMAGE; THIS REJECTION OF CULTURAL DIFFERENCE WILL RESULT IN INFINITE WAR<br />
Robert Jay Lifton 2003, The Nation<br />
The apocalyptic imagination has spawned...menacing nuclear stockpies and their world-destroying capacity<br />
<br />
WITH THE UNFORTUNATE EVENTS OF 9/11, THE GOVERNMENT TOOK PRE-EXISTING CONCEPTIONS OF DIFFERENCE AND INGRAINED THEM INTO LAW. ANY PERSON SUSPECTED OF BEING A TERRORIST, IS AUTOMATICALLY LABELED AS AN UNLAWFUL COMBATANT AND DETAINED INDEFINITELY. WHILE BEING HELD, DETAINEES ARE BEATEN AND OFTEN SUBJECTED TO TORTURE. LISTEN OT THE FOLLOWING EXCERPTS FROM THE STORY OF SHAFIQ RASUL AND ASIF IQBAL, TWO BRITISH CITIZENS CAPTURED AND DETAINED IN GUANTANAMO BAY<br />

<strong>Plan:</strong> The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin on the grounds that international law prohibits the classification of &quot;unlawful combatant&quot; and thath all persons are entitled to the same due process rights granted to citizens under the fifth and sixth amendments<br />
<br />
OBESRVATION 2: A HOPEFUL VISION<br />
THE SACRED AND THE HOLY ARE EACH A PRODUCT OF TWO SEPARATE MEANS THE SACRED IS A PRODUCT OF APOLOGETIC THEOLOGY, WHICH SEEKS TO PROVE ITS OWN SUPERIORITY AT EVERY TURN. WHEREAS THE HOLY COMMUNITY I S APRODUCT OF ALIENATED THEOLOGY, WHICH CONSSTS OF PASSING OVER INTO THE TRADTIONS OF OTHERS AND COMINB BACK, WHICH IS THE LINE OF THINKING THAT THE PLAN PROVIDES. OUR DEFENS OF OUR PLAN IS PURELY ONE BASED ON THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF BECOMING STRANGERS AND VIEWING ONE'S EXPERIENCE THROUGH THE EYES OF THE OTHER. THIS BECOMES A WONDERFUL MODEL THAT CAN BREAK FREE OF RELIANCE ON APOLOGETIC THEOLOGY, WHICH RESULTS IN A WAR ON DIFFERENCE. INSTEAD THE POSSIBILITY OF ALIENTATED THEOLOGY COMES ABOUT, WHICH CREATES SPACE FOR OPENNESS.<br />

SPECIFICALLY, INTEGRATING NARRATIVES INTO LAW THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OF THE PLAN CHALLENGES THE DOMINANCE OF EXISTING SACRED ORDERS BY DISRUPTING HTE ACADEMIC APARTHEID THAT SURROUNDS CURRENT LEGAL DISCOURSE<br />

<br />
THROUGH NARRATIVE TRADITION AND TELLING THE STORIES OF THE DISPOSSESSED OUR AFFIRMATIVE EVOKES A SENSE OF EMPATHY ALLOWING US TO IDENTIFY WITH THE OTHER. THIS ALLOWS US TO STRIKE AT THE VIOLENT ORDERING OF SOCIETY<br />

UTOPIAN HOPE IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF HOLY COMMUNITIES - ONLY RADSICAL OPTIMISM CAN DESACRILIZE THE SACRED AND TRANSCEND OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPENDENCE ON VIOLENT ORDERING<br />
Fasching 92 &quot;Narrative theology after Auschwitz&quot;<br />
THus for human life to be creative...illusions that dominate our technological civilization<br />
<br />
OUR AFFIRMATIVE IS NOT A DEFENSE OF &quot;NATURAL RIGHTS&quot;, BUT RATHER A DFEENSE OF THE INVINITE DIGNITY OF VERY HUMAN BEING. OUR AFFIRMATIVE CREATES A HOLY COMMUNITY BY ALLOWING THE AMERICAN POPULACE TO ENCOUNTER THE ISLAMIC OTHER AND THE TRAUMA THAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED. THIS ACT WILL SPUR CROSS CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING AND A COALITION TO SUBORDINATE THE POLITICAL REALM TO RESPECTING HUMAN DIGNITY<br />

Chapter 5 suggests that the mergence of a human rights ethic...Mircea Eliade, and Gabriel Vahanian in concluding my own argument<br />
<br />
FURTHERMORE, THE CREATION OF A HOLY COMMUNITY IS TENABLE. THE CROSS CULTURAL COALITIONS SPARKED BY OUR PLAN WILL SERVE AS AN EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR A NEW BEGINNING. THIS CAN BREAK FREE OF THE WAR ON TERROR'S SACRED DOGMA CREATING SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION.<br />

The experience of being open to the infinite separates....become like Socrates, ethical gadflies sent to transform society<br />
<br />
FOUR OUR STRUGGLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE MUST HAVE THIS UTOPIAN HOPE THAT FASCHING OUTLINES. HOPE OPENS UP PATHWAYS FOR DISSENT AND DECONSTRUCTING STRUCTURES OF EXCLUSION AND VIOLENCE<br />
Giroux 04 Tikkun Magazine Nov-Dec<br />
Crafting such a new political language will require.l..questioning from ever stalling or being declared finished<br />
<br />
FINALLY, FEAR OF SECURITY NEED NOT BE A CONCERN. HOPE DOES NOT MEAN RUNNING AWAY FORM DIFFERENCE, NOR DOES IT MEAN PROJECTION OF INVULNERABILITY. IT IS OUR EMBRACE OF VULNERABILITY THAT ALLOWS FOR A BREAK FROM THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. IN THIS SENSE, THE EXPERIENCE OF UNMEDIATED KNOWLEDGE OF THE DETAINEES DEPLOYS VULNERABILITY IN WAYS THAT MAKES SPACE FOR INTERDEPENDENCE AND CONNECTION WITH OTHERS PLAUSIBLE<br />

One insight that injury affords is that there are....and that final control is not, cannot be an ultimate value
