“As has been repeatedly observed, none of this speaks to the constitutional problems raised by what seems, as this…Professor Duff’s conception of punishment”<br />

<u>Social Studies PIC</u><br />
CP: The United States Supreme Court should hold that the evidence from the social studies field submitted to the supreme court’s record that residential segregation constitutes an inter-district violation proves a basis for inter-district remedies for school desegregation.<br />
Social studies refers to an academic field that is inclusive of the social sciences—it uniquely heightens the emphasis on systematic data collection and rational evidence-driven decisionmaking<br />
Claire E. Sinnema, Political Science at University of Aukland, prepared for the ministry of Education. August 2k4<br />
(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tki.org.nz/r/nzcurriculum/pdfs/dilemma-naming-learning.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://www.tki.org.nz/r /nzcurriculum/pdfs/dilemma -naming-learning.pdf__</a><br />
“The most widely referred to overseas definition…society in an interdependent world”<br />
The various sub-fields of social studies are all interconnected—history, anthropology, human geography, economics, and other fields possess interconnections and relationships that we must recognize in order to have an effective understanding of data—HOWEVER, the term ‘social sciences’ to describe the field reflects an understanding of the discipline in which every field of study is allwed off from others—this actively creates an impoverished understanding of the social studies field—and we have data from multiple peer-reviewed studies to support our argument<br />

“Arguments against ‘social sciences,’ for the name of the learning area ‘social sciences’ mainly…perceive as important and appropriate”<br />
The report that we’re reading from is based upon an extremely aggressive defense of data—the point of the report was to alter the approach to the social sciences to force a more evidence-based approach to learning and knowledge<br />
New Zealand Ministry of Education, July 2004<br />

The United States federal government should reaffirm four criteria that determine whether or not a combatant is lawful. A combatant must be part of a responsible and effective military chain-of-command, conspicuously distinguish themselves from the civilian population in all combat operations by wearing a fixed distinction sign, badge, or emblem visible from a distance, carry arms openly, and fight and conduct their military operation in accordance with the international laws and customs of armed conflict.

<strong>CP – 1NC</strong><br />
The United States Congress should establish a comprehensive set of family planning initiatives modeled on the reducing the need for abortion and supporting parents act. These initiatives should include the establishment of mandatory sex education in public schools by specially-trained teachers, the expanision of Medicaid coverage of contraceptives in all health plans, adoption tax credits, increased funding for child care, and increased assistance for pregnant students or student parents.<br />
<br />
The CP is crucial to replace abortion policy extremism with a sensible affirmation on behalf of life. It cements a building movement to make abortion “safe, legal, and rare” as a broad affirmation of life without invoking absolutist criminalization. Only this process can affirm the value of life for both women and the fetus<br />

Plan causes surveillance and criminalization – elevating the fetus to personhood wont end abortion but it will create the most expansive system of interrogation and imprisonment in American history – millions of women and medical personnel will become full-fledged enemies of the state as the abortion regime goes underground<br />
