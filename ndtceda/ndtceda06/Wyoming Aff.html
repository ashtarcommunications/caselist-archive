Observation One: The Greatest Trick the Devil Ever Pulled<br />
<br />
FIRST, A LITTLE HISTORY—THE DECISION IN QUIRIN ESTABLISHED THE PRIVILEGE OF VIOLENCE, BUT ONLY FOR SOME, EMBODIED IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE ‘UNLAWFUL’ COMBATANT<br />
<br />
ZACHARY (J.D.) 2005<br />
[Shlomy, “Between the Geneva Conventions”, Israel Law Review, Winter/Spring, p. ln <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
The term unlawful combatant' originates in World ...which render their belligerency unlawful&quot;. n37<br />
<br />
<br />
SECOND, IN THE FACE OF BUSH’S REVIVAL OF THE TERM IN THE WAR ON TERRORISM, THE LEFT HAS CONCEPTUALIZED THE SPACE OF GUANTANAMO BAY AS THE EXCEPTION, THE BLACK-HOLE OUTSIDE OF LAW. THIS IS EXACTLY NOT THE CASE. GUANTAMO IS AN INSTANTIATION OF THE EXCESS OF LAW IN OVERDRIVE<br />
<br />
JOHNS (Univ. of Sydney, Faculty of Law) 2006<br />
[Fleur, “Guantanamo Bay and the Annihilation of the Exception”, European Journal of International Law, Vol. 16, No. 4</em> wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
Is Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, as one scholar ... replication beyond Cuba merit interrogation and resistance.<br />
<br />
<br />
THIRD, THE RESULT OF THIS CUNNING RUSE HAS BEEN THE LESS THAN RADICAL CALL TO RETURN TO LAW. THIS MOVE FETISHIZES AND REDEEMS LAW, ERASING IT’S CONSTRUCTION OF VIOLENCE AND ALLOWING IT TO RUN ROUGHSHOD OVER THE MAJORITY OF HUMANITY<br />
<br />
NEOCLEOUS (Politics &amp; History @ Brunel University) 2006<br />
[Mark, “the Problem with Normality”, Alternatives, no. 31 <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
To criticize the use of emergency powers in terms ...unified political strategy in the fabrication of social order.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation Two: The Advantage<br />
<br />
FIRST, THOUGHOUT HISTORY, SOCIETY HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY CONFOUNDED AT THE FAILURE OF LAW TO CONTAIN VIOLENCE—WE SEE LAW AS A ‘LESSER EVIL’ THAT IS NECESSARY TO HUMANIZE WAR. QUITE TO THE CONTRARY, THE LAWS OF WAR, AND ESPECIALLY THE DOCTRINE OF ‘UNLAWFUL COMBATANTS’ SERVES TO LEGITIMIZE AND PROTECT STATIST FORMS OF VIOLENCE AND CRUSH DISSENT<br />
<br />
BERMAN (Prof of Law at Brooklyn Law School) 2004<br />
[Nathaniel, “Privleging Combat?”, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, p. ln</em> wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
In 1928, the parties to the Kellogg-Briand Pact ... excluding other forms engaged in by other people. n9<br />
<br />
<br />
SECOND, CASTING CERTAIN FORMS AND TYPES OF COMBATANCY AS ‘UNLAWFUL’ CONSTRUCTS A NORMALIZED FORUM OF VIOLENCE, GRANTING LAW THE AUTHORITY TO CHOOSE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR ENTIRE POPULATIONS<br />
<br />
BERMAN (Prof of Law at Brooklyn Law School) 2004<br />
[Nathaniel, “Privleging Combat?”, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, p. ln <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
By granting the combatants' privilege, law ... public fora in the last few [*13] years.<br />
<br />
<br />
THIRD, THIS STATIST MODE OF VIOLENCE IS A PERPETUAL GENOCIDE WHERE OUR LEADERS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE DICTATORS AND TERRORISTS THEY PURPORT PROTECT US FROM ONLY IN NAME—CHALLENGING AND DESTROYING THE WAR-MACHINE IS THE ONLY HOPE.<br />
<br />
SHAW (Prof Int’l Relations and Politics at University of Sussex) 2000<br />
[Martin, “The Contemporary Mode of Warfare?”, International Political Economy, vol. 7, no. 1, p. 171-80</em> wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
There is here something of a mismatch between Kaldor’s ... which provide a framework of legitimacy for all the new warriors.<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin 317 U.S. 1 (1942) by holding that there is no distinction between lawful and unlawful combatancy.<br />
<br />
Observation Three: The Third Observation<br />
<br />
FIRST, LEGAL CONSTRUCTIONS OF ‘UNLAWFUL COMBATANCY’ AND LEGAL WAR ARE HIGHLY CONTINGENT—EXPOSING THE VULNERABILITY AND POLITICAL NATURE OF THESE LEGAL CONSTRUCTIONS IS CRITICAL TO RENDER LAW’S CONSTRUCTION OF VIOLENCE VISIBLE, AND ALLOW A TRUE ALTERNATIVE TO FILL THE VOID<br />
<br />
BERMAN (Prof of Law at Brooklyn Law School) 2004<br />
[Nathaniel, “Privleging Combat?”, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, p. ln <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
The third proposition is that the legal construction ... bemoaning its misuse by all the major participants.<br />
<br />
SECOND, DISSAPPEARING OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAWFUL AND UNLAWFUL VIOLENCE SOWS THE SEEDS FOR PROPER SOCIAL CHAOS, RENDERING VISIBLE THE VIOLENCE INHERENT WITHIN BOTH LAWS CONSTRUCTION OF PEACE AND WAR<br />
<br />
BERMAN (Prof of Law at Brooklyn Law School) 2004<br />
[Nathaniel, “Privleging Combat?”, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, p. ln</em> wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
At a hypothetical level, there are two conditions, both implausible... destabilized the entire legal construction of war.<br />
<br />
THIRD, ONLY BY REFUSING TO TAKE LAW AT ITS WORD AND EXPOSING LAW AS VIOLENCE CAN WE CREATE THE TRUE STATE OF EMERGENCY—BREAKING LAW’S MONOPOLY ON VIOLENCE ALLOWS TRUE RADICAL POLITICS TO ENTER. MAKE NO MISTAKE. IT WILL BE VIOLENT, BUT WE MUST EMBRACE THIS TO OVERCOME THE FASCISM OF LAW<br />
<br />
NEOCLEOUS (Politics &amp; History @ Brunel University) 2006<br />
[Mark, “the Problem with Normality”, Alternatives, no. 31 <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
The question to ask, then, is less about how ... class power and the bourgeois world of the rule of law.<br />
<br />
THE 1AC ALLOWS YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE STATE IN A NEW WAY. INVOKING A STATE OF EMERGENCY EXPOSES ITS IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION AND THE VIOLENT CONTRADICTIONS THAT SUSTAIN IT. VOTING AFF IS WRITING AGAINST THE STATIST IMAGINARY, ALLOWING FOR RESISTENCE TO ITS FAULTY UNDERSTANDING OF IDENTITY<br />
<br />
Neocleous 2003<br />
[Mark, Teaches politics @ Brunel, Imagining the state, Philadelphia: Open University Press, 6-7/uwyo-ajl]<br />
<br />
The last point should indicate to ... end to the possibility of fascism.</em><br />

<br />
Contention One – Depoliticizing Boundaries<br />
<br />
DECADES AFTER THE SUPREME COURT’S DECISION IN MILLIKEN V. BRADLEY, AMERICA’S PUBLIC SCHOOLS REMAIN AS SEGREGATED AS EVER. MILLIKEN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A SYSTEM OF RACIAL SEGREGATION AND SUBORDINATION UNDER WHICH URBAN SCHOOLS LIE FORGOTTEN AND ABANDONED, MERE BLOCKS AWAY FROM THEIR SUBURBAN COUNTERPARTS. THIS SITUATION WILL PERSIST AS LONG AS MILLIKEN REMAINS ON THE BOOKS.<br />
<br />
Mark C. Rahdert, Professor of Law, Temple University Beasley School of Law, Spring 2004, Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Review, 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 785, p. 800-801<br />
Looking back, we can clearly see that Milliken … …of any judicial decree.<br />
<br />
IN TODAY’S AMERICAN POLITICAL IMAGINATION, THE WORD ‘SEGREGATION’ UNFORTUNATELY CONJURES UP VISIONS OF THE PAST. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT BECAUSE DELIBERATE SCHOOL SEGREGATION IS ILLEGAL, ANY REMAINING SEGREGATION IS THE NATURAL, INEVITABLE RESULT OF PRIVATE CHOICES. THIS VIEW OF SEGREGATION TRANSFORMS THE POLITICS OF RACIAL SUBORDINATION INTO A DEPOLITICIZED FACT OF LIFE FOR WHICH NO ONE BEARS RESPONSIBILITY. DELIBERATE RACIAL SEGREGATION IS THUS QUITE LITERALLY HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT.<br />
<br />
Richard Thompson Ford, Assistant Professor of Law, Stanford Law School, June 1994, Harvard Law Review, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 1843, p. 1844-1845<br />
It is now passe' to speak of racial … …rights reform, is not mysterious.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – Superfluous Students<br />
<br />
URBAN SCHOOLS HAVE BECOME REPOSITORIES FOR A SURPLUS POPULATION OF MINORITY STUDENTS CAST AS THREATENING DEVIANTS BY DOMINANT AMERICAN SOCIETY, WHO ARE INEVITABLY FUNNELED INTO LITERAL PRISONS AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM INCREASINGLY PRISON-LIKE SCHOOLS. THIS SYSTEM’S LOGIC PERFORMS FLAWLESSLY – STUDENTS WHO ARE GIVEN ONLY ONE ROLE TO PLAY, THAT OF DEVIANT, VALUELESS CRIMINALS, CANNOT HELP BUT PLAY IT.<br />
<br />
Annette Fuentes, Adjunct Professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, April 8, 2004, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.blackcommentator.com/85/85_guest_schoolhouse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackcommentator.com/85/85_guest_schoolhouse.html</a><br />
Columbine-style incidents… …. The system works.<br />
<br />
THE PRODUCTION AND CONFINEMENT OF URBAN YOUTH AS A SURPLUS, CRIMINAL POPULATION IS CONNECTED TO A NEWLY-EMERGENT FORM OF BIOPOLITICS THAT HAS COME TO CHARACTERIZE AMERICAN SOCIAL LIFE. TODAY, POPULATIONS LIKE URBAN YOUTH WHO ARE DEFINED AS PATHOLOGICAL AND DANGEROUS ARE EXPOSED TO THE UNCHECKED POWER OF MILITARIZED BIOPOLITICS. THESE POPULATIONS OCCUPY A SPACE OF ABANDONMENT, CUT OFF FROM ALL SOCIAL SUPPORT AS THE STATE MAKES WAY FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE MARKET. THE POLITICS OF RACIAL SEGREGATION AND HOMOGENEITY ARE ESSENTIAL TO TODAY’S BIOPOLITICS.<br />
<br />
Henry A. Giroux, Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University in the English and Cultural Studies Department, 2006, College Literature, Vol. 33, No. 3, p. 181-182<br />
I want to further this position … …death that followed Hurricane Katrina.<br />
<br />
THE INTERSECTION OF RACISM AND BIOPOLITICS IS THE SINGLE POLITICAL LOGIC THAT ENABLES MASS SLAUGHTER AND GENOCIDE. THE BIOPOLITICAL STATE TAKES ON THE HEALTH OF THE POPULATION WRIT LARGE AS ITS MANDATE, AND THEREBY MUST CEASELESSLY STRIVE TO PURGE THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE POPULATION THAT REPRESENT THREATENING FOREIGNNESS. THE POPULATION OF URBAN STUDENTS CAST AS DEVIANT THREATS TO PROPER AMERICAN SOCIETY ARE A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THE TARGETS OF THE CEASELESS WAR MADE INEVITABLE BY RACIST BIOPOLITICS.<br />
<br />
Eduardo Mendieta, Professor of Philosophy at SUNY-Stony Brook, April 25, 2002, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/philosophy/faculty/emendieta/articles/foucault.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.stonybrook.edu/philosophy/faculty/emendieta/articles/foucault.pdf</a>, accessed August 29, 2006<br />
I have thus far discussed Foucault’s triangulation … … foes are biological in nature.<br />
<br />
Plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974) by holding that a federal court may impose a multidistrict, areawide remedy to de facto school segregation and de facto residential segregation.<br />
<br />
Contention Three – The Politics of Race and Space<br />
<br />
REVERSING THE MILLIKEN PRECEDENT IS ESSENTIAL TO COMBATING RACIAL SEGREGATION – OVERRULING MILLIKEN IS THE ONLY WAY TO EMPOWER LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TAKE PROACTIVE MEASURES AGAINST SEGREGATION.<br />
<br />
The Honorable Nathaniel R. Jones, Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, October 1992, Fordham Law Review, 61 Fordham L. Rev. 49, p. 54-55<br />
I think that our jurisprudence would … …of a single society.<br />
<br />
THE MILLIKEN PRECEDENT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACET OF THE LAW WITH REGARDS TO SCHOOL SEGREGATION – SO LONG AS MILLIKEN REMAINS VALID PRECEDENT, SCHOOL DESEGREGATION WILL HAVE NO CHANCE OF SUCCESS. MILLIKEN’S LEGACY OF RACISM PRODUCES AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION AGAINST COMPLACENCY IN REGARDS TO THE SEGREGATED STATUS QUO.<br />
<br />
Mark C. Rahdert, Professor of Law, Temple University Beasley School of Law, Spring 2004, Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Review, 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 785, p. 785-788<br />
In the five decades since Brown v. Board of Education, … …for the courts and the nation.<br />
<br />
<br />
SUPREME COURT DESEGREGTION MANDATES SPUR COMPLIANCE, DISTRICT COURT JUDGES ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO IMPOSE REMEDIES AND CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT WON’T INTERVENE<br />

A widely recognized authority on the court system, Baum is the author of Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior (2006), American Courts: Process and Policy, 5th Edition (2001) and The Puzzle of Judicial Behavior (1997), as well as numerous articles on topics such as the implementation of court decisions, change in Supreme Court policies, and interaction between the Supreme Court and Congress., The Supreme Court, Eight Edition, CQ Press, 2004, page 199-200 cabalwej)<br />
On the whole, federal district … …had little impact.<br />
<br />
DOMINANT LEGAL NARRATIVES THAT JUSTIFY RACIAL SEGREGATION OPERATE BY MAKING THE POLITICS OF SPATIAL BOUNDARIES APPEAR NATURAL AND APOLITICAL. REVERSING THE MILLIKEN DECISION MAKES THE SEEMINGLY NATURAL PLACEMENT OF BOUNDARIES BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AN EXPLICITLY POLITICAL ISSUE, HIGHLIGHTING THE RACIAL DIVIDE BETWEEN URBAN AND SUBURBAN AMERICA AS A DELIBERATE INSTANCE OF SEGREGATION. THIS AWARENESS OF SPATIAL POLITICS IS CRITICAL TO DENATURALIZING THE RACIST FOUNDATIONS OF COURT PRECEDENT AND BRINGING A CRITICAL, ANTI-RACIST LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS INTO BEING.<br />
<br />
Reginald C. Oh, assistant professor of law at the Appalachian School of Law, 2005, Cleveland State Law Review, 52 Clev. St. L. Rev. 243, p. 246-248<br />
If dominant narratives … …how did they get there?<br />
<br />
INDIVIDUAL AND APOLITICAL CONDEMNATIONS OF RACISM WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH – WE NEED TANGIBLE, SOLUTIONS TO RACIAL SEGREGATION NOW – ONLY EXPOSING THE INHERENTLY POLITICAL AND UNEQUAL NATURE OF SPACES THAT ARE PRESUMED NEUTRAL AND RACE-BLIND CAN CHALLENGE THE SPATIAL CONFINEMENT OF RACIAL MINORITIES.<br />

Richard Thompson Ford, Assistant Professor of Law, Stanford Law School, June 1994, Harvard Law Review, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 1843, p. 1918-1920<br />
This Article has attempted to … … the boundaries of race.<br />
<br />
MOREOVER, CHALLENGING RACIAL SEGREGATION IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS CRITICAL TO COMBATING THE NEWLY EMERGENT BIOPOLITICS OF RACE. BIOPOLITICAL DECISIONS CONCERNING THE PLACEMENT OF PEOPLE DO NOT INEVITABLY FAVOR DOMINANT SOCIAL GROUPS. THE TERRAIN OF THE BIOPOLITICAL MUST BE REPOLITICIZED AND REFASHIONED BY POLITICAL STRATEGIES THAT DIRECTLY ATTACK RACIAL HOMOGENIZATION IN SCHOOLS.<br />
<br />
Henry A. Giroux, Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University in the English and Cultural Studies Department, 2006, College Literature, Vol. 33, No. 3, p. 189-192<br />
Any viable attempt to… …, and critical education (Bauman 2003, 14).<br />
<br />
WE ARE NOT PROMISING AN OVERNIGHT TRANSITION TO A RACIAL UTOPIA. INSTEAD, WE OFFER THE BEGINNING OF AN AWARENESS OF RACIALIZED SPACE, WHICH THEN MAKES VISIBLE A MULTITUDE OF PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN FORMS OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND DOMINATION. THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN CONTESTING THE ABANDONMENT OF URBAN POPULATIONS IS AN AWARENESS THAT THE UTOPIA PROMISED BY THE ESCAPE TO WHITE SUBURBIA AND THE DYSTOPIA OF THE INNER CITY ARE MUTUALLY CONSTITUTIVE. A POLITICS OF OPPOSITION TO SEGREGATION MAKES EXPLICIT THE INHERENT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PLACES, GROUPS, AND INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE REMAIN SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL.<br />

Observation One<br />
<br />
HAMDAN MISSED THE POINT—THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS NOT HOW TO TRY ‘ENEMY COMBATANTS’ BUT RATHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO DETAIN THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. EVEN IF A TRIBUNAL PROCESS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW IS RATIFIED, BUSH WILL FALL BACK ON HIS ABILITY TO DETAIN ENEMY COMBATANTS INDEFINITELY<br />

<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Solvency<br />
<br />
FIRST, QUIRIN’S SPECIAL FACTS DON’T MERIT IT’S USE AS PRECEDENT. THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE IT BY TREATING IT AS A STRICT, HISTORICAL ABBERATION<br />

1ac - Contention One – Depoliticizing Boundaries<br />
<br />
DECADES AFTER THE SUPREME COURT’S DECISION IN MILLIKEN V. BRADLEY, AMERICA’S PUBLIC SCHOOLS REMAIN AS SEGREGATED AS EVER. MILLIKEN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A SYSTEM OF RACIAL SEGREGATION AND SUBORDINATION UNDER WHICH URBAN SCHOOLS LIE FORGOTTEN AND ABANDONED, MERE BLOCKS AWAY FROM THEIR SUBURBAN COUNTERPARTS. THIS SITUATION WILL PERSIST AS LONG AS MILLIKEN REMAINS ON THE BOOKS.<br />
<br />
Mark C. Rahdert, Professor of Law, Temple University Beasley School of Law, Spring 2004, Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Review, 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 785, p. 800-801<br />
Looking back, we can clearly see that Milliken … …of any judicial decree.<br />
<br />
IN TODAY’S AMERICAN POLITICAL IMAGINATION, THE WORD ‘SEGREGATION’ UNFORTUNATELY CONJURES UP VISIONS OF THE PAST. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT BECAUSE DELIBERATE SCHOOL SEGREGATION IS ILLEGAL, ANY REMAINING SEGREGATION IS THE NATURAL, INEVITABLE RESULT OF PRIVATE CHOICES. THIS VIEW OF SEGREGATION TRANSFORMS THE POLITICS OF RACIAL SUBORDINATION INTO A DEPOLITICIZED FACT OF LIFE FOR WHICH NO ONE BEARS RESPONSIBILITY. DELIBERATE RACIAL SEGREGATION IS THUS QUITE LITERALLY HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT.<br />
<br />
Richard Thompson Ford, Assistant Professor of Law, Stanford Law School, June 1994, Harvard Law Review, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 1843, p. 1844-1845<br />
It is now passe' to speak of racial … …rights reform, is not mysterious.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – Superfluous Students<br />
<br />
URBAN SCHOOLS HAVE BECOME REPOSITORIES FOR A SURPLUS POPULATION OF MINORITY STUDENTS CAST AS THREATENING DEVIANTS BY DOMINANT AMERICAN SOCIETY, WHO ARE INEVITABLY FUNNELED INTO LITERAL PRISONS AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM INCREASINGLY PRISON-LIKE SCHOOLS. THIS SYSTEM’S LOGIC PERFORMS FLAWLESSLY – STUDENTS WHO ARE GIVEN ONLY ONE ROLE TO PLAY, THAT OF DEVIANT, VALUELESS CRIMINALS, CANNOT HELP BUT PLAY IT.<br />
<br />
Annette Fuentes, Adjunct Professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, April 8, 2004, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.blackcommentator.com/85/85_guest_schoolhouse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackcommentator.com/85/85_guest_schoolhouse.html</a><br />
Columbine-style incidents… …. The system works.<br />
<br />
THE PRODUCTION AND CONFINEMENT OF URBAN YOUTH AS A SURPLUS, CRIMINAL POPULATION IS CONNECTED TO A NEWLY-EMERGENT FORM OF BIOPOLITICS THAT HAS COME TO CHARACTERIZE AMERICAN SOCIAL LIFE. TODAY, POPULATIONS LIKE URBAN YOUTH WHO ARE DEFINED AS PATHOLOGICAL AND DANGEROUS ARE EXPOSED TO THE UNCHECKED POWER OF MILITARIZED BIOPOLITICS. THESE POPULATIONS OCCUPY A SPACE OF ABANDONMENT, CUT OFF FROM ALL SOCIAL SUPPORT AS THE STATE MAKES WAY FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE MARKET. THE POLITICS OF RACIAL SEGREGATION AND HOMOGENEITY ARE ESSENTIAL TO TODAY’S BIOPOLITICS.<br />
<br />
Henry A. Giroux, Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University in the English and Cultural Studies Department, 2006, College Literature, Vol. 33, No. 3, p. 181-182<br />
I want to further this position … …death that followed Hurricane Katrina.<br />
<br />
THE INTERSECTION OF RACISM AND BIOPOLITICS IS THE SINGLE POLITICAL LOGIC THAT ENABLES MASS SLAUGHTER AND GENOCIDE. THE BIOPOLITICAL STATE TAKES ON THE HEALTH OF THE POPULATION WRIT LARGE AS ITS MANDATE, AND THEREBY MUST CEASELESSLY STRIVE TO PURGE THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE POPULATION THAT REPRESENT THREATENING FOREIGNNESS. THE POPULATION OF URBAN STUDENTS CAST AS DEVIANT THREATS TO PROPER AMERICAN SOCIETY ARE A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THE TARGETS OF THE CEASELESS WAR MADE INEVITABLE BY RACIST BIOPOLITICS.<br />

Eduardo Mendieta, Professor of Philosophy at SUNY-Stony Brook, April 25, 2002, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/philosophy/faculty/emendieta/articles/foucault.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.stonybrook.edu/philosophy/faculty/emendieta/articles/foucault.pdf</a>, accessed August 29, 2006<br />

Plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974) by holding that a federal court may impose a multidistrict, areawide remedy to de facto school segregation and de facto residential segregation.<br />
<br />
Contention Three – The Politics of Race and Space<br />
<br />
REVERSING THE MILLIKEN PRECEDENT IS ESSENTIAL TO COMBATING RACIAL SEGREGATION – OVERRULING MILLIKEN IS THE ONLY WAY TO EMPOWER LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TAKE PROACTIVE MEASURES AGAINST SEGREGATION.<br />
<br />
The Honorable Nathaniel R. Jones, Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, October 1992, Fordham Law Review, 61 Fordham L. Rev. 49, p. 54-55<br />
I think that our jurisprudence would … …of a single society.<br />
<br />
THE MILLIKEN PRECEDENT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACET OF THE LAW WITH REGARDS TO SCHOOL SEGREGATION – SO LONG AS MILLIKEN REMAINS VALID PRECEDENT, SCHOOL DESEGREGATION WILL HAVE NO CHANCE OF SUCCESS. MILLIKEN’S LEGACY OF RACISM PRODUCES AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION AGAINST COMPLACENCY IN REGARDS TO THE SEGREGATED STATUS QUO.<br />
<br />
Mark C. Rahdert, Professor of Law, Temple University Beasley School of Law, Spring 2004, Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Review, 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 785, p. 785-788<br />
In the five decades since Brown v. Board of Education, … …for the courts and the nation.<br />

On the whole, federal district … …had little impact.<br />
<br />
DOMINANT LEGAL NARRATIVES THAT JUSTIFY RACIAL SEGREGATION OPERATE BY MAKING THE POLITICS OF SPATIAL BOUNDARIES APPEAR NATURAL AND APOLITICAL. REVERSING THE MILLIKEN DECISION MAKES THE SEEMINGLY NATURAL PLACEMENT OF BOUNDARIES BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AN EXPLICITLY POLITICAL ISSUE, HIGHLIGHTING THE RACIAL DIVIDE BETWEEN URBAN AND SUBURBAN AMERICA AS A DELIBERATE INSTANCE OF SEGREGATION. THIS AWARENESS OF SPATIAL POLITICS IS CRITICAL TO DENATURALIZING THE RACIST FOUNDATIONS OF COURT PRECEDENT AND BRINGING A CRITICAL, ANTI-RACIST LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS INTO BEING.<br />
<br />
Reginald C. Oh, assistant professor of law at the Appalachian School of Law, 2005, Cleveland State Law Review, 52 Clev. St. L. Rev. 243, p. 246-248<br />
If dominant narratives … …how did they get there?<br />
<br />
INDIVIDUAL AND APOLITICAL CONDEMNATIONS OF RACISM WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH – WE NEED TANGIBLE, SOLUTIONS TO RACIAL SEGREGATION NOW – ONLY EXPOSING THE INHERENTLY POLITICAL AND UNEQUAL NATURE OF SPACES THAT ARE PRESUMED NEUTRAL AND RACE-BLIND CAN CHALLENGE THE SPATIAL CONFINEMENT OF RACIAL MINORITIES.<br />

This Article has attempted to … … the boundaries of race.<br />
<br />
MOREOVER, CHALLENGING RACIAL SEGREGATION IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS CRITICAL TO COMBATING THE NEWLY EMERGENT BIOPOLITICS OF RACE. BIOPOLITICAL DECISIONS CONCERNING THE PLACEMENT OF PEOPLE DO NOT INEVITABLY FAVOR DOMINANT SOCIAL GROUPS. THE TERRAIN OF THE BIOPOLITICAL MUST BE REPOLITICIZED AND REFASHIONED BY POLITICAL STRATEGIES THAT DIRECTLY ATTACK RACIAL HOMOGENIZATION IN SCHOOLS.<br />
<br />

Any viable attempt to… …, and critical education (Bauman 2003, 14).<br />
<br />
WE ARE NOT PROMISING AN OVERNIGHT TRANSITION TO A RACIAL UTOPIA. INSTEAD, WE OFFER THE BEGINNING OF AN AWARENESS OF RACIALIZED SPACE, WHICH THEN MAKES VISIBLE A MULTITUDE OF PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN FORMS OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND DOMINATION. THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN CONTESTING THE ABANDONMENT OF URBAN POPULATIONS IS AN AWARENESS THAT THE UTOPIA PROMISED BY THE ESCAPE TO WHITE SUBURBIA AND THE DYSTOPIA OF THE INNER CITY ARE MUTUALLY CONSTITUTIVE. A POLITICS OF OPPOSITION TO SEGREGATION MAKES EXPLICIT THE INHERENT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PLACES, GROUPS, AND INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE REMAIN SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL.<br />

Contention One – Depoliticizing Boundaries<br />
<br />
DECADES AFTER THE SUPREME COURT’S DECISION IN MILLIKEN V. BRADLEY, AMERICA’S PUBLIC SCHOOLS REMAIN AS SEGREGATED AS EVER. MILLIKEN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A SYSTEM OF RACIAL SEGREGATION AND SUBORDINATION UNDER WHICH URBAN SCHOOLS LIE FORGOTTEN AND ABANDONED, MERE BLOCKS AWAY FROM THEIR SUBURBAN COUNTERPARTS. THIS SITUATION WILL PERSIST AS LONG AS MILLIKEN REMAINS ON THE BOOKS.<br />
<br />

Looking back, we can clearly see that Milliken … …of any judicial decree.<br />
<br />
IN TODAY’S AMERICAN POLITICAL IMAGINATION, THE WORD ‘SEGREGATION’ UNFORTUNATELY CONJURES UP VISIONS OF THE PAST. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT BECAUSE DELIBERATE SCHOOL SEGREGATION IS ILLEGAL, ANY REMAINING SEGREGATION IS THE NATURAL, INEVITABLE RESULT OF PRIVATE CHOICES. THIS VIEW OF SEGREGATION TRANSFORMS THE POLITICS OF RACIAL SUBORDINATION INTO A DEPOLITICIZED FACT OF LIFE FOR WHICH NO ONE BEARS RESPONSIBILITY. DELIBERATE RACIAL SEGREGATION IS THUS QUITE LITERALLY HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT.<br />
<br />

Contention Two – Superfluous Students<br />
<br />
URBAN SCHOOLS HAVE BECOME REPOSITORIES FOR A SURPLUS POPULATION OF MINORITY STUDENTS CAST AS THREATENING DEVIANTS BY DOMINANT AMERICAN SOCIETY, WHO ARE INEVITABLY FUNNELED INTO LITERAL PRISONS AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM INCREASINGLY PRISON-LIKE SCHOOLS. THIS SYSTEM’S LOGIC PERFORMS FLAWLESSLY – STUDENTS WHO ARE GIVEN ONLY ONE ROLE TO PLAY, THAT OF DEVIANT, VALUELESS CRIMINALS, CANNOT HELP BUT PLAY IT.<br />
<br />
Annette Fuentes, Adjunct Professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, April 8, 2004, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.blackcommentator.com/85/85_guest_schoolhouse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackcommentator.com/85/85_guest_schoolhouse.html</a><br />
Columbine-style incidents… …. The system works.<br />
<br />
THE PRODUCTION AND CONFINEMENT OF URBAN YOUTH AS A SURPLUS, CRIMINAL POPULATION IS CONNECTED TO A NEWLY-EMERGENT FORM OF BIOPOLITICS THAT HAS COME TO CHARACTERIZE AMERICAN SOCIAL LIFE. TODAY, POPULATIONS LIKE URBAN YOUTH WHO ARE DEFINED AS PATHOLOGICAL AND DANGEROUS ARE EXPOSED TO THE UNCHECKED POWER OF MILITARIZED BIOPOLITICS. THESE POPULATIONS OCCUPY A SPACE OF ABANDONMENT, CUT OFF FROM ALL SOCIAL SUPPORT AS THE STATE MAKES WAY FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE MARKET. THE POLITICS OF RACIAL SEGREGATION AND HOMOGENEITY ARE ESSENTIAL TO TODAY’S BIOPOLITICS.<br />
<br />
Henry A. Giroux, Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University in the English and Cultural Studies Department, 2006, College Literature, Vol. 33, No. 3, p. 181-182<br />
I want to further this position … …death that followed Hurricane Katrina.<br />
<br />
THE INTERSECTION OF RACISM AND BIOPOLITICS IS THE SINGLE POLITICAL LOGIC THAT ENABLES MASS SLAUGHTER AND GENOCIDE. THE BIOPOLITICAL STATE TAKES ON THE HEALTH OF THE POPULATION WRIT LARGE AS ITS MANDATE, AND THEREBY MUST CEASELESSLY STRIVE TO PURGE THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE POPULATION THAT REPRESENT THREATENING FOREIGNNESS. THE POPULATION OF URBAN STUDENTS CAST AS DEVIANT THREATS TO PROPER AMERICAN SOCIETY ARE A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THE TARGETS OF THE CEASELESS WAR MADE INEVITABLE BY RACIST BIOPOLITICS.<br />

DOMINANT LEGAL NARRATIVES THAT JUSTIFY RACIAL SEGREGATION OPERATE BY MAKING THE POLITICS OF SPATIAL BOUNDARIES APPEAR NATURAL AND APOLITICAL. REVERSING THE MILLIKEN DECISION MAKES THE SEEMINGLY NATURAL PLACEMENT OF BOUNDARIES BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AN EXPLICITLY POLITICAL ISSUE, HIGHLIGHTING THE RACIAL DIVIDE BETWEEN URBAN AND SUBURBAN AMERICA AS A DELIBERATE INSTANCE OF SEGREGATION. THIS AWARENESS OF SPATIAL POLITICS IS CRITICAL TO DENATURALIZING THE RACIST FOUNDATIONS OF COURT PRECEDENT AND BRINGING A CRITICAL, ANTI-RACIST LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS INTO BEING.<br />

INSTEAD, WE OFFER THE BEGINNING OF AN AWARENESS OF RACIALIZED SPACE, WHICH THEN MAKES VISIBLE A MULTITUDE OF PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN FORMS OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND DOMINATION. THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN CONTESTING THE ABANDONMENT OF URBAN POPULATIONS IS AN AWARENESS THAT THE UTOPIA PROMISED BY THE ESCAPE TO WHITE SUBURBIA AND THE DYSTOPIA OF THE INNER CITY ARE MUTUALLY CONSTITUTIVE. A POLITICS OF OPPOSITION TO SEGREGATION MAKES EXPLICIT THE INHERENT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PLACES, GROUPS, AND INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE REMAIN SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL.<br />
