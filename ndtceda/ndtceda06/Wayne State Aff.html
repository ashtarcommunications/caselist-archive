<br />
Contention One: Inherency:<br />
<br />
The US Supreme Court in Ex Parte Quirin established the legal basis for indefinitely detaining “unlawful combatants”. The Bush administration has deployed this label in the “war on terror” to carve out an extra-legal status to involuntarily incarcerate individuals in Guantanamo Bay.<br />
<br />
JOHNS, Lecturer University of Sydney Faculty of Law, 2005 [Fleur, European Journal of International Law, 16(4), 613, batto]<br />
<br />
Between 1991 and 1996… … that process will take its own course’<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Governmentality<br />
<br />
The extra-legal demarcation of “unlawful combatants” constitutes a new form of governmentality that justifies sovereign control of populations through the denial of the law. Judicial deference on this question legitimates a lawless sovereign.<br />
<br />
BUTLER, Berkeley Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature, 2004 [Judith, Precarious Life, p. 94-95, Stevenson]<br />
<br />
Foucault distinguishes governmentality from sovereignty… … augmented exercise of state sovereignty.<br />
<br />
Adding to the complexity of law is the discursive violence taking place. The unlawful status of combatants constitutes a performative death sentence<br />
<br />
HOUEN, Lecturer at the University of Sheffield, 2006 [Alex, theory &amp; event, 9(1), batto]<br />
<br />
The Presidential order thus resuscitated sovereignty… … right to &quot;take life and let live.&quot;<br />
<br />
Current legal strategies only entrench governmentality – unlawful combatants are being given piecemeal rights which only reify their status as latent bodies<br />
<br />
HOUEN, Lecturer at the University of Sheffield, 2006 [Alex, theory &amp; event, 9(1), batto]<br />
<br />
What about the issue of biopolitical government, though?... … infinite prolongation of sovereignty's resuscitated power.<br />
<br />
Unrestrained governmentality order populations rendering life disposable<br />
<br />
Elden, Lecturer in politics at the University of Warwick, England, 2002 (Stuart, boundary 2 - Volume 29, Number 1, page project muse)<br />
<br />
It is worth thinking this through in a little more detail… … The body is a bio-political reality; medicine is a bio-political strategy&quot;<br />
<br />
Contention Three: Bare Life –<br />
<br />
The Bush administration’s decision to hold people as unlawful combatants is framed as an intervention in global security for the sake of humanity<br />
<br />
WHYTE, Monash University’s Centre for Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies, 2005 [Jess, Signature, February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spinach7.com/signature/sig-stories.php?id=346" rel="nofollow">http://www.spinach7.com/signature/sig-stories.php?id=346</a>, batto]<br />
<br />
The use of emergency powers in times of war is nothing new… … the state is left to act with absolute flexibility and without constraint.<br />
<br />
This supposedly neutral appeal to global humanity establishes hidden conditions on recipients to abide by a specific bio-political world order<br />
<br />
WHYTE, Monash University’s Centre for Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies, 2004 [Jess, The Human Is A Battleground, State of Emergency Reader, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://stateofemergency.nomasters.org/reader/human.html" rel="nofollow">http://stateofemergency.nomasters.org/reader/human.html</a>, batto]<br />
<br />
If today biopolitics increasingly operates on a global scale… … is quickly written out of the sphere of humanity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Bush administration’s separation between lawful and unlawful combatants uses the right to life to trump political rights. This framing stabilizes human rights as solely the right to biological life<br />
<br />
VAN MUNSTER, University of Southern Denmark Department of Political Science, 2004 [Rens, International Journal for the Semiotics of Law, 17: 148-150, batto]<br />
<br />
In the war on terror, the figure of the terrorist embodies the bare life… … subjected to the power exercised over them<br />
<br />
Rights based on biological life make the right to life the supreme goal of politics<br />
<br />
WHYTE, Monash University’s Centre for Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies, 2004 [Jess, State of Emerging, June 8, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://stateofemergency.nomasters.org/reader/human.html" rel="nofollow">http://stateofemergency.nomasters.org/reader/human.html</a>, batto]<br />
<br />
From Aristotle to Arendt, classical political thinkers have sought to delimit politics… … they themselves will kill<br />
<br />
The right to life as security of biological life mandates perpetual annihilation and genocide.<br />
<br />
COVIELLO, Bowdoin College Associate Professor of English, 2000 [Peter, Queer Frontiers, p. 40-41, najor]<br />
<br />
Perhaps. But to claim that American culture… … scarcely be done without.<br />
<br />
We propose the following plan: Through all necessary means the United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942) and hold that there is no distinction between lawful and unlawful combatants. Funding and enforcement through normal means. We reserve clarification.<br />
<br />
Contention Four: The Ballot<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Quirin to promote political goals. This use of the law reveals the legal current that secretly conditions rights on bio-political criteria.<br />
<br />
GREGG, Univ. of Queensland Centre for Critical &amp; Cultural Studies research fellow, 2005 [Melissa, Cultural Studies Review, September, 11(2):156-157, batto]<br />
<br />
Law isn’t created through declarations of human rights… … …where is the law in ‘unlawful combatant’?<br />
<br />
The ballot can recognize the failings of the law and use the plan to develop sites of resistances to challenge governmentality and promote self-determination<br />
<br />
BUTLER, Berkeley Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature, 2004 [Judith, Precarious Life, p. 98-99, Stevenson]<br />
<br />
It may seem that the normative implication of my analysis… … obligatory framework for state action.<br />
<br />
Each instance of rejecting bare life opens space for being<br />
<br />
CALDWELL, University of Louisville Political Science Professor, 2004 [Anne, theory &amp; event, 7(2), batto]<br />
<br />
Agamben's alternative is therefore radical… … made up of whatever life, appears.<br />
<br />
A2: CPs<br />
<br />
Effective politicization must begin with the distinction between bare life and political life. The CP begins with the political considerations consider with political life, but the plan begins with criticism<br />

<br />
KAPLAN, University of Pennsylvania Professor in the Humanities, 2005<br />
[Amy, American Quarterly, 57(3), p. 831, batto]<br />
<br />
This turns life into “Apocalypse-From-Now-On”, any action against a detainee becomes permissible as they represent the diseased body politic, depoliticizing everyday destruction<br />
<br />
JACKSON, Manchester University International Security Lecturer, 2005<br />
[Richard, Democracy and Security, 1:147, batto]<br />
<br />
The apocalyptic mindset pervades the debate activity. Homeland securitization parallels the narrative pleasure we get from reading nuclear war impacts. This process turns the subject, from debaters or the public, into apocalyptic bodies whose lives have meaning only insofar as they achieve “health”.<br />
<br />
Elana Gomel, Head of English Dept @ Tel Aviv University, Winter 2000<br />
[Twentieth Century Literature Vol 46 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0403/is_4_46/ai_75141042" rel="nofollow">http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0403/is_4_46/ai_75141042</a>, najor]<br />
<br />
Their representation of war as an event entrenches violence as usual undermining political resistance – we need to elevate the concerns of everyday violence like our case impacts<br />

Despite the lack of competency or desire on the part of the states to regulate gender violence, the court opinion in morrison used the guise of traditional federalism to deny action by the federal government<br />
Huene- J.D. Washington University School of Law- 2002<br />
(Claire L., “Fundamentalist Federalism: The Lack of a Rational Basis in United States v. Morrison”, Washington University Journal of Law &amp; Policy, Volume 9 pg. 353, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://law.wustl.edu/journal/9/p353_note_Huene_book_pages.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://law.wustl.edu/journal/9/p353_note_Huene_book_pages.pdf</a>)<br />
The VAWA was first introduced to Congress in 1990…. simply one of an automatic rule.<br />
<br />
<br />
Therefore we present the following plan:<br />
In the next available test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison by ruling that section 13981 of the Violence Against Women Act does not violate either the Commerce or Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. We can clarify<br />
<br />
The Advantage is Federalism:<br />
Initially, The plan is the best model for federalism – overruling Morrison on both commerce and equal protection clauses creates an interpretation which prevents a slippery slope of centralized power and still solves for the fight against gendered violence<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
Short of such reconsideration… the Court's dreaded slope would not slip far.<br />
<br />
<br />
The traditonal conception of federalism that justified the original Morrison decision does not evaluate Women’s Concerns. Current Notions of federalism relegate women to the private sphere – the goal of this doctrine is to uphold male supremacy and maintain gender oppression.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
Given that the VAWA could readily … be given any consideration at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
These federalist concerns are not an adequate response to violence against women – we should instead be willing to reconsider the traditional federal balance’s effect on women<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
Abandoned by states and the federal judiciary … subject have been this way for some time.<br />
<br />
This ideology of federalism is historically a tool of oppression – in this instance the Supreme Court’s strategy assures not only the national indoctrination of male supremacy but also that there cannot be redress for the violence that this system causes<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
There may be a more direct relation … equal protection of the laws to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, violence against women is the foundation for greater campaigns of aggression, the systemic slaughter of women’s material and psychic existence provides the context for the violence of the international system.<br />

In the next available test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison by ruling that section 13981 of the Violence Against Women Act does not violate either the Commerce or Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. We can clarify<br />

Contention One: The Violence of the Private<br />
In US v. Morrison the Supreme Court enforced a myopic gendered view of the economy that systemically excludes the material existence of women in the economic sphere. Women’s productive activity was so marginalized by the court that home grown wheat was more economic than the impact of gendered violence.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
The Morrison majority found gender-motivated crimes of violence beyond Congress's power to regulate under the Commerce Clause because such acts were not &quot;economic in nature&quot; … by sex-based violence. The VAWA record, a record that only had to reasonably support Congress's actions, showed both direct and extended economic impact. The Morrison Court saw neither.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the Morrison decision re-inscribed the public / private dichotomy by abandoning women in the private whenever violence against them takes place. This radical expansion of the private maintains a system of male power that has no limit. The decision not only denies the public’s complicity in promoting violence against women, it actively creates and constitutionally entrenches impunity for gendered violence. The exemption of women from public recognition perpetuates assault throughout society and lack of address in the law makes violence against women a self-enforcing and efficient mechanism of subordination.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
The Morrison majority does not simply respect a preexisting line between what is private and what is public. … Violated women are abandoned alone there. Discriminatory abdication by public authority makes private acts public.<br />
<br />
And, the private sphere is not an adequate location to address the concrete and urgent needs of survivors of gendered violence. In order to fight against the domination of male sovereignty, women must emerge and resist this oppression in the public sphere; unfortunately, the Morrison decision viciously closed the necessary avenues for this struggle.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
One way to describe the process of change in women's legal status from chattel to citizen is as a process of leaving home. … The ruling thus raised, as no case before it has, the question whether a nation organized to preclude relief for the violation of one half of its people by the other should survive.<br />
<br />
And, this relegation to the private sphere encourages the continuation of masculine violence – the erasure of citizenship is an act of trivialization which assures that violence against women is never confronted<br />
<br />
Enloe, Professor of Women’s Studies at Clark University, 2004<br />
(Cynthia, The Curious Feminist, page 73-74 gjm)<br />
<br />
One of the most potent mechanisms for political silencing is dichotomizing &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private.&quot; … As early as the 1800s, trivializers already were labeling women who spoke out publicly against violence against women as &quot;loose,&quot; &quot;prudish,&quot; or &quot;disappointed&quot; (it would be the trivializers' twentieth-century successors who would think to add &quot;lesbian&quot;.<br />
<br />
Finally, violence against women is the foundation for greater campaigns of aggression, the systemic slaughter of women’s material and psychic existence provides the context for the violence of the international system.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, U of Michigan Law School, 2006<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard International Law Journal, winter page lexis, gjm)<br />
<br />
What does being done by domestic men inside each country make these acts in international terms? … simply dissolved when some men's access to equal protection of state election laws was at stake, and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore put President Bush into office. n107<br />
<br />
Despite the lack of competency or desire on the part of the states to regulate gender violence, the court opinion in Morrison used the guise of traditional federalism to deny action by the federal government—Huene, JD Wash. University School of Law, 2002, Claire L., “Fundamentalist Federalism,” “The VAWA was first introduced to Congress in 1990…simply one of an automatic rule”<br />

<br />
Contention Two: the Harms<br />
<br />
Loss of control over procreative matters devastates women’s ability to engage in active public discourse starting at the level of the community. Women’s bodies are identified as something the patriarchal state controls, not the individual woman. Loss of control over such an important life issue breeds apathy and hopelessness amongst women – this hopelessness spills over and becomes self perpetuating<br />

“reproductive freedom is” … “become self-perpetuating”<br />

Contention Three: Solvency<br />
Decisions like Casey are permitted because the law &amp; society use patriarchal notions of comfort and security to marginalize the feminine. Our affirmative acts as a feminist ethic of curiosity that questions and exposes this system of privilege, calling into question the system’s truth claims and efforts to constantly marginalize others<br />
Enloe, 2004. (Cynthia, Prof of Women’s studies at Clark University. THE CURIOUS FEMINIST. P 1-4)<br />
<br />
“Military spouses,” “child soldiers,” “factory managers,” … controlling women or drawing them into complicity.<br />
<br />
Our ethic of curiosity constantly calls attention to and interrogates the Status Quo assumption that exclusions are natural, necessary and inevitable. Our engagement in curious interrogation undermines the uncuriousity that allows patriachial structures on all levels to go unchallenged<br />

Additionally, the reproductive autonomy created by the plan recognizes that a woman is intimately connected to her fetus, rather than in competition with it.

In the 1992 decision of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the United States Supreme court upheld that the government could take virtually any measure to restrict a woman from exercising her right to reproductive autonomy by establishing the &quot;undue burden&quot; standard for evaluation.

<br />
Contention Two: the Harms<br />
<br />
Reproductive regulation excludes women from an active decision-making role in the community. Women's bodies are identified as objects that the law necessarily has control over. The lack of reproductive autonomy creates a sense of looming hopelessness and apathy amongst women which becomes self-perpetuating<br />

“reproductive freedom” … “become self-perpetuating”<br />

Restrictions on abortion relegate women to second class citizens. Because the reproductive choice is the only right that is shunned by the legal system, Women who choose to abort are deemed &quot;bad social actors&quot; for acting outside the ethics of that system.

<br />
Contention Three: Solvency<br />
<br />
Legal recognition of reproductive choice will force a public reconception of the woman’s body and its role within the legal system. Legal recognition will ensure that a woman and her fetus are not viewed as distinct legal entities, which will help women to break away from patriarchal description and control.<br />
<br />

“current shape of the” … “materially shape women”<br />

Reproductive choice will restore hope amongst individual women. Giving women control over their own bodies will encourage women to develop an equal voice in the community, and to participate in the social, political, and economic spheres of American life<br />

“in some, loss of” … “holds great promise”<br />
<br />
The option of Abortion helps many women to mediate the pressures and societal obligations of sexuality, famialism, and social and economic productivity when these pressures attempt to threaten their individual identities. Reproductive freedom has become symbolic of the need for women to achieve equality and acceptance, despite biological difference<br />
<br />

<br />
The disruptive and destabilizing nature of our affirmative is necessary to create a catalyst for institutional reform.

Plan:<br />
In the next available test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule the United States Supreme Court’s decision in U.S. v. Morrison by ruling that the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution provide a sufficient grant of authority to Congress to authorize the Federal Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act. We can clarify.<br />
<br />
Advantage One is Criminal Categories:<br />
In Morrison the Court’s use of section 13981 established a categorization of the Federal Civil Rights Remedy as a criminal concern – this ideology was modeled through the media to the public<br />

<br />
One of the most potent mechanisms for political silencing is dichotomizing &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private.&quot; … who would think to add &quot;lesbian&quot;.<br />
Finally, Violence against women serves as the foundation for greater campaigns of aggression, the systemic slaughter of women’s material and psychic existence provides the context for the violence of the international system.<br />

<br />
Acts of violence against women are mass atrocities, … while everyday life never ends.<br />
Advantage Two is the Civil Rights Remedy:<br />

We must move beyond criticism of the law and instead focus on the material consequences of legal actions – the Morrison decision should be overruled because its rejection of the Civil Rights Remedy was a major setback for the struggle against violence<br />

Narratives combined with imagery are none the less valuable however because they are the only way to facilitate the witness state.<br />

“Yet one can argue…of bearing false witness.”<br />

Brault &amp; Nass, 2001 [The Works of Mourning, p. 10-11]<br />
“But what does it mean…dead, living in me”<br />
<br />
Our criticism engages in a collective responsibility to address the root cause of violence – this is not relativism<br />
Butler 2004 [Precarious Life, p. 17-18]<br />
“Our collective responsibility…and well about global options”<br />
<br />
The affirmative forces us to lose moral proximity with the other by delegating our responsibilities to the state as a mediator of conflict. With no responsibility to the other any crimes against humanity can be waged in the name of law. This makes violence inevitable.<br />
Rozo 4 [“Forgiving the Unforgivable.”<br />
“As Benjamin describes it…our most private conflicts”<br />
<br />
A2 Consequentialism<br />
Our K is not an act of moral relativism – we adhor all acts of violence whether they be carried out by so called “terrorist” or by the United States itself. Questioning the foundations for violence is not mutually exclusive with feeling all the necessary reactionary emotions that come with acts of violence against a nation<br />

“I argue that it is not a vagary…the norm of political life”<br />

Combined the t flows<br />
Case outweighs legitimacy<br />
On T framework he emphasized that their interp was the most grammatical, that their interpretation excludes Wayne, that their interp excludes images, that you can talk policy elsewhere, and that affs should just have justify why the court acts (instead of justifying court action)<br />
On Case they created a separate sheet for Cato – which was about 45 seconds, on the case flow proper they used Cato to answer the terrorism/fear debate and then impacted imagery for a while – why it o/w t and why it impact turns the neg args<br />

4 minutes of Cato – discourse outweighs everything, how action is described, it’s a drule, impact calc dropped by neg, all their answers new in 2nr, operates an another level beyond just an impact turn, reject the negative, win this, nothing else matters<br />
2 minutes of case – didn’t answer vulnerability, only aff impact calc, change the ethic of social and cultural vulnerability, violence becomes impossible, neg might stop terror, but aff stops all violence, extends a lot of butler cards, violence for the sake of violence is bad, doesn’t really go for images that much<br />

<br />
Contention One: The Violence of the Private<br />
In US v Morrison the Supreme Court enforced a myopic gendered view of the economy that systemically excludes the material existence of women in the economic sphere. Women’s productive activity was so marginalized by the court that home grown wheat was more economic than the impact of gendered violence.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
The Morrison majority found gender-motivated crimes of violence beyond Congress's power to regulate under the Commerce Clause because such acts were not &quot;economic in nature&quot; … by sex-based violence. The VAWA record, a record that only had to reasonably support Congress's actions, showed both direct and extended economic impact. The Morrison Court saw neither.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the Morrison decision re-inscribed the public / private dichotomy by abandoning women in the private whenever violence against them takes place. This radical expansion of the private maintains a system of male power that has no limit. The decision not only denies the public’s complicity in promoting violence against women, it actively creates and constitutionally entrenches impunity for gendered violence. The exemption of women from public recognition perpetuates assault throughout society and lack of address in the law makes violence against women a self-enforcing and efficient mechanism of subordination.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
The Morrison majority does not simply respect a preexisting line between what is private and what is public. … Violated women are abandoned alone there. Discriminatory abdication by public authority makes private acts public.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, the private sphere is not an adequate location to address the concrete and urgent needs of survivors of gendered violence. In order to fight against the domination of male sovereignty, women must emerge and resist this oppression in the public sphere; unfortunately, the Morrison decision viciously closed the necessary avenues for this struggle.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
One way to describe the process of change in women's legal status from chattel to citizen is as a process of leaving home. … The ruling thus raised, as no case before it has, the question whether a nation organized to preclude relief for the violation of one half of its people by the other should survive.<br />
<br />
And, this relegation to the private sphere encourages the continuation of masculine violence – the erasure of citizenship is an act of trivialization which assures that violence against women is never confronted<br />
<br />
Enloe, Professor of Women’s Studies at Clark University, 2004<br />
(Cynthia, The Curious Feminist, page 73-74 gjm)<br />
<br />
One of the most potent mechanisms for political silencing is dichotomizing &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private.&quot; … As early as the 1800s, trivializers already were labeling women who spoke out publicly against violence against women as &quot;loose,&quot; &quot;prudish,&quot; or &quot;disappointed&quot; (it would be the trivializers' twentieth-century successors who would think to add &quot;lesbian&quot;.<br />
<br />
Finally, violence against women is the foundation for greater campaigns of aggression, the systemic slaughter of women’s material and psychic existence provides the context for the violence of the international system.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, U of Michigan Law School, 2006<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard International Law Journal, winter page lexis, gjm)<br />
<br />
<br />
What does being done by domestic men inside each country make these acts in international terms? … simply dissolved when some men's access to equal protection of state election laws was at stake, and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore put President Bush into office. n107<br />
<br />
Therefore we present the following plan:<br />
In the next available test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison by ruling that the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution provide a sufficient grant of authority to Congress to authorize section 13981 of the Violence Against Women Act. We can clarify.<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Our Ethic<br />
Patriarchal actors enjoy near immunity in the public sphere while those relegated to the private sphere must constantly confront their vulnerability to the threat of violence. Collapsing this dichotomy forces those previously protected by patriarchy to recognize that they too are inevitably vulnerable. This recognition has the power to change the very structure of domination because it opens a space for an ethical relationship with the other. The very act of address instigates a shift away from violence and towards an ethic of collective responsibility. This relationship is most transformative when it occurs under violent institutional conditions.<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: the Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 42-46 gjm)<br />
<br />
By insisting on a &quot;common&quot; corporeal vulnerability, I may seem to be positing a new basis for humanism. That might be true, but I am prone to consider this differently…. I cannot think the question of responsibility alone, in isolation from the other; if I do, I have taken myself out of the relational bind that frames the problem of responsibility from the start.<br />
Finally, attempts to master or eradicate our vulnerability fuels the instruments of war. Only embracing the inevitability of vulnerability can halt a future with infinite violence.<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: the Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 28-29 gjm)<br />
<br />
Mourning, fear, anxiety, rage. In the United States, we have been surrounded with violence, … Is there something to be learned about the geopolitical distribution of corporeal vulnerability from our own brief and devastating exposure to this condition?<br />
<br />
We have also read this add-on<br />

Changing the way that courts perceive public/private dichotomy is key to preventing employment termination for survivors of domestic violence<br />
<br />
Porter 2006(Assistant Professor of Law, Saint Louis University School of Law, J.D. 1998, magna cum laude, University of Michigan Law School)<br />
Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law 12 Mich. J. Gender &amp; L. 275<br />
<br />
Given the state's strong interest in combating domestic violence,… because for years society refused to recognize it as a crime, and instead treated it as something to hide behind closed doors. n145<br />

Stopping employment termination key to breaking the cycle of domestic violence<br />

<br />
Furthermore, the consideration of the public's interest … societal subordination and objectification of women.&quot;<br />

<br />
In the context of the War on Terrorism, the distinction between legal and illegal combatants is tactically deployed as part of a larger strategy of derealization – deeming a combatant illegal not only suspends the law for that individual – but it establishes a framework to make the lives of entire populations unlivable<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 67-68, gjm)<br />
<br />
These acts of state ...one’s situation is highly, if not fatally, politicized.<br />
<br />
In order to answer the question: “should the supreme court overrule ex parte quirin?” we must interrogate powers larger aim in the deployment of the legal/illegal distinction<br />
<br />
It would be a mistake to center this discussion anywhere but on the populations who are deemed unlivable by the larger strategies of the war on terror – to start from ourselves would simply replicate the ignorance of violence against the other that justifies their exclusion from our understanding of the world around us. Why is it that images like this small girl who is bleeding and screaming after US soldiers shot and killed her parents are excluded from coverage of the war? Why is it that this murder was blamed on poor aim, and pushed into non-existence? It is our separation from these images and stories that allows us to deny our responsibility for the violence that is committed in the name of the War on Terror<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 5-7, gjm)<br />
<br />
Our own acts of violence do not receive graphic coverage ...future shape and possibility of global cooperation.<br />
<br />
The lives we have destroyed in the war on terror have become unreal, unlivable and therefore ungrievable lives, how else could one explain the disconnect present in this image where an American soldier is playing with parts of a human body, mutilated and incomplete, as if they were a toy? Or this image, where a man was shot in the head which was for some reason then flattened? We can guess that what is left of the persons in this picture will not receive an obituary – the Soldiers dragging the remnants of bodies in seclusion seems to tell us that their remains will most likely not be identified. The violence committed against these people is a natural consequence of our current ideology – by making these populations unreal we have necessitated their extermination – it is through the omission of images and perspectives that the discourse of the war on terror plays its violent games – the 1AC refuses to relegate these lives to the sphere of the unlivable – we instead reject the foreclosure of these lives by opening the possibility of mourning those who are considered ungrievable.<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 33-35, gjm)<br />
<br />
If violence is done against those who are unreal, ... for the most part unmarkable and ungrievable.<br />
<br />
The images we show should make you uncomfortable, in fact they should inspire a sense of remorse, outrage and hopefully grief. In the same way images like this one, of children burning and dying from Napalm attacks produced ethical outrage and protest against the<br />
Vietnam War, images of the people killed by US aggression can produce an ethic which allows us to adequately recognize the violence we commit against the other. Showing images like this man, shot in the head while sitting in his car at a US checkpoint, disrupts the hegemonic field of representation and the entire sense of public identity that was founded on it.<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 150-151, gjm)<br />
<br />
In the Vietnam War, it was the pictures ... a sensate democracy they occasionally perform.<br />
<br />
therefore we advocate an obituary for the United States Supreme Courts decision in Ex Parte Quirin.<br />
<br />
This act is an affirmation of those who have been negated by the larger application of the legal / illegal distinction that this decision upholds. This affirmation is essential to opening a space for us to grieve the persons who have been lost in strategies of violence and aggression advanced in the name of the War on Terrorism. This is a specific strategy of criticism which should not be excluded – attempts to restrain our affirmative by placing arbitrary limits on the game of debate is an extension of a conservative strategy which deems what is and is not sayable in order to control the public sphere of debate. Once it has been decided that our 1AC is treasonous, and can’t be seen or heard the atrocities we’ve outlined also become invisible. You should reject the strategy of quelling dissent because it is too easily incorporated into larger strategies of derealization of life.<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page xix-xvi, gjm)<br />
<br />
Dissent and debate depend upon the inclusion ... publicly about the effects of war.<br />
<br />
Providing a obituary for Ex Parte Quirin establishes a politics of grief which refuses to foreclose our vulnerability to violence this opens a space for an identification with suffering -- voting affirmative is essential to creating a relationship with the other that is not based on violence or the urge to exterminate<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 30-32, gjm)<br />

Is there something to be gained from grieving ... will not even qualify as “grievable.”<br />

It would be a mistake to center this discussion anywhere but on the populations who are deemed unlivable by the larger strategies of the war on terror—to start from ourselves would simply replicate the ignorance of violence against hteother that justifies their exclusion from our understanding of the world around us.

<br />
Contention One: The Violence of the Private<br />
In US v. Morrison the Supreme Court enforced a myopic gendered view of the economy that systemically excludes the material existence of women in the economic sphere. Women’s productive activity was so marginalized by the court that home grown wheat was more economic than the impact of gendered violence.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
The Morrison majority found gender-motivated crimes of violence beyond Congress's power to regulate under the Commerce Clause because such acts were not &quot;economic in nature&quot; … by sex-based violence. The VAWA record, a record that only had to reasonably support Congress's actions, showed both direct and extended economic impact. The Morrison Court saw neither.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the Morrison decision re-inscribed the public / private dichotomy by abandoning women in the private whenever violence against them takes place. This radical expansion of the private maintains a system of male power that has no limit. The decision not only denies the public’s complicity in promoting violence against women, it actively creates and constitutionally entrenches impunity for gendered violence. The exemption of women from public recognition perpetuates assault throughout society and lack of address in the law makes violence against women a self-enforcing and efficient mechanism of subordination.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
The Morrison majority does not simply respect a preexisting line between what is private and what is public. … Violated women are abandoned alone there. Discriminatory abdication by public authority makes private acts public.<br />
<br />
And, the private sphere is not an adequate location to address the concrete and urgent needs of survivors of gendered violence. In order to fight against the domination of male sovereignty, women must emerge and resist this oppression in the public sphere; unfortunately, the Morrison decision viciously closed the necessary avenues for this struggle.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at U of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard Law Review, November page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
One way to describe the process of change in women's legal status from chattel to citizen is as a process of leaving home. … The ruling thus raised, as no case before it has, the question whether a nation organized to preclude relief for the violation of one half of its people by the other should survive.<br />
<br />
And, this relegation to the private sphere encourages the continuation of masculine violence – the erasure of citizenship is an act of trivialization which assures that violence against women is never confronted<br />
<br />
Enloe, Professor of Women’s Studies at Clark University, 2004<br />
(Cynthia, The Curious Feminist, page 73-74 gjm)<br />
<br />
One of the most potent mechanisms for political silencing is dichotomizing &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private.&quot; … As early as the 1800s, trivializers already were labeling women who spoke out publicly against violence against women as &quot;loose,&quot; &quot;prudish,&quot; or &quot;disappointed&quot; (it would be the trivializers' twentieth-century successors who would think to add &quot;lesbian&quot;.<br />
<br />
Finally, violence against women is the foundation for greater campaigns of aggression, the systemic slaughter of women’s material and psychic existence provides the context for the violence of the international system.<br />
<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, U of Michigan Law School, 2006<br />
(Catharine A., Harvard International Law Journal, winter page lexis, gjm)<br />
<br />
What does being done by domestic men inside each country make these acts in international terms? … simply dissolved when some men's access to equal protection of state election laws was at stake, and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore put President Bush into office. n107<br />
<br />
Therefore we present the following plan:<br />
In the next available test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison by ruling that section 13981 of the Violence Against Women Act does not violate either the Commerce or Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. We can clarify<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Our Ethic<br />
Patriarchal actors enjoy near immunity in the public sphere while those relegated to the private sphere must constantly confront their vulnerability to the threat of violence. Collapsing this dichotomy forces those previously protected by patriarchy to recognize that they too are inevitably vulnerable. This recognition has the power to change the very structure of domination because it opens a space for an ethical relationship with the other. The very act of address instigates a shift away from violence and towards an ethic of collective responsibility. This relationship is most transformative when it occurs under violent institutional conditions.<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: the Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 42-46 gjm)<br />
<br />
By insisting on a &quot;common&quot; corporeal vulnerability, I may seem to be positing a new basis for humanism. That might be true, but I am prone to consider this differently…. I cannot think the question of responsibility alone, in isolation from the other; if I do, I have taken myself out of the relational bind that frames the problem of responsibility from the start.<br />
Finally, attempts to master or eradicate our vulnerability fuels the instruments of war. Only embracing the inevitability of vulnerability can halt a future with infinite violence.<br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC-Berkeley, 2004<br />
(Judith, Precarious Life: the Powers of Mourning and Violence, page 28-29 gjm)<br />
<br />
Mourning, fear, anxiety, rage. In the United States, we have been surrounded with violence, … Is there something to be learned about the geopolitical distribution of corporeal vulnerability from our own brief and devastating exposure to this condition?<br />

<br />
Our Ethic:<br />
<br />
Extend contention two of the 1ac: it makes multiple arguments<br />
<br />
A – we are inherently constituted by the norms and discourse of social structures and institutions – there is no outside of thos system because the very limits of our subjectivity are defined in ways that are out of our control – only the affirmative ethic embraces these limitations and exposes them through a radical relationship with the other – only this act can create the conditions for their alternative<br />
Butler 2004 – The Judith Butler Reader, page 334-335<br />
<br />
B – They’ve got no uniqueness – our inevitable relationship with others makes us constantly vulnerable to their existence – their alternative attempts to control this vulnerability in ways that ultimately commit the worse kinds of violence – only the affirmatives embrace of this vulnerability can oslve for the root of physical and metaphysical violence.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our argument is not that individuals are free from responsibility for the violence they commit – extend the Butler evidence from the 1ac – our agument is that the plan is an essential mechanism to advance and formulate personal responsibility for the violence if the world around us – understanding the role social norms play in the production of violence is a prerequisite in the struggle against violence<br />
Butler 2004 – precarious life – page 17-18<br />
“our collective responsiblilty not merely as a nation” … “from thinking and acting radically and well about global options.”<br />
<br />
Our social incentives argument does not link to their criticism – extend the Butler in 2000 evidence from the 1AC – the state-exempt nature of violence against women creates an incentive that individuals partake in. This does not deny that indivuals role in committing violence it simply condemns the state for providing the incentive to comit violence.<br />
<br />
Their alternative forecloses the possibility of criticizing social conditions that give rise to violence – our 1ac does not exonerate individual responsibility for violence it re-orients the entire division between social constitution and individual responsibility<br />
Butler 2004 – Precarious Life, page 15-17<br />

<strong>In the context of the War on terrorism, the distinction between legal and illegal combatants is tactically deployed as part of a larger strategy of derealization-deeming a combatant illegal not only suspends the law for that individual-but it establishes a framework to make the lives of entire populations unlivable.</strong><br />
Butler, Precarious Life: The powers of mourning and violence, page 67-68<br />
These acts of state are themselves not grounded in law, but in another form of judgment; in this sense, they are already outside the sphere of law, since the determination of when and where, for instance, a trial might be waived and detention deemed indefinite does not take place within a legal process per se. These are not decisions, for instance, made by a judge, for which evidence must be submitted in the form of a case conforming to certain protocols of evidence and argument. Agamben has elaborated upon how certain subjects undergo a suspension of their ontological status as subjects when states of emergency are invoked.' He argues that a subject deprived of rights of citizenship enters a suspended zone, neither living in the sense that a political animal lives, in community and bound by law, nor dead and, therefore, outside the constituting condition of the rule of law. These socially conditioned states of suspended life and suspended death exemplify the distinction that Agamben offers between &quot;bare life&quot; and the life of the political being (bias politikon), where this second sense of &quot;being&quot; is established only in the context of political community. If bare life, life conceived as biological minimum, becomes a condition to which we are all reducible, then we might find a certain universality in this condition. Agamben writes, &quot;We are all potentially exposed to this condition,&quot; that is, &quot;bare life&quot; underwrites the actual political arrangements in which we live, posing as a contingency into which any political arrangement might dissolve. Yet such general claims do not yet tell us how this power functions differentially, to target and manage certain populations, to derealize the humanity of subjects who might potentially belong to a community bound by commonly recognized laws; and they do not tell us how sovereignty, understood as state sovereignty in this instance, works by differentiating populations on the basis of ethnicity and race, how the systematic management and derealization of populations function to support and extend the claims of a sovereignty accountable to no law; how sovereignty extends its own power precisely through the tactical and permanent deferral of the law itself. In other words, the suspension of the life of a political animal, the suspension of standing before the law, is itself a tactical exercise, and must he understood in terms of the larger aims of power. To be detained indefinitely, for instance, is precisely to have no definitive prospect for a reentry into the political fabric of life, even as one's situation is highly, if not fatally, politicized.<br />

<strong>In order to answer the question: “should the supreme court overrule ex parte quirin?” we must interrogate powers larger aim in the deployment of the legal/illegal distinction<br />
It would be a mistake to center this discussion anywhere but on the populations who are deemed unlivable by the larger strategis of the war on terror- to start from ourselves would simply replicate the ignorance of violence against the other that justifies their exclusion from our understanding of the world around us. Why is that images like this small girl who is bleeding and screaming after us soldiers shot and killed her parents are excluded fro coverage of the war? Why is it that this murder was blamed on poor aim, and pushed into non-existence? It is our separation from these images and stories that allows us to deny our responsibility for the violence that is committed in the name of the War on Terror</strong><br />
Butler, Precarious Life: The powers of mourning and violence, page5-7<br />
Our own acts of violence do not receive graphic coverage in the press, and so they remain acts that are justified in the name of selfdefense, but by a noble cause, namely, the rooting out of terrorism. At one point during the war against Afghanistan, it was reported that the Northern Alliance may have slaughtered a village: Was this to be investigated and, if confirmed, prosecuted as a war crime? When a bleeding child or dead body on Afghan soil emerges in the press coverage, it is not relayed as part of the horror of war, but only in the service of a criticism of the military's capacity to aim its bombs right. We castigate ourselves for not aiming better, as if the end goal is to aim right. We do not, however, take the sign of destroyed life and decimated peoples as something for which we are responsible, or indeed understand how that decimation works to confirm the United States as performing atrocities. Our own acts are not considered terrorist. And there is no 4iistory of acts that is relevant to the selfunderstanding we form in the light of these terrible events. There is no relevant prehistory to the events of September I r, since to begin to tell the story a different way, to ask how things came to this, is already to complicate the question of agency which, no doubt, leads to the fear of moral equivocation. In order to condemn these acts as inexcusable, absolutely wrong, in order to sustain the affective structure in which we are, on the one hand, victimized and, on the other, engaged in a righteous cause of rooting out terror, we have to begin the story with the experience of violence we suffered. We have to shore up the first-person point of view; and preclude from the telling accounts that might involve a decentering of the narrative &quot;I&quot; within the international political domain. This decentering is experienced as part of the wound that we have suffered, though, so we cannot inhabit that position. This decentering is precisely what we seek to rectify through a recentering. A narrative form emerges to compensate for the enormous narcissistic wound opened up by the public display of our physical vulnerability. Our response, accordingly, is not to enter into international coalitions where we understand ourselves to be working with institutionally established routes of consensus-building. We relegate the United Nations to a second-order deliberative body, and insist instead on American unilateralism. And subsequently we ask, Who is with us? Who is against us? As a result, we respond to the exposure of vulnerability with an assertion of US &quot;leadership,&quot; showing once again the contempt we have for international coalitions that are not built and led by us. Such coalitions do not conflict with US supremacy, but confirm it, stoke it, insist upon it, with long-term implications for the future shape and possibility of global cooperation.<br />
<br />
<strong>The lives we have destroyed in the war on terror have become unreal, unlivable and therefore ungrievable lives, how else could one explain the disconnect present in this image where an American soldier is playing with parts of a human body, mutilated and incomplete, as if they were a toy? Or this image, where a man was shot in the head which was for some reason then flattened? We can guess that what is left of the person in this picture will not receive an obituary-the soldiers dragging the remnants of bodies in seclusion seems to tell us that their remains will most likely not be identified. The violence committed against these people is a natural consequence of our current ideology-by making these populations unreal we have necessitated their extermination-it is through the omission of images and perspectives that the discourse of the war on terror plays its violent games-the 1ac refuses to relegate these lives to the sphere of the unlivable-we instead reject the foreclosure of these lives by opening the possibility of mourning those who are considered ungrievable.</strong><br />
Butler, Precarious Life: The powers of mourning and violence, page 33-35<br />
If violence is done against those who are unreal, then, from the perspective of violence, it fails to injure or negate those lives since those lives are already negated. But they have a strange way of remaining animated and so must be negated again (and again). They cannot be mourned because they are always already lost or, rather, never &quot;, were,&quot; and they must be killed, since they seem to live on, stubbornly, in this state of deadness. Violence renews itself in the face of the apparent inexhaustibility of its object. The derealization of the &quot;Other&quot; means that it is neither alive nor dead, but interminably spectral. The infinite paranoia that imagines the war against terrorism as a war without end will be one that justifies itself endlessly in relation to the spectral infinity of its enemy, regardless of whether or not there are established grounds to suspect the continuing operation of terror cells with violent aims. How do we understand this derealization? It is one thing to argue that first, on the level of discourse, certain lives are not considered lives at all, they cannot be humanized, that they fit no dominant frame for the human, and that their dehumanization occurs first, at this level, and that this level then gives rise to a physical violence that in some sense delivers the message of dehumanization that is already at work in the culture. It is another thing to say that discourse itself effects violence through omission. If 200,000 Iraqi children were killed during the Gulf War and its aftermath,' do we have an image, a frame for any of those lives, singly or collectively? Is there a story we might find about those deaths in the media? Are there names attached to those children? There are no obituaries for the war casualties that the United States inflicts, and there cannot be. If there were to be an obituary, there would have had to ]Rave been a life, a life worth noting, a life worth valuing and preserving, a life that qualifies for recognition. Although we might argue that it would be impractical to write obituaries for all those people, or for all people, I think we have to ask, again and again, how the obituary functions as the instrument by which grievability is publicly distributed. It is the means by which a life becomes, or fails to become, a publicly grievable life, an icon for national self-recognition, the means by which a life becomes noteworthy. As a result, we have to consider the obituary as an act of nation-building. The matter is not a simple one, for, if a life is not grievable, it is not quite a life; it does not qualify as a life and is not worth a note. It is already the unburied, if not the unburiable. It is not simply, then, that there is a &quot;discourse&quot; of dehumanization that produces these effects, but rather that there is a limit to discourse that establishes the limits of human intelligibility. It is not just that a death is poorly marked, but that it is unmarkable. Such a death vanishes, not into explicit discourse, but in the ellipses by which public discourse proceeds. The queer lives that vanished on September ii were not publicly welcomed into the idea of national identity built in the obituary pages, and their closest relations were only belatedly and selectively (the marital norm holding sway once again) made eligible for benefits. But this should come as no surprise, when we think about how few deaths from AIDS were publicly grievable losses, and how, for instance, the extensive deaths now taking place in Africa are also, in the media, for the most part unmarkable and ungrievable.<br />

<strong>The images we show should make you uncomfortable, in fact they should inspire a sense of remorse, outrage and hopefully grief. In the same way images like this one of children burning and dying from Napalm attacks produced ethical outrage and protest against the Vietnam War, images of the people killed by us aggression can produce an ethic which allows us to adequately recognize the violence we commit against the other. Showing images like this man shot in the head while sitting in his car at a US checkpoint, disrupts the hegemonic field of representation and the entire sense of public identity that was founded on it.</strong><br />
Butler, Precarious Life: The powers of mourning and violence, page 150-151<br />
In the Vietnam War, it was the pictures of the children burning and dying from napalm that brought the US public to a sense of shock, outrage, remorse, and grief. These were precisely pictures we were not supposed to see, and they disrupted the visual field and the entire sense of public identity that was built upon that field. The images furnished a reality, but they also showed a reality that disrupted the hegemonic field of representation itself. Despite their graphic effectivity, the images pointed somewhere else, beyond themselves, to a life and to a precariousness that they could not show. It was from that apprehension of the precariousness of those lives we destroyed that many US citizens came to develop an important and vital consensus against the war. But if we continue to discount the words that deliver that message to us, 4and if the media will not run those pictures, and if those lives remain unnameable and ungrievable, if they do not appear in their precariousness and their destruction, we will not be moved. We will not return to a sense of ethical outrage that is, distinctively, for an Other, in the name of an Other. We cannot, under contemporary conditions of representation, hear the agonized cry or be compelled or commanded by the face. We have been turned away from the face, sometimes through the very image of the face, one that is meant to convey the inhuman, the already dead, that which is not precariousness and cannot, therefore, be killed; this is the face that we are nevertheless asked to kill, as if ridding the world of this face would return us to the human rather than consummate our own inhumanity. One would need to hear the face as it speaks in something other than language to know the precariousness of life that is at stake. But what media will let us know and feel that frailty, know and feel at the limits of representation as it is currently cultivated and maintained? If the humanities has a future as cultural criticism, and cultural criticism has a task at the present moment, it is no doubt to return us to the human where we do not expect to find it, in its frailty and at the limits of its capacity to make sense. We would have to interrogate the emergence and vanishing of the human at the limits of what we can know, what we can hear, what we can see, what we can sense. This might prompt us, affectively; to reinvigorate the intellectual projects of critique, of questioning, of coming to understand the difficulties and demands of cultural translation and dissent, and to create a sense of the public in which oppositional voices are not feared, degraded or dismissed, but valued for the instigation to a sensate democracy they occasionally perform.<br />
<br />
Therefore we advocate an obituary for the United States Supreme Court decision in Ex Parte Quirin<br />
<br />
<strong>This act is an affirmation of those who have been negated by he larger application of the legal/illegal distinction that this decision upholds. This affirmation is essential to opening a space for us to grieve the persons who have been lost in strategies of violence and aggression advanced in the name of the War on Terrorism. This is a specific strategy of criticism which should not be excluded- attempts to restrain our affirmative by placing arbitrary limits on the game of debate is an extension of a conservative strategy which deems what is and is not sayable in order to control the public sphere of debate. Once is has been decided that our 1ac is treasonous, and can’t be seen or heard the atrocities we’ve outlined also become invisible. You should reject the strategy of quelling dissent because it is too easily Incorporated into larger strategies of derealization of life.</strong><br />
Butler, Precarious Life: The powers of mourning and violence, page xix-xvi<br />
Dissent and debate depend upon the inclusion of those who maintain critical views of state policy and civic culture remaining part of a larger public discussion of the value of policies and politics. To charge those who voice critical views with treason, terroristsympathizing, anti-Semitism, moral relativism, postmodernism, juvenile behavior, collaboration, anachronistic Leftism, is to seek to destroy the credibility not of the views that are held, but of the persons who hold them. It produces the climate of fear in which to voice a certain view is to risk being branded and shamed with a heinous appellation. To continue to voice one's views under those conditions is not easy, since one must not Only discount the truth of the appellation, but brave the stigma that seizes up from the public domain. Dissent is quelled, in part, through threatening the speaking subject with an uninhabitable identification. Because it would be heinous to identify as treasonous, as a collaborator, one fails to speak, or one speaks in throttled ways, in order to sidestep the terrorizing identification that threatens to take hold. This strategy for quelling dissent and limiting the reach of critical debate happens not only through a series of shaming tactics which have a certain psychological terrorization as their effect, but they work as well by producing what will and will not count as a viable speaking subject and a reasonable opinion within the public domain. It is precisely because one does not want to lose one's status as a viable speaking being that one does not say what one thinks. Under social conditions that regulate identifications and the sense of viability to this degree, censorship operates implicitly and forcefully. The line that circumscribes what is speakable and what is livable also functions as an instrument of censorship. To decide what views will count as reasonable within the public domain, however, is to decide what will and will not count as the public sphere of debate. And if someone holds views that are not in line with the nationalist norm, that person comes to lack credibility as a speaking person, and the media is not open to him or her (though the internet, interestingly, is). The foreclosure of critique empties the public domain of debate and democratic contestation itself, so that debate becomes the exchange of views among the like-minded, and criticism, which ought to be central to any democracy, becomes a fugitive and suspect activity. Public policy, including foreign policy, often seeks to restrain the public sphere from being open to certain forms of debate and the circulation of media coverage. One way a hegemonic understanding of politics is achieved is through circumscribing what will and will not be admissible as part of the public sphere itself. Without disposing populations in such a way Ilia war seems good and right and true, no war can claim popular consent, and no administration can maintain its popularity. To produce what will constitute the public sphere, however, it is necessary to control the way in which people see, how they hear, what they see. The constraints are not only on content— certain images of dead bodies in Iraq, for instance, are considered unacceptable for public visual consumption—but on what &quot;can&quot; be heard, read, seen, felt, and known. The public sphere is constituted in part by what can appear, and the regulation of the sphere of appearance is one way to establish what will count as reality, and what will not. It is also a way of establishing whose lives can be marked as lives, and whose deaths will count as deaths. Our capacity to feel and to apprehend hangs in the balance. But so, too, does the fate of the reality of certain lives and deaths as well as the ability to think critically and publicly about the effects of war.<br />
<br />
<strong>Providing a obituary for Ex Parte Quirin establishes a politics of grief which refuses to foreclose our vulnerability to violence this opens a space for an identification with suffering-voting affirmative is essential to creating a relationship with the other that is not based on violence or the urge to exterminate.</strong><br />
Butler, Precarious Life: The powers of mourning and violence, page 30-32<br />
Is there something to be gained from grieving, from tarrying with grief, from remaining exposed to its unbearability and not endeavoring to seek a resolution for grief through violence? Is there something to be gained in the political domain by maintaining grief as part of the framework within which we think our international ties? If we stay with the sense of loss, are we left feeling only passive and powerless, as some might fear? Or are we, rather, returned to a sense of human vulnerability, to our collective responsibility for the physical lives of one another? Could the experience of a dislocation of First World safety not condition the insight into the radically inequitable ways that corporeal vulnerability is distributed globally? To foreclose that vulnerability, to banish it, to make ourselves secure at the expense of every other human consideration is to eradicate one of the most important resources from which we must take our bearings and find our way. To grieve, and to make grief itself into a resource for politics, is not to be resigned to inaction, but it may be understood as the slow process by which we defelop a point of identification with suffering itself. The disorientation of grief—&quot;Who have I become?&quot; or, indeed, &quot;What is left of me?&quot; &quot;What is it in the Other that I have lost?&quot;— posits the &quot;I&quot; in the mode of unknowingness. But this can be a point of departure for a new understanding if the narcissistic preoccupation of melancholia can be moved into a consideration of the vulnerability of others. Then we might critically evaluate and oppose the conditions under which certain human lives are more vulnerable than others, and thus certain human lives are more grievable than others. From where might a principle emerge by which we vow to protect others from the kinds of violence we have suffered, if not from an apprehension of a common human vulnerability? I do not mean to deny that vulnerability is differentiated, that it is allocated differentially across the globe. I do not even mean to presume upon a common notion of the human, although to speak in its &quot;name&quot; is already (and perhaps only) to fathom its possibility. I am referring to violence, vulnerability, and mourning, but there is a more general conception of the human with which I am trying to work here, one in which we are, from the start, given over to the other, one in which we are, from the start, even prior to individuation itself and, by virtue of bodily requirements, given over to some set of primary others: this conception means that we are vulnerable to those we are too young to know and to judge and, hence, vulnerable to violence; but also vulnerable to another range of touch, a range that includes the eradication of our being at the one end, and the physical support for our lives at the other. Although I am insisting on referring to a common human vulnerability, one that emerges with life itself, I also insist that we cannot recover the source of this vulnerability: it precedes the formation of &quot;I.&quot; This is a condition, a condition of being laid bare from the start and with which we cannot argue. I mean, we can argue with it, but we are perhaps foolish, if not dangerous, when we do. I do not mean to suggest that the necessary support for a newborn is always there. Clearly, it is not, and for some this primary scene is a scene of abandonment or violence or starvation, that theirs are bodies given over to nothing, or to brutality, or to no sustenance. We cannot understand vulnerability as a deprivation, however, unless we understand the need that is thwarted. Such infants still must be apprehended as given over, as given over to no one or to some insufficient support, or to an abandonment. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to understand how humans suffer from oppression without seeing how this primary condition is exploited and exploitable, thwarted and denied. The condition of primary vulnerability; of being given over to the touch of the other, even if there is no other there, and no support for our lives, signifies a primary helplessness and need, one to which any society must attend. Lives are supported and maintained differently, and there are radically different ways in which human physical vulnerability is distributed across the globe. Certain lives will be highly protected, and the abrogation of their claims to sanctity will be sufficient to mobilize the forces of war. Other lives will not find such fast and furious support and will not even qualify as &quot;grievable.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Framework 2ac<br />
Only our ethic solves their impact-the negatives attempt to master our vulnerability to violence is what fuels the instruments of war- only exposing and attending to this vulnerability allows us to create an ethic which solves the root cause of violence</strong><br />
Butler, Precarious Life: The powers of mourning and violence, page 17-18<br />
Our collective responsibility not merely as a nation, but as part of an international community based on a commitment to equality and non-violent cooperation, requires that we ask how these conditions came about, and endeavor to re-create social and political conditions on more sustaining grounds. This means, in part, hearing beyond what we are able to hear. And it means as well being open to narration that decenters us from our supremacy, in both its right- and left-wing forms. Can we hear that there were precedents for these events and even know that it is urgent to know and learn from these precedents as we seek to stop them from operating in the present, at the same time as we insist that these precedents do not &quot;justify&quot; the recent violent events? If the events are not understandable without that history, that does not mean that the historical understanding furnishes a moral justification for the events themselves. Only then do we reach the disposition to get to the &quot;root&quot; of violence, and begin to offer another vision of the future than that which perpetuates violence in the name of denying it, offering instead names for things that restrain us from thinking and acting radically and well about global options.
