Gonzaga BS vs Emory MP<br />
<br />
GONZAGA BS AFFIRMATIVE<br />
<br />
Contention one – the future will be better tomorrow<br />
<br />
The war on terror is founded on the drive to secure the future. If you have ever seen the movity minority report, you might notice a similarity btwn its depiction of a world where criminals are arrested before they commit a crime and the way suspected terrorists have been detained as part of the wot. The detention of ev’s is a calculated strat to colonize the future by apprehending individuals who have not yet committed a ccrime and whose only offense is having been identified with an apocalyptic eventually that always remains just over the horizon<br />
Weber 07<br />
<br />
And, the quirin precedent is the key factor that enables this vision of the future secured by preemptive justice – the justice – the bush admin has rescued quirin from the dustbin of history and applied its precedent to justify unlimited authority to apply the EC designation to anyone identified as a threat<br />
Rhodes 06<br />
<br />
This drive to secure the future is the drive to ahhihilate all dissent agains thtat future. The wot’s vision of the furure is one of simultaneous inevitability and danger – the march of us empire across the globe is portrayed as the natural progress of civilization, yet at any moment, a catastrophic threat of this order might arise. Thus, the need to secure the future at all costs necessitates the creation of spaces like gitmo where all those who dissent against the vision of the future are confined<br />
Whyte 06<br />
<br />
The impact is limitedless war. The power to detain ec’s is the key linchpin in a larger governmental paradigm of preemptive violence. The most dangerous aspect of the wot is not the endless war it heralds, but rather the fact that this war is portrayed as ushering in a utopian furure of global peace. The fact that this project can do nothing but fail to bring abt the peace it promoses sets the stage for endless war – today’s war can always be justified if paradise is always a day away<br />
Whyte 06<br />
<br />
The Plan: the supreme court of the united states should overrule ex parte quirin 317 U.S. 1 [1942], holding that enemy combatant status cannot be applied to persons detained by the united states government on the grounds that persons detained as enemy combatants are not held in lawful custody.<br />
<br />
Contention two – political intervention and the role of the court<br />
<br />
Rejecting the politics of preemption requires direcrtly repudiates quirin. The decision itself embodies preemptively politics – the sabatogers were held in preemptive detention and the decision was an ex post facto attempt at rationalizing the predetermined ourcome of their execution. Quirin’s precedent is poisioned only explicit court repudation can counter the execurive’s use of it as precedent for preemptive politics.<br />
Belknap 06<br />
<br />
The politics of preemption depend on expansive claims of executive power. The party line risk calculus of the war on terror means that so long as the executive can act unchecked, any appeal to visions an an apocaluptic furure will be used to justify the spaces like gitmo. Only reigning in the executive solves our adv<br />
Whyte 05<br />
<br />
The court is critical to this rejection of the executives authority – an explicit refusal to executive authority is essential to account for the moral and political language that enables violence against ev’s undertaken in the name of the future<br />
Wilke 04<br />
<br />
Security achieved through appeals to preemptive visions of the future must be abandoned. Solve our aff requires avtive recognition that visions of future bad. Predictions become self fulfilling. Only refusing to play the game of preemptive politics creates a political order in which the ever recurring creation of spaces like gitmo is no longer necessary<br />
Weber 07<br />
<br />
Reject the structure of risk calculus in evaluating disads. The survival society of risk analysis relies on constructed speculation on the insecurities that might arise from any deviation from the status quo. These attempts to predict inevitable craastrophe create a culture of atomized bodies won have forgone public critique.<br />
Elmer 06<br />
<br />
In the WOT, every gov function from securing economic growth to preventing environmental collapse has been brought under the rubic of securitization. Appeals to human survival are not objective nor begign- the imperative of a secure tomorrow lays the groundwork for ever expanding forms of control and requires the annihilation of anyone who threatens the framework of security.<br />
Lacy 07<br />
<br />
This obsession with risk and security justified hundreds of millions of deaths in the 20th centiry and promises to become enev more devastating as the war on terror accelerates. The ultimates catastrophe is not the terrorist attack but this way of living in perminant need of the security state’s salvation, this depoliticized worldview puts life on hold to the prerogatives of the state<br />
Diken 06<br />
<br />
Today, there is no such thing as a neutural depiction of the facts. Every analysis of our political condition is already preconditioned by its context. Discourses of danger are interpreted to justify ever extending state power. It continually recreates policy problems to be solved, while forgetting that these problems have seeminglyt been solved countless times before. Unfortunately, a state defined by the imperative to secure cannot exist w/o these dangers. This imperative makes the reproduction of danger both perpetual and inevitable.<br />

The Bush administration has breathed new life into the Quirin decision; the Court has allowed the Executive branch the untrammeled power to designate ‘enemy combatants.’ Quirin’s very existence is a loaded gun that threaten to establish an Orwellian future. The Court’s refusal to challenge Quirin as good law allows continual expansion of Executive power.<br />
Stewart Rhodes, Yale Law Graduate and Research Scholar, Montana Bar Association, November 19, 2006 Understanding Enemy Combatant Status and the Military Commissions Act, Part I. Enemy Combatant Status: No More Pernicious Doctrine <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.moreliberty.org/more_liberty/2006/11/enemy_combatant.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.moreliberty.org/more_liberty/2006/11/enemy_combatant.html</a><br />
Introduction: No Greater Threat No greater threat to our Constitution… not what course others may take, but as for me<br />
<br />
The ‘enemy combatant’ designation is the linchpin of this new governmental paradigm. The authority to designate enemy combatants is quite literally the authority to exclude anyone the state chooses from the field of humanity itself. This creates a class of ‘existential enemies’ who must be utterly annihilated because the ‘threat’ they pose is defined by their very being.<br />
Christiane Wilke, PhD candidate, New School for Social Research, New York, 2004, “War v. Justice: Terrorism Cases, Enemy Combatants, and Political Justice in U.S. Courts”, p. 29-32<br />
The third possible…. Administration’s rhetoric borrowed.<br />
This creation of existential enemies sets the stage for never-ending war – the authority to designate ‘enemy combatants’ requires the destruction of these ‘enemies’ at all costs, promising the annihilation of the planet.<br />
Gil Anidjar – Ass't Professor, Middle East and Asian Languages &amp; Cultures @ Columbia - 2004<br />
CR: The New Centennial Review 4.3 35-69 “Terror Right” Muse [nfb]<br />
Such questions were…. still according to Schmitt, would be at the basis of Islamic law.<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court of the United States should overrule Ex Parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 [1942], holding that enemy combatant status cannot be applied to persons detained by the United States government on the grounds that persons detained as enemy combatants are not held in lawful custody. We'll clarify.<br />
The legal category of ‘enemy combatants’ is a perfect opportunity to tactically intervene in the political field – this designation is a contradiction in the official ideology of the ‘war on terror’. Only directly challenging the authority to designate enemy combatants can come to terms with sovereign violence and break the neo-conservative hold on power.<br />
Melissa Gregg, Research Fellow at the Centre for Critical and Cultural Studies at the University of Queensland, September 2004, online: www.cccs.uq.edu.au/resources/unlawful.doc, accessed August 22, 2006<br />
Antonio Gramsci’s great legacy for…. this term and the word ‘terrorist’ matters.<br />
The Court must explicitly reject executive authority to detain ‘enemy combatants’ – any retreat from this explicit refusal of executive authority fails to account for the moral and political language that enables violence against ‘enemy combatants,’ making that violence inevitable.<br />
Christiane Wilke, PhD candidate, New School for Social Research, New York, 2004, “War v. Justice: Terrorism Cases, Enemy Combatants, and Political Justice in U.S. Courts”, p. 36-38<br />
War does not appear…. explicitly be employed for this purpose.<br />
<br />
We solve quickly and globally – the Court’s explicit condemnation of the Bush administration’s global order of security immediately eviscerates the foundation of U.S. global imperialism. Only this direct and uncompromising repudiation of executive authority can dissolve the Homeland Security State consolidated under the auspices of the ‘war on terror’.<br />
Donald Pease, Avalon Foundation Chair of the Humanities at Dartmouth College, 2003, boundary 2, Vol. 30, No. 3, p. 17-18<br />
Overall, 9/11 brought to the light… out of which it has emerged.<br />
<br />
Contention 3: Ethical Decision Making<br />
The Bush administration’s claim to authority over ‘enemy combatant’ designations is driven by a utilitarian and policy-based understanding of the Court’s role in interpreting law. So long as any legal ambiguity remains surrounding the status of detainees, the mandates of utilitarian decision-making will be used to justify the global ‘war on terror’.<br />
Amnesty International, September 29, 2006, Military Commissions Act of 2006 – Turning bad policy into bad law, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR511542006" rel="nofollow">http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR511542006</a><br />
Yet at the same… lawfulness of his detention judicially reviewed.<br />
<br />
An ethic of human rights in the context of the ‘war on terror’ requires a rejection of utilitarian decisionmaking – utilitarian justifications for limiting the Court inevitably cause a slippery slope to torture and unlimited executive power. The Court cannot consider the actions of intervening actors in determining the legality of detention – this stance is key to preserving the ethical values that give life meaning in the first place.<br />
Richard Ashby Wilson, the Gladstein Distinguished Chair of Human Rights and Director of the Human Rights Institute at the University of Connecticut, 2005, Human Rights in the War on Terror, p. 19-21<br />
Michael Ignatieff’s ‘lesser evil’ ethics… defensible, and which are not.<br />
<br />
Our ethics arguments provide a specific method to evaluate debates over indefinite detention. Human rights demand a radically anti-utilitarian framework. You are only responsible for resolving the question over the morality of indefinite detention in this debate – all other impacts are not causally related to your decision, so they must not be part of your moral calculus. The detention of ‘enemy combatants’ is unique in this sense – generic defenses of consequentialism DO NOT RESPOND TO OUR AFFIRMATIVE and detention outweighs EVERYTHING.<br />
Fernando R. Tesòn, Tobias Simon Eminent Scholar at the Florida State University School of Law, 2005, Human Rights in the War on Terror, p. 64-67<br />
One argument that liberals… is self-defeating.<br />
<br />
In the war on terror, any discourse of danger is swept up into the larger climate of fear in order to justify the militarism of every aspect of life – everything from environmental degradation and disease to economic collapse is portrayed as a threat to global civilization, requiring a quite-literal ‘war’ in response. Reject their disadvantages – representations of danger like theirs are manipulated by those in power to justify ever-increasing state intervention into everyday life.<br />
Frank Furedi, Professor of Sociology at the University of Kent, June 27, 2006, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/printable/907/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/printable/907/</a>, accessed February 4, 2007<br />
It is now common to hear… will be made more explicit.<br />
<br />
And, the embrace of consequentialist risk analysis in the ‘war on terror’ is catastrophic – the “enemy combatant” status is part of an elite discourse of risk calculation that makes the public acquiesce to the erosion of civil liberties. Accepting this logic makes us all spectators to the state’s rituals of violence played out across the globe.<br />
Donald Pease, Avalon Foundation Chair of the Humanities at Dartmouth College, 2003, boundary 2, Vol. 30, No. 3, p. 14-17<br />
The detention camps were…. material witness,&quot; and &quot;persons of interest.&quot;<br />
<br />
This obsession with risk and security justified hundreds of millions of deaths in the 20th century, and promises to become even more devastating as the war on terror accelerates. The ultimate catastrophe is not the terrorist attack but this way of living in permanent need of the security state’s salvation, this depoliticized worldview puts life on hold to the prerogatives of the state.<br />
Bulent Diken, Senior Lecturer in Sociology at Lancaster University, 2006, Irish Journal of Sociology, Vol. 15, No. 1, p. 83-84<br />
Meinhof aimed, through sabotage,… or the lack of politics) with other means.<br />
<br />
Finally, the large-scale mobilization of violence undertaken in the 'war on terror' depends above all else on the successful reproduction of the official discourse of counter-terrorism. The explicit repudiation of the 'enemy combatant' designation is critical to breaking down the manufactured consensus of the 'war on terror' hurtling the world toward unending war.<br />
Richard Jackson, Professor of Politics at Manchester University, Spring 2005, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm</a>, accessed September 25, 2006<br />
