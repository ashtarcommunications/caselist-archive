Treaty Power 1NC<br />
-No risk of declining treaty power<br />
A. it’s never been challenged<br />
Merico-stephens – 04 (Michigan journal of int’l law, winter, 25 mich j. int’l l. 265)<br />
“justice eholmes rejected missouri’s”<br />
“tried in civil courts”<br />
B. no spillover<br />
Swaine 03 (Edward, Columbia law review april)<br />
“the objectives of international and constitutional doctrine” “resuscitate one such means”<br />
CIL ADV 1nc<br />
No internal link – no evidence court would apply CIL<br />
CIL not binding<br />
Bradley and goldsmith 97 (110 harv l. rev 815)<br />
“we have argue dthat” “federal or state law”<br />
Cil does not affect state practice<br />
Goldsmith and posner 98 (working paper no 63)<br />
“one of the central claims of the standard account” “multilateral cooperation”<br />
Turn activism – use of CIl opens door to unrestrained judicial activism<br />
Wilkins 05 (brinton, 2005 byu l. rev 1415)<br />
‘given cil’s source and potential” “judge having jurisdiction”<br />
That makes enforcement impossible – undermines democracy, liberty, and independence of the judiciary<br />
O’scannlain, 2006<br />
“judicial activism can have consequences that are far more profound” “of what is to come”<br />
Loss of judicial indep collapses democ globally<br />
Sobel 2005 (judicature, mar/apr vol 88, iss 5)<br />
“this unprecedented effort tof congress” ‘weeks, is anarchy”<br />

Geopsychosis Kritik<br />
The 1ac is premised on a flawed notion of ir – realist political ideology maps purely psychic threats onto the global gameboard<br />
Bruke, 2002 (Anthony, “aporias of security” alternatives: global, local, political” infotrac onfile)<br />
“in describing this productivity” “geopolitical and psychic contours”<br />
This transplantation of the threat matrix onto the real human community implicates modern international relations – realist politics are limited by their political failings<br />
George, 1994 (im, discourses of global politics: a criical reintroduction ot internationalr elations, pg 11-12)<br />
Criticism is a gateway issue – aff must justify its methodology in the face of hooor of modern politics<br />
Campbell and dillon 93 (political subject of violence, pg 2-4)<br />
Missouri v. Holland CP<br />
Text: In an appropriate test case, the United States USpreme Court should ovverule the decision in <em>United States v. Morrison</em> by upholding the civil rights rememdy of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act under Section 5 of th Fourteenth Amendment as well as the treaty power and Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution as per the holding in <em>Missouri v Holland.</em><br />
Competition<br />
Solvency<br />
Extending the Holland precerent would uphold the civil remedy and preserve the treaty power<br />
Stark 01 (47 loy l. rev 255)<br />
“in Missouri v. Holland, the united” “treaty is an open question”<br />
Enhancing CIL destroys thte treaty making process which is key to solve international conflict”<br />
Estreicher 03 (samuler, 44 va. J. int’l l. 5)<br />

Ecosystems resilient<br />
AFP 1999 “the united nations warned Wednesday that” “take a long time to recover”<br />
CIL doesn’t affect environmental law<br />
Wiener 99 (jonathan, 87 geo l.j. 749 )<br />
„these coercive features might“ „not majority rule“<br />
<strong>2NC CARDS</strong>*<br />
REALISM TRICK<br />
Realism is inevitable – this takes out their i-law advantages becausre states act out of self interest and ignore I-law if it comes in conflict with their interests<br />
Sriram 06 (chanra lekha, “international law, international relations theory and post-atrocity justice”<br />
“perhaps, the most obvious and significant reason whyt” “provide the relevant expertise”<br />
<br />
ACTIVISM Impact<br />
Congress will pass the reaffirmation of American independence resolution to strip the court and it would turn all their i=-law impacts<br />
Setear 05 (john, 91 va. L. rev. 579)<br />
“several potential explanations for the court’s” “resolution’s constitutionality”<br />
Backlash turns the case and takes out enforcement<br />
Rae, 2001 (nicol, <em>congress confronts the court: the struggle for legitimacy and authority in lawmaking)</em><br />
“in the third set of circumstances” “elections during that period”<br />
Legitimacy key to enforcement<br />
Hansford and sprigs, 2006 (Thomas and james, <em>the politics of precedent on the US supreme court p 25)</em><br />
Acitvism contextualizes the internal link takeouts – our wilkins evidence indicates that the aff opens the door for CIl to become a playground for judicial caprice<br />
This is especially true for the Roberts court which will engage in conservative activism<br />
Grabber 06 (mark, 75 fordham l. rev 675)<br />
„conservative jurists who endorse these“ „promote many conservative causes“<br />
The plan itself causes congress to backlash<br />
Cohen 06 (Harlan, 24 Berkeley j. int’l law. 273)<br />
“the reaction to the supreme court’s” “enforcement of U.S. law”<br />
CIL activism link:<br />
CIL is subjective- courts can simply cherry pick the policies they want to support<br />
Kochan 06 (Donald, 29 Fordham int’l lj 507)<br />
“this brings the article back to the cocktail” “to them by the constitution”<br />
Lack of rules governing citation of foreign law means that the court can dictate whatever result I wants<br />
Sanchez 05 (Ernesto, 38 conn l. rev. 185)<br />
“it is easy to dismiss such concerns about” “confidentiality of judicial deliberations”<br />
Citing international law tanks legitimacy – link only goes our way<br />
Sanchez 05 (above)<br />
“the fourth reason against an” “accepted by the nation”<br />
<br />
ALIEN TORT SUITS<br />
Enhancing judicial power with CIL opens the door to ATS that crush confidence in ecoinomy and competitiveness – d’amore evidence indicates businesses will fear that federal courts could begin to entertain lawsuits against companies that operate in nations that violate human rights. Our evidence says this literally wreaks havoc on the economy and the ability of Us companies to compete<br />
Cil the crucial internal link<br />
Bradleyt 98 (curtis 26 denv j. int’l . l. and pol’y 807)<br />
“in a recent article” “customary intenrationa law has the status of federal law”<br />
The impact turns and outweighs the case<br />
<ol><li>collapse in confidence causes a recession that triggers their conomy impact</li></ol>Braithwaite 04 (john, 592 annals 79)<br />
“the challenge of designing institutions that” “continues to this day”<br />
<ol><li>loss of competitiveness collapses leadership our segal evidence indicates that our lead in tech and other sectors is the crucial lynchipin to our overall leadership</li></ol>khalilzad 95<br />
c. this turns human rights and democracy – kochan indicates htat ATS liability suits will chill foreign investment<br />
Kochan 05 (above)<br />
“the final principal objection involves” “rights in developing countries”<br />
POVERTY TRADE<br />
Poverty outweighs – hufbauer evidence indicates pullout of int’l investment leaves millions impoverished – sucrutla poverty impact over nuclear war scenario<br />
Perceptual threat of ATRs suits destroy global foreign direct investment<br />
Hufbauer and mitrokostas 04 (16 st. Thomas l. Rev. 607 )<br />
„adverse ats decisions coudl“ „investment in china“<br />
This collapses free trade and destroys millions of jobs in developing countries<br />
Hufbauer above<br />
“ats suits will damage target countries by”<br />
Free trade prevents nuke war<br />
Copley news service 99<br />
<br />
Ats suits cause mass divestment in developing nations, destroy hundreds of thousands of US jobs and wreak havoc on free trade<br />
Duruigbo 04 (14 minn j. global trade 1)<br />
“a hallmark of awakening monster” “implications for U.S. interest’<br />
<br />
<br />
2nc CIL NORM<br />
<ul><li>Goldsmith and posner is an indict of their assumption that CIL is an objective norm that can be applied to state practice because it’s that state practice htat defines CIL in the first place – you should prefer our ev that says CIL as an illusion better explained by convergence of self interest and coercion</li></ul>Goldmsith and posner 98 (above)<br />
“in our view, CIL scholars approach” “absence of external constraints”<br />
CIL cannot change state behavior<br />
Judson 06 (walter – army lawyer)<br />
“using this theory, posner and goldsmith” “coercion—between states”<br />
CIL is the gg not the chicken – CIL is not a norm but only a label that we apply to self interested actions ex post facto<br />
Goldsmith and posner 98 (above)<br />
“this section sets forth our revisionist theory of CIL” “pursuing their self-interest”<br />

<br />
A. Interpretation: No new grounds. The plan has to rule opposite the grounds in the original decision<br />
<br />
<br />
Overrule means “deprive the decision of authority as precedent by holding the opposite of the original grounds.”<br />

Thomson Gale, 2005. eNotes.com. 2006. 9 Sep, 2006 &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://law.enotes.com/wests-law-encyclopedia/overrule" rel="nofollow">http://law.enotes.com/wests-law-encyclopedia/overrule</a>&gt;<br />

An issue that is within ... surrounding the case at hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. They don’t overrule the original grounds:<br />
A Court can still cite it as precedent post the plan<br />
C. Superior Interpretation<br />
Core negative ground is the original holdings are good. They eviscerate that ground by leaving the precedent intact.<br />
Predictable limits:Lurking questions abound, but none are decisions:<br />
Examples:<br />
Quirin: International Human Rights<br />
Casey: Equal Protection<br />
Milliken: Housing and employment discrimination<br />
Morrison: International Law<br />
We need a stable solvency mechanism for productive clash. The range of new grounds is infinite<br />
D. Voting Issue. Topicality is a game of competing interpretations. Its what you justify. Vote negative for limited predictable topic or the affirmative will win every debate with a new unbeatable case<br />

<h1 id="toc23"><a name="TEST CASE"></a>TEST CASE</h1>
A. The plan has to grant cert to a test case to overrule the original decision. The court can’t rule without a live case or controversy<br />
Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law, 1996, p. 341<br />
Opinion: the formal written expression ... cannot issue advisory opinions.<br />
<br />
B. The plan doesn’t use a live test case.<br />
[It just says “the court should hold….”]<br />
<br />
C. Vote Negative<br />
1. Core topic knowledge: Fiat is limited to the court acting in accord with its institutional nature – the court is institutionally constrained from ruling without one. Utopian fiat is antithetical to the unique knowledge of how the courts and the law work.<br />
2. Predictability: There are two sides to every case. We need to know which they rule on so we can research the merits of the other side. They artificially prevent indepth policy analysis.<br />
3. Ground: A specific test case is critical to all core negative link ground. Some cases are more controversial than others &amp; there is in depth literature about every pending case before the court because it sits atop a pyramid of lower court argument.<br />
4. If they “fiat” a test case its illegitimate &amp; a voting issue—it fiats that a private citizen file the suit &amp; that the Supreme Court act. Private actor fiat is an extra-topical voting issue because it prove the resolution is insufficient to solve the harm<br />

A. The plan doesn’t specify the grounds on which they overrule.<br />

B. Vote Negative:<br />
<br />
1. Topicality: its not an overrule without opposing grounds. Vote negative for limited predictable topic or the affirmative will win every debate with a new unbeatable case<br />
Pintip Hompluem Dunn, Yale Law Journal, November, 2003, 113 Yale L.J. 493<br />
After all, Justices create ... has just been created. n66<br />
<br />
2. Civics: Its how the court works. The court never overrules without substituting new law for old.<br />
<br />
3. Desirability depends on grounds for overrule. Guts any educational policy analysis because you have no idea what the policy will even be or look like if you vote Aff.<br />
Kia Hayes, February 12, 2003, The Brown Daily Herald, Vol. CXXXVIII, No. 16, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/printstory.asp?storyID=333&amp;dbversion=herald" rel="nofollow">http://www.browndailyherald.com/printstory.asp?storyID=333&amp;dbversion=herald</a><br />
The effects of Michigan &quot;losing&quot; the case ... action all over the country, including Brown University.&quot;<br />
<br />
4. Affirmative Conditionality – plan vagueness lets them shift out of core Disads and Counterplans. Its uniquely abusive: in order for the neg to debate the aff plan must stay stable throughout the entire debate<br />
<br />
5. Evaluate this just like a disadvantage: Its what they justify. Meaningful debate is impossible unless they give grounds.<br />

OTHER THREATS This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security and well-being in the coming years and decades. In the former Yugoslavia nationalist aggression tears at the stability of Europe and could easily spread. The flow of illegal drugs intensifies through increasingly powerful international crime syndicates that have made common cause with authoritarian regimes and have utterly corrupted the institutions of tenuous, democratic ones. Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons continue to proliferate. The very source of life on Earth, the global ecosystem, appears increasingly endangered. Most of these new and unconventional threats to security are associated with or aggravated by the weakness or absence of democracy, with its provisions for legality, accountability, popular sovereignty, and openness. LESSONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY The experience of this century offers important lessons. Countries that govern themselves in a truly democratic fashion do not go to war with one another. They do not aggress against their neighbors to aggrandize themselves or glorify their leaders. Democratic governments do not ethnically &quot;cleanse&quot; their own populations, and they are much less likely to face ethnic insurgency. Democracies do not sponsor terrorism against one another. They do not build weapons of mass destruction to use on or to threaten one another. Democratic countries form more reliable, open, and enduring trading partnerships. In the long run they offer better and more stable climates for investment. They are more environmentally responsible because they must answer to their own citizens, who organize to protest the destruction of their environments. They are better bets to honor international treaties since they value legal obligations and because their openness makes it much more difficult to breach agreements in secret. Precisely because, within their own borders, they respect competition, civil liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.<br />

The failure to develop an international system to hedge against the possibility of worldwide depression- will open their eyes to their folly. Hundreds of millions-billions-of people around the world have pinned their hopes on the international market economy. They and their leaders have embraced market principles-and drawn closer to the West-because they believe that our system can work for them. But what if it can't? What if the global economy stagnates, or even shrinks? In that case, we will face a new period of international conflict: South against North, rich against poor. Russia. China. India-these countries with their billions of people and their nuclear weapons will pose a much greater danger to world order than Germany and Japan did in the 1930's.<br />
