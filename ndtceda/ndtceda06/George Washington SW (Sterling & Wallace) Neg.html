Barret, 2k3 74 U. Col. L Rev. 1011<br />
“once a court decides an issue…precedent was wrongly decided”<br />
Disagreement with the original decision is not normal means for an overrule, the aff’s plan must point to one of three specific justification<br />

Plan results in Miranda rights- hurts the war on terror<br />
Becker 2k3 (casebook)<br />
We have reached a crisis point in the war on terror. Islamic fundamentalists have declined war upon us and yet the ranks of the faint of heart are growing. A renewed commitment to fight this aggressive threat is essential. There is no middle way, it is victory or holocaust.<br />
Frum and Perle, 2k3 <u>An end to evil, how to win the war on terror</u><br />
“taken all in all…the democratic west”<br />
The people who attacked the United States on September 11th were part of a radical faction of the multifaceted Islamic belief system. Only by understanding their religious ideology can we end the threat that terrorism poses to the world<br />
Habeck, 2006 <u>Knowing the enemy, Jihadist Ideology and the War on terror</u> 4-6<br />
Islamic fundamentalism has its roots in Islamic law and theology dating back to the death of Muhammad. Their strategy, tactics and targets are all based on extreme interpretations of the Qur’an that justify their jihad, and not political social or cultural events.<br />
Habeck, 2006 <u>Knowing the enemy, Jihadist Ideology and the War on terror</u> 4-6<br />
The Central innovations of Islamic fundamentalism demonad the destruction of the United States. According to them only god has sovereignty to create rules for society and thus everything the United States does as the center for global democracy and liberalism is sinful. Additionally, they believe violence is necessary to destroy non-believers to create a world ruled solely by their vision of Islam.<br />
Habeck, 2006 <u>Knowing the enemy, Jihadist Ideology and the War on terror</u> 53-5<br />
The extremists aren’t interested in dialog. Any agreement with their ideology would necessitate sacrificing every other society on the planet. A successful response involves a two-track approach; one ideological and one physical. First, we must stop more terrorist attacks from occurring by fighting the war on terror and depriving fundamentalists of land, time, and money. Second, we must counter radical Islam’s preaching of jihadist ideology.<br />
Habeck, 2006 <u>Knowing the enemy, Jihadist Ideology and the War on terror</u> 53-5<br />
Specifying that Islamic fundamentalists are the king threat presents overly braod security justifications. Make them prove why this specific can be solved by their aff<br />
Rouch 2k6 The National Journal, April 15, 2006 “A war on Jihadism—Not Terror”<br />
“Speaking to reporters…at their word”<br />
Just because sometimes truth claims are wrong doesn’t mean we should reject truth. Doing so inhibits our ability to make coherent assertions about the world. Make the negative prove why our specific claims are socially constructed and not objective.<br />

The Court has made it clear that stare decisis….words are “liberty” and “freedom,” respectively<br />
“special justification….cannot explain the courts…decisions….there was another factor, liberty considerations, that…became an additional criterion. Lawrence also abandoned the rhetorical flourishes of casey regard the corut legitimacy<br />

The very concept of equal protection makes false presumptions of fairness and justice that fail those most in need. While education is a laudable goal, the plan is analogous to trying to solve a homeless person’s hunger by giving them a small can of beluga caviar.
