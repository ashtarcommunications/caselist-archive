Long Beach – Kappelar K<br />
<br />
The 1AC’s representation of violence (e.g. the representation of war, conquests, domination, and the nation state) constitutes the subject through violence and inaugurates militarism as the basis of their project.<br />
Kappelar, Susanne (lecturer of film theory at University of Essex); <em>The Will to Violence Politics of Personal Behavior</em>, 1995<br />
<br />
The 1AC turns justice into a justification to help dominators. This means a) theres no solvency for the case because the plan hurts the oppressed and helps the oppression and b) the aff is a linguistic justification of violence.<br />
Kappelar<br />
<br />
The form of representation maintains a cultural will-to-violence that makes war, racist, and sexist violence not only legitimate but necessary. Our alternative is to conceptualize violence as individual behavior. It’s the least necessary condition to prevent apathy and violence.<br />

Environmental reforms are based on an anthropocentric perception that view nature as a warehouse for resources. This turns advantage<br />
Maclaughlin, 1993, regarding nature, p. 67-68<br />
“Within industrialism, nonhuman nature is not seen…developed” for human use.”<br />
<br />
Our notions that the worst form of violence be classified as terrorism demonstrates a disconnect with how we view colonial or political illegitimate violence. Our interpretations of terrorism as evil does not allow for distinctions between freedom fighters and terrorists. Changing the way we view such distinctions between acts of violence done to the government and acts of violence done by the government is our last hope for political change or we face sure extermination<br />
Hage, 2003, Comes a Time we are all enthusiasm, public culture, p. 83<br />
“It is not surprising that it is often arabs…dying as a dignified being.”<br />
<br />
Current U.S. policies are based on the procurement of violence based on the articulation of our victimization in global issues. In the status quo, labeling political outcry against the USFG as terrorism is a means of distinguishing these violent acts from those that are justified through U.S. politics. This has lead to the limitless aggression against targets who may or may not be related to the U.S.’s suffering<br />
Butler, 2004, Precarious Life, p. 4<br />
“The articulation of this hegemony takes…sources of one’s own suffering.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc20"><a name="x-CSU Longbeach FJ Neg-Off Case Args:"></a><em>Off Case Args:</em></h3>
The 1AC’s representation of violence (e.g. the representation of war, conquest, domination and the nation state) constitute the subject thru violence and inaugurates militarism as the basis of their project<br />
Kappelar, 1995<br />
“War – attack, conquest, domination – seems to be the guiding…rather than a radical refusal of it.”<br />
<br />
And the 1AC turns justice into a justification to help dominators. This means a) there’s no solvency for the case because the plan hurts the oppressed and helps the oppression and b) the plan is a linguistic justification of violence<br />
Kappelar, 1995, 121-2<br />
“As white moralists of the past tried…she gives him her handbag.”<br />
<br />
This form of representation maintains a cultural will-to-violence that makes war, racist, and sexist violence not only legitimate but necessary. Our alternative is to conceptualize violence as individual behavior. It’s the least necessary condition to prevent apathy and violence<br />
Kappelar, 1995<br />
“War does not suddenly break out…we permit them to happen.”<br />
<br />
Fem K<br />
Acting through normal structures without questioning how womyn are affected makes womyn invisible. The plan comes from a patriarchial mindset and reproduces it. The invisibility of womyn is proven by the 1ac never once mentions womyn<br />
D’Souza, 1994, Feminist Perspectives on Sustainable development, 95-96<br />
“As in the Eurocentric knowledge construct…explain the subjective.”<br />
<br />
Don’t be mislead into believing that the aftermath of 9/11 only affected one community of people. The war on terror has portrayed American womyn as sad widows and Islamic womyn as equally sad oppressed wives. The western narrative of victimization has re-inscribed violent gender norms<br />
Lorber, 2005, Breaking the bowls, p. 103<br />
“In the U.S. media, the post-September, 11 picture…times of powerfulness.”<br />
<br />
Without pursing gender equality, impacts are inevitable<br />
Chew, 1998, International Journal on world peace, December, 41-42<br />
“There is a close connection in our search…not the result of world peace.”<br />
<br />
We must detach sovereignty from the state to create a post-patriarchal world that can move beyond oppression<br />
Hoffman, 2001, 126-127<br />
“It is crucial, in my view, to detach…post-statist manner.”<br />
<br />
2NC evidence<br />
Conceptualizing violence as cyclical only justifies individual violence by externalizing it onto “the system.”<br />
Kappelar, 1995, p. 2-3<br />
“While consideration of mitigating…zone of non-violence.”<br />
<br />
AT Framework<br />
Predictability is a discredited myth of Newtonian science – you got no offense<br />
Davis, 1997, Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, vol. 48<br />
“These startling new scientific perspectives are just…to existing the future.”<br />
<br />
Their claims of predictability represents elitist attempts to exclude and silence us – this is a voting issue<br />
Dantley, 2002, Education and Urban Society, vol. 34 (3)<br />
“The third dynamic of positivism…exclusivity in ontology.”<br />
<br />
AT Perm<br />
The permutation maintains a semblance of K while subsuming real discourse under the banner of competition. It perpetuates silence in debate and proves the need for wholesale K without permutation<br />
Kappelar, 1995, p. 59-60<br />
“Scientific standpointlessness, however, is no longer…form of discourse.”<br />
<br />
Perm ignores dialogue and the content of communication in the name of victory and unity<br />
Kappelar, 1995, 73<br />
“What is of interest is not what…behaviour towards myself.”<br />
<br />
The perm just allows the aff to reformulate the K without engaging violence. It’s an exercise of power, control, and violence commited by the aff<br />
Kappelar, 1995, 72<br />
“But the point of such reformations is evidently not…of ‘us’ and ‘them’.”<br />
<br />
The perm fails conducting a mathematical exercise to add the critique to the aff does not alter the framework<br />
Scott, 1995, Gender and development, 121-22<br />
“The text includes sections…meaning of tradition.”<br />
<br />
Fem 2NC<br />
Feminism within the state inverts patriarchy<br />
Hoffman, 2001, Gender and Sovereignty, 48-49<br />
“This point applies no less to…natural bodies altogether.”<br />
<br />
Feminist refusal to critique, the state prevents a reformulation of sovereignty<br />
Hoffman, 2001, p. 73<br />
“Although it is sometimes argued…concept becomes possible.”<br />

<br />
THESE ARE OUR MAIN THREE STRATS. THE SHELLS ARE SUBJECT TO VARY<br />
DEPENDING ON THE AFFIRMATIVE AND OUR MOOD AT THE TIME.<br />
<br />
Essentialism<br />
Juridical systems of power, like the Supreme court produce the<br />
subjects they represent. The assumptions of a stable subject whom it<br />
can represent closes off subjectivity and reproduces masculinist<br />
domination turning solvency.<br />
Butler 99 (Rhetoric at Berkeley; Gender Trouble pg 4-5)<br />
<br />
Rejecting the notions of static identities is key to stopping the<br />
eradication of populations.<br />
Molloy 95 (Patricia, Prof of Sociology @ Ontario Institute for Studies<br />
in Educ., &quot;Subversive Strategies or Subverting Strategy? Toward a<br />
feminist Pedagogy for Peace,&quot; 236-238)<br />
<br />
Only be releasing a fixed understanding of gender is agency/change possible.<br />
Butler 1995 (Judith, Maxine Elliot Chair of Rhetoric @ Univ of Cal @<br />
Berkeley. &quot;Contingenet Foundations: Feminism and the Question of<br />
'Postmodernism&quot; in Butler Feminist Conditions: A Philosophical<br />
Exchange Routeledge 1995)<br />
<br />
Intersectionality<br />
Feminist and anti-racist discourse often overlooks the intersections<br />
of Gender and race based oppression – this marginalizes the interests<br />
of womyn of color.<br />
Crenshaw 1991 (Kimberle Williams, &quot;Mapping the Margins:<br />
Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence Against Women of<br />
Color&quot; 43 Stanford Law Review 1241-99 LN)<br />
<br />
The false guise of heterogeneity is rooted in the very master<br />
narratives it claims to challenge. This must be opposed in our way of<br />
being and thinking for transformation.<br />
Hooks 90 (bell, &quot;Postmodern Blackness; Postmodern Culture_vol 1; no. 1 Sept)<br />
<br />
Recognizing the identitiy is fluid allows us to rebuild coalitions and<br />
reconstruct the world along more inclusive lines.<br />
Crenshaw 1991 (Kimberle Williams, &quot;Mapping the Margins:<br />
Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence Against Women of<br />
Color&quot; 43 Stanford Law Review 1241-99 LN)<br />
<br />
Feminism Kritik<br />
Acting through normal structures without questioning how womyn are<br />
affected makes womyn invisible. The plan comes from patriarchal<br />
mindset and reproduces it. The invisibility of womyn is proven by the<br />
1AC never once mentions womyn.<br />
D'Souza (activist with the Collective for International Education and<br />
Development, Corrine, Feminist Perspectives on Sustainable<br />
Development, page 95-96)<br />
<br />
Without pursuing gender equality pollution, resources depletion, war,<br />
poverty, and famine are inevitable.<br />
Chew (Prez of the Assoc. of Womyn for Action and Research; Phyllis<br />
Ghim LIan, International Journal on World Peace, Decemeber pg 41-42)<br />
1998<br />
<br />
While womyn are not normally recognized in the public sphere they can<br />
change that through their agency but immediate recognition of their<br />
voice.<br />
Mann 94 (Patricia S, Micro-Politics: agency in a post feminism era.<br />
Univ of Minnesota press p. 85-86)<br />

Affirmative Disclosure--Negative Disclosure:<br />
Well this is hard because they (this is their coach) do not read a plan or qoute people. They instead at times mention authers who support what they are saying but really do not really on them. they instead talk about how parts of debate are bad and how debate as a whole &quot;banks&quot;. This includes things like speed, flowing, mindless reading of cards. They do not say all debate is bad and do find some good in the activity they would like it to be more inclusive. They instead would love for teams to have a discusion with them about life and the topic to discuss what the future could be like in debate. They do say this in all rounds, but it is different and not a preplanned discusion and change depending on what the other teams say and also what they feel like.
