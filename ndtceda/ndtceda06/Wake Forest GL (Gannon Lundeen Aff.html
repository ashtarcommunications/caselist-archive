Observation One: Sanctity of Life<br />
In 1992, the Supreme Court held in Planned Parenthood v Casey that there was a right to abortion because the lack offetal personhood<br />
Jay alan Sekulow, and John Tuskey, 1996 (40 NYL Sch L Rev 945)<br />
“planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey” “right to abortion was perverse”<br />
<br />
However scientific consensus concludes that life begins at conception<br />
Klasing 95 (Murphy, 22 pepp l. rev. 933)<br />
“the unborn child” “brain-wave activity”<br />
Even if the fetus is not a human, abortion must be rejected on the grounds that we must protet all human life – failure results in a slippery slope that justifies the lsaughter of all life<br />

“the legal disntiction between person and human” “already participates in its immorality”<br />
Unwanted children become unwanted lives this logic results in extinction<br />

Fetal personhood is a prerequisite for utility – it begs the question utility for whom<br />

Solvency<br />
First – precedent – casey court enshrines the constitutional status of unpersons to fetuses all legal scholars agree that the SC is the crucial actor because the Congress and states lack any power to cause change<br />

Plan Text<br />
In an appropriate test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey by ruling that requiring a minor to obtain parental consent for an abortion violates the 9th Amendment of the United States Constitution. We’ll clarify.<br />

<br />
Contention 1 --- Gender<br />
Casey upheld parental consent requirements for minors seeking abortion, securing the last bastion of patriarchal control of reproductive-rights<br />
Berman ‘94<br />
(Leonard, JD Candidate – U Toledo College of Law, Howard Law Journal, 37 How. L.J. 577, Lexis)<br />
In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 3 the Court confronted the constitutionality … literally owned their children and constructively owned their wives.<br />
Parental consent restrictions systematically demoralize women and preclude full citizenship, crippling the potential for gender equality<br />
Schmidt ’93 (Catherine, 68 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 597, June, Lexis)<br />
Denying or restricting access to abortion also undermines women's long struggle…these laws are unconstitutional and should be struck down as a violation of the fourteenth amendment.<br />
U.S. parental consent laws are modeled globally<br />
<hr />
it’s a vital internal link to patriarchy<br />
Ernst ‘04<br />
(Julia L., Et al., 6 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 752, April, Lexis)<br />
The impact of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade 1 … effectively fight against each initiative by placing it within this comprehensive framework.<br />
Unchecked patriarchy makes extinction inevitable<br />
Warren and Cady ‘94<br />
(Karen J., and Duane L., Hypatia, Spring, Vol. 9, Issue 2)<br />
The notion of patriarchy as a socially dysfunctional system enables… lies in understanding the conceptual roots of various woman-nature-peace connections in regional, national, and global contexts.<br />
Contention 2 --- Violence<br />
Parental involvement laws prioritize family integrity above minors’ rights, fueling family violence<br />
Katheryn D. Katz, Professor of Law @ Union University, 1999, 62 Alb. L. Rev. 1119, pp l/n<br />
At the same time that the Casey Court upheld the parental notification statute… potentially grave emotional and psychological consequences of the decision to abort.&quot; 179<br />
Violence against young women is rampant because parental consent laws fuel a cycle of victim blaming<br />
Berman ‘94<br />
(Leonard, JD Candidate – U Toledo College of Law, Howard Law Journal, 37 How. L.J. 577, Lexis)<br />
A host of different forms of child abuse threatens the independent exercise… state control over unemancipated minors' reproductive freedom by striking down the parental consent provision in total.<br />
<br />
Violence resulting from parental consent affects 4 million women a year<br />
Center for Reproductive Rights, “Mandatory Parental Consent and Notification Laws,” March 2001, pp <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reproductiverights.org/pub_fac_mandconsent.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.reproductiverights .org/pub_fac_mandconsent.html</a><br />
In families where abusive relationships or other … Narrowly defined parental involvement laws ignore the importance of such supports in young women's lives.<br />
4 women die each day<br />
NOW, “Violence Against Women in the United States,” Acc. 2007, pp <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.now.org/issues/violence/stats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.now.org/issues /violence/stats.html</a><br />
MURDER. Every day four women die in this country as a result of domestic violence … violence are being denied insurance in some states because they are considered to have a &quot;pre-existing condition.&quot;<br />
Contention 3—Hypocrisy<br />
Parental consent laws assume young women are capable of raising children but not equipped with the capacity to decide to abort—this targets women simply because of their age<br />
Medic ‘2K<br />
(Bill, DeAnza College, Pro-Youth Pages, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.geocities.com/hatredsucks/supremecourt.html#abortion1" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com /hatredsucks/supremecourt.html #abortion1</a>)<br />
The issue of youth rights comes up frequently in Supreme Court rulings… most feminists and most reporters don't give a damn about victims this young, so it's easier for the rest of us to ignore.<br />
Abortion is a unique context for age discrimination<br />
Schmidt ‘93<br />
(Catherine, 68 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 597, June, Lexis)<br />
Recognition of the equal protection concerns inherent in abortion laws …. current parental notification and consent laws would not survive such an analysis.<br />
State-sanctioned ageism universally engineers children to remain docile in the face of oppression<br />
Dominick and Ebrahimi ‘96<br />
(Brian, Contributer – Znet, and Sara, “Young and Oppressed”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.youthrights.org /oppressed.php</a>)<br />
While most common oppressions, such as sexism, racism, classism, heterosexism… &quot;equality&quot; of most other oppressed groups are lauded and, at least to some extent, protected by government agencies.<br />
Such apathy and deliberative withdrawal makes extinction inevitable<br />
Boggs ‘97<br />
(Carl, National University, Theory and Society, Vol. 26, December)<br />
The decline of the public sphere in late twentieth-century America … that it precisely devalues those very types of information, skills, and attitudes.<br />
<br />
SOLVENCY<br />
Overruling Casey’s parental consent decision is the only way to eliminate patriarchal authority over reproduction, prevent domestic abuse, and grant minors equal rights<br />
Berman ‘94<br />
(Leonard, JD Candidate – U Toledo College of Law, Howard Law Journal, 37 How. L.J. 577, Lexis)<br />
The general consensus among critics of bypass provisions amounts … unemancipated minors be able to exercise their Constitutional right to privacy.<br />
Must hold that abortion is an unenumerated right under the 9th Amendment to avoid pitfalls of substantive due process<br />
Christopher J. Schmidt, 2003 (Spring)J.D., Widener University School of Law, University of Baltimore Law Review, , 32 U. Balt. L. Rev. 169 pp l/n<br />
Troxel v. Granville 110 gave the Court another opportunity to utilize the Ninth Amendment … a Nebraska statute criminalizing certain partial birth abortions was unconstitutional. 115<br />
*2000<br />
9th amendment roots abortion in the constitutional text, protecting it from the whims of judicial majority and political interests<br />
Christopher J. Schmidt, 2003 (Spring)J.D., Widener University School of Law, University of Baltimore Law Review, , 32 U. Balt. L. Rev. 169 pp l/n<br />
Regardless of what interpretative school of thought a legal scholar is in… it is infra dignitatem, it leaks in the front and leaks in the back. 155<br />
Unenumerated rights fall under strict scrutiny, raising the bar for state interest<br />
Christopher J. Schmidt, 2003 (Spring)J.D., Widener University School of Law, University of Baltimore Law Review, , 32 U. Balt. L. Rev. 169 pp l/n<br />
The meaning of the Ninth Amendment may be clear, but its implications for constitutional adjudication are not … the law in question is narrowly tailored to meet a compelling interest. 339<br />
Only the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the 9th Amendment<br />
Christopher J. Schmidt, 2003 (Spring)J.D., Widener University School of Law, University of Baltimore Law Review, , 32 U. Balt. L. Rev. 169 pp l/n<br />
If the judiciary does not determine unenumerated rights … express intent announced through the words of the Amendment.<br />
Rights trump governmental interest – this is the only way to ensure equality<br />

Wake GL AFF--Morrison, Section 5<br />
Plan<br />
In an appropriate test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in United States v. Morrison [529 U.S. 598] by ruling that the United States Congress has power under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment to regulate private acts of gender-motivated violence as in 42 U.S.C. § 13981.<br />
