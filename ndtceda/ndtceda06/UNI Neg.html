More fundamentally, as we… unavailable through litigation..<br />
<br />
Test case<br />
<br />
Violation - The use of a Test Case is inherently abusive to the neg – Test Case involve cherry picking litigants to guarantee the most favorable set of case facts possible<br />
<br />
reasons to prefer<br />
1. prevents 2ac timeframe shifts out of our disads<br />
<br />
2. key to ground –their applicability to the decision the aff seeks to overturn for links to judicial politics, activism, legitimacy and the breadth of the facts for args about which movement may be sucked into the court for hollow hope links<br />
<br />
3. plan text is key<br />
a. its key to pre-round prep, coaching advice, and the 1NC strategy. The plan text is the only thing that we get to see before the debate. All of our coaching and strategizing is based on plan text<br />
<br />
b. it’s the only ground in the debate that is GUARANTEED to not mutate and change. Their plan text represents the only truly stable advocacy in the debate<br />
<br />
4. our interpretation fairly divides ground – there are cases on the docket concerning all four decision areas<br />
<br />
voting issue<br />
1. clarification is illegit – our arguments are specific to pre-round research and strategizing, coaching advice, and general preparation – we will make additional voting issues in the block if they attempt to clarify<br />
<br />
2. potential absue related to ground i.e. DA links, moving target, extra topical advantages from other test cases, etc.<br />
<br />
overrule T<br />
<br />
A. INTERPRETATION – the affirmative must use the same grounds that the original decision was grounded in<br />
<br />
1. OVERRULE MEANS ON THE OPPOSITE GROUNDS OF THE ORIGINAL CASE<br />
<br />
Galloway, professor of Communication Studies, et al., 2006<br />
(Ryan, Jonah Feldman, Matt Moore, Joe Patrice, David Steinberg, Topic Committee Report: Supreme Court Topic Area, accessed 09/09/06, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usctrojandebate.com/2006galloway_interim_sct.pdf#search=%22%22supreme%20court%20topic%20area%20report%22%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.usctrojandebate.com/2006galloway_interim_sct.pdf#search=%22%22supreme%20court%20topic%20area%20report%22%22</a>) IB<br />
<br />
Several sub-issues quickly… Court originally decided upon.<br />
<br />
2. our interpretation is superior based on predictability – overturning on the same grounds limits the topic to four cases. This ensures stable disad and kritik ground which is critical to checking affirmative side bias and grounded in the literature.<br />
<br />
B. VIOLATION – the affirmative overrules the case on a different grounds than the original decision (insert card)<br />
<br />
C. TOPICALITY IS A VOTING ISSUE – a fair interpretation of the topic is critical to debate to education and fairness. You vote them down for what their interpretation of the topic justifies<br />
