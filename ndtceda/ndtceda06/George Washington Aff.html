<strong>Contention 1 –</strong><br />
Sept. 11th has allowed the Bush administration to implement a cloak of secrecy over the government. The Supreme Court has yet to provide guidance as to the extent of first amendment rights.<br />
Haridakis, Assit Prof Communication Studies Kent State, 2k6. (25. st. Louis U. Pub. L. Rev 3)<br />
“Like July 4, 1776, and... to make judgments about government activity<br />
<br />
Democracies lie behind closed doors. Secrecy has a corrosive effect, undermining the free market and encouraging corruption.<br />
Steinzor 2k3. (Prof Law at MD, 12 Kan. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y 641)<br />
“other changes in federal law enacted... both honestly and well”<br />
<br />
THE DEMOCRATIC VALUES OF OPENESS AND SEPERATION OF POWERS ARE KEY TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN SECURITY AND LIBERTY IN THE WAR ON TERROR. WITHOUT THEM EXECUTIVE OVERRACTION AND POLICY FAILURE IS INEVITABLE.<br />
Ignatiff, PHD Harvard, Intl. renowned Scholar and Historian, 2k4 (Michael, The Lesser Evil p 10-12)<br />
<br />
OVERREACTION IS THE ONLY WAY FOR US TO LOSE THE WAR ON TERROR. PRESERVING OUR POLITICAL IDENTITY IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT AN ESCALATORY SPIRAL OF VIOLENCE AND ENSURE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION.<br />
Ignatiff, PHD Harvard, Intl. renowned Scholar and Historian, 2k4 (Michael, The Lesser Evil p 61-62, 154)<br />
<br />
And, the commissions rest on shaky legal grounds, public sentitment will be the deciding factor<br />
Yen 2k6. (Associated Press, November 3)<br />
“Riddled with legal uncertainties... not be done under the cover of darkness”<br />
<br />
AND AL QAEDA IS SEEKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS, IF THEY GET THEM THEY WILL USE THEM<br />

<br />
Nuclear weapon acquisition is likely<br />

<br />
IMPACT IS EXTINCTION<br />
Patrick F. Speice, Jr. J.D. Candidate 2k6, Marshall-Wythe School of Law. William &amp; Mary Law Review. February<br />
<br />
<br />
BUSH ADMINISTRATION INCORRECTLY RELIES UPON QUIRIN FOR PRECEDENT TO MAKE MILITARY TRIBUNALS SECRET. IF JUSTICES HAD TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS THE DECISION WOULD HAVE BEEN RULED THE OTHER WAY.<br />
New York Bar Association, Main author 2k5 (Specifically, The Committee on Communications and Media Law, Main author Edward Klaris, ed of the report and Chair of the Reports Subcommittee) 22 Cardozo Arts &amp; Ent LJ 767 ARTICLE: THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC'S FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT OF ACCESS TO TERRORISM ON TRIAL: A POSITION PAPER<br />
<br />
And, judicial intervention is inevitable. Military commissions will be overruled by the Supreme Court<br />
LA Times 06. (11-3)<br />
“The Bush administration has faced... asked to resolve the issue”<br />
<br />
And the DOJ empirically enforces Supreme Court rulings<br />
Pages 2k3. (66 Alb. L. Rev. 1213)<br />
“The Court in Zadvydas held that... pending their removal”<br />
<br />
Adv. 2 – Immigration Hearings<br />
The federal government’s response to terrorism has been to scapegoat immigrant communities causing a broad erosion of their constitutional liberties<br />
Pfitsch 05. (11 Wash. &amp; Lee R.E.A.L. J. 151)<br />
“Immediately after the terrorist attacks on the... basic rights of all immigrants”<br />
<br />
Closed hearings harm national security – they cover up abuses and mistakes – cause us to depor people that could provide vital information and allow foreign governments to manipulate the trial<br />
New York Bar Association 2k4. (59 The Record 5)<br />
“The closure of hearings can actually hurt national security... received too little attention”<br />
<br />
Closed hearings waste resources and are an ineffective way of fighting the war on terror<br />
New York Bar Association 2k4. (59 The Record 5)<br />
“Closed hearings are particularly pernicious because... without public scrutiny”<br />
<br />
The DOJ’s national security justifications are fictitious<br />
New York Bar Association 2k4. (59 The Record 5)<br />
“The possibility of terrorists learning intelligence... wrong place at the wrong time”<br />
<br />
Openness is key to effectiveness of deportation hearings<br />
Bayrooti 03. (25 Whittier L. Rev. 203, lexis)<br />
“Although some exceptions have been permitted... access to deportation hearings.”<br />
<br />
Closed hearings alienate immigrant communities, decreasing trust of law enforcement<br />
New York Bar Association 2k4. (59 The Record 5)<br />
The immigrant community has been terrified by the DOJ’s new... whistle on suspicious activity”<br />
<br />
Distrust of law enforcement will result in WMD attack<br />
Kendrick 04. (47 How. L.J. 989)<br />
“Optimally, law enforcement would not rely... thwarting the ‘next September 11th.’”<br />
<br />
Domestic intelligence is the most important part of counter-terrorism<br />
Lewis 06. (CQ Congressional Testimony)<br />
“Second, many countries have refocused the work... at airports or harbors”<br />
<br />
And it’s the weakest link in the intel system<br />
Orange County Register 2k5 (December 4)<br />
“Judge Posner defines his topic as... neutralize or thwart them”<br />
Secret deportation hearings solidify MS-13 networks in Central America<br />

“After September 11, 2001, INS was absorbed... both the east and west coasts”<br />
<br />
These networks will smuggle in a nuclear weapon for al Qaeda – it will be used and kill millions<br />

“As London recovers from the latest... smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico”<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 3 – Don’t Run Agent CPs<br />
First they’re not real world. No actor has the authority to choose between the Supreme Court and another agent.<br />
Mitchell 91.<br />
“The key to understanding... limits of the resolution”<br />
<br />
Second: Infinitely regressive – the number of potential negative counterplans is limitless<br />
Solt 89. (Resolving the Ambiguities of Should JAFA, pg. 122)<br />
“There is clearly, however, no such consensus... could fill a forensic wax museum”<br />
<br />
Executive secrecy enlarged presidential powers to a dangerous level. Only the Court can delimit the power of the executive and restore democracy by creating a presumption of openness.<br />
Ross 2k4. (40 Idaho L. Rev. 351)<br />
“The Department of Justice has imposed...within it far more profound implications”<br />
<br />
Congressional oversight of the DOJ fails<br />
Boston Public Interest Law Journal 2k4<br />
“In addition to its foia policies... warrants for e-mail”<br />
<br />
And, executive privledge will overwhelm your counterplan<br />
Haridakis 06.<br />
“Executive branch action... to withhold documents from disclosure”<br />
<br />
The executive will circumvent your plan – the courts have refused to interpret the first amendment to allow information disclosure or deportation access<br />
Haridakis 06.<br />
“It is at least worth mentioning... view of public access rights”<br />
<br />
Allowing the political process to determine a right of access will inevitably result in manipulation and selective disclosure<br />
Papandrea 05. (25 B.C. Third World L. J. 25)<br />
“Bust as scholars have argued for decades... timely receipt of information”<br />

<strong>1AC:</strong><br />
Contention One: Secrecy is the Squo<br />
The issue of a public trial for military tribunals has yet to be settled by the Supreme Court<br />
Haridakis, Assitant Prof Communication Studies Kent State, 2004 (Paul, 9 Comm. L. &amp; Pol’y 317 The War on Terrorism: Military Tribunals and the First Amendment)<br />
“Despite differing opinions regarding courtroom… tailored to serve that interest”<br />
<br />
And, the Bush administration will invoke secrecy as the rule rather than the exception for military tribunals<br />
Same cite<br />
“There is no conclusive evidence… the rule rather then the exception”<br />
<br />
Contention Two: How I learned to stop worrying and love democracy<br />
Military tribunals undermine international confidence in the war on terror and the rule of law<br />
Goldsmith, Prof Law U of Chicago, 2002 (Jack MILITARY TRIBUNALS AND LEGAL CULTURE: WHAT A DIFFERENCE SIXTY YEARS MAKES, Contitutional Commentaryl V 19 I 1, p 261, 29 p)<br />
“The reastion to President Bush’s Order… against the terrorists and in the nation’s democratic institutions”<br />
<br />
And, tribunals cloaked in secrecy will be seen as illegitimate, undermining public confidence in the process<br />
Haridakis “If trials are held in relative secrecy… in the integrity of the process”<br />
<br />
Furthermore, executive secrecy has enlarged presidential powers to a dangerous level. Only the court can delimit the power of the executive and restore democracy by creating a presumption of openness<br />
Ross, Assoc Prof, Edward R Murrow School of Comm, 2004 (Susan Dente, 40 Idaho L. R. 351 SECRECY’S ASSAULT ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO OPEN TRIALS)<br />
“The Department of Justice has imposed secrecy… rely on secret evidence withheld from the accused…. The Court must reclaim its role as zealous advocate of an informed populace.”<br />
<br />
The Democratic values of openness and separation of powers are key to strike the right balance between security and liberty in the war on terror<br />
Ignatiff, PHD Harvard, 2004 (Michael, THE LESSER EVIL p 10-12)<br />
“If a war on terror may require… rights of whistle blowers to tell the truth.”<br />
<br />
Overreaction is the only way for us to lose the War on Terror.<br />
Ignatiff, p 61-62, 154<br />
“These harms, it should be understood,… that can defead a democracy is itself”<br />
“Remaining on the higher ground… trust in them, and make them work”<br />
<br />
A democratic system that respects civil liberties is key<br />
McDonnell, Prof Law @ Pace, 2004 (Thomas, 16 Pace Int’l L. R. 19 TARGETING THE FOREIGN BORN BY RACE AND NATIONALITY: COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE IN THE “WAR ON TERRORISM”?<br />
“times of emergency may justify… forward with the information we need to stop this threat”<br />
<br />
Terrorists are seeking nuclear weapons<br />
Bunn and Wier 2003 Matthew and Anthony, Harvard, Controlling Nuclear Warheads and Materials: A Report Card and Action Plan <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nti.org/e_research/cnwm/cnwm_chapter2.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.nti.org/e_research/cnwm/cnwm_chapter2.pdf</a><br />

“Immediately after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center… could signal a drastic erosion of the basic rights of all immigrants”<br />
<br />
Closed hearing alienate the immigrant community, decreasing their trust of law enforcement<br />

“Closing Hearings Alarms the Immigrant Community The immigrant community has been terrified by the DOJ… they need to blow the whistle on suspicious activity”<br />
<br />
Distrust of law enforcement will result in WMD attack<br />
Lindsay N. Kendrick JD Candidate at Howard Law, 2004 (“Alienable Rights and Unalienable Wrongs: Fighting the “War on Terror” through the Fourth Amendment,” Howard LJ (47 How. L.J. 989)<br />
“Optimally, law enforcement would not rely on racial profiling techniques…may prevent law enforcement officials from thwarting the next September 11”<br />
<br />
Closed hearing harm national security- they cover up abuses and mistakes- cause us to deport people that could provide vital information and allow foreign governments to manipulate the trial<br />
New York Bar Association 2004 (59 The Record 5 DANGEROUS DOCTRINE: THE ARRORNEY GENERAL’S UNFOUNDED CLAIM OF UNLIMITED AUTHORITY TO ARREST AND DEPORT ALIENS IN SECRET The Committee on Immigration and Nationality Law)<br />

Case-by-case nature of Supreme Court rulings means they can’t provide an overarching and specific policy for Guantanamo and as such do not send a signal that the US is complying with internation law. Congressional legislation provides the best blueprints for protections afforded to detainees and sends a strong international signal<br />

Hey man - I don't have any cites on me right now, but here is what we said and what they said.<br />
We said Terror DA and a CP to institute Common Article 3 protections for military tribunals and have Bush propose an international framework for making tribunals more open.<br />
The 2ar was Agent CP's bad - the impact calculus was real world education with the link being that there is no such thing as a policymaker who gets to decide will I act through the courts or congress or the executive. This is a bad model for education. The 2ar relied heavily on a Gordon Mitchell card about real world education and used a Solt card to prove that contextual ev is limitless.<br />
Their substance in the debate was INS deportation hearings in addition to all of the 1ac args for openness. The INS arg was that we deport innocents and this hurts intel gathering and increases resentment. Plan solves through the first amendment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does Northwestern think that GORDON Mitchell was writing cards in 1981? What an r-tards. It is Frank Mitchell.<br />

SOME AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE IS INEVITABLE IN THE WAR ON TERROR. A LESSER EVIL APROACH IS THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID EITHER A PYRRHIC VICTORY OR MEASURES THAT LEAVE US DEFENSLESS IN THE FACE OF EVIL. PERFECTIONISM IGNORES THE ETHICAL REALISM THAT IS A PREREQUISITE FOR SOUND PUBLIC POLICY.<br />
