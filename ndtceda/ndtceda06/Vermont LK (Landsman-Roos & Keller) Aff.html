NDT Round 1<br />
Vermont KL vs Mary Washington KS<br />
Judges: Button, Derrick, V. Guevarra<br />
<br />
<strong><u>NEW AFF: 1AC</u></strong><br />
<br />
Contention One – Alienation<br />
EPQ drew parallels between aliens and citizen aliens – it effectively denied due process for aliens<br />
Stumpf ’04 (Juliet – acting asst prof @ NYU school of law, UC Davis Law Review, lexis)<br />
“quirin’s second step toward…against the sovereign power of the government”<br />
<br />
And, regardless of the original meaning of the term and its many uses, the language of “alien” signifies a hostile threat to the body politic that must be contained or destroyed whether extraterrestrial or not<br />
Lipschuts 04 (Ronnie – Dept of Ptx at UC Santa Cruz, USCS website)<br />
“it might be helpful to recall that aliens are….dominant social norms and traditions”<br />
<br />
And, this desire to contain the alien could not be truer in the modern day – the government is convertly detaining ET at Camp X-ray in Guantanamo and Area 51<br />
Trainer 03 (Joseph, UFO Roundup)<br />
“If live aliens are captured, the process will probably follow…send an email to UFO roundup”<br />
<br />
Contention Two – Alien Invasion<br />
Current narratives of aliens as threats to humanity within the cultural status quo symptomatically represent larger structures of elitist, racist, and sexist domination. The extraterrestrial other stands in for the racial, sexual, social and cultural other. Nuanced and open approaches to contact, even if fictional are a vital antidote to the fictive replication of nativism and discrimination.<br />
LeGuin 75 (Ursula – sci fi writer, online)<br />
“the question involved here…alienated yourself”<br />
<br />
And the status quo scripts this encounter with otherness in fundamentally violent mannar, where the otherness of Aliens is always evil and all violence is justified in the cause of eradicating it. Our moral culpability for the state of the work is never examined and our responsibility for the violence of it goes unquestioned.<br />
Kakoudaki 02 (despina – asst prof of comparative literature @ Harvard)<br />
“in order to discuss the other…tracing their containment of difference”<br />
<br />
And, suck a dualist paradigm of self against otherness is the root cause of risks of violent extinction and ecosystemic breakdown. Transcending this worldview is a try or die situation.<br />
Mack 91 (John – prof of psychiatry @ Harvard med school)<br />
“we hear the expression…leaders and their followers”<br />
<br />
Only coming to terms with the extraterrestrial other can prevent extermination from martial and ecosystemic violence<br />
Zimmerman 02 (Michael – assistant prof of religious studies @ Stanford, “Encountering Alien Otherness”, pg 153-177)<br />
“obviously, alien abduction…integration a top priority”<br />
<br />
Text: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin 317 U.S. 1 (1942) on the grounds that the “enemy alien” classification violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<br />
<br />
Contention Three – Hospitality<br />
Extending rights to the alien other as if the other was a refugee rather than enemy is critical for an ethical politics<br />
Freitas 77 (Robert – sr research fellow @ institute for molecular manufacturing)<br />
<br />
Such an encounter with the gaze or face of the alien otherness creates an ontological shock with egoic subjectivity – such a move forces a higher level of consciousness not based on the self but the ethics for the other.<br />
Zimmerman 02 (Michael – assistant prof of religious studies @ Stanford, “Encountering Alien Otherness”, pg 153-177)<br />
“the binary projections of…identify so closely”<br />
<br />
This encounter with the face is a critical embrace of our vulnerability and an infinite responsibility to the Other – such an act is key to avert extermination of all that is foreign<br />
Burggrave 99 (roger, journal of social philosophy pg 29-45)<br />
“although emmanuel levinas…of justice and truth”<br />
<br />
Embracing our vulnerability and infinite responsibility towards the other in the only is the only true hospitality towards the alien other – our constitutional hospitality must be absolute in its refusal to make judgment, discriminate or demand reciprocity<br />
Kearney 99 (Richard, prof of philosophy at university college Dublin, “aliens and others: between girard and derrida”)<br />
“hospitality is only truly just…becoming-right of justice’”<br />
<br />
Unconditional hospitality demands action through the law, hospitality is self-defeating and impossible outside systems of law and sovereignty – transforming and improving the law is the only way to create hospitable ethics as a priority towards the refugee<br />
Derrdi 01 “on cosmopolitanism and forviveness”<br />
“it is this limitation…invitation to suspicion”<br />
<br />
Contention Four – Ethics over predictions –<br />
<br />
Predictions as a standard for evaluation fails – it results in disproportionate preference for the stutus quo, annihilates human agency, cements static structures, and is unable to anticipate unseen events – even if they win predictions work, that’s only because the current system has become so calcified<br />
Bleiker 00 (Popular dissent, human agency and global politics)<br />
“prediction, in particular…ensuing political practices”<br />
<br />
Predictions and obsessions with future politics justify violence – we become so obsessed with pure future politics that we are willing to commit violence to get there – in order to have true hospitality we mustn’t taint the ethics with futuristic scenarios – such will bring conservative politics into future sifiling any real chance at a new politics and unconditional ethics<br />
Renyolds 06 (jack, lecturer @ u of tasmaina)<br />
“arguably john rawles and …upon the incalculable”<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Planned Parenthood v. Casey, coupled with numerous Congressional and<br />
state statutes has effectively ended abortion access for low-income<br />
women – the shift of Court review standard from strict scrutiny to undue<br />
burden has led to a virtual reversal of Roe v. Wade, especially for<br />
women living in poverty<br />
<br />
*Lichtman ‘3* [Julia (J.D. Candidate, Georgetown University Law Center);<br />
“Restrictive State Abortion Laws: Today's Most Powerful Conscience<br />
Clause”; Georgetown Journal on Poverty Law &amp; Policy; 10 Geo. J. Poverty<br />
Law &amp; Pol'y 345; l/n <em>nick]<br />
No sooner had the …a pregnancy to term.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – the Myth of the Welfare Queen<br />
<br />
Casey’s elimination of strict scrutiny and strengthening of the state’s<br />
interest has streamlines the creation financial obstacles such as<br />
waiting periods which impose huge structural barriers to poor women. The<br />
court aligned reproductive freedom with white, middle-class wives while<br />
excluding “welfare moms” from the institutionalized discourse of<br />
privacy. These poor women are both constructed as “bad mothers” and<br />
“poor deciders” making it seem less morally reprehensible and the proper<br />
political choice to sterilize them. The lack of safeguards for<br />
reproductive rights for the “welfare mother” makes racist sterilization<br />
and eugenics inevitable<br />
<br />
*Horsburgh ’96* [Beverly (Associate Professor of Law, St. Thomas<br />
University School of Law); “Schrodinger's Cat, Eugenics, and the<br />
Compulsory Sterilization of Welfare Mothers: Deconstructing an Old/New<br />

eugenic practices.<br />
<br />
Additionally the lack of funding for abortion for poor women and<br />

*Blake ’96* [Meredith (Research Scholar, Center for the Study of Women,<br />
UCLA); “Welfare and Coerced Contraception: Morality Implications of<br />
State Sponsored Reproductive Control”; Brandeis Law Journal; 34 U. of<br />

<br />
<br />
And poor, single, “lazy”, “stupid”, “promiscuous”, Black, “welfare<br />
queen” women with children have become the symbol for what mainstream<br />
society deems as what is wrong with American society. The more a women’s<br />
right to determine her reproductive freedom is subordinated to state<br />
interest the less safeguards against sterilization exist – the lack of<br />
popular sympathy and legality of sterilization mean poor Black women are<br />
powerless to stop eugenic encroachments<br />
*Horsburgh ’96* [Beverly (Associate Professor of Law, St. Thomas<br />
University School of Law); “Schrodinger's Cat, Eugenics, and the<br />
Compulsory Sterilization of Welfare Mothers: Deconstructing an Old/New<br />

<br />
<ul><li>*</li></ul><br />
*The myth of inferiority and the government’s control over the rights of<br />
procreation for women of color invests the power to sterilize with the<br />
government – the power to sterilize allows discrimination against<br />
particular individuals and races – justifying oppressive treatment and<br />
denying human dignity – the end result of such sterilization will be<br />
genocidal implication in whole races will wither and disappear*<br />
*Roberts ’91* [Dorothy E. (Associate Professor, Rutgers University<br />
School of Law); “Punishing Drug Addicts Who Have Babies: Women of Color,<br />
Equality, and the Right of Privacy”; Harvard Law Review; 104 Harv. L.<br />

Skinner rested on grounds that linked …subject to the highest scrutiny.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Three is Judicial Deference<br />
<br />
The courts blind adherence to legalism and deference to state and local<br />
legislative decisions to deny funding to poor individuals who lack the<br />
resources to receive an abortion is linked to the stigmatization, racism<br />
and cycles of poverty that are entrenched by judicial choices<br />
*Daly ’95* [Erin (Assistant Professor, Widener University School of<br />
Law); “RECONSIDERING ABORTION LAW: LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND THE NEW<br />

<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s reluctance to exercise heightened judicial scrutiny<br />
by preferring a rational basis review in issues that disproportionately<br />
impact the poor signals broad deference to the legislative branches of<br />
government. The lack of judicial review of welfare restrictions has<br />
resulted in a virtual free fire zone on the rights of poor people<br />
leading to scapegoating and stigmatization<br />

The United States Supreme Court should overrule the undue burden test<br />
articulated in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey<br />
[505 U.S. 833 (1992)] by ruling that strict scrutiny must be applied to<br />
any government burden placed on an individual’s fundamental right to<br />
privacy in seeking an abortion.<br />

<br />
The Supreme Court should strike down the undue burden standard in Casey<br />
and return to the strict scrutiny standard in Roe – strict scrutiny<br />
prevents manipulation by the state which violates<br />
constitutionally-protected abortion rights. Only a return to this<br />
framework can protect abortion rights for poor and minority women.<br />

<br />
Hurricane Katrina 1AC<br />
[During the 1AC we play on a projector 9 minutes of images of New Orleans and the people of New Orleans during and after Hurricane Katrina]<br />
Emmett Till's body arrived home in …site and space &quot;where democracy has lost its claims&quot; (2005, 122, 124).<br />
As Henry Giroux points out the images of the living dead in New Orleans marks a form of racism distinct from that of the age of Emmett Till. No longer does white supremacy reveal itself in vengeance killings or terrorizing attacks by the KKK but rather is now a less overt from of white racism. The bodies of the Katrina victims illuminated a new kind of racism that has originated not based on intentional racism but rather on the alleged unintentional racism that has come with the withering of democracy and a politics willing to render segments of its population disposable.<br />
This shift in the way structural racism originates can be attributed to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Milliken v. Bradley ­ the Supreme Court has used the distinction between de jure and de facto segregation to limit the scope of desegregation remedies. The Supreme Court held in Milliken that desegregation remedies could only occur if there was intentional discrimination ­ this functionally withdrew all Supreme Court involvement in the desegregation process and doomed cities which were rapidly segregating despite non-intentional influences<br />
Preston Cary Green III elaborates in 1999 [University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Spring 99, 68 Journal of Negro Education 2, JSTOR nick]<br />
Since the Keyes decision, the Supreme Court … proper use of the federal judiciary’s remedial power.<br />
The intent standard expressed in Milliken creates a colorblind criterion within racial justice ­ it has led to the projection of an imagery of fairness which has largely rendered invisible the current enduring reality of race within the United States. The intent requirement effectively has become the modern grandchild of Plessy ­ it denies, evades and disengages race and the remedies for it ­ Donald Lively and Stephen Plass explain in 1991<br />

Modern formulations of discriminatory … is distinguished from its analytical past more by rhetoric than actual result.<br />
The rendering invisible of the poor, elderly, infirm, and criminalized populations removed from the suburbs hides the decaying schools and rundown neighborhoods of the contemporary inner city since Milliken ­ these people have become the waste product of the American dream ­ they are the living dead in a social state that does not care about them ­ it is the commitment to colorblind ideology that reinforces this invisibility<br />
Katrina, however, momentarily illuminated the disposability of populations within the inner city ­ once visible these images became unbearable for the nation’s elite. In response the Bush Administration and neoliberalism created an anti-spectacle ­ they bombarded us with images of everything but race and the destruction of Katrina ­ Bush appears on TV telling Brownie he’s doing a good job while simultaneously restricting the media from going on rescue boats. Ironically the response to Katrina was to end all images an initiate, through colorblindness, a national blackout ­ only continuing the racist nature of the current configuration of democracy and easing the disposal or sacrifice of portions of the population deemed dangerous or irrelevant ­ Giroux writes,<br />

According to Franz Hinkelammert, the West has … enough to pay the health costs of the world's poorest countries for four years.<br />

To study racism is to study walls. We have looked at barriers … For the sake of the world and ourselves, we dare not allow it to continue.<br />
Hence we believe that the United States Supreme Court should rule that intent is not a pre-requisite to find segregation unconstitutional.<br />
