We control uniqueness – Bryant and powell say Milliken was an ideological ruling based on the manipulation of racial reailty by ignoring and refusing data.<br />
Lively &amp; Plass 19<strong>91</strong> 40 Am. U.L. Rev. 1307 SUMMER<br />
“While professing fealty to the importance of education and equal opportunity … may manipulate it for the majority’s benefit.”<br />
Data is inevitable – both of us could have been manipulate or lied to, but the odds are much higher that you were manipulated than we were – this is our strong data versus weak data claims – strong data is much better at constraining ideology to prevent data manipulation that your data.<br />
Glenn Loury 2000, “Social Exclusion and Ethnic Groups: The Challenge to Economics: page 227-8<br />
“That “good science” might prove to be an antidote to group hatred… the structure of scientific revolutions.”<br />
We’ll isolate 3 warrants<br />
<ol><li>Sample size – their data assumes a very small sample size of a few casual inferences which are false causation because they ignore a whole host of other facts and situations – this is our Dillon example – nazi calculated to.. doesn’t mean nobody can calculate</li><li>Explicit citation – explicitly citing where your studies come from prevents the government from racism.</li></ol><br />
Cooption DA – their refusal to demand rigorous data sets is debilitating to material change.<br />

“First, I want to declare that I do not see the feedback… chain that perpetuates racial inequality over time.”<br />
Rejecting our political advocacy for the alternatives micro strategy of discursive disruption leaves us powerless to fight the forces of domination and ensures a continuation of mass inequality.<br />
Cloud, Prof of Communication Studies @ Texas, December 2006, Communication and Critical/Cultural studies<br />
“poststructuralist theory answers the question of instrumentality… and invulenerable at the macroscopic level.”<br />
We must create a public discourse linking housing and school segregation from which this legal system can draw from creating actual material change 0 the problem in society isn’t “mass politics” but a “lack of politics” – people maintain institutions of white privilege by distancting themselves outside of the law and outside of social struggle.<br />

The United States Supreme Court should hold that the social science evidence submitted to the supreme court’s record that residential segregation constitutes an inter-district violation proves a basis for inter-district remedies for school desegregation.<br />

Contention One – Milliken<br />
The closest thing Milliken has to a holding says that inter-district remedies require an inter-district violation. Detroit suburbs were held not responsible for inner-city de-jure school segregation<br />
Burger, majority opinion, 1974<br />
[Chief Justice, U.S. Supreme Court MILLIKEN v. BRADLEY, 418 U.S. 717 (1974) No. 73-434. Decided July 25, 1974] [ct] [<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=418&amp;invol=717" rel="nofollow">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com /scripts/getcase.pl?court=US &amp;vol=418&amp;invol=717</a>]<br />
Petitioners have urged that … been delayed since 1970.<br />
Suburbs were not held responsible for school segregation because the court found them innocent of school segregation – this happened only because the court explicitly refused to consider quantitative data proving significant de jure discrimination by suburbs in the housing market<br />

D. The Milliken Betrayal … discriminated in numerous respects.<br />
Contention Two – American Apartheid<br />
Residential and housing segregation is only getting worse – each year of inaction because they are inherently intertwined and self-perpetuating<br />
Ong &amp; Rickles 04<br />

Two of the most … in each metropolitan area.<br />
Residential segregation is the most important determinant of one’s life chances – discrimination in the housing market spills over to poison all race relations because segregation limits social networks and prevents the acquisition of property wealth<br />

Contention Four – Framework<br />
We offer a unique method of judging that deals with an endemic problem: most of what is said in debates has nothing to do with reality. Policy debaters read disads with incredulous internal links that laughably suppose every action ends the world. The result is that the everyday oppression suffered by the marginalized populations gets ignored in favor of a myopic focus on nuclear war. Kritik debaters replace instrumentally effective action with ideological mystification when they pretend that simply voting negative or rethinking our assumptions will cause the world to magically improve. The effect has been to obscure the material existence of devastated populations and to perpetuate an ideology of resignation to existing social relations disguised as kritik and resistance.<br />
Adopting a standpoint based definition of reality centered in empirically provable lived experiences is the only way to break out of the illusory fantasies of the left and the hysterical threat mongering of the right<br />

This illusory world resembles … of structuralism and relativism.<br />
Our evaluative framework has two components<br />
First – data<br />
You should evaluate competing arguments under the following evaluative hierarchies:<br />
A claim should be given near zero probability<br />
A claim plus a warrant should be also given near zero probability – the difference between them should be infinitesimal<br />
A claim plus a warrant with weak data to support it is a little better, but still should be given near zero probability<br />
Only a claim plus a warrant with strong data should be given a default 100% probability. Strong data requires the following<br />
1) A sample size greater than casual analysis<br />
2) Where the data set comes from and who conducted the research<br />
3) Models – either regression or other models supporting empirical research<br />
And<br />
Policy Analysis requires strong data to maintain any resemblance to reality – specifically, data is necessary to prove the existence of mass inequality necessary to overcome traditional cognitative dissonance<br />

When the Thernstroms argue … each of these concerns.<br />
When weighing impacts and deciding between the alternative and the plan – you should adopt the standpoint of a minority individual living in the conditions of material deprivation described above – only through this standpoint of epistemology can one fairly decide debates – pleas by the negative to “judge normally” are really just demands for a color-blind paradigm responsible for the pain, suffering, and death of millions of people of color<br />
