AT: FAITH Critique<br />
Your claims of morality and political calculations construct the universal notions of evil only perpetuate the myth of the monster, we must realize that our image is inseparable from the gas chamber, your attempts to believe in the innocent victim only secure the inevitable recurrence of horror.<br />
Surya ’02 (Michel, Georges Bataille an Intellectual biography, p. 358-60]<br />
“Until he saw that war had become inevitable… nothing other than the inevitable reappearance of the horror.”<br />
Sexual Eroticism reorients life from a work economy to one based upon expenditure and waste –<br />
Bataille ’62 (Georges, Death and Sexuality: A study of Eroticism and the Taboo, p. 170-71)<br />
“The very extravagance of his affirmations… The truth of eroticism is treason.”<br />
The negative team is grounded in a fear of Life, upholding weak nihilism, we must live dangerously in order to experience true ecstasy.<br />
Braman ’04 (Jorn, The Educating Rit Workbook, Nietzsche the Dark Side of Things, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://faculty.frostburg.edu/phil/forum/Nietzsche.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://faculty.frostburg.edu /phil/forum/Nietzsche.htm__</a> )<br />

Non-unique – futurism makes extermination both possible and inevitable, only a radical break has a risk of avoiding violence.<br />
Chow, prof of humanities at Brown, 2002<br />
[Rey, <u>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Campitalism</u>, page 7]<br />
“The ascendancy of life over death, naturally, has… the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population” (137).<br />
Increase in abortions in the future is a good thing, as opposed to relying upon the guilt of womyn our re-envisioned Christianity, we should see the waste of fetus’s in a positive luxury.<br />
Seery ’01 (John, “Moral Perfectionism and Abortion Politics,” <em>Polity</em> Vol. 33 Issue: 3. p345<br />
“In the near future, abortions will likely increase… are tending toward the same goals anyway.”<br />
The aff’s positioning of powerful system of oppression to which the powerless objects on control must respond is analogous to the Aryan sullying of the Judeo ethics that was a necessary prerequisite to the Holocaust – In other words, Nietzsche eats babies args are not unique and link turned – genocides and other atrocities are up now because of ethics and the reason is that ethical systems are incompatible – to erect one, we must eradicate the other. The impact is genocide – their offense is not unique.<br />

UCO CH Pre Shirley<br />
Our affirmative does not read evidence per se. We play (in the Nietzschean sense) with the topic and with the star-spangled by Francis Scott Key. We distort and change the lyrics and add poetry of our own into it. There are selections of the lyrics in the 1AC come from Immortal Technique, and Sage Francis. We also sample random parts from Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus, in the very first pages of the book when we talk about desiring machines as well as examining transcendence. We also take parts of Nietzsche’s Thus spoke Zarathustra when playing with the ideas of life, love, authority, and ressentiment. We have a plan text which says: The United States Supreme Court should overrule ex parte Quirin.<br />
When faced with the question of why we should overrule said case we say because it is fucking sweet.<br />
<br />
<strong>Central Oklahoma</strong> <strong>CH (Casey &amp; Henry)</strong><br />
<strong>QUIRIN</strong><br />
<br />
Quirin is grounded in the herd mentality, in which the masses desire their own repression based on the fear of terrorism and national security. However this fascism is ignored by the public because they are grounded in the ressentiment that “terrorists” are evil and thus Americans are good. We however argue that this situation smells bad, and that we want a breath of fresh air.<br />
Deleuze and Guattari in ’72 (Gilles, and Felix, Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, p. XVI-II)<br />
<br />
Specifically the talking heads love to bombard us with the images of the sadistic pornography of the US military torturing the “non-American” prisoners. The security apparatus uses these images to scare the citizens into obeying without question the policies of the state apparatus. But the images serve another purpose, marking bodies designating them as subjected groups, “others” in which to be destroyed, while at the same time aiding in the endocolonization of the bodies which are marked “American.” The state then uses the law as a tool in which, the “Terrorist” body is marked as being an illegal enemy combatant, being outside the law. It is through this that ex parte quirin allows the US to turn the world into one giant panopticon.<br />
McClintock ’04 (Scott, Antioch university, Los Angeles, “The Penal Colony: Inscription of the subject in literature and Law, and Detainees as Legal Non-person at camp x-ray, Comparative Literature Studies 41.1 (2004) 153-167<em>avery)</em><br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1(1942). People will ask us why we overrule this decision; our answer is that it is fucking sweet.<br />
<br />
It is time to take a breath of fresh air, politics is an experiment. It is time to abandon the subjected groups based on reactionary politics, and instead “roll the dice.” We are going on a strange journey and there will be no transcendence over us for comfort. We embrace the insecurity of not being able to understand what will ever happen. We are a constant becoming-revolutionary.<br />
May ’05 (Todd, Gilles Deleuze, p. 148-153)<br />
<br />
Finally we are the Pink Panther, living life like a rhizome, because for the nomad the adventure is in the journey and not the destination.<br />
Deleuze and Guattari ’87 ( A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, p.24-25)<br />

<em><strong>The story of lillith affirmative</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em><strong>This affirmative retells the story of lillith (for those of you uncultured about biblical text, Lillith is the woman prior to Eve. She was banished from the garden because she insisted that she should be able to have sex with adam while on top while insisting on notions of equality between man, woman, and nature in general)</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em><strong>We claim that this religious judeo-christian worldview has infiltrated society to this day whether it be the missionary position or the prohibition on incest. Morrison reified this. 1st – the VAWA itself was an establishment of male superiority in that it attempted to protect the weak feminine other from the dangerous outside. 2nd – The supreme court’s initial ruling wasn’t because of thesubordinating position of the VAWA’s paternalistic attitude but rather because it interfered with other males abilities to have commerce set in a particular way.</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em><strong>Thus plan: The united states supreme court should overrule U.S. vs. Morrison, because said law did not realize that God is dead.</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em><strong>The following part of the 1ac is the poem from Thus Spake Zarathustra from the Madman who proclaimed god’s death. The interpretation comes from Jorn Braman in 2004 “Nietzsche the dark side of things” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://faculty.frostburg.edu/phil/forum/nietzsche.htm" rel="nofollow">http://faculty.frostburg.edu/phil/forum/nietzsche.htm</a></strong></em><strong><em><br />
<br />
The 1ac ends with the concept of the evangel – a person who believes in god but not for reward or punishment but as a practice of life<br />
<br />
<u>Batailles Sacrifice affirmative</u><br />
<br />
Observation one: solar repression –<br />
Solar energy is accumulated infinitely. We must move from traditional moral claims and instead embrace the useless, nonproductive, violent outpourings of energy <u>Kenneth Itzkowitz in 99</u> “to witness spectacles of pain: the hypermorality of georges batailles” “it would be…end, are inevitable”<br />
<br />
Womyn’s sexuality is one such moral issue which is perpetuated under the ieology that sex is sinful, and then seeks to label womyn as irrational justifying control over their bodies <u>Carlin Meyer in 94</u> [Sex, sin, and womens liberation: against porn suppression. Tex. L. Review. 1097 “Western culture remains…socially sanctioned parameters”<br />
<br />
The sexual is political, I which a womyn is tied to reproduction, allowing for the state to regulate a womyn’s body to the work economy of production<br />
<u>Georges Batailles in 1962</u> [Death and Sensuality: a study of eroticism and the taboo, p. 212 “I believe indeed…women now signify”<br />
<br />
The supreme court’s decision in Planned parenthood vs. casey helps to further regulate a womyn’s body to the work economy, by restricting her ability to obtain an abortion, creating the assumption that the state has a vested interest in promoting life<br />
Julie Mertus in 1993 [beyondthe solitary self: voice, community and reproductive freedom. Columbia journal of gener and law 92-93 “the most recent word from the …reproductive freedom remains”<br />
<br />
Plan: the United States Supreme court should overrule its decision in planned parenthood of southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, ruling that the state has no compelling interest in promoting unborn life.<br />
<br />
Observation 2: the solar abortion<br />
We use our decision to reorient Christianity to advocate abortion, offering the unborn as a sacrifice to god. This offers the child as the best gift of all pure death. This leads to a move away from the realm of reproduction <u>John Seery in 2001</u> [Moral perfectionism and abortion politics polity, volume 33 issue 3 in 2001 page 345 “Bataille doesn’t address abortion explicitly…deferred until armageddom”<br />
<br />
We challenge patriarchy by challenging the idea of the purpose of a womyn’s body. It is no longer to be traded from man to man but to become the givers of the most beautiful gift of all: death. Even if they win we increase abortion this can only be viewed as a good thing in order to stave off the Christian apocalypse <u>seery 01</u> “what extra benefit…to be “pro-abortion.””<br />
<br />
Observation 3: the big “o”<br />
Some of us know that if you aren’t getting any and you don’t masturbate for a few days, that you will fall asleep and wake up from a wet dream in a pool of your own ejaculate. The world works in the exact same way, only so much excess energy reaches its limits. War and all of its destruction is a product of the work economy refusing to uselessly expend all of its energy <u>Georges Batailles 1997</u> The Batailles reader, pg. 185-187 “Incomprehension does not…who changes a tyre”<br />
<br />
Only the affirmative has a lot of sex, or sometimes we masturbate with a sock puppet on our left hands, this unshackling of erotica from reproduction, allows for us to access the transgressive act of uselessly squandering our resources for pleasure allowing us a glimpse at death and avoiding the conflicts of war <u>this is Jason Deboer in 2002</u> [Eschatology and orgasm, online “once removed from the…death as waste.”<br />
<br />
Observation 4: dead baby jokes<br />
Our sacrifice of the unborn to death, allows for the comedic dramatization, which allows for us to become sovereign as we stare death in tehf ace, allowing for us to embrace the beauty which it offers, creating the only life truly worth living <u>Irwin in 2002</u> [Death and sensuality a study of eroticism and taboo pg 163-165 “Bataille was convinced…but without killing”<br />
<br />
At this point you may be pondering just exactly what the fuck we are doing. Our response to this is “not a damn thing”, we want to be as useless and unproductive as possible, rejecting all forms of authority, living only on our passions, for this is what allows us to engage in an askesis of excess which solves for the imposing of violence upon others, <u>Irwin in 02</u> pg 166-7 “challenging the tyranny…our fellow beings”</strong></em>
