<strong>New 1AC</strong><br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), by ruling that Roe v. Wade is no longer good law on the grounds that there is no constitutional protection of a right to abortion. We’ll clarify.<br />
Observation One – Rome is Burning<br />
Casey’s apparent victory deters the growth of the pro-choice movement allowing conservative forces to slowly and covertly erode the right to choose.<br />
Strossen &amp; Collins, 99 , “The future of an illusion: reconstituting planneg parenthood v. casey” winter 1999<br />
To return…Rome burns.”<br />
This conservatism is not contained in domestic politics – the Right’s gradual tactics are lulling the pro-choice movement to sleep, opening the door for a global assault on reproductive freedom.<br />
Ernst, Katzive, and Smock 2004<br />
(“Symposium: the legacy of roe: the constitution, reproductive rights, and feminism: the global pattern of u.s. initiatives curtailing women’s reproductive rights: a perspective on the increasingly anti-choice mosaic” university of Pennsylvania journal of constitutional law, a pril 6 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 752, lexis<br />
Roe was…women.”<br />
The US anti-abortion movement controls the direction of global agenda – as their power grows it will further choke off support for reproductive rights.<br />
Political Environments 2006 (“International Anti-Abortion research projects: preliminary report,” committee on women, population and the environment, july 18, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cwpe.org/resources/healthrepro/antiabortion1" rel="nofollow">__http://www.cwpe.org/resources /healthrepro/antiabortion1__</a>)<br />
The U.S….levels.<br />
The growing strength of the pro-life movement prevents a shift to a rights based approach to reproductive health.<br />
Ernst, Katzive, and Smock 2004<br />
Advocates…powers.<br />
This lack of reproductive choice has several impacts:<br />
<ol><li>Women’s Health – Unsafe abortion kills thousands of women a year – information and access is vital to preventing a pandemic of women’s deaths.</li></ol>Grimes 2006 (David A., “Unsafe Abortion: the preventable pandemic” sexual and reproductive health 4, 11/1/06, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.svss-uspda.ch/pdf/lancet-unsafe+abortion.pdf" rel="nofollow">__www.svss-uspda.ch/pdf/lancet -unsafe%20abortion.pdf__</a><br />
Ending…women.<br />
<ol><li>Coercion – the result of this conservatism is an approach to family planning that espouses coercion, racism and eugenics – the effects are far reaching and devastating.</li></ol>Bandarage, 2006 (Asoka, “new and improved population control policy, committee on women, population and the environment, political environments, july 15, 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cwpe.org/node/71" rel="nofollow">__http://cwpe.org/node/71__</a>)<br />
The new…liberation.<br />
Coercive family planning schemes are doomed to failure – only incorporating a rights based approach to abortion can prevent extinction. E 98 (the environmental magazine, baby boom: American anti-abortion politics blocks family planning funding around the world, nov/dec, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.emagazine.com/view/?822" rel="nofollow">__http://www.emagazine.com/view/ ?822__</a>)<br />
“What…Waak.<br />
<ol><li>Poverty – Denial of reproductive rights drives millions of women into poverty – empowering control over women’s fertility is vital to ending this cycle.</li></ol>Marie Stopes Intl, 2005 (“Sexual and reproductive health rights and poverty”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pgpd.asn.au/documents/PGPD%20submissions/MSIPovertySubmission.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.pgpd.asn.au/documents/PGPD %20submissions/MSIPovertySubmis sion.pdf</a>)<br />
Many…poverty.<br />
Poverty is the worst form of structural violence and more devastating than a thermonuclear war<br />
Abu-Jamal, 98 (Mumia, A quiet and deadly violence 9/19, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.flashpoints.net/mQuietDeadlyViolence.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.flashpoints.net /mQuietDeadlyViolence.html__</a>)<br />
We live…to it.<br />
Observation Two: Bare Branches –<br />
Control over childbearing will determine the future of global demographics. While fertility decreases in the West, Asian countries are experiencing population growth – reproductive freedom will be the watch word in preventing 20th century totalitarianism.<br />
Purdy, 2006, “The New Biopolitics” Democracy: A Journal of Ideas, July 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?sec=Documents&amp;pg=article&amp;DocID=3141&amp;T2=Article" rel="nofollow">__http://www.newamerica.net /index.cfm?sec=Documents&amp;pg =article&amp;DocID=3141&amp;T2=Article__</a><br />
Will globalization…benefit.<br />
Additionally, promoting a global focus on reproductive rights is vital to check sex ratio disparities in Asia.<br />
Purdy 6<br />
One element…freer.<br />
And, Asia in particular will be the center of an unprecedented gap in sex ratios – the prospects for regional peace will develop in lockstep with expanse of the gender gap.<br />
Hudson and Boer, 2004<br />
(Valerie M., “Is our security threatened by too many men?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1413&amp;fuseaction=topics.event_summary&amp;event_id=86385" rel="nofollow">__http://www.wilsoncenter.org /index.cfm?topic_id=1413 &amp;fuseaction=topics.event _summary&amp;event_id=86385__</a>)<br />
Mission Women…before.<br />
Finally, the result of this instability nuclear conflict.<br />
Kennedy 2000 (paul, The Daily Yamiuri, Jan 10)<br />
Over…region.<br />
Observation 3 – Solvency<br />
Overturning Roe will energize the pro-choice movement and ensures women’s core rights are protected.<br />

*The Privacy 1AC is on the Wake wiki. All solvency and add-ons are there as well.<br />
<br />
*The 13th amendment 1AC is the same, save for this solvency evidence:<br />
Affirming abortion as a fundamental right under the 13th amendment creates a binding protection of Roe's precedent – all other grounds fail to protect abortion rights from fetal personhood claims<br />
Koppelman, 90<br />
[Andrew, A.B., University of Chicago, 1979; M.A., Political Science, Yale University, 1986; J.D., Yale University, 1989; Ph.D. expected, Political Science, Yale University, 1991, Winter, 84 Nw. U.L. Rev. 480]<br />
Even many of Roe's friends want to rewrite it... to secure Roe's validity as a binding precedent.<br />
<br />
*The Informed Consent 1AC is the third version of our 1AC:<br />
<br />
Observation One: Government Knows Best<br />
<br />
In Planned Parenthood v. Casey the Supreme Court upheld state provisions requiring women seeking abortions to receive informed consent, upholding doctrines intended to create uncertainty and persuade women against receiving an abortion<br />
Berg, Visiting Assistant Professor at CUNY Law School, 94<br />
[Paula, &quot;TOWARD A FIRST AMENDMENT THEORY OF DOCTOR-PATIENT DISCOURSE AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNBIASED MEDICAL ADVICE,&quot; Boston University Law Review, March, 74 B.U.L. Rev. 201, p. Lexis]<br />
The Supreme Court plurality ...than necessary to serve that interest.&quot; 98<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Eugenics<br />
<br />
Informed consent portrays women as irrational and maintains a history of exclusion – it tells women that the fetus is a life and portrays any right of choice as murder<br />
Abrams, Associate Professor of Law, Northwestern School of Law of Lewis &amp; Clark College , 95<br />
[Paula, &quot;The Tradition of Reproduction,&quot; Arizona Law Review, Summer, 37 Ariz. L. Rev. 453]<br />
Casey represents a significant emergence... tradition becomes a validator of past inequities.<br />
<br />
This approach creates two fundamental problems. The first is futurism. The protection of future life becomes a social obligation, beginning a death drive against anyone who question's the states vision of the reproductive order.<br />
Edelman, Professor of English at Tufts University, 04<br />
[Lee, No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive, p. 2-3]<br />
But what helped him most in ... such resistance from every social structure.<br />
<br />
This death drive is manifest in the most extreme forms of violence, hiding murder behind the cloak of protection of the social order<br />
Edelman, Professor of English at Tufts University, 04<br />
[Lee, No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive, p. 115-117]<br />
On October 12, 1998—... negative force that sinthomosexuality names.<br />
<br />
The second problem is state control of the body. The reproductive regulations upheld by Casey cede control of life to the state – court action is the only way to limit this government quest<br />
Abrams, Associate Professor of Law, Northwestern School of Law of Lewis &amp; Clark College , 95<br />
[Paula, &quot;The Tradition of Reproduction,&quot; Arizona Law Review, Summer, 37 Ariz. L. Rev. 453]<br />
In Roe v. Wade, the plaintiffs sought... the cultural judgment that &quot;biology is destiny.&quot;<br />
<br />
This inscription within biopolitics is at the heart of violence allowing every 'citizen' to be devalued and eliminated in the name of sovereign management.<br />
Agamben 98<br />
(Giorgio – Univ. Verona Philosophy professor, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, Stanford UP, p. 139-140)<br />
&lt;3.3. It is not our intention here... biological body of every living being .&gt; &lt;139-140&gt;<br />
<br />
Individualizing and identity forming methods of governance are the new predominant forms of power. The production and administration of life lead to the maneuvering of subjects in ways that culminate in violence, war, and genocide.<br />
Foucault '78<br />
(Michel – late philosopher, History of Sexuality An Introduction Vol. 1, Vintage Books, p. 135-137)<br />
For a long time, one of the characteristic privileges... the large-scale phenomena of population.<br />
<br />
The 1AC is a starting point for social change – magnifying discrimination in the context of social choice is crucial to highlighting democracy's demise in the private sphere<br />
Giroux, McMaster University in the English and Cultural Studies Department, 2k6<br />
[Henry A. College Literature 33.3, &quot;Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability,&quot; p. 186-188]<br />
Underneath neoliberalism's corporate ethic ...age of neoliberal global capitalism.&gt; &lt;186-188&gt;<br />
<br />
Doctor-patient privilege must be protected by the first amendment – the alternative is unlimited government eugenics<br />
Berg, Visiting Assistant Professor at CUNY Law School, 94<br />
[Paula, &quot;TOWARD A FIRST AMENDMENT THEORY OF DOCTOR-PATIENT DISCOURSE AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNBIASED MEDICAL ADVICE,&quot; Boston University Law Review, March, 74 B.U.L. Rev. 201, p. Lexis]<br />
Recent history confirms that basic democratic and humanitarian values... in accordance with government preferences.<br />
<br />
Plan<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey by ruling that abortion regulations requiring informed consent are unconstitutional on the grounds that the regulations violate the first amendment protection of doctor-patient discourse.<br />
<br />
Observation Three: Open Communication<br />
First amendment protection of doctor-patient discourse would render informed consent provisions unconstitutional<br />
Berg, Visiting Assistant Professor at CUNY Law School, 94<br />
[Paula, &quot;TOWARD A FIRST AMENDMENT THEORY OF DOCTOR-PATIENT DISCOURSE AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNBIASED MEDICAL ADVICE,&quot; Boston University Law Review, March, 74 B.U.L. Rev. 201, p. Lexis]<br />
The practice of medicine invariably reflects and reinforces a culture's dominant ideology.... dogma upon medical choices.<br />
<br />
The Casey decision's first amendment analysis is flawed – the grounds for first amendment protection necessitate precedented constitutional protection<br />
Berg, Visiting Assistant Professor at CUNY Law School, 94<br />
[Paula, &quot;TOWARD A FIRST AMENDMENT THEORY OF DOCTOR-PATIENT DISCOURSE AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNBIASED MEDICAL ADVICE,&quot; Boston University Law Review, March, 74 B.U.L. Rev. 201, p. Lexis]<br />
The various opinions in Rust and Casey reveal ...power and competence needed to cure them.<br />
<br />
Upholding first amendment values is crucial to open communication and freedom from political suppression – their alternative is only possible in a world of the plan<br />
Berg, Visiting Assistant Professor at CUNY Law School, 94<br />
[Paula, &quot;TOWARD A FIRST AMENDMENT THEORY OF DOCTOR-PATIENT DISCOURSE AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNBIASED MEDICAL ADVICE,&quot; Boston University Law Review, March, 74 B.U.L. Rev. 201, p. Lexis]<br />
The Supreme Court has never held ... individual self-expression 156 and fulfillment, 157 and the &quot;exposition of ideas.&quot; 158 [*233]<br />
<br />
Reproductive rights and legal protections are crucial to equality in the public sphere – the alternative guarantees oppression<br />
Reilly, Associate Dean and Professor of Law, The University of Akron School of Law, 95<br />
[Elizabeth, &quot;The Rhetoric of Disrespect: Uncovering the Faulty Premises Infecting Reproductive Rights,&quot; The American University Journal of Gender &amp; the Law, Fall, 5 Am. U. J. Gender &amp; Law 147]
