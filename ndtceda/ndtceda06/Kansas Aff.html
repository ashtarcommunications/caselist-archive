MILLIKEN<br />
<br />
Plan: the United States Supreme Court should overrule the Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974) decision on the grounds that de jure or de facto segregation in public education is evidence of racism. We can clarify.<br />
<br />
Our justification is a criticism of white innocence or race neutrality in equity jurisprudence. In Brown, the Supreme Court formaly ended segregation, finding separate to be inherently unequal. we no longer live in a world of legal, de jure segreation. Unfortunately, Brown was silent on the new, covert racism - the rhetoric of race neutrality. In 1974, about two decades after Brown, the Supreme Court reasoned in Milliken that whites no longer bear responsibility for the new form of separate and unequal education, de facto segregation. This sent a stigmatic and racist message of inferiority that abandoned the redemptive vision of Brown. We must speak of the informal, de facto racism that permeates society.<br />
ROSS, 96<br />
Thomas, U. of Pittsburgh Law, Just Stories: How Law Embodies Racism and Bias, pg. 37-43<br />
<br />
The Milliken decision reinforces race neutral equity jurisprudence. This is a manifestation of the unconscious that allows racial identification and subjugation under a neutral guise. We must abandon the conscoius belief that the world is equal and tap into this repressed racism to achieve redemptive equality.<br />
ROSS, 96<br />
Thomas, . of Pittsburgh Law, Just Stories: How Law Embodies Racism and Bias, pg. 49-56<br />
<br />
Law exists in its justifications. Previously, the Supreme Court assumed a narrow, negative form of equality. In Milliken, this application of equal protection formed a narrative of limited legal doctrine. The Supreme Court should use alternate narratives or justifications for understanding racism and race neutral law. We should attack the logic of precedence.<br />
ROSS, 96<br />
Thomas, . of Pittsburgh Law, Just Stories: How Law Embodies Racism and Bias, pg. 138-140<br />
<br />
We should not despair abou the poewr of law - justice and change lies in criticism of law's justifications - nothing is fixed and we must act despite our solvency<br />
ROSS, 96<br />
Thomas, . of Pittsburgh Law, Just Stories: How Law Embodies Racism and Bias, pg. 142-143<br />
<br />
We must assume a redemptive vision of low that promotes absolute racial equality. This vision is of schools not separated by skin color or income divisions. This law is formed by the narratives of its justificaiton. Our discourse if fundamental to our advocacy.<br />

<br />
The rhetoric of war has been written into law with Quirin with the term &quot;unlawful or enemy&quot; combatant and creates a sovereign power maintaining state of exception analogous to the Third Reich, not only creating entropic cruelty, but also replicating the harms it seeks to rid itself of, our discursive choices are key to change<br />

Racism is the fundament of BP control – BP implies that power is exercised over biological units and categorization by race is the method of choice- as long as racism exists the BP state can justify a permanent state of war and genocide by devaluing lives<br />

Justice Stevens distinguished…lucrative, interstate market.&quot; n47<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Courts should grant cert to an appropriate test case and hold that the Gonzalez v. Raich decision overruled United States v. Morrison on the grounds that the “comprehensive regulatory standard” is no longer good law.<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Solvency<br />
<br />
Implicit rulings do not overrule. The act of declaring a case to be previously implicitly overruled is the act of overruling the case. It also avoids all courts and politics DA’s<br />

MANY THINGS ARE CONTROVERSAL….PROTECT CIVIL RIGHTS<br />

WE DON’T MAKE CLAIMS THAT MEN ARE THE ABUSERS-WE OUTLINE HOW THE SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED GENDER CALLED A “MAN’ IS WHAT DEALS THESE ABUSIVE ACTS. THIS PARADIGM IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THAT ANY PERSON REGARDLESS OF BIOLOGICAL SEX, ORIENTATION OR SEXUAL COMMUNITY CAN BE BATTERED OR BE ABUSED<br />

<br />
THIS CONTINUATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN CANNOT BE CATEGORIZED AS PEACEFUL WHEN WOMEN WORLDWIDE ARE ENSLAVED, RAPED, PROSTITUTED, TORTURED AND MURDERED. WE MUST EXPAND OUR NOTION OF WAR TO INCLUDE THE SYSTEMIC AND ONGOING VIOLENCE THAT OCCURS AGAINST WOMEN<br />

Round: 3<br />
Affirmative Team: Kansas ST<br />
Negative Team: Vandy CR<br />
Judge: Whiteaker<br />

Affirmative Read: Morrision Gender Policy Aff<br />
<br />
Plan Text:<br />
Write out the affirmative's full plan text word for word. If the complete plan is already on a caselist or on a previous round report and hasn't changed, then you can simply indicate that.<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule U.S. V Morrision, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) on the 14th amendment grounds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantages:<br />
If a new affirmative is read or you hear a new advantage, you should get complete cites. Otherwise, just list the advantages that the affirmative claims.<br />
<br />
Gender Violence<br />

Aff Strategy Notes:<br />
If the affirmative straight turned a DA, read a kritik against a DA, or did anything else unusual, make a note of it here.<br />
<br />
Trys to say gender is root cause of violence, DA are linear, does answer them though.<br />
They were so good, we had to go for T immediately.
