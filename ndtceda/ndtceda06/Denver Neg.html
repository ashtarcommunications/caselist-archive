Role of the Ballot Thing<br />
A. Our interpretation: on this topic, the role of the judge is not to weigh the impacts of various policy and philosophical arguments to determine which policy option is best. Instead, your job is to role play as the Supreme Court and to decide as the court whether or not you should overturn <u>_.<br />

Link – specific abstractions<br />
The aff concerns itself with the particular rather than the general conditions of human sufferieng – this results in the treating of humans as animals of worse ignoring the human condition entirely. Bakunin 1916 [ Miachel “God and the state” 58-61]<br />
“Now, history is mad . . . its legitimate preoccupations.”<br />
<br />
Your plan is divine claims of justicy, beauty etc. fall into the same pitals of idealism and the destruction of humanity.<br />
Bakunin 1916 same above pg. 36-37<br />
To proclaim as divine . . .l human liberty and dignity.”<br />
<br />
The economic organization of society (i.e. capitalism) result in slavery and the imprisonment of the mind-social revolution is the only alternative.<br />
Bakunin above pg 16-17<br />
“There is another reason . . . and all the churches.”<br />
<br />
Idealism leads to slavery<br />
Bakunin pg 48<br />
“It is evident that . . . the level of the beats.”<br />
<br />
AT: Perm do both and Alt solvency<br />
Bakunin 1916 pg 30-31<br />
The liberty of man consists solely in this . . . in a word, he becomes corrupted.”<br />
<br />
To be a slave to god is to be a slave to the sate for the sate cannot exist without god nore god without the state – the state exists because politicians are positioned as mediators between the divine and the masses so to question the state is to questions god<br />
Bakunin above pg. 24-25<br />
God being everything . . . legitimate, and divine church.”<br />
<br />
Idealism/Religion is all predicated on the vilification of the pursuit of knowledge – the state control over the masses mirrors the biblical tale of Adam and Eve.<br />
Bakunin 1916 Pg. 11<br />
The Bible, which is a very . . . of all the Russias.<br />
