Sets up a framework for solidarity<br />
Solidarity with Vermont, working through issues with her<br />
It is not disingenuous, I am in control as the aff- people would just perm on the negative, we are not perfect, aff creates opportunity for change<br />
Vote neg to challenge sexism is stupid, this is the SQ, not a gendered issue.<br />
Sexism overt makes no sense; we can solve these things, point both out- speaker points are lower with women, or talking about bodies and looks<br />
We are a true revolution with change in the debate<br />

<strong>Order: Topicality, Case, Kritik</strong><br />
<strong>Topicality-</strong> extend that they would just create a constitutional debate, not a question about debate, this is fundamental to debate and how it functions, they don’t answer our question of fairness for whom? We take the community back- Stafford evidence on the case debate, we don’t try to destroy debate, we are tied to the resolution, SQ doesn’t allow for fairness<br />
<strong>Case</strong>- We are able to solve all of your implications, Wilde evidence, we must stand in solidarity to understand our commonality, emotional pull of the 1ac allows them to criticize themselves as well, qualitative impacts, D3 Women’s conference being set up, does not allow a strategy to fight oppression, punishment is N/U, lower speaker points, Lindsey was punished last year- every round risk losing for topicality, we risk it, it doesn’t have to happen<br />
<strong>Kritik</strong>- Prefer aff, their ideologies are incorrect, who I am in the debate community must be understood, you are the SQ, the nihilism of the SQ, Wilde, we can get past these distinctions, Went for the permutation.. Zirelli, way to move on is to reclaim the community.<br />
<h3 id="toc13"><a name="Doubles-Kansas JL Aff-2ar Strategy Notes"></a><strong><em>2ar Strategy Notes</em></strong></h3>
<strong>Overview (On Case) and then Kritik</strong><br />
<strong>Case-</strong> just a question of our solvency, we can c/a these arguments, they don’t question their own stance<br />
<strong>Kritik-</strong> don’t question ethic, they don’t explain how they themselves relate to the debate community and how they can solve, we can coopt this with the permutation, no disad to the perm, difference exists, Neal says 33% of women allowed in debate, identity is enclosed on us, this makes aff preferable.<br />

Cards read…<br />
There is inherent worth of our speech act within the community – it is absolutely important that we do this on the aff because a woman its important that Lindsey is in charge of the change we are trying to create – we need to create a space for this to be discussed. Beyond that having this discussion on the negative denies the personal agency of other teams which is why we will endorse a framework of aff choice.<br />

Wid disclosure<br />
<br />
After being raped by Morrison and two football players, Christy Brzonkala lost her options and her voice. Like numerous women in similar situations she quit. School, her job, and in many ways her life. Women all over the world are sexually harassed, assaulted or just plain pushed out of activities, jobs, and lives. The problem, or at least part of the problem is that women often find themselves lacking the discursive ability or experience that aides them in discussing their oppression. They also lack a safe public forum in which to dialogue on said issues. The debate community is no different women leave everyday for a plethora of reasons. Some women know why, some have no idea and many have a feeling that they cannot describe.<br />
Morrison like much of the debate community admits guilt.<br />
<br />
Then we talk about the DCA bios<br />

<strong><u>That being said it is not like we can easily ignore the shortage of women in debate. The numbers are staggering while there seems to be an even split when students first enter the activity the numbers of women decline greatly in later years. This problem of sheer numbers cannot be ignored.</u></strong><br />

</em><u>'I don't usually…</u><em> to the debate community.”<br />
<br />
When men are mean in debate round they are funny or they might be assholes but no one applies that to their out of round personality.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>There are multiple theories of why women leave debate it may have something to do with the multipliticity of ways in which sexism manifests itself in the rounds and in the community.</u></strong><br />

Often, two women… <u>traditions will remain.</u><br />
<br />
<strong><u>And, we know that you will probably say that debate is just a microcosm of the oppression that women face all over the world and that it is these larger systems of oppression are what cause women’s oppression in debate. But we must focus on our own situations and community before we can address more global problems.</u></strong><br />

Given the significance… <u>with gender bias.</u><br />
Debates should be held open to topics of oppression in debate as the need arises.<br />
<br />
We are all part of the problem and the solution, traditional, policy, critical and performance debaters all have a stake in this conversation.
