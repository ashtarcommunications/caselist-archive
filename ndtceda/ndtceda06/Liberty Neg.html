Constitutional Amendment CP<br />
The relevant national and sub-national actor(s) should amend the U.S. Constitution to (insert plan text)<br />
<br />
Enforcement and implementation through all necessary means.<br />
<br />
1. Constitutional amendments instead of the court itself should be used to overrule SCT decisions<br />
Denning, ’97, 65 Tenn. L. Rev. 155<br />
“we must be careful not to forswear” and “interpretation of a constitutional provision”<br />
<br />
2. Constitutional amendments are more effective at resolving fundamental disagreements over social issues and are uniquely conducive to the strengthening of American democracy<br />
Presser, ’00, 5 Tex. Rev. Law &amp; Pol. 209<br />
“appear to see them as a dangerous threat to American liberty” and “They are a democracy in action.”<br />
<br />
This prevents planetary extinction<br />
Diamond, 95 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ics.si.edu/" rel="nofollow">www.ics.si.edu</a><br />
“The flow of illegal drugs intensifies through” “very souce of life on Earth”<br />
<br />
2NC Permutation Answers<br />
<br />
1. The perm links to the net benefits – it still overrules<br />
<br />
2. The perm requires the court to speak to the legitimacy of its own actions in the context of the amendment process – this undermines judicial legitimacy<br />
Tribe, 83, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 433 “many of the concerns motivating judicial abstention” and “integrity of the judicial enterprise”<br />
<br />
3. The counterplan alone make the legal controversy implicated by the aff moot – the perm necessarily requires the court to rule on a moot issue<br />
Baker, 94, 19 Nova L. Rev. 323, “the judgment of the federal court has nothing to” and “federal statute that were enacted”<br />
<br />
4. Judicial decisions regarding moot issues undermine SOP<br />
Watson, ’91, 86 Nw. U. L. Rev. 143<br />
“the risk to separation of powers is greatest where the temptation exists to ignore” and “undermines our system of separated powers”<br />
<br />
5. Violatioons of SOP must be rejected<br />
Redish and Cisar, ’91, 41 Duke L. J. 449, “tyranny would be the inevitable outcome” and “no one wants to be forced into the position”<br />
<br />
6. The perm links to the DAs – it forces the court to “flip-flop” regarding its involvement in the amendment process<br />
Baker, 00 (10 Widener J. Pub. L. 1)<br />
“places the primary responsibility for amending the Constition” and “beyond the pale of judicial review”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Punitive Damages – Tobacco Court Capital Disad<br />
<br />
A. Uniqueness – the Supreme Court appears ready to rule in favor of limiting punitive damages now<br />
Marketwatch, 10-31, “Phillip Morris gets Supreme Court’s ear”<br />
“the oral argument went well for Philip Morris”<br />
<br />
B. Links<br />
1. PC is finite – the plan saps the Court’s ability to make other decisions<br />
Posner, ’83 59 Ind. L. J. 1<br />
“lack the power of purse or sword” and “conserving their political capital”<br />
<br />
2. Ruling in favor of PM requires judicial capital expenditure<br />
Daily Deal, 2-14-05<br />
“The trial is a relic from” and “waste political capital by siding with a social pariah”<br />
<br />
C. Impacts<br />
1. Ruling to limit punitive damages is key to the US economy<br />
Conrad, 11-1<br />
“We hope and expect that the U.S. Supreme Court” and “economy are protected”<br />
<br />
2. US economic collapse goes global, undermines US global hegemony and makes WMD conflict with China inevitable<br />
Mead, 04, Foreign Policy<br />
“enormous, unacceptable damage on the rest of the world” and “conflict is less likely to occur”<br />
<br />
2NC Link Exts<br />
Institutional capital is finite, spending it limits the court’s ability to address other issues<br />
Young, ’04 (Texas Law Review) “pursue all possible doctrinal avenues”<br />
<br />
The SCT has a finite amount of institutional capital – this eliminates their link turns because no decision can ever increase capital<br />
Young, ’04 (Texas Law Review) “arises from this notion that they decide according to law” and “favor doctrines of judicial restraint”<br />
<br />
And, its empirically proven – not once in the history of the court has a decision ever increased its capital<br />
<br />
The SCT carefully husbands it PC not making more than one controversial decision at once<br />
Lawrence, ’86 (Indiana Law Journal) “it may seek to husband its political capital” and “many controversial decisions in too brief”<br />
<br />
Reversals of recent precedent tank the Court’s political capital<br />
Pickrell, 1-4-06, “Should state supreme courts refuse to follow Gideon”, sentencing.typepad.com<br />
“the Supreme Court needs to be particularly” and “180-degree switches” and “see the power of the Supreme Court slip away”<br />
<br />
Overturning burns PC<br />
Rehnquist, ’86 (Boston Univ LR)<br />
“A recurring argument is that overrulings of precedent” and “organ that passes judgment on the popular will”<br />
<br />
Terrorism K (read on case as defense)<br />
<br />
The kritik disproves the 1AC impact evidence – While low impact terrorism incidents are likely, attacks on the scale claimed by the 1AC are incredibly low risk. Despite political rhetoric to the contrary, a consensus of experts agree that the al-Queda’s ability to harm the US has been sharply reduced. Al-Queda can only create large scale disaster by inviting US overreaction<br />
Fallows, Atlantic, 2006, “Declaring Victory”<br />
“I talked with some sixty experts” and “Our reaction is what can cause the damage”<br />
<br />
Inspite of gloomy predictions of the aff – the US is defeating Al-Queda. Terrorists can’t inflict large-scale damage unless they successfully bait the US into overreacting by continuing the war on terror. The alternative is to reject the affirmative’s war rhetoric and declare the US the victor<br />
Fallows, “When I began this reporting” and “were justified as a wartime emergency”<br />

The US Congress should pass an amendment to the US constitution overruling Planned Parenthood v. Casey 505 vs. 833 (1992). The US congress should submit the amendment to the states for ratification. The necessary number of states should ratify the amendment.<br />

Law is violence K<br />

Unfortunately, the self-identification of the legal… It is in such ways that the radical simplification of law is achieved.<br />
