1) Forgetting is too dangerous to risk the past will be replaced by artifical memory which will begin to exterminate itself, radiating forgetfulness systematically until no guilt remain. And the, it is too late, because everyone has seen “that” for of oppression, everyone has fought it, mourned it, certain that “that” will never happen again - but the harms of the past are already being reproduced through the very act of forgetting<br />
Baudrillard, 95 (<u>Simulacra and Simulation)</u><br />
2) Even if they win that their decision is a landmark, case in the history of the Court’s oppression the process of reinventing history to subsequently destroy it all at once sanitizes the Court and recreates the conditions that allowed the atrocities in the first place<br />
Baudrillard, 94 (<em>The Illusion of the End</em>)<br />
3) It is not enough to say “we won’t forget” – without the accountability of history, no amount of logic will prevent the gravest injustices from bein repeated<br />

<ul><li>Overruling sanitizes history by removing the decision from the legacy of the court. This process of whitewashing is analogous to the strategy of racial redemption wherein the court systematically removes the blood of oppression from its hand by burying its institituional history. The affs overrule enacts the burial feature by removing the decion from the lasting public view. Without the constant accountability generated by keeping the worst decions on the books, the court has historically worked to generate new institional preotection for power and sovereignty</li></ul>Cho 98 [sumi, depaul law professor, 1998 (boston college third world law journal 19 B.C. third world L.J. 73 pg 122)<br />
Racial redemption is the … of colorblind fundamentalism.<br />
<ul><li>We’ll identify two empirical examples of how the court deals with bad decisions. The first example is brown. It proves how institutions of power influence the interpretation of history to erase the beliefs of the past and glorify the ideology of the present as if it were what we’d always believed. Furthermore it proves that these tactics can and will successfully rewrite history not only in the academy but among the public, using the media to convince us all that we’ve always been at war with Eurasia</li></ul>Ryan 04 [Kevin F.

Brown has an iconic status… for “white” and “colored”<br />
<ul><li>Brown proves that dehistoricizing the court’s participation in oppression legitimizes an inevitable replication of violence and coercion- this acts as a complete case turn. The aff turns the oppressors of today into the oppressor sof tomorrow.</li></ul>Cho 98 [sumi, depaul law professor, 1998 (boston college third world law journal 19 B.C. third world L.J. 73 pg 122)<br />

<br />
We live in an era filled with the greatest amount of violence in history. We are constantly confronted with loss and vulnerability. But, who can we grieve for? What constitutes a grievable life? These questions appeal to something beyond the minutiae of technical policy-making, but rather speak to the very condition of life itself. At every moment of everyday, we are vulnerable, we are exposed to the other. This vulnerability threatens us to fall apart. This is a universal vulnerability, and its causes everyone of us to come undone by the touch, the feel and the memory of others. But it it through this touch that we can experience empathy as a common basis to build new communities.<br />
Butler, 2004, “Precarious Life: The powers of Mourning and Violence”, p19-25<br />
“I propose to consider…….them as well.”<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s scenes of war and violence induce panic and fear, because they remind us of the omnipresent threat of bodily harm, the specter of exposed flesh, and the mortality of our own skin. However, the first step of grief is to acknowledge this very vulnerability and to make ourselves vulnerable to others.<br />
Butler, 4, p. 26-31<br />
“But is there……its possibility”<br />
<br />
This Drive to rationality suppress violence through order and reason has brought us to the edge of extinction through militaristic, ecological and political means<br />
Dillon and Campbell in 92, (Michael, Lancaster and David, Newcastle, The Political Subject of Violence, p. 163-164”<br />
“This interpretation of……persistence of vulernability.”<br />

<h1 id="toc22"><a name="Commerce Clause K"></a>Commerce Clause K</h1>
<br />
A. Relying on the commerce clause to legislate human rights restricts the legal system to 19th century human rights protections. This ensures gender and racial oppression, and any injustice that doesn’t impact the economy is considered irrelevant.<br />
<strong>Pope 02</strong> (James Gray, Professor of Law at Rutgers University Law School, “The Thirteenth Amendment Versus the Commerce Clause”, Columbia Law Review, 102.1, January)<br />
B. Like in VAWA, justice achieved through economic payments reduces people to abstract, fungible commodities. Those who are not deemed economically valuable are left to suffer and die.<br />
<strong>Sweeney 06</strong> (Megan, Assistant Professor of English at the University of Michigan, “Something Rogue: Commensurability, Commodification, Crime, and Justice in Toni Morrison’s Later Fiction”, Modern Fiction Studies, 52.2, Summer, pg. 440-469)<br />
<br />
C. The belief that we can use economic markets to solve all our problems is called neoliberalism. It reduced life to bare consumerism and is responsible for corporate corruption, environmental destruction, and the commodification of life.<br />
<strong>Giroux 05</strong> (Henry A., Professor at McMaster University, “The Terror of Neoliberalism: Rethinking the Significance of Cultural Politics”, College Literature, 32.1, Winter, pg. 1-19)<br />

<br />
<strong>The Rhetoric of Choice gives a false glimmmer of hope to women, an illusion of autonomy that really keeps them osciallating between career and mother- requiring that women who want financial success have abortions. Feminism can never succeed until this rhetoric is critically addressed.</strong><br />
<strong>Williams 91</strong>, Joan, professor of law washington college of law, american universityGENDER WARS: SELFLESS WOMEN IN THE REPUBLIC OF CHOICE; <em>66 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1559</em><br />
<strong>Focusing on the “freedom to choose” detracts from the reality that NO choice is the right choice. The choice is actually another form of entrapment into strict gender roles.</strong><br />
<strong>Williams 91</strong>, Joan, professor of law washington college of law, american universityGENDER WARS: SELFLESS WOMEN IN THE REPUBLIC OF CHOICE; <em>66 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1559</em><br />
<strong>Theories of autonomy ignore the DOMESTIC UNDERCURRENT that holds: “capitalism is for men, not for women,” and that women who parttake in the race to the top individually destroy the family structure and should be disgusted at themselves for wanting to succeed. This pits women against each other.</strong><br />

(Overrule requires a denial of a previous decision on that legal question)<br />
A.) Negative interpretation:<br />
1.) DEFINITION- overrule<br />
<u>Law.com, 2006</u><br />
2.) ruling on grounds tHat were not part of the original decision does not constitute an overrule<br />
<u>justice stevens</u> <u>2000</u> (120 C. Court 1084 @1108) CWEB<br />
3.) EVEN IF A NEW DECISION DICTATES A DIFFERENT RESULT IN AN OLD CASE, IT DOESN’T OVERRULE THE OLD DECISION IF ITS REASONING IS UNRELATED TO THE QUESTIONS CONSIDERED IN THE OLD CASE BECAUSE THE RELEVANT QUESTION HASN’T BEEN SO DECIDED AS TO CONSTITUTE A PRECEDENT.<br />
John Paul <strong>Stevens</strong>, Justice, U.S. Supreme Court, 2/29/<strong>2000</strong><br />
To be sure, the reading of Michigan Academy … Ringer did not decide.<br />
A.) Violation- The affirmative overrules on grounds that were not part of the original decision<br />
B.) STANDARDS<br />
1.) PREDICTABLE LIMITS- THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS THAT THE AFF COULD JUSTIFY AN OVERRULE. THIS CREATES AN ENORMOUS RESEARCH BURDEN FOR THE NEGATIVE<br />
2.) REAL WORLD EDUCATION AND TOPIC KNOWLEDGE- OUR EVIDENCE IS CONTEXTUAL THAT PROVES WHY THEY SUPREME COURT ONLY OVERRULES CASES ON THE GROUNDS THAT WERE RULED UPON IN THE ORIGINAL DECISION. PRESERVING THE AUTHENTICITY OF TOPIC ACTION IS KEY TO OUR EDUCATION ABOUT THE PROCESS AND THE ABILITY OF THE NEGATIVE TO FIND CASE EVIDENCE REGARDING THE AFF.<br />
