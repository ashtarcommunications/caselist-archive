Federalism high now- Conservative Court<br />
Matthew J. Franck 9/13/2006 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGRiYjk4Yzk5ZjA2YWNmNjgzZTAwMWZkZWMONzY0MzU=" rel="nofollow">http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGRiYjk4Yzk5ZjA2YWNmNjgzZTAwMWZkZWMONzY0MzU=</a><br />
To say all this, by the way, is not to say that it couldn’t be successfully argued that the conservative justices are just as activist as the liberal ones. I have often argued so myself, for instance that the conservative wing of the Court is wedded to an extra-constitutional abstraction called “federalism” in its response to some act of Congress. But one has to have an argument about constitutional meaning to carry that off. Mere data won’t do.<br />
<br />

US vs. Morrison was a key step in solidifying US federalism<br />

Fetishization K<br />
<br />
A. Aff chooses to locate in the Miliken decision and the individual actors of the Supreme Court a mindset of a “biopolitics of sacrifice.” They construct a historical vision which locates the responsibility for history in the purposive choices of individual actors. This is mutually exclusive with a genealogical politics.<br />
[Wendy Brown, <em>The Later Foucault</em>, 1998]<br />
“The space of this….remonstrances of it.”<br />
<br />
B. Aff is a call for action by the Supreme Court. Focusing on and studying the actions of gov’t actors as a focus of study. This is mutually exclusive with genealogical politics.<br />
[Brown 98, p. 41-2]<br />
“While Foucault….might-not-be.”<br />
C. Focus on Supreme Court fetishizes and prevents real change.<br />
[Robin Kar 1997, Yale Law Journal]<br />
“In What should….legal mandates.”<br />
D. Alternative: Recognize through the accidental confluence of a number of social factors cities have become zones that marginalize the lives and opportunities of peoples of color and call on ourselves as communities to work toward alternative futures.<br />
[Brown 98, p. 46-7]<br />
“Foucault’s ontology….political rationality.”<br />
E. Rejecting institutional fetishism opens space for societal transformations. Claims that it fails or is utopian reflect failure of imagination.<br />
[Roberto Unger 2k5, online]<br />
“The advancement of alternatives like….midst of constraint.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Historical Misrepresentations<br />
<br />
A. Constructs a purposeful representation of history. Suggesting it was part of a programmed intentional agenda.<br />
<br />
Flawed representations--<br />
1.Time—handed down in 1974, but movie from 1950s but by then the nuclear war had subsided<br />
[]<br />
2. Space—Miliken not about locking in cities but providing federalism to control of schools.<br />
[]<br />
3. School district lines not Berlin Wall<br />
4. Cold War—cities not zones of sacrifice.<br />
[Seed 3]<br />
5. Cities-Laughable notions cities sacrificed.<br />
[]<br />
<br />
Atomic café is wrong—point of film is that all of America was sacrificed. No African Americans in the film, try to hide—doesn’t show the propaganda.<br />
<br />
B. Flawed representations are reason to vote neg.<br />
<br />
1. Kills responsibility<br />
[Jackson]<br />
2. Distortions of history do violence against ourselves and others.<br />
[Jackson 1]<br />
<br />
Case<br />
<br />
1. The 1ac reifies the racist exclusionary black-white binary—by only identifying African Americans tand Whites in the 1ac, the aff ensures continued marginalization of Latinos, Native Americans, and Asian Americans.<br />
[Perea 1997, 85 California L. R. 1213]<br />
“Paradigms of race….seen at all.”<br />
2. Overreliance on black/white dichotomy is a form of academic colonialism.<br />
[Perea 1997, 85 California L. R. 1213]<br />
“In the context…civil rights.<br />
3. T/ paradigm bc new pedagogy would draw new lines of which groups deserve our attention. Aff insures continued marginalization of populations.<br />
[Perreri 2]<br />
4. Aff gives impression that it’s a black/white issue—ignores Latinos.<br />
[Perea 97]<br />
“In order to tell…..students.”<br />
<br />
FETISH<br />
<br />
Case turn—working in existing structures causes us to fetisizhe those structures even though they engage in conservative programs that turns the case and prevents Aff.<br />
Political solutions cause scape-goating.<br />
Should embrace randomness in historical events. This transforms domination.<br />
<br />
AT: Specificity.<br />
1. Don’t look at pass. Specifically mutually exclusive.<br />
2. Cannot embrace policy and different types of strategies.<br />
3. Evidence goes Neg—must look at historical events that lead up to racism.<br />
4. Foucault evidence goes neg.<br />
<br />
AT: Double bind.<br />
1. Ungar—no reform. Aff co-opted.<br />
2. Efforts to reform foreclose opportunities when using existing institutions.<br />
[Unger 2k5]<br />
“In a setting….into fate.”<br />
3. AT: Perm<br />
5. Also AT: perm<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AT: Must look at Supreme Court.<br />
1. Allows elite grab for power.<br />
2. Specific to desegregation—overturning precludes fundamental rethinking of racism.<br />
<br />
AT: Perm<br />
1. Brown proves mutually exclusive.<br />
2. Fails—must embrace radical experiment.<br />
[Unger 2005, online]<br />
“The other species…alternatives.”<br />
3. All link evidence shows that only overturning should solve is a link.<br />
4. Cooption<br />
[Unger 2007, online]<br />
“Dewey’s conception of experience…view of experience.”<br />
<br />
<br />
AT: Neoliberal co-option.<br />
1. No impact to neoliberalism.<br />
2. Straight turn—lead to new form of biopolitics.<br />
3. Genealogical politics turns the case.<br />
[Brown 98]<br />
“While these features….politics.”<br />
4. Rejecting political positions solves the case.<br />
[Brown 98]<br />
“Sundering Genealogical….expanded.”<br />
5. Proves links that fetishize the institution—Just another link in defense of Supreme Court action.<br />
<br />
2NC<br />
<br />
Historical Misrepresentations<br />
<br />
Vote Neg.<br />
<br />
A. Aff historically inaccurate. Prior issue to plan. Pure manipulation of history to feed the plan.<br />
B. Academic discussion. Thesis would be rejected.<br />
C. Impact—history textbooks cover up violence by covering up history. Impact turns case<br />
<br />
Link<br />
<br />
A. Exclusion is for economic reasons, not forced.<br />
B. Time—McCarthy papers start the Cold War, followed by Brown. IF internal link is true, then minorities based on conservative cases.<br />
C. Cold War ends before Miliken<br />
<br />
<br />
AT: Contradictions<br />
<br />
1. Mohalan evidence—1970s no longer afraid of the nuclear war. No evidence the reason we put minorities in the ghetto was nuclear fear.<br />
2. No impact to conditionality.<br />
Denies choice to Neg<br />
COnditonality good.<br />
A. Negation<br />
B. Fairness<br />
C. Not moving target<br />
D. Competitive equity<br />
E. Strategic thinking<br />
F. Dispo doesn’t solve<br />
G. C/i—1 conditional alt.<br />
3. They have plenty of ground for the AFF—must prove historical accuracy of representations.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Turns history into one analysis—multiple sources prove history is not a single narrative and they depoliticize history.<br />
[Giroux 93]<br />
<br />
3. Hold them to performative act of 1nc—can’t challenge history.<br />
<br />
AT: Brown part of Cold War.<br />
1. Not true.<br />
[]<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Cities—exclusion and they misunderstand atomic café.<br />
<br />
6. Movies false—<br />
<br />
AT: Neoliberlaism.<br />
[Giroux 5]<br />
1. Says should not prefer counterplans because we should focus on impact of words. When makeup history it makes us ignore the violence of our acts.<br />
[Jackson]<br />
<br />
<br />
AT: Case o/w impact<br />
1. All reasons cases doesn’t solve.<br />
2. K = impact turn<br />
<br />
<br />
CASE<br />
<br />
O/V<br />
1. No evidence they are an inclusion of races.<br />
2. IF we win privilege black/white, it crushes movement—Krishna goes Neg. Impact to Latino argument.<br />
3. This turns the case—perm = intrinsic vi.<br />
4. It’s not net beneficial—paradigm of 1ac relies on black-white binary. Paradigms are inherently singular.<br />
[Perea 1997, 85 California L. R. 1213]<br />
“Thomas Kuhn….observed anomalies.”<br />
<br />
AT: Ethics and politics.<br />
1. Aff = unethical political choice. Giroux says we should find best way for liberatory politics. Aff ignores the majority of excluded populations.<br />
2. Question of framing.<br />
<br />
AT: Aff doesn’t exclude.<br />
1. Could read the aff regardless—could have talked about others.<br />
2. Aff’s strategic choice to include one and not the other.<br />
[Perea 97]<br />
“I cannot see…scholarship.”<br />
<br />
AT: Black/white focus good in context of Aff.<br />
1. Aff exclusive focus denies other groups and their agency.<br />
[Giroux 97]<br />
2. Renders docile all other people.<br />
[Perea 97]<br />
“Hacker’s….these groups.”<br />
Turns case.<br />
[Perea 1997, 85 California L. R. 1213]<br />
“One of Kuhn’s…seen at all.”<br />
Omission of Mexican Americans uniquely dangerous and link turns line-drawing bad.<br />
[Perea 1997, 85 California L. R. 1213]<br />
“The point of….such indifference.”<br />
This is a form of academic colonialism.<br />
It’s unique—if we broaden up context it means it leads to broader progressive legislation.<br />

Precautionary principle – you should defer to the precautionary principle when evaluating life, unless you are 100% sure life doesn’t begin at conception you must default on the side of not killing babies<br />
Oliver, 2005, 5-9, 2005, National Review, online<br />
“Now let’s try a thought experiment. Suppose a building is to be demolished…knowledge about the humanity of the fetus.”<br />

 Alternative to the plan leaves you with two choices – any chance that life begins with conception<br />
<br />
There is no 2ac answer – life begins at conceptions – there’s no difference so no exceptions<br />
<br />
All of these offensive arguments on why you should never allow murder<br />
<br />
If the latino women the fetus as a child – their canonization spillsover causing them to kill them<br />
<br />
Our arguments that you never allow for murder – Bauers – allows the extermination of all children with disabilities<br />
Not allow an extrapolation – c-x is not persuasive. Internalizing my guilt prevents action, this instance is murder<br />

Justification on why the supreme court should act<br />

Shively says it's a pre-requisite – euthanasia example, if one person thinks its what we do other thinks it's a ban we can’t have a conversation<br />
<br />
Evaluate the debate how you should choose<br />
<br />
We can’t have a debate about the liberation of the oppressed – use the personal narratives to justify the resolution – use personal experience that casey decision is bad<br />
<br />
We are not necrophiliac – we do not like having sex with death people<br />
<br />
We are not banking model – we can counterargue lets us fight that – switchside debate is not banking –in a constant dialogue – examples of framework debates proves this<br />
<br />

Defending the status quo is impossible – we don't know what part we should<br />
<br />
Forces us to defend racism, sexism etc,<br />
<br />
We do not embrace the notion of the citizen in Rawls – switchside debate changes culture – we can question assumptions through switchside debate – real world example of why debate is good – it can transform homophobia<br />

Lack of engaging in the political means the right forces will take over – the Bush administration always win<br />

STATE OF EXCEPTION CRITICISM<br />
<br />
The power of the biopolitical sovereign exists in the power to define humanity - definitions try to create separation through conceptions such as rights extended to all citiziens - these are a farce used to extend sovereign control over all of the political body in a world of diminishing border - this internal link turns the aff - we must affirm the status of the refugee as a human outside of the rule of the sovereign<br />
CALDEWLL, 04<br />
Anne, 'Bio-sovereignty and the Emergence of Humanity, Theory and Event, pg. Project Muse<br />
<br />
The language of inclusion violently relies on exclusion - it reduces the other to bare life that can be exterminated<br />
NORRIS, 2K<br />
Andrew, 'Giorgio Agamben and the Politics of the Living Dead,' Diacriticis, 30.4, pg. Project Muse<br />
<br />
We should affirm 'whatever being' and reject the criteria of sovereign control - appeals to rights and identity will inevitably fall within the poewr of the biopolitical sovereign - only when we accept our status as whatever being can we break from biopolitics<br />
CALDEWLL, 04<br />
Anne, 'Bio-sovereignty and the Emergence of Humanity, Theory and Event, pg. Project Muse<br />
<br />
<br />
CRITIQUE OF REDEMPTION<br />
<br />
The aff is an attempt to perfect sociality and history - like stereophonic efects that destroy the reality of music, so too does the aff end reality for the ecstasy of perfection - it assumes a linear path to perfection that marginalizes alterity and ensures its own suicide<br />
BAUDRILLARD, 94<br />
Jean, philosopher from France, The Illusion of the End, pg. 5-9<br />
<br />
The linear assumptions of the affirmative is the worst of colonial ideologies - if society is progressing then there is little we have to do and we can whitewash the past and repent - but there are still the oppressed only becausae we try to manufacture our own destiny that will result in ultimate destruction<br />
BAUDRILLARD, 94<br />
Jean, philosopher from France, The Illusion of the End, pg. 69-71<br />
<br />
The aff is a reconciliation with the past but at the same time criticizing only the past - it creates a pious future that will result in suicidal or murderous behavior<br />

CRT/Intergration - AFF didn’t discuss race in 1AC, count correctly S<br />
<br />
NYU 1AC – [did not hear it – this is my assumption based on what happened in later speeches]<br />
Milliken - race, transform law, possibly w/music &amp; narratives about segregated experience in NYC educ system, indict of NDT/CEDA, &amp; including organic intellectuals as best sources<br />
<br />
Based on the 2AC, it seems their advocacy is to take their narratives about segregation in NYC schools to the Supreme Court – granting of cert would ensure that their voices were heard, would result in overrule of Milliken, later becomes a precedent for other movements to use (in response to Hollow Hope, they say the court listening to their narratives ensures other movements’ narratives would be heard).<br />

Played some music too, possibly Tupac, because the 2AC refers back to 1AC references to Tupac.<br />
