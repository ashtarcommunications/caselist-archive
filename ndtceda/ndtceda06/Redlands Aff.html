Therefore, we demand that your ballot be handed to us upon the last breath of the fourth cross examination. If you do not accept our demand, you declare yourself in support of the format, the rules, and the state. Guard your ballot well, or it shall become our plunder<br />

<br />
Yarr, ye’ve probably noticed that we’re pirates. The way we see it, debate concerns itself with two commodities: Evidence and the ballot. Powerful institutions deploy huge budgets to organize bodies, coordinate labor, and divide responsibility, all in service to the ceaseless production of evidentiary knowledge. Amassed in password-protected databases and locked squadrooms, this knowledge is practically untouchable. Like gold in a treasury, it can be safely stored until the right moment, when it is broght into the public realm and exchanged for the win. The web of power at play here is illustrative of Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of arborescence, knowledge based on the model of a tree. We each have a pre-ordained place in the round, and serve a specific function, fulfilling the order of “what debate is and ought to be.” Like branches on a tree, we are powerless to act outside of rigid parametes. A coach cuts a file, a debater demands predictable ground so it can be read, a judge votes for a theoretical truth and makes it so. But, in the end, we cannot use this thought without being used by it. We lose the ability to think creatively, to respond actively to other people’s thoughts, to experience realisty outside of the walls that we ourselves create. The web which calls for the production of knowledge simultaneously calls for the production of docile bodies making us all both servants and tyrants.<br />
<br />
The hands flip page after page as debaters repeat the reading for that they were taught at debate institute when we go judge at high school tournaments, the debaters have started to say “six” instead of “06” or “2006” because saying “oh” ten times is another eight seconds of speech time. Wouldn’t it be faster if we just recorded ourselves speaking and then played it back on the laptop as fast as we could up until the point where the judge loses understanding and yells, “Clear!”<br />
<br />
That's where the piracy comes in. The knowledge may sit in untouchable vaults, but it is made vulnerable at one point in particular: the moment of transfer. It parallels the situation of Caribbean pirates who found themselves lodged between colonial fortresses and their overseers across the atlantic. While both points were protected, the gold made in the Americas had to be transferred across the open ocean in order for it to be relevant. Pirates took advantage of this, and caused massive disruption to commerce and the state machines it supported. The debate round, like the ocean, is more resistant to the claims of sovereign power than dry land. The constant change of judges and participants means that stable rules barely gain a foothold, causing debate space to exist in permanent fluctuation. It is within this type of space that piracy can undermine sovereign.<br />
<br />
Our claim is not merely that debate creates the possibility of pirating. More accurately, the relationship is bidirectional, because pirates also create the possibilities of debate. Our activity is not just a bunch of mindless automata wielding arguments like jackboots, though there are forces within it pushing it in that direction. Throughout the history of debate, people have made personal investments in argument that have changed the face of the activity forever. Pirate mentaltity resists the arborescent model of hierarchy and order and un-leashes the desire to create the new. This round is a chance for just that, investing ourselves into this little pocket of debate in order to recreat it. As Kaufman et al explain<br />
<br />
Ulrike Kausman, Marion Meinzerin and Gabreiel Kuhn write in 1997 ( <u>Women in pirates: the politics of the Jolly Roger</u>) pg. 231-234<br />
“A substantive prerequisite for the departure into freedom....we must also ask who the pirates of today might be.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Rebuttals, as traditionally deployed in debate serve the purpose of creating techno-strategic advantage, not communication. They try to focus the debate down to one argument, one hinge, one essential question, aka a root of knowledge. They privilege the flow by locating truth in dropped arguments and extended cards, subjecting communication to a regime of structure. This has made the first part of the debate less dialogical, encouraging teams to save the <u>real good stuff</u> for later speeches, where cross-x doesn't exist. The 1n can almost be replaced by a computer in no small part because of the privileging of rebuttals.<br />
<br />
We believe that the “rules of the game” are contestable on every level—we should capitalize on these spaces of freedom and play with the rules as part of pirating debate space. Pirates are a threat to order and capitalism because they make smooth spaces from within—they have the freedom to play with and strike at the state and moreover to <u>leave</u> if they feel their actions are being striated these are the necessary tactics to fighting the state.<br />
<br />
Same authors continue from page 273-274<br />
“Why not just walk away from capitalism and build....everything else will follow from that.”<br />
<br />
The state apparatus will always act violently which means we can’t be bound to moral rules that prevent violence. In response, nomadic violence preserves smooth space which is essential to freedom.<br />
<br />
Same authors continue from page 264-267<br />
“After the last sections we can say with some confidence that pirate crews were a type....and thus the reconstitution of a smooth space or the life form of the smooth space.”<br />

Here is our aff disclosure sheet for now - I will get the copy of the case outline from the gonzaga case book later today At Gonzaga, Jake and I said that: &quot;The Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin [insert case number here] on the grounds that the &quot;enemy combatant&quot; classification is unconstitutional.&quot; In a couple of debates, we specified that it should be overruled on the grounds that it violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment.<br />
<br />
At Berkeley, we talked about the &quot;enemy combatant&quot; classification that is being deployed to send people to Guantanamo Bay. We read cards from Amy Kaplan - Where is Guantanamo?, American Quarterly (57.3), 2005 Project Muse and said that the invocation of that phrase is an example of otherization and imperialism. &quot;Enemy Combatant&quot; at guantanamo is rooted in particular racist ideologies, attempting to fit a person to a particular mold that has empirically been filled by refugees, revolutionaries, dissidents, terrorists, and everyone else that has been detained illegitimately at guantanamo. We did not read a plan - we said that reading plans cuts us off from our own connection to the things that were going on in the world today because they focused the debate on federal government action and abstract theoretical principles instead of what we can do in our day-to-day lives or how we should orient ourselves politically. We then read a card from <strong>Doxtader</strong>, E. 2000. Characters in the Middle of Public Life: Consensus, Dissent and Ethos. Philosophy and Rhetoric 33(4) about communicative theory.<br />
<br />
At Pepperdine, we made an argument along these lines: Debate is primarily concerned with two commodities - evidence and the ballot. Teams go to great lengths to produce and hoard evidence during the year before debate tournaments in order to come to the tournament and exchange that evidence for the ballot. This evidence is amassed like capital, to be exchanged for the ballot, the goods (the... plunder?). The way that evidence is produced is epistemogically problematic because it constructs knowledge arborescently, assuming there is a particular root ( i.e. the resolution) that we can derive knowledge from if we use it as a starting point. It is also produced in a machinized form, reducing debaters to pawns playing out the ends of a topic committee's decree. This machinization is present elsewhere in debate - for example, the way efficiency is taught at debate camp (like debaters saying &quot;five&quot; instead of &quot;05&quot; or &quot;2005&quot;) - we think that communication has been forsaken for competition. We think that this competition is promoting the hypercapitalism in debate that exacerbates differences in budgets, recruitment, etc., making access to this knowledge impossible. (we also say that debating like this represents statist ideals.)<br />
<br />
We dressed up like pirates. We say that the most vulnerable area between the gold produced in the Americas and the money that the Europeans made off of it is the ocean, the free unguarded space between the two ports. In our analogy, the two ports would likely be the squad room and the tabulation room at the tournament. The debate round is the ocean, the unguarded space where we can strike back at this violent construction of knowledge. We should mock the value of the ballot, taking it instead as what we really think it is: a chance to draw a jolly roger.<br />
<br />
We also read evidence. Our evidence at Pepperdine came from a book called <u>Women Pirates: The Politics of the Jolly Roger</u> by Ulrike Klausman, Marion Meinzerin, and Gabriel Kuhn, written in 1997.<br />
<br />
<br />
I found that the Gonzaga case is already up there. In my last email, I forgot another part of the argument we made at pepperdine. below is a paragraph about it.<br />
<br />
Rebuttals represent an example of arborescent knowlege in debate by trying to narrow the debate down to particular voting issues. This privileges the hypertechnical aspects of debate like spreading out the 1ar or 2nr choice or new 2ar arguments that can't be responded to. Therefore, we think that the debate should end after cross-ex of the 2nc - This shifts the focus away from competition based on technical drops and preserves a smoother debate space.<br />

WE BEGIN BY REVISITING A MOMENT IN THE PAST – 1942 TO BE EXACT – A GROUP OF GERMANS ARE ARRESTED ON AMERICAN SOIL – PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT ISSUES AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE MEN ARE TRIED IN MILITARY TRIBUNALS. AND THE REST, THEY SAY, IS HISTORY.<br />
