Plan: The United States Supreme Court should grant writ of certiorari to the next relevant test case and rule on said test case that the Federal District Courts do have broad remedial power to desegregate, including desegregation across district lines.<br />
The 1974 Milliken decision prevents federal courts from implementing desegregation orders, effectively marginalizing minority students and destroying value to life<br />

The problems of segregation are only getting worse—racial segregation is increasing in the public school system, fueling inequality throughout the United States<br />

Segregated public education reinforces white privilege—marginalizing the educational opportunity of minority students and spilling over into all facets of life<br />

Institutionalized racism must be rejected at all costs, inaction dooms the world to poverty and destruction<br />
Barndt ’91<br />
(Joseph R. Codirector of Crossroads, a program working to dismantle racism, Dismantling Racism, 1991, p. 155-6)<br />
<br />
We have a moral imperative to act—inaction makes us complicit with the violent cycle of racism<br />

Segregation in the educational situation promotes the derealization of life. The ability of the sovereign to banish certain populations to an unlivable state of bare life in the name of political interest renders all populations vulnerable to extermination.<br />
Butler 2004<br />
[Judith, Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature @ UC Berkeley, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, p. 63-68]<br />
<br />
The effect of this derealizaiton of life is violence without end: the discursive ability to strip lives of their ontological subjectivity produces violence not against lives that are intelligible politically but against an infinite and never-ending spectral enemy.<br />
Butler 2004<br />
[Judith, Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature @ UC Berkeley, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, p. 33-35]<br />

Overturning Milliken is essential to eliminate inequalities in all aspects of life—the creation of metropolitan school districts is key to prevent white flight and promote integration<br />

<br />
Empirics support plan—metropolitan school districts curb white flight and will endure with Supreme Court action<br />

Reforming the school system is essential—breaking down bias in education will set a model for positive modes of interaction throughout society<br />

The court is key—must act to overrule Milliken<br />
