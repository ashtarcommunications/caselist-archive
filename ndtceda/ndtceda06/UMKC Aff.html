THE LAW HAS NULLIFIED WOMEN’S SELFHOOD THROUGH ITS MASCULINIZING OF THE SELF-AFTER COVERTURE WAS RESCINDED, REPRODUCTIVE LAW HAS BECOME THE SITE OF THIS DENIAL OF AGENCY<br />
<br />
Feminist Perspectives on the Self, 1st published June 28, 1999, substantive revision Jan 7, 2004; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/feminism-self/" rel="nofollow">http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries//feminism-self/</a><br />
“Feminist critiques, we have seen...gesture of self-renunciation.”<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS DENIAL OF SELFHOOD IS PIVOTAL TO AGENCY—MAKING THE MASCULINE THE NORM CREATES THE FEMININE AS THE OTHER, DEVOID OF PERSONHOOD, IDENTITY, THE LAW RENDERS WOMEN AS MERE BODIES<br />
<br />
Diana Meyers, Feminist Perspectives on the Self, 1st published June 28, 1999, substantive revision Jan 7, 2004; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/feminism-self/" rel="nofollow">http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries//feminism-self/</a><br />
“The topic of the self has long...these angles.”<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS EXCLUSION SACRIFICES WOMEN BY APPEALING TO A UNIVERSAL EQUALITY-IT’S VISION OF EQUALITY AND NEUTRALITY REQUIRES THE EXCLUSION OF MATERIALITY AND DIFFERENCE FROM CONSIDERATIONS IN THE POLITICAL REALM, FORCING POLITICAL BODIES TO SUCCOMB TO THE UNIVERSAL, ABSOLUTIST VISION OF POLITICS<br />
<br />
Anne Caldwell, 2002, Hypatia, 17.4, Transforming Sacrifice: Iragaray and the Politics of Sexual Difference, project Muse<br />
“How does Irigaray see...such as women.”<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS IDEAL OF EQUALITY REQUIRES A SUBJECT, MAN, TO BE POSITED AS NATURAL, AND DEFINED IN COMPARISON TO OTHER SUBJECTS BY DISAVOWING MATERIALITY. THE EQUAL SUBJECT REQUIRES THE EXISTENCE OF LESSER SUBJECTS TO JUSTIFY ITSELF. THE FREEDOM OF DEMOCRACY IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE MASTERY OF THINKING THAT EXCLUDES DIFFERENCE IN THE NAME OF AN AUTONOMOUS SELF<br />
<br />
Caldwell same cite<br />
“The formation of ideal citizen...autonomy of the self.”<br />
<br />
<br />
THE ATTEMPT TO VIEW IDENTITY THROUGH ENTRENCHED FORMATIONS CAUSES VIOLENCE AGAINST BOTH THE SELF AND THE OTHER<br />
<br />
William Connoly, 2002, <u>Identity/Difference</u>, expanded edition, p 177<br />
“Without a particular set...in them too.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey by ruling that women’s right to choose an abortion is based on a woman’s right to selfhood.<br />
<br />
THE PLAN IS A RADICAL BREAK WITH THE CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS OF EQUALITY AND LIBERTY THAT CURRENTLY UNDERLIE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS<br />
<br />
Caldwell same site<br />
“In Irigaray’s words...because of it.”<br />
<br />
<br />
WORKING THROUGH THE LAW IS A CRITICAL STEP TO BROADEN THE RECOGNITION OF DIFFERENCE IN THE LAW-THE PLAN PLACES WOMEN WITHIN THE SYMBOLIC ORDER WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO FORMING COALITIONS<br />
<br />
Caldwell same site<br />
“Irigaray’s effort to transform...must repress difference.”<br />
<br />
<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE IS A RADICAL BREAK WITH TEMPORALITY—WE SHOULD VIEW THE PLAN AS OPENING A NEW SPACE/TIME THAT DOES NOT RELY ON PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS—THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO A POLITICS OF BECOMING<br />
<br />
Ewa Plonowska Ziarek, 1998, Diacritics 28.1 (1998) 60-75, Toward a Radical Female Imaginary: Temporality and Embodiment in Irigaray’s Ethics<br />
“Irigaray’s analysis of Descartes’s...spaces of freedom.”<br />
<br />
<br />
A FLUID POLITICS ONLY ASCRIBES IDENTITY TO A UNIVERSAL, WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT OUR ATTACHMENT TO THAT UNIVERSAL IS INCOMPLETE AND SINGULAR IN NATURE. THIS PREVENTS ANY SINGLE SUBJECT FROM NARCISSISTICALLY CLAIMING IT REPRESENTS THE WHOLE, OR IDEAL, SUBJECT<br />
<br />
Caldwell same site<br />
“Aside from fearing that...shaped by it.”<br />
<br />
<br />
OUR THEORY OPENS THE PATH TO RECOGNIZING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALL FORMS OF OPPRESSION, WHILE SOME MAY ESSENTIALIZE OPPRESSION TO A FEMININE/MASCULINE DICHOTOMY, WE NEED NOT<br />
<br />
Caldwell same cite<br />
“If a feminine universal can...necessary exclusion.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The impact is violence<br />
<br />
Margaret Whitford, 1991, Luce Irigaray: Philosophy in the feminine, p 145<br />
&lt;If identity is one...sacrificial victim&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Casey's waiting period and consent requirements deny women the ability to define their own imaginary--it relegates women as subordinate to the fetus<br />
<br />
Pagilaro, 2000, (My coach cut this the day of outrounds and there isn't anything more for a cite<br />

AT: Framework<br />
We meet framework – will defend Supreme Court<br />
We can kritik your disads – language and discourse can be violent<br />
Framework attempts to eradicate difference<br />
<br />
AT: Test Case Specification<br />
No ground loss<br />
C/I – defend normal means – increases ground, most predictable<br />
Being topical checks resolution<br />
Test case irrelevant<br />
<br />
AT: T<br />
Our aff o/t’s undue burden standard<br />
We o/t parental consent<br />
Central question of casey is access to abortion from liberty<br />
Original decision decided against liberty<br />
Interpretation bad – vague plan writing, stale debate, moving target<br />
C/I – aff can allow new precedent and overrule central target<br />
Solves predictability/bidirectionality<br />
Solvency advocate checks<br />
C/I – Caldwell proves we are direct opposition to squo<br />
No abuse – CP’s solve all offense<br />
Competing interpretations bad<br />
<br />
AT: Roberts<br />
We kritik the way the rule of law operates – denies women’s sexuality<br />
Court overrules all the time – Costello 2005<br />
Court overrules 3 times/yr<br />
Spatial metaphors bound – Coppolla 96<br />
Nuclear war representations deny periphery – Kato 93<br />
Representations key – they shape the world – Gorham 99<br />
Attempts to invoke security create a discourse of danger – Dillon 96<br />
<br />
AT: Appointments<br />
Court hears abortion now – X<br />
Alito rule against them – X<br />
Politics is inherently masculine and must be rejected – 99<br />
Environmental representations are managerial – McWhorter 92<br />
<br />
AT: CP<br />
They don’t access the self<br />
Perm do both<br />
DA’s link to CP – Supreme Court inevitably rule<br />
CP not change SCOTUS interpretation of Casey<br />
The way they try to solve discrimination is bad – 93<br />
Sexual difference must be addressed at national level – state actions fails – 98<br />

<h3 id="toc10"><a name="x-UMKC FG Aff-Answers To Major Case Args"></a><em>Answers To Major Case Args</em></h3>
AT: Solvency<br />
We’re not Levinas – there’s no infinite responsibility to the other – Uriguay 91<br />
Zyriek from 1AC answers consequentialism – future oriented politics stops break of political action<br />
Utilitarian actions serve as basis for calculating though – Dillon 96<br />
Zero point of the holocaust – Dillon 96<br />
We change the entire symbolic order<br />
Liberty is a bad standard – need to reject that because it causes denial of rights<br />

Roberts<br />
Solvency<br />
CP<br />
<br />
We meet – we defend entirety of plan, we are key to instrumentality<br />
Predict key to aff – takes out uniqueness args<br />
Stop crying about this – err aff because of topic bias<br />
Plan text focus is only question of topicality<br />
Not extra topical<br />
C/I – you close off space for political engagement<br />
<br />
Topicality:<br />
New grounds must be in direct opposition to old decision<br />
We have solvency advocate – Caldwell<br />
Can CP out of extra topicality<br />
We meet liberty argument<br />
We result in new standard<br />
Stale debate – too few affs<br />
C/I solves limits<br />
Best for neg ground – get overrule CP, DAs and grounds PICs<br />
Aff must prove new holding is mutually exclusive<br />
Not competing interpretations – reasonability<br />
Dunn ev – normal means proves not abusive<br />
<br />
Roberts:<br />
Non unique: overrules three times per year and evidence is from 1958<br />
Cuomo – saying there is a threat causes focus only on politics and ignores structural violence<br />
Kato – representations of nuclear war as singular event is bad. Nuclear testing against third and fourth world face violence – this justifies all atrocities<br />
Status quo is genocide<br />
No link to realism – our evidence just says don’t center around utilitarian claims – Dillon evidence<br />
Representations change politics – Gorham 99 – key to solve the aff<br />
Calculation causes externalization of other<br />
<br />
Solvency:<br />
We kritik their notion of democracy<br />
Undecidability teason to reject neg<br />
Representations turned – you deny difference to squo<br />
<br />
CP:<br />
Permutation – provides cover, deflect blame<br />
Rollback – lower courts won’t follow – Layne 2006<br />
Court rule against CP<br />
Status quo against pro-choice legislation – aff proves it gets overturned<br />
Sexual difference must be addressed at national level – symbol is key<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc12"><a name="x-UMKC FG Aff-2ar Strategy Notes"></a><em>2ar Strategy Notes</em></h3>
Framework:<br />
Plan focus and implementation of plan are not mutually exclusive with critiques of disads<br />
Representations shape political reality – policies constantly shaped and changed by discourse<br />
Most predictable – must defend your rhetoric<br />
<br />
CP:<br />
Low risk of solvency for aff + low risk of disad<br />
No evidence extended for solvency of aff – national level action is the only way to solve for difference in law<br />
They try to repress difference<br />
DA impact is empirically disproven over past 150 rulings – impact evidence is from 1958<br />
No reason why Roberts key<br />
Permutation doesn’t link – looks like state and federal courts are working together<br />
SCOTUS is anti-choice – Court thinks states have constitutional right to have abortion restrictions<br />
<br />
Solvency:<br />
Undecidability is a reason to reject them – they create stable politics<br />
<br />
Roberts:<br />
DA is terminally non-unique – average overrule is 3 cases per year = zero risk of impact<br />
Zyriek – symbolic order of law functions to repress women, this causes genocide<br />
Can’t solve for Cuomo or Dillon – even if consequences important, can’t outweigh the aff<br />
Gorham – representations key to policy action<br />
Kato – the way they represent nuclear violence shapes policy outcome<br />
Saying war is distinct ignores that war is ongoing and happens everyday<br />

“For Negri……of bare life.”<br />
<br />
The element of air outweighs your discussion of being because air constitutes the ontological foundation for all that exists- this revaluation if what has been devalued by western metaphysics is key to subverting problematics of western thought<br />
Ellen Mortensen, 2002, prof of comparative lit @ U of Bergen, Touching thought: ontology and sexual difference, pg 94-5<br />
“Irigaray both……and beings.”<br />
<br />
The abandonment of legal reform by foucauldian legal philosophy is misguided- it posits the struggle between the legal and non-legal instead between juridical and disciplinary. This distinction opens the door for subversive struggles against oppression and violence through the legal sphere- this is an essential ground for subversive politics<br />
Vanessa E Munro, 2001, Deot of Law U Reading, 2001, Journal of Law and Society Vol. 28 Page 546<br />
“In presenting……….legal feminism<br />
<br />
The story of Truismes shows how sexual bodies are easily placed into bare life. Women are marginalized because of the perceived irregularities of their sexuality. Sexual appropriation becomes the first part of a political process that culminates in the categorization of bare life. To not focus on sex specifically allows this to continue against sexed bodies<br />

Use of the symbolic order to control political strategies means you link to our aff, we can only recognize the body as a productive process of becoming after we abandon traditional symbolic structures.<br />

Irigaray’s argument that the visual imaginary….Rather, Irigaray repeats Freuds question about how one becomes woman, as if femininity were a telos<br />

<strong>CP net benefit doesn't solve aff</strong><br />

Irigaray’s critique of the masculine imagery wants to demonstrate….the institution in the profound sense of the term can exist only be posing itself as outside of time…by posing the norm of its immutable identity and by posing itself as the norm<br />
<br />
<strong>Judicial Capital</strong><br />
<br />
Justices do not act with political strategy actions prove that justices do not worry about capital<br />
<br />
Landau 05<br />
<br />
The factual environment renders strategic action unnecessary at least for…thus what matters is the outcome, not the reasoning of the case<br />
<br />
The most recent and convincing evidence concludes against the theory of judicial capital- constraints on the oversight of justices by congress make the court wholly independent<br />
<br />
Brace 99<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court is a highly autonomous institution whose decisions essentially reflect the aggregation of preferences of its members…the Supreme Court’s decisions are not constrained by anticipated reactions from congress.<br />

A/T: Essentialism<br />
<br />
We are the opposite of essentialism- we prevent essentialism by denaturaliuzing the view of woman as the negation of man<br />
<br />
Margaret Whitford, 1991 Luce Irigacy; Philosophy in the Feminine<br />
<br />
The process of naturalization conceals the absence of the women in the symbolic order…needed is a framework which allows access to life and to death to 2 and this has to be a construction the construction of an identity which allows each sex it’s own life and its own mobility.<br />
<br />
We don't essentialize- the affirmative creates a point for exposing the exploitation of women so that each person can create struggles and strategies for their personal situations<br />
<br />
Whitfors, 91<br />
<br />
Irigaray is often askes about her relation to the women’s movement…what Irigaray is doing must be seen as a political strategy<br />
<br />
We are not essentialist<br />
<br />
Deutscher 2002 A Politics of OImpossible Difference: The Later work of Luce Irigaray<br />
<br />
Irigaray does not universalize a concept or essentialize a reality….if she is essentializing anything, she is essentializing its absence throughout the ages<br />
<br />
An ethics of sexual difference forms the basis for all encounters with Others. We must recognize that our sex means we can never complete ourselves as representative of humans, we can only encompass half of humanity at best. This is the negation of negation, denying the validity of drive based ethics and leading to true intersubjectivity<br />
<br />
Schwab in 98<br />
<br />
The way out of the impasse is through the labor of the negative…through the recognition of the limits of the self.<br />

THE LAW HAS NULLIFIED WOMEN’S SELFHOOD THROUGH ITS MASCULINIZING OF THE SELF-AFTER COVERTURE WAS RESCINDED, REPRODUCTIVE LAW HAS BECOME THE SITE OF THIS DENIAL OF AGENCY<br />
<br />

“Feminist critiques, we have seen...gesture of self-renunciation.”<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS DENIAL OF SELFHOOD IS PIVOTAL TO AGENCY—MAKING THE MASCULINE THE NORM CREATES THE FEMININE AS THE OTHER, DEVOID OF PERSONHOOD, IDENTITY, THE LAW RENDERS WOMEN AS MERE BODIES<br />
<br />
Diana Meyers, Feminist Perspectives on the Self, 1st published June 28, 1999, substantive revision Jan 7, 2004; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.science.uva.nl/%7Eseop/entries/feminism-self/" rel="nofollow">http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries//feminism-self/</a><br />
“The topic of the self has long...these angles.”<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS EXCLUSION SACRIFICES WOMEN BY APPEALING TO A UNIVERSAL EQUALITY-IT’S VISION OF EQUALITY AND NEUTRALITY REQUIRES THE EXCLUSION OF MATERIALITY AND DIFFERENCE FROM CONSIDERATIONS IN THE POLITICAL REALM, FORCING POLITICAL BODIES TO SUCCOMB TO THE UNIVERSAL, ABSOLUTIST VISION OF POLITICS<br />
<br />
Anne Caldwell, 2002, Hypatia, 17.4, Transforming Sacrifice: Iragaray and the Politics of Sexual Difference, project Muse<br />
“How does Irigaray see...such as women.”<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS IDEAL OF EQUALITY REQUIRES A SUBJECT, MAN, TO BE POSITED AS NATURAL, AND DEFINED IN COMPARISON TO OTHER SUBJECTS BY DISAVOWING MATERIALITY. THE EQUAL SUBJECT REQUIRES THE EXISTENCE OF LESSER SUBJECTS TO JUSTIFY ITSELF. THE FREEDOM OF DEMOCRACY IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE MASTERY OF THINKING THAT EXCLUDES DIFFERENCE IN THE NAME OF AN AUTONOMOUS SELF<br />

THE ATTEMPT TO VIEW IDENTITY THROUGH ENTRENCHED FORMATIONS CAUSES VIOLENCE AGAINST BOTH THE SELF AND THE OTHER<br />

<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey by ruling that women’s right to choose an abortion is based on a woman’s right to selfhood.<br />
<br />
THE PLAN IS A RADICAL BREAK WITH THE CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS OF EQUALITY AND LIBERTY THAT CURRENTLY UNDERLIE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS<br />
<br />
Caldwell same site<br />
“In Irigaray’s words...because of it.”<br />
<br />
<br />
WORKING THROUGH THE LAW IS A CRITICAL STEP TO BROADEN THE RECOGNITION OF DIFFERENCE IN THE LAW-THE PLAN PLACES WOMEN WITHIN THE SYMBOLIC ORDER WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO FORMING COALITIONS<br />
<br />
Caldwell same site<br />
“Irigaray’s effort to transform...must repress difference.”<br />
<br />
<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE IS A RADICAL BREAK WITH TEMPORALITY—WE SHOULD VIEW THE PLAN AS OPENING A NEW SPACE/TIME THAT DOES NOT RELY ON PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS—THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO A POLITICS OF BECOMING<br />
<br />
Ewa Plonowska Ziarek, 1998, Diacritics 28.1 (1998) 60-75, Toward a Radical Female Imaginary: Temporality and Embodiment in Irigaray’s Ethics<br />
“Irigaray’s analysis of Descartes’s...spaces of freedom.”<br />
<br />
<br />
A FLUID POLITICS ONLY ASCRIBES IDENTITY TO A UNIVERSAL, WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT OUR ATTACHMENT TO THAT UNIVERSAL IS INCOMPLETE AND SINGULAR IN NATURE. THIS PREVENTS ANY SINGLE SUBJECT FROM NARCISSISTICALLY CLAIMING IT REPRESENTS THE WHOLE, OR IDEAL, SUBJECT<br />
<br />
Caldwell same site<br />
“Aside from fearing that...shaped by it.”<br />

1NC Offcase Arguments:<br />
Be as detailed as possible. Just saying &quot;Topicality&quot; isn't particularly helpful. There needs to be some indication as to what the violation is. Try to include an outline of each argument that includes a tag for every card. Whenever you hear an argument that you have not previously heard, you should get complete cites for that argument and include them here.<br />
<br />
Midterms Politics…Conservatives hate VAWA, Feminists love it; if the Republicans feel threatened, they will take a hard-line stance towards China to devalue its currency, which hurts US economic growth, hurts our efforts in the War on Terror, and risks nuclear war (Reardon 01).<br />

Congress CP: no solvency; cross-apply all their own S cards; perm; some attempt at some SOP turn that went nowhere fast<br />

Plan<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 – Challenging Racism<br />
<br />
RACIAL SEGREGATION IN SCHOOLS IS AN ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE WHITE RACIAL PURITY, REINFORCING WHITE SUPREMACY AND RACIST ATTITUDES<br />
<br />
Oh in 2k6 (Reginald, 2006 March, “Defining The Voices Of Critical Race Feminism: Interracial Marriage in the Shadows of Jim Crow: Racial Segregation as a System of Racial and Gender Subordination,” 39 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1321, p lexis)<br />
<br />
Understanding racial segregation in public … maintenance of white supremacy<br />
<br />
SEGREGATION LEADS TO PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SPIRITUAL INVISIBILITY OF THE MINORITY. THIS CREATES A SOCIAL REALITY WHERE WE CAN TOUCH PEOPLE BUT NOT FEEL THEIR PAIN. WE CAN LISTEN TO THEIR CRIES FOR HELP BUT NOT EMPATHIZE WITH THEM OR HEAR THEM IN A WAY THAT WILL LEAD US TO ACT. ONLY FULL ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL RIGHTS WILL CHALLENGE THIS INVISIBILITY<br />
<br />

<br />
Despite the enormous scholarly energy … trapped in this one-way mirror<br />
<br />
RACISM IMPRISONS US ALL AND THREATENS GLOBAL DESTRUCTION. IT MUST BE DISMANTLED BRICK BY BRICK, STONE BY STONE<br />
<br />
Barndt in ‘91 (Joseph, Pastor in the Bronx and Co-director of Crossroads, Dismantling Racism: The Continuing Challenge to White America, p. 155-156)<br />
<br />
To study racism is to study walls … we dare not allow it to continue<br />
<br />
SCHOOL DESEGREGATION AND INCREASED SOCIAL INTERACTION IS KEY TO STOPPING RACISM<br />

<br />
Racial segregation exacts costs … establish friendships and understanding of others<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 – Poverty<br />
<br />
RACISM, SEGREGATION, AND POVERTY ARE ALL LINKED TOGETHER. CHILDREN WHO ATTEND SEGREGATED SCHOOLS ARE 11 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN AREAS OF CONCENTRATED POVERTY<br />
<br />

T Opposite Decision<br />
GSPEC<br />
K of International law<br />
<br />
I Internatoinal Terror<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should hold that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits the use of the classification “enemy combatant.” We reserve the right to clarify intent.<br />
<br />
The bush administrations fundamental fear from the threat of terrorism is that it may undermine democracy and give way to totalitarian politics, thus it is absurd that its response to this percecive threat is to enact edxdac tly that which it condemns. Citing judicial deferenc e and the enemy combatant status mentioned int suprerem court’s quirin decision has eroded democracy and foregone an effective response to terror by denying individuals the right to freedom and a fair trial cementing unlimited sovereign power.<br />
Lon Troyer 03, Sovereitny, Law, Subjectivity 259-276<br />
<br />
Observation I sq<br />
<br />
Quirin based this holding on a simple calculus – first the government has the authority to punish offense defined by interntioanl law and second enemy combatant is a recognized offense, just like spying<br />
Ex parte quirin 42<br />
From the very beginning of its history…punishment by military tribunals<br />
<br />
In this way policymakers today perceived democracy to be under attack, the paradoxical response to this risk has been to shut off democracy itself, strip individuals fo their rights and imprison them indefinitely. This logicl is known as auto-immunity, wehre a political system immunizes itself against its own immunity – or in other words, when democracy kills itself to save itself<br />
Samir Haddad, September 2004, Contretemps, Vol. 4, p. 29-30<br />
<br />
Above all else it it she fear of the other that drivers this process of auto-immunity. The faceless who are presumed to threaten democracy become the justification for massive fviolence against all those who dare to dissent. In this case, the enemy combatant is the othe who we make invisible in order to secure and ordlery world . this is a fundamental denial of ethics and responsibility<br />
Orford 2005, German Law Journal, Vol. 6., No. 1, p. 34-37<br />
While in his early work Derrida…as soon as we open our mouths<br />
<br />
This process is ethically bankrupt our responsibility to the toher is the very foundation of subjectivity itself, preceding questions of ontology and the utilitar ian calculus they engage in – responsibility to the other transcends all other impacts and obligations<br />
Amit Pinchevski, Diacritics 31.2, Summer 2001, p. 77<br />
In order to reencounter the Other’s side of the freedom to speak…it’s first word is “Welcome.”<br />
<br />
This is particularly dangerous in the context of auto-immunity, it’s a logic qulatiiatviely different from other forms of conflict what iat stake is nothing less than the existence of the world, but at infite risk because the threat that democracy feels it must protect itself from is equally invinite<br />
Ivan Callus, SuSummer 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reconstruction.ws/043/callus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.reconstruction.ws/043/callus.htm</a><br />
It needs to be said immediately that if…the grammar of the future anterior<br />
<br />
In this way evne in the face of globalization schmitt’s monster is still alive and well it has just changed tactics. The means by which the modern sovereign maintains its power over the state of exception is through the partial and overlapping compliance iwht international law. This is particularly true of the bush administrations dealings in the war on terror. While functioning within the coordinates of international reservations understandings and holdings have created a system of international law whereby nit is nothing more than a tool for the bush administration to declare individuals like Hamdi and Hmadan life that is devoid of meaning by arguing that international law and the ICCPR are not binding.<br />
International emergency governance : fragments of a driverless system, critical sense, Vik Kanwar Volume XII Number 1 Spring 2004<br />
The state of “exceptionalism”: on the misue and disuse<br />
<br />
The enemies of international law have invaded the law itself, the only strategy of resistance in this world is to ensure that human rights never be derogated or reserved out of, basing the plan on the ICCPR even though thte treaty is not self executing ensures a reversal of the Bush strategy to use international law to undermine international law, Goldman “Of treaties and torture: how the supreme court can restrain the executive, Duke Law Journal, December 2005, 55 Duke L.J. 609<br />

Overturning quirin is thus an act of hospitality, a politically positive response to violence undertaken against alterirty. Ane theic of hospitality toward the other should be prioritized over their disads and defense of utilitarianism brecuase literally no toher value, even life itself is possilbve without our prior relationship to the other. While calculation is inevitable and useful, the incalculable must win out over calculation to act on our responsibility<br />

As Zehfuss m akes clear in her articles…challenging Western ethical discourse<br />

Contention II The End of the Social Relation<br />
The end point fo executive control of international law is this rigidifciation and codification of the public sphere ensuring total sovereign power.<br />
Goldman 05<br />
<br />
Adv 2 – Derrida Version<br />
<br />
This undermines and precludes any relation to the other<br />
<br />
Richard Beardsworth, Derrida &amp; the Political, 1996<br />
The Kantian idea of sovereignty …the monarchic despot<br />
<br />
And this makes authoritarianism and extinction inevitable – their scheme of dec isionmaking will insist that pure utilitarian consequences are literally the only way to make decisions. This is both untrue and a fundamentally violent way to approach the world. utilitarianisms inevitable failure to account for radical alterity must be questioned hbeofre any responsible decision can be made. Their decision calculus is set up to fail and cannot function in the real world of human interaction<br />
Nick Smith 97, Buffalo Law Review, 45 Buffalo L. Rev. 503, p. 504-509<br />
Numerous jurisprudential books and articles… and incommensurability theory<br />
<br />
And next is neverending war – their disada nd system of calculation are part of a system of politics that simply refuses to believe that human suffering matters – their preoccupation with notions like hegemony and the international balance of power subordinates ethics. A vote for the negative framework nesures massiv systemic violence and internal link turns their scenario<br />
Richard Falk 2000, Human Rights Horizons: The Pursuit of Justice in a Globalizing World, p. 173-175<br />
Every phase in the history of international relations and world order…such a peace is never peaceful<br />
<br />
Also it’s try or ide, their disads are a rationalization of the other’s suffering which si the root of violence means their impacts are inevitable<br />
