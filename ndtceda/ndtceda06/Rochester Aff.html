Ob1. Inherency<br />
The US V. Morrison Decision prevents congress from legislating a civil remedy for violence against womyn Harper 06 (Gonzales v. Raich: Has New Federalism Gone Up in Smoke?” 57 Mercer L. Rev 1309, Summer)<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court used the rational basis test to create a new standard, determining that rape is non-economic activity and that it’s economic correlation is irrational Goldberg 01 (“Substantial Activity and Non_Economic Commerce: Toward a New Theory of the Commerce Clause,´9 J.L. &amp; Pol’y 563)<br />
<br />
Plan: In the next relevant test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in United States V. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), by using the rational basis standard of review to determine that gender violence is covered under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. CX is for questions.<br />
<br />
Ob2. Harms<br />
Commerce<br />
Economic transactions which are non-market and non-capitalist are not prioritized by the system. This leads to marginalization of femininity in the market The answer is tot expand our notions of economic Gibson-Graham 96 (The end of capitalism (as we know it), HB 501 .6447 1996 260-261)<br />
<br />
Though the Morrison decision sought to obscure this fact, violence against womyn is pervasively economic Ackerman 99 (from amicus curie brief cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/vaw/readings/library/profamicuspet.html)<br />
<br />
Only by identifying the political with the economic can we positively and productively challenge social problems- Any alternative masks the machinations of capitalist power Althusser 73 (Lenin and Philosophy, Monthly Review Press NY pg. 8-10)<br />
<br />
Subjugation<br />
Morrison’s refusal to make gender violence a federal issue reflects a public/private split used to subjugate womyn Saylor 02 (“Federalism and the Fmaily after Morrison: An Examination of the Child Support Recovery Act, the Freedom of Accessto Clinic Entrances Act, and a Federal Law Outlawing Gun Possession by Domestic Violence Abusers,” 25 Harvard Women’s Law Journal 57, Spring)<br />
<br />
A lack of legal recourse makes gender violence the easiest and least punishable type of violence in our system, continuing to subordinate female concerns. Gender violence must be seen as public or it will not stop. MacKinnon 00 (Catharine – prof law Michigan – 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135)<br />
<br />
Female Inequality is a form of private torture by which they cannot escape the gender-based power imbalance. Meyersfeld 03 (Fellow at Intl. Human Rights Clinic at Yale School of Law, “Reconceptualizing Domestic Violence in International Law,” 67 Alb. L. Rev. 371)<br />
<br />
Violence against women follows a genocidal pattern MacKinnon 06 (Women’s September 11th: Rethinking the International Law of Conflict,” 47 Harvard Int. L. Journal 1. Winter 06)<br />
<br />
Rape<br />
Confining rape to the private sphere prevents solving it Bevacqua and Baker 04 (Profs at Minnesota State and Berry college, respectively. “Pay No Attention to the Man Behind the Curtain: Power, Privacy, and the Legal Regulation of Violence Against Women,” Women &amp; Politics, Vol. 26(3/4) 04)<br />
<br />
Rape is a fate worse than death Mesiter 03 (Spring 03 “Murdering Innocence: The constitutionality of Capital Child Rape Statutes,” 45 Ariz. L. Rev. 197)<br />
<br />
Ob3. Solvency<br />
Civil Remedies repoliticize the law and challenge the relegation of womyn to the private and local spheres, sending a signal which break down gender, racial, and class domination Benedict 02 (“United States v. Morrison: Progressive Legislation is Down, but not Out,” 33 University of Toledo Law Review 411, Winter)<br />
<br />
Only by itendifying violence as economic violence linked to the state can we resist extermination of populations- Any alternative fails to understand the state, society, or capital Althusser 73 (Lenin and Philosophy, Monthly Review Press NY pg. 138-140)<br />
<br />
Without the constrictions of patriarchy, womyn would be empowered and society could reach a higher potential Wrangham 96 (Demonic Males: Apes and the origins of human violence. Coauthored by Dale Peterson. Houghton Mifflin, Chap 12.)<br />

Quirin affirmed the ability to designate persons enemy combatants<br />
- Washington Post, August 4, 06; A19<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should grant cert to a relevant test case and overrule Ex Parte Quirin (317 U.S. 1.1942) holding that the designation of “unlawful combatants” is unconstitutional. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
Advantage 1: Bunker Busters<br />
<br />
Use of tactical nuclear weapons and bunker busters are illegal in the context of sieges of enclosed spaces such as bunkers and caves, they violate numerous international accords.<br />
- James D. Fry, Contextualized Legal Reviews for the Methods and Means of Warfare: Cave Combat and International Humanitarian Law, 2006<br />
“during the Cold War….bombs on caves”<br />
<br />
The US is exploiting Quirin to create a legal loophole allowing for the use of these weapons in the context of caves by defining the persons within them as unlawful combatants. This designation allows us to ignore these legal restraints as they are not covered by international accords.<br />
- James D. Fry, Contextualized Legal Reviews for the Methods and Means of Warfare: Cave Combat and International Humanitarian Law, 2006<br />
“While customary….patently unlawful”<br />
<br />
Classification is what justifies pre-emptive strikes<br />
- Marco Sassoli, Use and Abuse of the Laws of War in the “War on Terrorism”, 2004<br />
<br />
The impact is a blurring between conventional and nuclear weapons which causes more destruction and leads to things like DU weapons and an encouragement of the use of nuclear weapons.<br />
- Kovel and Campell, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.revelation2seven.org/WebPages/SideLinks/The%20AmericanMilitaryIndustrialComplex.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.revelation2seven.org/WebPages/SideLinks/The AmericanMilitaryIndustrialComplex.htm</a>, 2003<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: North Korea<br />
<br />
Bush’s policy of pursuing new nuclear weapons such as Bunker Busters is what is causing North Korea’s feelings of insecurity and this the current situation in East Asia.<br />
- Los Angeles Time, October 15, 2006; Part M, Page 1<br />
<br />
North Korea perceives bunker busters technology as aimed against it<br />
- Washington Post, June 22, 2003; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A212142003Jun22?language=printer" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A212142003Jun22?language=printer</a><br />
<br />
NOKO perceives attack strategies on Afghanistan and Iraq as the future for it, this insecurity is exacerbated by our usage of bunker busters<br />
- Desaix Anderson, 2003, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nautilius.org/fora/security/0335" rel="nofollow">http://www.nautilius.org/fora/security/0335</a><br />
<br />
New RRW program is designed to allow for the building of new nuclear bunker buster, spawning proliferation and destabilizing North Korea.<br />
-Civak, January 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tivalleycares.org/TVC_RRW_FNL.pdf#search='Nuclear%2C%20Shifted%20Funding%2C%202006" rel="nofollow">http://www.tivalleycares.org/TVC_RRW_FNL.pdf#search=’Nuclear%2C%20Shifted%20Funding%2C%202006</a>’<br />
<br />
RRW leads to bunker tactical nukes<br />
-Civak, January 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tivalleycares.org/TVC_RRW_FNL.pdf#search='Nuclear%2C%20Shifted%20Funding%2C%202006" rel="nofollow">http://www.tivalleycares.org/TVC_RRW_FNL.pdf#search=’Nuclear%2C%20Shifted%20Funding%2C%202006</a>’<br />
<br />
Observation 3: Solvency<br />
<br />
Legal review is uniquely key now, the alternative is arms faces that end in the final downward spiral<br />
-James D. Fry, Contextualized Legal Reviews for the Methods and Means of Warfare: Cave Combat and International Humanitarian Law, 2006<br />
<br />
Legal review is key to checking unlawful uses of weapons like tactical nuclear weapons<br />
- James D. Fry, Contextualized Legal Reviews for the Methods and Means of Warfare: Cave Combat and International Humanitarian Law, 2006<br />
<br />
Overturning Quirin fills in a void in US law concerning international issues, and allows us to preserve the rule of law, which will deteriorate without reform<br />

Observation 1: Planned parenthood v. Casey<br />

Lexis.<br />
“The battleground over abortion involves . . . which basically translates into virtually no lobbying power as well.”<br />
<br />
These laws put women in a dangerous situation – they do not deter women from obtaining abortions but result in domestic violence and deadly unsafe abortions<br />

Plan: At the next available opportunity the United States supreme Court should grant cert to a relevanant test case and overrule planned parenthood v. Casey 505 US 833 (1992), holding that parental notification and parental consent requirements are unconstitutional.<br />
<br />
Observation 2: The Myth of the Youth<br />
<br />
Construction of youth in parental consent laws is an attempt to depict the young as innocent angels who must be protected from the evils of sexuality – pregnancy becomes a punishment for young women who experience sexual desire.<br />
Northcraft, above.<br />
<br />
Suppression of minor women’s sexuality.<br />
J. Shoshanna <u>Ehrlich,</u> “Symposium: Science politics and reproductive rights: from age of consent laws to the Silber Righ Thing” : the regulation of adolescent female sexuality, health matrix: journal of law-medicine, winter, <u>2k6</u><br />
“We are presently in an era of intense . . . funded abstinence – only education.”<br />
<br />
But the lack of which myth of youth attempts to fill is structurally necessary it cannot be erased – we must take a radical and profound responsibility for these fantasies to avoid holocaust and war<br />
Jan <u>Jagodzinski</u> Prof at University of Alberta, “Youth Fantasies: The perverse Landscape of the Media, Palgrave macmillan, <u>2k4</u><br />
“History has judged that all those . . . utmost importance for future direction.”<br />
<br />
<br />
This conception of youth embodies a fantasy of erasing differences to achieve an impossible state of purity – such a recognition is critical to grand narrative of progress<br />
<u>Jagodzinski ,above</u><br />
“ In Lacan’s later writing . . . elaborates an “initial foregting.”<br />
<br />
IMperliasm and racist project through state disavowal of its violence<br />
<u>Jagodzinski</u><br />
“The romantic fantasy of the pure child . . . remain progressive and forever young.”<br />
<br />
The confession of youth sexuality is an act intended to hold together societal order as such deviation can be punished with violence – we demand the other conform to our demand for difference and similarity so as to transfer them responsibility for our impure desire<br />
<u>Jagodzinski</u><br />
“Take shows are where moral panic . . . putting a human face to the intolerable deviant act.”<br />

Observation One: Inherency<br />
<br />
The Milliken case, more than any other, marked the end of the quest to desegregate American schools<br />

Observation Two: Racism<br />
<br />
The Milliken decision makes segregation and educational inequality inevitable<br />

Observation Three: Suburbanization<br />
<br />
Since the Brown v. Board case, “white flight” has led to the increasing suburbanization of populations in the U.S.<br />

This type of urban-suburban division creates the myth of different “races;” the impact is perpetual oppression<br />

Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974), by upholding that a federal court may impose a multidistrict remedy for single-district school segregation violations<br />
<br />
Observation Four: Solvency<br />

OBS I: SEPARATE IS UNEQUAL<br />
<br />
Brown v Board stymied by Milliken. Only de-jure segregation is actionable. Many now believe constitution prevents race-consciouness<br />

The effects of de-jure and de-facto segregation are the same – they concentrate poverty and rig the game of life<br />
<br />
SUSAN EATON 04, www.vqronline.org/articles/2004/winter/eaton-browns-faint-revival/<br />
<br />
Northern-style segregation … rigs the game of life<br />
<br />
Recent court cases charging that High Stakes Educational Testing produce a disparate impact on people of color fail because of the difficulty proving de-jure segregation in racist courts<br />

No Child … tide of resegregation<br />

Testocracy is similar in function to jim crow literacy tests. As the poor fail, they experience the worse marginalization of racial capitalism<br />
<br />
Johnson 04 (same as above)<br />
<br />
According to R. Scott … race and class<br />
<br />
Construction of other as outsider is a violence that is prior to action. Failure to remedy = ceaseless conflict<br />

Andrew Taslitz notes, …. Ultimately born.<br />
<br />
PLAN: The USSC should overrule the decision of Milliken v Bradley by granting a writ of cert. for litigation regarding the constitutionality of high stakes testing. The court will rule, in opposition to milliken, that evidence of de-facto segregation constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the constituion of the United States of America<br />

Abu-Lughod uses … the marginalization of students of color<br />

Accepting racism,sexism,and classism make oppression seam normal – vote affirmative to act as a wedge against the ideological normalization of injustice<br />
