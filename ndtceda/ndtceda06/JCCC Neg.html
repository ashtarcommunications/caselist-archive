Identity Kritik<br />
<br />
-Disciplinary power works with law and social constructions to produce identities as categories that normalize social behavior.<br />
Brown ’93 (Wendy, “Wounded Attachment” Political Theory, Vol. 21, NO. 3 August 1993, p. 390-410)<br />
<br />
-Affirmatives stance is the will that creates the universal, which results in the paranoid economy of the state – this universalism exists to exclude and annihilate<br />
Butler ’00 (Judith, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Judith Butler, Ernesto Laclan and Slavoj Zizek)<br />
<br />
-In order to avoid the risks of discourse of reality we should reconceptualize modernistic creations of identity before engaging in politics.<br />
Butler ’00 (same as above)<br />
<br />
<br />
LEGITIMACY DISAD<br />
<br />
-Uniq: SC has legitimacy now, susceptible to shifts<br />
Gibsonn &amp; Souers ’06 (James &amp; Sidney, “The legitimacy of the US Supreme Court in a polarized polity, june 15)<br />
<br />
-Link: Overruling precedent destroys stare decisis and legitimacy<br />
Banks ’99 (Christopher, Akron Law Review)<br />
<br />
-Internal Link: Activism destroys rights and snowballs – one decision opens floodgates to tyranny<br />
Wolfe ’97 (Christopher, Judical Activism, p. 44-45)<br />
<br />
-Impact: Each invasion of liberty must be resisted<br />
Petro ’74 (Univ of Toledo Law Review, Spring p. 480)<br />
<br />
<br />
HOLLOW HOPE DISAD<br />
<br />
Link: Courts do produce change – they cause movements to change focus from successful legislation to unsuccessful litigation<br />
Rosenburg ’91 (“The Hollow Hope, p. 343)<br />
<br />
This turns case: social activism will create a myth of rights which cause complicity<br />
Southworth ’99 (Ann, The Boston Public Interest Law Journal, Spring 8 B.U&gt; Pub. INt. L.J.<br />

COUNTERPLAN: The United States Congress will, using the power granted to it under the Morgan<br />
Doctrine and Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, overrule _&lt;insert aff case&gt;_<br />
through legislation. Funding and enforcement guaranteed via normal means, ask and we’ll clarify.<br />
Observation I is Topicality—CP is not topical; congressional action violates agent specified in the<br />
resolution.<br />

Observation II is Competition—<br />
A Subpoint; any permutation would link to the courts disad—congressional action does not directly<br />
involve the court<br />
