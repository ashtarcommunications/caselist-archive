Lower courts CP: The 13 federal appellate courts should underrule United States v. Morrison by holding that the “rational basis” test demonstrates the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act under the auspices of the Commerce Clause. The United States Supreme Court should decline to hear any and all appeals to the courts’ decisions.<br />

<br />
CP: The United States Supreme Court should vacate all cases pertaining to the war on terror detainees and the habeas rights of enemy combatants and deny certiorari for any cases currently being appealed to the Supreme Court in these areas. The Supreme Court should issue a statement on the orders list that the executive veto of a bill undermining habeas rights would be unconstitutional under Article I Section 9 of the Constitution of the United States.<br />

MCA<br />
A. Congress will overrule the MCA and assert rights for detainees now<br />
Washington Post 2/23/07. “A Congressional Duty; legislators should not expect courts to undo the lawmakers’ error of depriving foreign detainees of a fundamental right.” Lexis<br />
“On the first day of the new Congress…prosecuted by the military commissions.”<br />

Aziz Huq, Brennan Ctr for Justice Liberty and National Project director, 3/5/07. “Habeas Requires Congressional Action.”<br />
“Partisans of the rule of law…filed more than five years ago.”<br />
2. Congress not respecting courts decimates foreign modeling of US democracy<br />

“Beyond the constitutional defects….in vindicating the rule of law.”<br />

Noah Feldman, “Our Presidential Era: Who Can Check the President?” 1/8/06<br />
“The lesson for the balance of powers…Just how it changes, though, is up to us.”<br />

<br />
A. Interpretation – Overrule is to rule contrary to original decision’s holding<br />
<br />
1. Overrule is to decide the same point of law contrary to the earlier decision<br />
Mellinkoff’s Dictionary of American Legal Usage 1992 David Mellinkoff (Professor of Law Emeritus UCLA) p. 455<br />
overrule<br />
to render a decision disapproving<br />
distinguished from reverse (see).<br />
2. Decision is the holding<br />
<br />
Radin Law Dictionary 1985 Max Radin, Ph. D, Law Professor at Berkley p. 85<br />
<br />
DECISION. The holding made<br />
which it is to decide.<br />
C. Reasons to vote negative<br />
1. Limits – explodes the negative burden because anything could be topical. There are hundred of treaties, international agreements, amendments, and legal doctrines that could justify a court action, but there is only a small number that actually have been considered by the Court<br />
<br />
2. Ground – Court decisions are merited on their precedential value, which is determined by the grounds of the decision. We lose all stable ground when a decision can have an unpredicted precedential affect – they can claim a huge advantage off of ruling on a ground that has nothing to do with the original case<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc18"><a name="Pre NDT--Topicality: Overrule = Explicit"></a><em>Topicality: Overrule = Explicit</em></h3>
<br />
Overruling the decision requires explicit &amp; substantial denunciation of central holdings<br />

<h3 id="toc19"><a name="Pre NDT--Test Case"></a><em>Test Case</em></h3>
<br />
Test Case Spec<br />
A. Violation: The affirmative plan does not specify the test case in which the Court overrules [Casey, Milliken, Morrison, or Quirin]. The plan must name the test case and the affirmative must provide evidence that the grounds on which they overrule are at issue in the test case.<br />
B. Voting Issue:<br />
1. Ground: The affirmative’s choice of test case is critical to negative ground, including disads relating to the specific facts of the test case and counterplans to rule on a different case or on different grounds that are at issue in the test case. The case must be named in the plan to ensure that counterplans compete and to maximize the value of negative pre-round preparation, which is especially important at the beginning of the year when strategies are not yet fully developed.<br />
2. Education: The Court never decides cases in the absence of a real controversy or on grounds that are not briefed by the parties as relevant issues in the case. Failure to require test case specification eliminates education about Court procedures.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc20"><a name="Pre NDT--Ground Spec"></a><em>Ground Spec</em></h3>
<br />
A: Interpretation- the affirmative must specify the grounds the plan is ruled on.<br />
<br />
<br />
B: The aff fails to do this- it’s a voting issue:<br />
<br />
1) Ground- grounds specification is crucial to disad links, counterplan ground and the best kritiks on the topic- ruling on different grounds has drastically different effects on the future of the law and the response to the decision-<br />
<br />
AND- the process is crucial- the reaction to the court turns on its specific justifications<br />
Caminker, University of Michigan Law Professor, 99 [Evan, 97 Mich. L. Rev. 2297, August]<br />
<br />
a. Adjudication as<br />
Process, not result, is paramount.<br />
<br />
2) Education- this is a courts topic and we should learn about court processes and constitutional decision-making- not specifying grounds destroys education about how the court arrives at its decisions and nullifies the best literature on the result of different constitutional interpretations<br />
<br />
<br />
3) No solvency- decisions without grounds have no legal weight and will be thrown out<br />
Post, UC-Berkeley Law Professor, 01 [Robert, 85 Minn. L. Rev. 1267, May]<br />
<br />
So, for example, the editors<br />
give for the opposing view.<br />

Unique link – courts use agenda-setting to defer to congress and avoid conflict – fiated nature of the plan destroys this<br />
Geyh, 2006, When Courts and Congress Collide, 231-2<br />
“There are very few cases that the Supreme Court is required by law to hear…unwanted fights with Congress.”<br />
<br />
And these conflict avoidance doctrines are the lynchpin to avoiding congressional retaliation<br />
Geyh, 2006, 223-24<br />
“The restraint that Congress has traditionally exhibited toward…solicitous of the desires of Congress.”<br />
<br />
Unique link – Roberts is placating congress by meeting with legislators – the plan throws a wrench into these efforts<br />
LA times, 7-14, 2006<br />
“In a wide-ranging speech that touched…meet legislators more often.”<br />
<br />
Robert’s conciliatory approach was a great fresh start with Congress<br />
Washington Post, 4-21, 2006<br />
“Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that his appointment….clear choice,” the chief justice said.”<br />
<br />
Even without the threat immediate retaliation, court deference is critical to maintaining judicial independence<br />

“This chapter, in turn, suggests that the courts assist in the care…begins to make sense.”<br />
<br />
AT won’t pass<br />

Previous cycles of court-congress relations prove nothing – previous bills were all close<br />
Geyh, 2006, 260<br />
“The independence norms described and defended…those norms unnecessary to their preservation.”<br />

Congress has the courts in their cross-hairs – tense relations means passage remains a possibility<br />
Degirolami, 2005, 10 Tex. J. on C.L. and C.r. 111, Spring<br />
“The apparent state of relations [between congress…manifested in several recent bills.”<br />
<br />
Now is key – public perception of the court is dropping, making retaliation a real possibility<br />
Geyh, 2006, 263<br />
“More recent data suggests that the public has become increasingly…another cycle of court-directed animus.”<br />

Ruling on abortion would force moderate pro-choice Republicans out the party<br />
Rosen, 2003, Worst Choice, online<br />
“And, even if a handful of state legislatures did pass…it could make a significant difference.”<br />

Key republican lawmakers have conceded that outlawing abortion would make democrats more appealing to swings voter<br />

“The experience of the pro-choice movement is instructive…pro-life movement politically.”<br />

Overturning the right to abortion would force nominally “pro-life” republicans to side with democrats<br />
