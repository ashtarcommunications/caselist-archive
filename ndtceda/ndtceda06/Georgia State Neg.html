Counter Plan<br />
Text – The United States Supreme Court should rule that “enemy combatant” cases should be evaluated using deferential review and that Rasul and Hamdi protections apply to longterm detainees at overseas facilities<br />
The Court should also rule that the Death Penalty can no longer be used for terrorists extradited from other countries<br />
<br />
David Martin, Ilaw prof at UVA, 2k5 (25 B.C. Third World L.J. 125, lexis)<br />
Upon closer analysis, however, there are two worthwhile responses to this concern. First, as noted above, the Supreme Court seems likely to insist on other structural or procedural guarantees of the neutrality of the decisionmaker, even though that person can be a military officer. <a name="r123"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.lexis-nexis.com/universe/document?_m=cf284351be98aec820273939d300101b&amp;_docnum=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkVA&amp;_md5=5bd0fa4a6ac30c6bd84ea8569485671d#n123" rel="nofollow">**123** </a>  Insulating the hearing officer from the base commander's authority, or requiring appellate review by a wholly separate and specialist appellate unit, are possible steps that reviewing courts could require. Structures and procedures can be evaluated fully by the reviewing court without directly evaluating the rightness or wrongness of the factual conclusions. Second, those who harbor this concern see the review process in overly formalistic terms. We must instead consider exactly how such a process, even with a highly deferential standard governing factual review, operates in actual practice, and we must see it from the differing standpoints of the key players involved. While detainees' advocates may feel that they are greatly disadvantaged by the court's inability to probe factual findings, the other players will have a considerably different perspective on the actual reach of the court's writ.<br />

Agamben (mostly cited except these cards):<br />
The political exception is at stake in and drives abortion debates. No matter which side one takes, biology and politics merge into dangerous caesuraes which constantly divide and define life. This relationship of abandonment is a political problem and must be confronted.<br />
Alfred Goodson, 2006, “Outsourcing Malthus: Bare life and Demographic Reason”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iablis.de/iablis_t/2006/goodson06.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.iablis.de/iablis_t/2006/goodson06.html</a><br />
“More is at….concept of life.”<br />
<br />
The Bush adminstration’s stance on abortion is just one manifestation of the way the anthropological machine reduces people to bare life in order to include ot write them out of the script of humanity. This is exactly why it is so dangerous to appeal to these situations with invocations of human rights- it is the sovereign who is human and who is not.<br />
Zach Formwalt, “Exemplary Violence in the War on Teerrorism”, 9/11/06<br />
“What is really at stake here…..necessary condition.”<br />
<br />
The impact is not inevitable- the alternative places us in a movement that is the only hope to resist violent biopolitics<br />
Agamben, The State of Exception, 05, page 86-87<br />
“The aim of this…….civil war.”<br />
<br />
Questions of ontology must be asked and answered first because they are a fundamental and inescapable basis for any line of thinking<br />

Test Case T – gotta specify it.<br />
Critique – the mystery of life is indeterminate (Goodsen 2006), all progress for women’s rights happens within the confines of a system of state biopower (Agamben), Alt – Rjct the aff’s politics, whatever being is the tops, there’s no common identity (Caldwell)<br />
Federalism – Roberts is pro-states rights, the Casey decision was deferential to states rights, calabresi card.<br />
Court DA – Respect for Stare Decisis insulates the Court from charges of politicization, overrules are perceived as politically motivated, impact is solvency take-out - lack of respect for the decision undermines compliance/enforcement.<br />

A. Solvency<br />
Even minimally intrusive federal review prompts massive internal change in military procedures ensuring adequate protection of individual rights. The counterplan works for three reasons. First, it strengthens the hand of internal officers who want reform, second it results in fear of outside review, and third, it allows for outside review when necessary<br />

AGAMBEN KRITIK<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE’S RELIANCE ON THE DISCOURSE OF RIGHTS IS SELF-DEFEATING. THE ABILITY TO TRY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN MILITARY TRIBUNALS IS UTLIMATLEY THE RESULT OF THE STATE OF EXCEPTION—A CONSTANT STATE OF EMERGENCY INVOKED BY THE SOVEREIGN TO MASK THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF ITS USE OF FORCE. THE AFF’S BRAND OF REFORMISM ONLY STRENGTHENS THE SYSTEM THAT CAUSED THEIR HARMS IN THE FIRST PLACE<br />
Dochterman, 02 (Zen, anarchist theorist, “An Anarchist Analysis of the Detention of Immigrants and War,” aporiajournal.tripod.com/detention.htm)<br />
The State has assumed extensive control over a number of areas<br />
<br />
WE MUST REALIZE THE DOUBLE MOVEMENT OF EVERY STEP IN WHAT THE 1AC CALLS PROGRESS—THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES WON BY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS REQUIRES AN INCREASING INSCRIPTION OF LIFE WITHIN SOVERIEGN POWER. THE AFF IGNORES THE WAY ‘HUMANITY’ IS POLITICALLY CONSTRUCTED TO WRITE CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS FORM THE SCRIPT<br />
Whyte, 02 (Jess, PHD candidate in Monash U’s Centre for Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies, “The human is a battleground” stateofemergency.nomasters.org/reader/human.html)<br />
How then do we respond to this new biopolitical control? The primary response to the inscription of biological life<br />
<br />
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TERM “UNLAWFUL COMBANTANT” IS JUST ONE MANIFESTATION OF THE WAY THE ANTHROPOLICAL MACHINE REDUCES PEOPLE TO BARE LIFE IN ORDER TO WRITE THEM OUT OF THE SCRIPT OF HUMANITY. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY IT IS SO DANGEROUS TO APPEAL TO THESE SITUATIONS WITH INVOCATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS—IT IS THROUGH THE FIGURE OF THE INHUMAN THAT HUMANITY ITSELF IS CONSTRUCTED<br />
Whyte, 02 (Jess, PHD candidate in Monash U’s Centre for Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies, “The human is a battleground” stateofemergency.nomasters.org/reader/human.html)<br />
This has become most evident in the context of the war on terror, and internment by the United States of thousands of people termed “unlawful combatants”,<br />
<br />
WE MUST REJECT THE USE OF SECURITY AS A RATIONALE FOR POLICY. THE ALTERNATIVE IS AN INFINITELY DESTRUCTIVE GLOBAL CIVIL WAR AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR OWN GOVERNMENT INTO A MECHANISM OF GLOBAL TERROR<br />
Agamben, professor of philosophy, 05 (Giorgio,“Security &amp; terror,” Theory &amp; Event, vol 5(4))<br />
Today we are facing extreme and most dangerous developments of this paradigm of security<br />
<br />
THE SOVERIEGN DECISION OVER LIFE ROBS IT OF ANY VALUE— PEOPLE BECOME THE STANDARD UNIT OF CURRENCY IN THE POLITICAL ARITHMETIC OF STATES<br />
Dillon, professor of politics at the University of Lancaster, 1999 (Micheal, “Another Justice&quot; in Political Theory; Vol 27, No. 2,<br />
April; p.165.)<br />
The very indexicality required of sovereign subjectivity gave rise rather to a<br />
commensurability<br />
<br />
THUS WE OFFER THE FOLLOWING ALTERNATIVE<br />
TEXT: THE ALTERNATIVE IS A REJECTION OF THE AFFIRMATIVE’S ATTEMPT TO CONSTITUTE US AS BIOPOLITICAL AGENTS, A REJECTION OF THE CALL TO PROTECT RIGHTS, A REJECTION OF THE ENTIRE TRADITION OF SOVEREIGN CLASSIFICATIONS AND DISCOURSE, AND THE EMBRACING OF WHAT AGAMBEN CALLS “WHATEVER BEING.”<br />
SIMPLE REJECTION OF THE 1AC IS ENOUGH TO GIVE US ACCESS TO THIS FORM OF BEING THAT DEFIES VIOLENT BIOPOWER BY CLAIMING NO COMMON IDENTITY.<br />

Agamben Kritik<br />
Giorgio Agamben Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life pg 181-2<br />
<br />
Simple rejection of the 1ac is enough to give us access to this form of being that defies violent biopower by claiming no common identity<br />
Anne Caldwell Theory and Event (7:2)<br />
“This expansion of the range of life meriting protection…made up of whatever life, appears.”<br />
<br />
The political exception is at stake in and drives abortion debates. No matter which side one takes, biology and politics merge into dangerous caesuraes which constantly divide and define life. This relationship of abandonment is a political problem and must be confronted.<br />
Alfred C. Goodson 2006 “Outsourcing Malthus: Bare Life and Demographic Reason” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iablis.de/iablis_t/2006/goodson06.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.iablis.de/iablis_t/2006/goodson06.html</a><br />
“More is at stake here than the hard facts of immigration…oceanic as the concept of life.”<br />

Bush’s stance on abortion is just one manifestation—it is the sovereign who decides who is human and not<br />

“What is really at stake here…continues to produce ‘terrorism’ as its necessary condition.”<br />

Accepting the role of affirmative would have us play moves us further into the status of sacred life, were we all beome lice waiting to be exterminated<br />

We must engage in an active forgetting. Critique is not enough, it remains confined within the larger discursive stories of the status quo<br />
Roland Bleiker ’01 (The Zen of International Relations: IR Theory from East to West, p. 38-41)<br />
“The prime objective of this essay . . . practice of world politics”<br />
<br />
Forgetting must be an active process that refuses to engage the orthodox stories. It is a negative process that opens up possibilities for dialogical understanding<br />
Bleiker ’01 (above, p. 38-41)<br />
“To forget orthodox IR theory is not to ignore . . . . remembering is a form of forgetting.”<br />
<br />
Searching for and critiquing causal origins to modern problems is not effective. Only an active forgetting makes room for new thinking<br />
Bleiker ’01 (above, p. 38-41)<br />
“How, then, are we to start forgetting . . . stories about world politics”<br />

Went for federalism and case.<br />
<br />
On case<br />
<br />
Brazilian federalism low now<br />
Stepan, 2000 (Alfred, “brazil’s decentralized federalism: bringing government closer to citizens?” deadalus, 129, 145-170, Spring<br />
<br />
There is nothing intrinsic to democratic federal….most unequal of all the federal systems.<br />
<br />
Brazil models<br />
Souza, 2002 (prof of resources at the federal university of bahia, celenda “brazil: the prospects of a center-contstraining federation in a fragmented politity, Spring, 2002<br />
<br />
Brazil has been a federal country….(brasilia) and 5,561 municipalities.<br />
<br />
Co-op fism will never work<br />
Walker, 95 (“The rebirth of federalism, pg 15) Director of the institute of public and urban affairs, U of Connecticut.<br />
The above twelve distinctive…federalism as some pundits would have it.<br />
<br />
Brazilian federalism some democracy when conflict erupts<br />
Souza, above<br />
<br />
Indonesia collapse leads to internal violence, regional destabilization and proxy wars<br />
Menon, 2001 (Rajan Menon, Monroe J. Prof of IR at Lehigh University, Fall 2001, The national interest (lexis load date, sept 19, 2001)<br />
Refugee flows will also accelerate if Indonesia….south china sea, and could provide another motive.<br />
<br />
Decentralization is key to solve Kashmir<br />
Chaudhuri, 94 (prof of poly sci at ASU, “federalism and the siamiese twins: diversity and entropy in india’s domestic and foreign policy,” federalism and the new world order, pg. 95, netlibrary]<br />
The very centralization of Indian “federalism” adds….local and district levels.<br />
<br />
Overrule Morrison grants unlimits police power to federal gov, kills federalism<br />
The national journal, 99 (The center for individual rights, march 13th)<br />
Still, Judge motz offered no…control over all domestic relations.<br />
<br />
Morrison was important to protect federalism than lopez<br />
Adler, Lewis and clark law review, vol 9:4 google scholar)<br />
While modest in scope, lopez…threatening to narrow the decision’s reach.<br />
<br />
The raich decision effectively overrules Morrison<br />
Adler, same as above<br />
<br />
That the federal government would prevail did not…it is unlikely Raich will be forgotten.<br />
