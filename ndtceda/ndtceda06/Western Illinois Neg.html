CP – Limit to its facts<br />
<br />
Text: US Supreme Court should distinguish the decision in Milliken v. Bradley (418 U.S. 717, 1974) to its facts. The Supreme Court will rule to nullify deferral to local control on the grounds that education is protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Also in this ruling the Supreme Court will ban eugenics.<br />

Justiciability 1nc<br />
<br />
a. affirmative fiat must be justiciable – they must have a test with standing. A case must be real and have controversy – a hypothetical violates the principle of justiciability<br />
ducat and chase, 1992, constitutional interpretation, 5th edition, pg. 15-16<br />
”jurisdiction, as already noted, is an indispensable requirement… no longer really exists.”<br />
<br />
a. and fiat requires a test case – the court anot magically just decide a case without an existing test case. Baum 1995 (the supreme court, 5th, edition, pg. 84)<br />
”the supreme court cannot… range of potions in a case.”<br />
<br />
b. the plan violates the legal principle of justiciability – bad for 3 reasons<br />
1. violates the precepts of fiat – fiat must be as close as possible to real world actions. If this were the real world, the plan wouldn’t pass due to lack of a test case<br />
2. lack of a test case crushes neg ground – knowing the test case offers insight into possible constitutional grounds the supreme court would rule – thus giving us counterplan ground that is predictable. The aff destroys this.<br />
3. violating justiciability is bad<br />
<br />
c. superior interpretation<br />
1. issues of fiat are a gateway issue and are key to process and legal counterplan gorund.<br />
2. the plan is extra-topical – without a test case, the plan goes outside of the resolution – arguably even by engaging in private actor fiat by requiring individuals to bring the case to the court – this is extra-topical, which is an indie voting issue<br />
3. education – the resolution calls for overruling a decision, which is a fundmanetal constitutional provision and aduty of the court. By eliminating the proper procedure by which the court uses to get to an overrule, the aff is gutting important legal education<br />
<br />
d. this is a voting issue for reasons of fairness, education and ground<br />
<br />
multidimensionalism<br />
a. all oppression is a multidimensional as people are oppressed because of the multiplicity of their identities including gender, class, sexuality, and race thus any anti-oppression policy or advocacy must use a multidimensional framework in order to fight oppression and prevent the marginalization of their own people.<br />
hutchinson, 99 [Hutchinson, Darren Lenard, assistant prof southern Methodist university school of law, buffalo law review, winter 1999, l/n, 10/10/99]<br />
”the foregoing discussion has uncovered… for anti-racist advocacy.”<br />
<br />
b. the affirmative team creates essentialized policy this leads to futher oppression as they marginzalize their own people. This is a case turn – we have a duty to encourage and accept multidimensional though on the individual level. Signing the ballot neg advocates multidimensionality.<br />
valdez, 97, [valdez, franciso, professor of law university of Miami, hasting law journal, august 1997, l/n., 10/19/99]<br />
“finally, and more generally… are engaging in this sort of work.”<br />
