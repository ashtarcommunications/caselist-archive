CONTENTION 1: THE SACRED COMMUNITY<br />
<br />
IN 1898 IN CONTEMPLATING WHETHER OR NOT TO ALLOW INDEPENDENCE IN THE PHILLIPINES PRESIDENT MCKINLEY DESCRIBED HIS DECISION MAKING PROCESS:<br />
<br />
“I walked the floor of the White House night after night until midnight and I am not ashamed to tell you, gentlemen, that I went down on my knees and prayed to Almighty God for light and guidance more than one night. And one night late it came to me this way – I don’t know how it was, but it came. One, that we could not give the Philippines back to Spain – that would be cowardly and dishonorable. Two, that we could not turn them over to France and Germany – our commercial rivals in the Orient – that would be bad business and discreditable. Three, that we could not leave them to themselves – they were unfit for self government – and they would soon have anarchy and misrule over there worse than Spain’s was. And, four, that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift them and civilize and Christianize them, and by god’s grace do they very best we could for them, as our fellow – men for whom Christ also died. And then I went to bed, and went to sleep, and slept soundly, and the next morning I sent for the chief engineer of the War Department (our map maker), and I told him to put the Philippines on the map of the United States, and there they will stay while I am President.”<br />

EMBRACING ONTOLOGICAL VIEWS OF THE US AS A VIRTUOUS SAVIOR IN THE FACE OF EVIL PREVENTS ALTERNATIVE VIEWS AND LEADS TO NUCLEAR ANNHILATION.<br />

THE US’ SACRED QUEST BEGINS IN AFGHANISTAN<br />

THE US QUEST ATTEMPTS TO REMAKE AFGHANISTAN IN ITS OWN IMAGE, DESPITE MILLIONS MISPLACED, MAIMED, INJURED, HUMILIATED<br />

<br />
THE RHETORIC OF LIBERATION IN AFGHANISTAN IS EMBEDDED WITH RACISM, USED TO JUSTIFY HEINOUS ACTIONS<br />

<br />
THE SACRED US COMMUNITY CONTINUALLY REPRODUCES RACISM BY LABELING AFGHANIS ‘INDIAN’. THE NAME ‘INDIAN’ TAKES AWAY ANY MEANING TO AFGHAN LIFE.<br />

EMBRACING THE SACRED MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN PSYCHOLOGICALLY ENGRAINS THE SACRED US IDENTITY, MAKING THE APOCALYPSE MORE LIKELY.<br />
Lifton ’03 (Robert J. psychologist specializing in war, War on Terrorism in Apocalyptic America, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Rogue_State_US/War_Terrorism_SPS.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Rogue_State_US/War_Terrorism_SPS.html</a>)<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should increase its constructive engagement with Afghanistan in the form of the offer of an ongoing dialogue in which the U.S. offers the guarantee that it will not use words as weapons and will listen to and respect the perspectives of the Afghan people.<br />

CONTENTION 3: TRANSCENDENCE TO THE HOLY COMMUNITY<br />
<br />
US CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT MANIPULATES DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MESSAGES TO PROMOTE THE MONOLOGUE OF US SUPERIORITY. THESE MESSAGES ONLY PROMOTE DOMINATE IDEOLOGIES.<br />

BREAKING WITH US MONOLOGUE OPENS SPACE FOR THE US TO BE OPEN TO PERSUASION. THE SPACE WILL DECONSTRUCT THE DOMINANT ONTOLOGY THROUGH A PROCESS OF GENUINE DIALOGUE.<br />

EXPERIENCE OF BEING OPEN TO THE OTHER HUMANIZES THE SACRED ORDER, OPENING OURSELVES TO THE HOLY EXPERIENCE OF ETHICALLY BEING OPEN TO THE OTHER.<br />
