Neg vs ISU JM<br />
<br />
Framework<br />
<br />
Our interpretation is that the plan must be an unconditional instrument to solve the advantages. But you should also be responsible for the words you use. If you say the federal government should do something, you have to answer our reasons why federal action would be bad.<br />
<br />
This is key to ground – plan focus provides the only stable locus for debate. Allowing them to shift destroys our ability to get links or do pre round prep.<br />
<br />
Aff conditionality is a voting issue since it makes it impossible to be neg. We’ll always lose because the aff gets to speak last. They could always clarify out of 2nr strategy. Plan focus is the only non-arbitrary interpretation.<br />
<br />
Their criticism is an all-or-nothing totalization that fails to account for the necessity of change in the real world. Engaging political structures is the only way to foster an ethic of solidarity and better the lives of individuals.<br />

What follows is …become a secondary concern.<br />

Food Prices<br />
<br />

Food markets are stabilizing <br />
Hills 2k8 [Sarah Hills, foodUSA navigator writer, “Oil not subsidies behind corn prices hikes” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Financial-Industry/Oil-not-subsidies-behind-corn-prices-hikes" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Financial-Industry/Oil-not-subsidies-behind-corn-prices-hikes</a>] <br />
In May the United States …for alternative fuels. <br />

Farm Subsidies are necessary to stabilize the food market and prevent food spikes <br />

Proponents of agriculture …desired market stability.<br />

High prices ensure massive poverty globally <br />

Poverty causes a structural violence that outweighs nuclear war<br />

We live, equally immersed, and to a deeper degree, in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging &quot;structural' violence, …throughout the world.<br />

CP – Corn PIC<br />
<br />
Resolved: that the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies, for biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, maize, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat.<br />
<br />
– CORN IS MORE THAN MAIZE; INCLUDES ANY GRANT WITH MORE THAN 50 PERCENT WHOLE KERNELS. <br />

<br />
Corn is defined …have been established.<br />
<br />
THE WORD CORN IS LINGUISTIC COLONIALISM THAT SERVES TO MASK A HISTORY OF WESTERN EXPLOITATION. CHANGING THE WORD TO MAIZE ALLOWS ANALYSIS OF IMPERIAL LANGUAGE BY CHALLENGING THE WAY WE VIEW FOOD. <br />
FUSSELL, 1999<br />
