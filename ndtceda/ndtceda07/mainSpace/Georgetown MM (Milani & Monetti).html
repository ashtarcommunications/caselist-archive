<strong><u>Observation 1: Mounting Death Tolls</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world; new landmines planted by the Taliban have claimed nearly a thousand lives since January</strong><br />
<strong>Moahid 9/7/2007</strong> (Ahmad Khalid, reporter for Pajhwok Afghan News, “AFGHANISTAN: Taliban Mines Take Toll on Civilian, Coalition Lives”)<br />
<u>New landmines planted since the Taliban returned…</u> by rival mujahiddin factions in the 1990s.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Afghanistan remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world with thousands dying annually</strong><br />
<strong>US Foreign Policy Agenda 2004</strong> (January, “Afghanistan: A Model  for Humanitarian Mine Action”)<br />
<u>Afghanistan remains one of the most heavily… <strong>landmines are estimated at 150 per month.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>And, Landmines kill 12 people a day in Afghanistan</strong><br />

Afghanistan has suffered greatly from war… of landmine victims die due to lack of medical facilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The problem will only get worse—landmines promise continued instability the persistent risk of death for civilians. Landmine clearance is the most pressing priority</strong><br />
<strong>Tayler, Newsday Reporter, 2002</strong> (Letta, January, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.banminesusa.org/news/983_afghan/983_1_16_02d.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.banminesusa.org/news/983_afghan/983_1_16_02d.html)</a><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Observation Two: Beyond Death Tolls</u></strong><br />
<strong>Thinking of landmine casualties in purely statistical terms is misleading: the mere threat of landmines makes daily life an exercise in paralyzing fear. It renders land, roads, and public buildings useless.</strong><br />
<strong>Njeri, PHD University of Bradford, 2003</strong> (Sarah, “The Impact of Explosive Remnants of War (ERW): Especially Landmines on Post-Conflict Reconstruction” google it)<br />
<u>The actual number of mines in the ground… <strong>And yet what a wealth of misery it can cover.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Our affirmative is a conduit to finally confront the reality of the landmine and clusterbomb crisis in Afghanistan and particularly our own complicity in perpetuating it. Coming to terms with the devastating effects on people’s daily lives can challenge brutal colonialism and indiscriminate killing that will spiral into extinction.</strong><br />
