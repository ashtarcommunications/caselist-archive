<strong>We offer the following plan:</strong><br />
<strong>Through all necessary means the US Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan including an offer for a long-term positive security guarantee and a substantial increase in foreign assistance by expanded oversight and quality control of US contractors, guaranteed funding as needed for reconstruction projects through the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund, if Afghanistan commits to a time-table for anti-corruption reforms.</strong><br />
