Observation One: The Aff Flunks History<br />
War, Terrorism and instability in the middle east can only be understood as expressions of capitalism’s contradictions—economic rivalry inevitably becomes wedded to war as we seek to control resources and markets. The other face of this system of war is the attempt of American foreign policy to engage with regimes and ultimately subordinate them to the needs of the global economy.<br />
Anne Alexander International Socialism Journal Winter 2001<br />
In the 11 years since the end of the Guld War … taking part in military exercises there.<br />
The affirmative presumes there is a scenario for impact that stands outside of the forces of history—threats of war and chaos are merely fabrications of the state in order to cow the masses and ensure its stranglehold over expropriation of wealth<br />
Mark Neocleous <em>Imagining the State</em> 107-8<br />
The state system and the statist political … by no state at all?<br />
Middle East turmoil and the present threats of war are not isolated outcomes of foreign policy decisisions nor will they be solved by a shift to a different policy. Rather they symptomatic of the contradictions of capital – in the framework peace is necessarily ephemeral. Catastrophic war and violence between states is inevitable so long as capitalism and the state remain the dominant political mode.<br />
Socialist Equality Party 2007 “Socialist strategy needed to oppose war and social inequality” online<br />
Millions of people around the globe are looking … anachronistic nation-state framework.<br />
The aff assumes the prior existence of the state, ignoring how sovereignty is produced by imaginary processes, creating its own circular justification. That creates contradictions that cause all of the problems that liberalism seeks to resolve<br />
Mark Neocleous <em>Imagining the State</em> 1-2<br />

Observation Two: the impact<br />
Far from successfully managing the current crisis, the entire brunt force of the American empire will be put to the task of squaring the circle of capitalism’s contradictions, creating an increasing cycle of imperial wars that culminate in extinction<br />
John Bellamy Foster “Imperialism and Empire” 2001<br />
At the core of … survival of humanity are concerned.<br />
Capitalism makes extinction inevitable through war, eco-collapse, disease, nuclear conflicts and genocides<br />

<strong><em>THE AFFIRMATIVE IS A FUNDAMENTAL MISREADING OF POLITICS AND THE REPRODUCTION OF SOCIAL RELATIONS. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE ‘BIOPOLITICAL STATE’ THAT SEEKS TO MANAGE AND CONTROL POPULATIONS FOR THE SAKE OF POWER. THE STATE AND CAPITAL MOVE HAND IN GLOVE—ONE CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT THE OTHER. ONLY A TOTAL DISTANCE FROM THE MODERN STATE CAN ALLOW FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF CAPITAL. OTHERWISE WHAT IS PUSHED OUT THE DOOR ONLY COMES BACK IN THROUGH THE WINDOW</em></strong><br />

CRITICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE ISRAELI/PALESTINIAN CONFLICT IS AN APOLOGY FOR CAPITALISM PAR EXCELLANCE—THE SHIFT AWAY FROM MATERIAL ACCOUNTS OF THE CONFLICT TO ‘CULTURE’ AND THE ‘POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION’ SERVE ONLY TO MASK THE CLASS CONTRADICTIONS THAT SUSTAINS VIOLENT IMPERIALISM THAT IS AT THE HEART OF THE CONFLICT AND CAPITALISM MORE BROADLY<br />

[Amrohini, “Edward Said’s “Class” Politics”, Red Critique, Sept/Oct, p. online <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
Over the years, especially since the public…. contradictions of class.<br />
<br />
<br />
FURTHER MORE, THE ABSENCE OF STRUCTURAL HISTORICISM IS NO MERE OVERSIGHT, NOR IS IT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY MENTION ECONOMICS IN A FEW OF YOUR CARDS-- THE RELIANCE OF INDENTY-BASED POLITICS IS NOT AN ACCIDENTAL INSTANCE OF IGNORING CLASS. THE DEMAND ARISES OUT OF THE CRISIS OF LIBERALISM—SUCH POLITICS PARTICULARIZES THE OPPRESSIONS OF CAPITALISM TO THE POINT THAT THE UNIVERSAL SYSTEM IS NATURALIZED. ATTAINING WHITE, MALE BOURGEOISSE PRIVILEGE BECOMES THE BENCH-MARK OF POLITICAL SUCCESS, RE-ENTRENCHING THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE SYSTEM<br />

FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF STRUCTURAL KRITIK, THERE CAN BE NO SUCH THING AS ‘MAKING THINGS BETTER’— THEIR MODEL OF POLITICS, NO MATTER HOW SUBVERSIVE OR CONSERVATIVE, ALL FUNDAMENTALLY EXAGERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FORMAL INSTITUTION OF POLITICS AND POWER, IGNORING THE WAYS SUCH A SYSTEM CREATES KNOWLEDGE—ONLY A MARXIST SHIFT TO KRITIK THE STRUCTURE AND CREATE MASS SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS WILL OVERCOME THIS FAILURE OF POLITICS<br />

THIS IS NOT THE ALTERNATIVE, BUT IN TRUTH THE ONLY OPTION— METHOD IS THE FOREMOST POLITICAL QUESTION BECAUSE ONE MUST UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING SOCIAL TOTALITY BEFORE ONE CAN ACT ON IT—GROUNDING THE SITES OF POLITICAL CONTESTATION OR KNOWLEDGE OUTSIDE OF LABOR AND SURPLUS VALUE MERELY SERVE TO HUMANIZE CAPITAL AND PREVENT A TRANSITION TO A SOCIETY BEYOND OPPRESSION<br />
