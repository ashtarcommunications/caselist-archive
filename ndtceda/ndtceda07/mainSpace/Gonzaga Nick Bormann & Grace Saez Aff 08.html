Contention One – Beware the Ides of March<br />
( ) The stage is set for the next phase of joint U.S.-Israeli plans to carve up the Middle East and literally redraw the map according to Western interests – the Kosovo model of breaking up weak states was just a dress rehearsal, about to make its grand opening in Lebanon, with full-scale preemptive attacks by Israel imminent<br />

The February 2008 declaration… forces in the borader region.<br />
<br />
( ) In particular, U.S. opposition to Hezbollah divides Lebanon’s government against its people and sets the stage for large-scale violence conducted in the name of the “New Middle East” – the upcoming election will provide cover for direct and violent intervention. Only an end to U.S.-led divisions between the Siniora government and the opposition can prevent all-out catastrophe<br />

The Bush Administration pushed Israel… divided in next month election<br />
<br />
We’ll isolate two scenarios:<br />
First, Israel strikes again:<br />
( ) Israel’s recent assassination of a top Hezbollah operative sets the stage for another invasion of Lebanon – Israel is itching for a fight and waiting for any available pretext to justify an invasion<br />

Last Friday I asked a top-level… soothe hurt Israeli feelings.<br />
<br />
<br />
( ) And, even absent Hezbollah retaliation, Israel will launch more and ever-escalating attacks on Lebanon – the key internal link is that Israel perceives a U.S. green light for renewed violence<br />

Second, the “New Middle East”:<br />
<br />
( ) U.S. plans for a “New Middle East” are the driving force behind Israeli military strikes on Lebanon – the U.S. will push Israel to destroy Lebanon in hopes of igniting a new ‘domino theory,’ hoping to topple all resistance to U.S. global control<br />

Ten years on from this… inexplicably help turn around Iraq.<br />

<br />
( ) That leads to World War 3, which destroys the planet - accesses all other impacts<br />

In recent weeks,… hard to prevent outbursts.<br />
<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer the government of Lebanon a binding pledge that the United States will not threaten, initiate, or support efforts to violate the government of Lebanon’s sovereignty or alter the government of Lebanon, and should request that the government of Lebanon cease the use of assistance provided by the United States to exclude Hezbollah from participation in the government of Lebanon.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – Solvency<br />
<br />
( ) The plan decisively prevents attacks and military intervention against Lebanon – an explicit U.S. guarantee successfully restrains Israel and de-escalates tension – failure to reverse status quo policy means apocalypse<br />
Noam Chomsky, Professor of Linguistics at MIT and keepin’ it real for 90 years, August 16, 2006, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/chomsky08162006.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.counterpunch.org/chomsky08162006.html</a>, accessed October 4, 2007<br />
On Hezbollah too, there are… perhaps even &quot;apocalypse soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
( ) A guarantee of Lebanon’s sovereignty is key – U.S. imperialism in the ‘war on terror’ relies on a double-standard with regard to sovereignty: U.S. sovereignty is seen as absolute and inviolable while the sovereignty of small states like Lebanon is seen as legitimately violated any time the U.S. chooses – ONLY directly contesting this double standard politicizes the U.S. plan for a ‘New Middle East,’ enabling effective alternatives to emerge<br />
Stuart Elden, Professor of Geography at the University of Durham, 2007, “Terror and Territory,” Antipode, p. 837-840<br />
As I have stressed throughout… use in positions of opposition.<br />
<br />
( ) Lebanon is key – in the plot to create a “New Middle East,” Lebanon is the vital linchpin, the state whose destruction enables a chain reaction spreading across the entire region<br />
Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya, Research Associate of the Center for Research on Globalization, November 18, 2006, “Plans for Redrawing the Middle East: The Project for a “New Middle East,”” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=NAZ20061116&amp;articleId=3882" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=NAZ20061116&amp;articleId=3882</a>, accessed August 29, 2007<br />

<br />
( ) Finally, the plan resolves Israel’s motivation to initiate violence against Lebanon – Israel is not driven by an innate desire to destroy its enemies but rather is goaded into war and violence by the U.S. – refusing the plan locks in a vision of the Middle East, Israel included, as nothing more than a mass of sacrificial pawns in a game orchestrated in Washington<br />

Contention One – Assistance Now<br />

US aid to…in the country.<br />
<br />
( ) There’s more to this description of the status quo than just a uniqueness contention – given all the ways foreign assistance is increasing, it’s crucial to investigate the POLITICS of who the U.S. decides to aid – and who it doesn’t.<br />
Unsurprisingly, these decisions are made in the context of imperial warplanning – in the wake of our invasion of Iraq, millions of displaced people have fled to neighboring states, particularly Syria. And while Syria long maintained an open-border policy towards Iraqis, our refusal to aid this ‘state sponsor of terrorism’ in its efforts to deal with the mess we created has forced their doors to be slammed shut<br />
Bill Frelick, Refugee Policy director for Human Rights Watch, October 16, 2007, “Talk to Syria for the Sake of Iraqi Refugees,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/10/16/syria17265.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/10/16/syria17265.htm</a>, accessed January 28, 2008<br />
This week, the…do bilaterally.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – Fear and Loathing in Damascus<br />
<br />
( ) The refusal to aid Syria reflects a malicious neglect of our responsibility to ensure the safety and security of those who were caught up in America’s war of choice – while Congress endlessly debates war funding and exit strategies, they’ve neglected to establish ANY strategy for dealing with the consequences of invading Iraq. The burden on Syria has been immense – but America’s flight for responsibility has left states like Sweden, who played no role in our invasion, to pick up the pieces of its aftermath in Syria<br />
Elizabeth Ferris, Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution, June 18, 2007, “Iraqi Refugees: Our Problem or Sweden’s?” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2007/0618humanrights_ferris.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2007/0618humanrights_ferris.aspx</a>, accessed January 14, 2008<br />
The near-blind eye… mitigated and controlled.<br />
<br />
( ) America’s lack of concern for the lives of Iraqi refugees reflects a cold, malicious calculus – debate on Iraq has focused solely on the consequences for us, with near-total blindness to the consequences for Iraqis – this refusal to foreground what a disaster the war has been for Iraq is a calculated strategy to keep reality from intruding into our belief in the benevolence of our mission to ‘liberate’ Iraq<br />
Richard Falk, the Albert G. Milbank Professor Emeritus of International Law at Princeton University and Visiting Distinguished Professor in Global and International Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, October 2007, “Would Iraqi Refugees Please Disappear,” Human Rights &amp; Human Welfare Roundtable, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.du.edu/gsis/hrhw/roundtable/2007/panel-c/10-2007/falk-2007b.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.du.edu/gsis/hrhw/roundtable/2007/panel-c/10-2007/falk-2007b.html</a>, accessed January 26, 2008<br />
I am grateful to… far larger numbers.<br />
<br />
( ) In this light, it should not be surprising that when asked about our obligation to Iraq’s refugees, John Bolton replied that we fulfilled our only obligation when we ‘liberated’ them – the belief that an American-made war and subsequent disregard for its consequences is synonymous with ‘freedom’ treats the lives of Iraqis as the disposable byproducts of a Middle East remade in our vision of freedom and democracy.<br />

An unsettling, if not…extremely vulnerable.<br />
<br />
( ) The impact is limitless war – left unchecked, the exceptionalist belief in America’s global manifest destiny and our immunity from the consequences of our actions will move from Iraq today to ever-new and escalating wars tomorrow<br />
Anthony Burke, Professor in the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, July 2005, “Freedom’s Freedom: American Enlightenment and Permanent War,” Social Identities, Vol. 11, No. 4, p. 334-335<br />
In this light, we can… hubris’ (Euben, 2000).<br />
<br />
We must take collective responsibility for wars fought in our name; interventions in countries like Iraq only go on because we refuse to take responsibility for them. Our acquiesce to status quo politics makes us complicit with the displacement of Iraqi refugees and with the destruction of their country<br />

In ‘Collective Responsibility’ (1968)…common to all people.’<br />
<br />
Only including the perspective of those who bear the costs of our political decisions can challenge the ideological beliefs that justify the invasion of sovereign countries. Only by refusing to ignore Iraqi refugees can we take responsibility for the global political system we’ve created, preventing them from laying waste across the globe<br />

Second, we can also…lives of millions.<br />
<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer the government of Syria all foreign assistance necessary to allow the government of Syria to open the Syria-Iraq border to persons displaced from Iraq, provide services to individuals displaced from Iraq, and facilitate the resettlement of those individuals displaced from Iraq to Syria wishing to resettle in the United States, and should request that the government of Syria enter into dialogue over this policy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Three – Solvency<br />
<br />
( ) The plan represents a recognition of those who have experienced the human consequences of the “war on terror” – our attention and your ballot must foreground a consideration of those written out of the narrative we’ve created around our role in the Middle East. Affirming a decision-calculus that holds our attention to Iraqi refugees above our narrow self-interest is critical to creating an ethic of engagement and understanding<br />
Derek Gregory, Distinguished University Scholar and Professor of Geography at the University of British Columbia, March 2004, “Geographies, Publics, and Politics,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProgramCourses/CoursePagesFA2006/Geog123_GregoryArticle.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProgramCourses/CoursePagesFA2006/Geog123_GregoryArticle.pdf</a>, accessed January 28, 2008<br />
So, to return to the… progressive human geography.<br />
<br />
( ) U.S. assistance directly to Syria is key – only direct, bilateral aid enables Syria to build infrastructure to provide for the needs of displaced people. The normal rules of international burden-sharing don’t apply – the U.S. must solely foot the bill because of our particular responsibility in the wake of the Iraq war. Given that the plan could be funded with a week of war spending, there’s no excuse for the U.S. to flee our responsibility<br />
Bill Frelick, Refugee Policy director for Human Rights Watch, November 15, 2007, “The Human Cost of War: The Iraqi Refugee Crisis,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/11/15/iraq17340.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/11/15/iraq17340.htm</a>, accessed January 28, 2008<br />
But the solution to…years to come.<br />
<br />
In the wake of our neglect, Syria has drawn up plans to address the needs of Iraqis, but the project will costs hundreds of millions of dollars. The United States has funded similar policies in Jordan, but refuses to do so with Syria. In this context, giving direct, bilateral assistance is necessary to politicize the way Iraqi refugees are held hostage to the imperatives of the “war on terror”<br />
Kristele Younes, advocate at Refugees International, former Legal Officer with the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, J.D. from McGill University, and Sean Garcia, advocate at Refugees International specializing in Iraqi refugee issues, September 17, 2007, “Iraqi Refugees: Donor Governments Must Provide Bilateral Assistance to Host Countries,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/article/detail/10098" rel="nofollow">http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/article/detail/10098</a>, accessed January 25, 2008<br />
The majority of…this entire process.<br />
<br />
( ) A substantial increase in U.S. assistance for refugee resettlement is key – opening our doors to Iraqi refugees would cause a wide-scale shift in U.S. political culture, away from violence and militarism towards empathy and compassion<br />

Pruce, Ph.D. candidate at the Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Denver and editor of DU’s Human Rights &amp; Human Welfare Roundtable, October 2007, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.du.edu/gsis/hrhw/roundtable/2007/panel-c/10-2007/iraqirefugees-2007.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.du.edu/gsis/hrhw/roundtable/2007/panel-c/10-2007/iraqirefugees-2007.html</a><br />

<br />
( ) Direct dialogue with Syria is key – the belief that Assad must placate domestic critics by opposing the West is an essentialist stereotype that codes Syria as a homogenous zone of Islamic irrationality – these representations are the cultural precondition for war on Syria – ONLY a commitment to cross-cultural engagement solves the case<br />
Tyler Golson, MA in Arab Studies from Georgetown, lived in Syria for years teaching English, December 1, 2005, “Serious Miscalculations About Syria,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/miscalculating_syria/" rel="nofollow">http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/miscalculating_syria/</a>, accessed February 10, 2008<br />
In the post-Saddam…concerns of both nations.<br />
<br />
( ) Those concerned with peace both globally and within the Middle East have a responsibility to advocate both a reframing of the debate on the Iraq war towards a consideration of the consequences felt by refugees, and a substantial, immediate increase in U.S. aid to Syria – the plan, and our framing of the ballot, are critical to this growing movement for peace<br />
Noah Merrill, Program Coordinator for the American Friends Service Committee, in Southeastern New England, recently returned from six weeks of intensive work in Jordan among Iraqi refugees displaced as a result of the ongoing Iraq crisis, he conducted more than 40 in-depth formal interviews with Iraqi families, participated in frequent consultations with staff of international humanitarian organizations, UN staff, and representatives of Iraqi civil society and political groups, Summer 2007, Faith Risk, Change, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afsc.org/central/documents/StLouisnewssummer07.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afsc.org/central/documents/StLouisnewssummer07.pdf</a>, accessed January 22, 2008<br />
Q. Do you think it's…able to get).<br />
<br />
( ) As we count the toll of dead and displaced in Iraq, we must be open to dialogue with those we demonize in the name of a utilitarian, strategic rationality that knows no bounds and feels no consequence from its actions. Engaging Syria is crucial to refuse violent foreign policy in the Middle East and interrogate America’s invasion of Iraq.<br />
Anthony Burke, Professor in the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, July 2005, “Freedom’s Freedom: American Enlightenment and Permanent War,” Social Identities, Vol. 11, No. 4, p. 335-336<br />
The arguments of Bin…it annihilates it.<br />
<br />
( ) An affirmative ballot does not signify merely a change to U.S. government policy – the calculus you use to arrive at your decision must exist outside utilitarian, strategic thought - otherwise our responses to violence like our invasion of Iraq will merely bottleneck into established ways of thinking and doing policy, with renewed militarism as the result. Only a steadfast commitment to questioning the imperatives of security policy can pave the way for a truly inclusive and peaceful global politics.<br />

What I take from Heidegger's…Will our thought?<br />

Contention 1: The history of the present <br />
<br />
American foreign policy remains on a collision course with Iran- our current intellectual climate constructs Iran as deviating from the liberal-international order, necessitating a uniquely American brand of justice – preemptive war waged solely on the basis that Iran threatens our ‘secure future’  <br />
Noam Chomsky, professor of linguistics at MIT and Paul Jay, Canadian journalist who is currently chair of Independent World Television January 25, 2008, Noam Chomsky on US policy towards Iran, PART 1: Are assumptions about Iran wrong? <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.campaigniran.org/casmii/index.php?q=node/3907" rel="nofollow">http://www.campaigniran.org/casmii/index.php?q=node/3907</a>  <br />
PAUL JAY, SENIOR EDITOR: ElBaradei, is the… towards a military confrontation. <br />
<br />
Preemptive attacks on Iran takes on a whole new meaning when understood in terms of the film “Minority Report,” where three pre-cogs see the future and provide the intelligence used to arrest or kill people before they ever commit a crime. This is no coincidence – the police state of ‘Minority Report’ and the security state of the preemptive war doctrine are both founded on the absolute power of the state to identify and annihilate threats to ‘our’ secure tomorrow  <br />
Greg Elmer, Bell Globemedia Research Chair in the School of Radio TV Arts at Ryerson University, and Andy Opel, assistant professor in the Department of Communication at Florida State University, July-September 2006, “Surviving the Inevitable Future: Preemption in an age of faulty intelligence,” Cultural Studies, Vol. 20, No. 4-5, p. 480-481 <br />
Such challenges to contemporary… opposed to evidence. <br />
<br />
In this atmosphere, it doesn’t matter if American bombs ever fall on Tehran because the very threat of war creates a permanent state of militarism and violence. Living under the threat of preemption impacts ALL of us by transforming the entirety of both the American and the Iranian population into mass of spectators, whose lives have already been sacrificed to war just over the horizon. The only ethical response for intellectuals is to analyze our own role in constructing the state of war  <br />
Hamid Dabashi, the Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, February 18, 2007, Al-Ahram Weekly, “Thinking Beyond the Invasion of Iran,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/831/focus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/831/focus.htm</a>, accessed October 8, 2007 <br />
The practice of anti-war… learn how to respond. <br />
<br />
In this light, the role of academics is clear- our ethical duty is to examine how the state of war is sustained. Only when we begin to question the cultural norms that foreground our interactions with the world can we challenge the endless drive for security <br />
<br />
We’ll begin with the US-Israeli relationship because our understanding of Iran is inseparable from our political and cultural ties with Israel. We see Iran as a mortal threat to Israel because American history has constructed Israel as an extension of the US. The ideal of Israel as the 51st state is perpetuated by academics who validate the need for an American protectorate for the Jewish state. We are conditioned to believe that to preserve “peace” we must support Israel, obscuring the violence the relationship wreaks on the Middle East  <br />

Not long ago,… presence in the Middle East. <br />
<br />
This intellectual culture impedes our ability to understand Iran at all- Western scholars inevitably misunderstand the Iranian regime, representing them as crazy religious zealots threatening the entire Middle East. In this climate, Iranian attempts to exercise its right to national development are always read as signs the regime is irrational and prone to violence. This discourse doesn’t reflect reality, even worse, it’s deployed by neocons to justify preemptive violence against dissent to American hegemony <br />
Arshin Adib-Moghaddam, department of Politics and International Relations at Oxford, 2007, Third World Quarterly, “Manufacturing War: Iran in the Neoconservative Imagination,” Vol. 28, No. 3, p. 636-637 <br />
Although this brief sketch… anti-Iranian agenda. <br />
<br />
The daily choice we make to prioritize security institutionalizes the doctrine of preemption. The survivor society is best exemplified in the structure of debate- where you vote for a counterplan if there is even a risk of a net benefit. Preemption emanates from this desire to prevent “the rise of another hostile global rival” or “another round of Saving Private Ryan” because when we name the threats we prescribe action to avoid it – transforming predictions into self-fulfilling prophecies <br />
Brian Massumi, professor in the Département de Communication, L'Université de Montréal, 2007, “Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption,” Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 10, No. 2 <br />
Fear is always a good… Get used to it. <br />
<br />
The impact is limitless war – a system of politics based on detecting and preempting threats at every turn can do nothing but annihilate all those who threaten our secure tomorrow. When we see instability and threat all around us, utopian peace is always a day away, always just over the horizon, to be achieved after one more enemy is annihilated.  <br />
Jess Whyte, PHD candidate in Monash University’s Centre for Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies, 2006, Arena Journal, No. 26, p. infotrac <br />
According to the doctrine… wreckage upon wreckage. (26) <br />
<br />
Understanding Iran is impossible without analyzing the culture of war we live in, and the ideologies that sustain it. As a result of our examination, we are resolved:  <br />
<br />
The United States federal government should establish a binding pledge to not threaten, initiate or support military conflict against Iran and request that the government of Iran engage in dialogue with the United States if the government of Iran wishes to engage in dialogue with the United States. <br />
<br />
Contention Two – Unwriting the Future <br />
<br />
Only a complete refusal of all forms of security politics can challenge preemptive violence. Actively choosing to live with insecurity crushes the state’s ability to manipulate us with ever-present threats. Vote affirmative to validate a minority report against the Bush doctrine – use whatever force your ballot has to dissent against the notion that Iran must be annihilated for our security. This choice is ethical as well as political – preemption is unjust if it’s even wrong once – accepting we may be wrong about Iran means you should affirm a minority report to balance the pursuit of security and justice  <br />
Cynthia Weber, Professor of International Relations at Lancaster University, 2007, The Logics of Biopower and the War on Terror: Living, Dying, Surviving, p. 124-126 <br />
Minority Report draws a… hegemonic logic of home. <br />
<br />
Rejecting the politics of preemption requires abandoning traditional risk-calculus of disads – just like the Bush administration’s color-coded alert system doesn’t even contain a color for ‘safe’, the ‘any risk of a link’ model normalizes a condition of permanent fear and emergency through its insistence that catastrophe is an ever-present threat against any action. This form of risk calculus is perverted by those in power to justify preemptive violence in the name of a ‘secure future’ <br />

In March 2002, with… in signs of alert. <br />
<br />
Challenging the survivor society we’ve created is the only way to break the stranglehold on public debate and dissent. Only refusing the constructions of threats can bring rationality back into the public sphere. Wagering on the likelihood of a catastrophe creates a culture of fear and docility, where life is reduced to preparations for the inevitable disaster. By disabling public criticism, this system abandons the tools necessary to distinguish fact from fiction and makes accurate decision-making impossible  <br />

Throughout the media… fraud may be our very own. <br />
<br />
Our obsession with security provides the perfect tools for the government to justify itself- our government is good because it protects us. Unfortunately, a state defined by the imperative to secure its population from ontological dangers cannot exist without these dangers –making them perpetual and inevitable. ‘Policy problems’ must be continually recreated to legitimate government intervention, while we forget that these problems have seemingly been ‘solved’ countless times before  <br />
Kyle Grayson, Lecturer in the Department of Geography, Politics, and Sociology at the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, 2007, The Logics of Biopower and the War on Terror: Living, Dying, Surviving, p. 90-92 <br />
Moreover this dichotomy is weakened… world to read us. <br />
<br />
In the quest to justify itself by securing our future, every governmental function from securing economic growth to preventing environmental collapse has been brought under the rubric of security and preemption. Appeals to dangers threatening human survival are not objective nor benign – the imperative of a secure tomorrow lays the groundwork for ever-expanding forms of control and the annihilation of anyone who threatens the framework of security. This focus on survival couched in terms of state intervention makes extinction inevitable  <br />
Mark J. Lacy, Professor of International Relations at Lancaster University, 2007, The Logics of Biopower and the War on Terror: Living, Dying, Surviving, p. 76-79 <br />
The possibilities for a future… harder to maintain. <br />
<br />
Contention 3: The politics of academia <br />
<br />
Academics’ first responsibility should be to challenge the language used to manufacture public consent for the constant state of war we’re in- only interrogating the discourse used to justify preemptive violence can provide the basis for a more ethical and sustainable form of politics <br />
Richard Jackson, Professor of Politics at Manchester University, Spring 2005, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm</a>, accessed September 25, 2006 <br />
The ‘war on terrorism’ is both a set of… it in academic discourse. <br />
<br />
The most important role for scholars today is to challenge a culture that makes the idea of preemptive strikes a possibility. Studying the ways knowledge about the world is produced is essential to challenge US dominance. Unless the roots of American preemptive violence are examined, the destruction of the planet will be inevitable <br />
Ashley Dawson, Associate Professor of English at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center and the College of Staten Island, and Malini Johar Schueller, Professor of English at the University of Flordia, 2007, Exceptional State: Contemporary U.S. Culture and the New Imperialism, p. 20-21 <br />
To engage in the critique… strikes, and perpetual warfare. <br />
<br />
Our argument is uniquely important in this forum- academic discussions of Iran and U.S. policy do not occur in a political vacuum and understanding the politics of our scholarship is critical to challenge the climate of ever-present violence against Iran. Set the bar high when considering the consequences of knowledge production because scholarship can either further the drive for war or serve as its undoing <br />

The displacement and &quot;unhomeliness&quot; Homi… literature and Iranian studies. <br />
<br />
Restricting consideration to only those issues that fit on the official agendas of policymakers marginalizes entire populations and results in a failure in knowledge production. The history of security politics in the Middle East proves that it’s necessary to broaden conceptions of security and agency – it's our responsibility as students to lead the way in transforming outdated theories <br />

 Contention One – The More Things Change…<br />
<br />
( ) Despite the recent bombshell of the National Intelligence Estimate, the U.S. remains firmly on the path to war with Iran. The administration has decided in advance that Iran is guilty and must be brought to a uniquely American brand of justice – a preemptive war waged solely on the basis that Iran threatens our ‘secure future’<br />
Anwaar Hussain, former member of the Pakistani Air Force, M.A. in Defense and Strategic Studies from Quaid-e-Azam University of Islamabad, 12-8, 2007, “Iran: Off the Hook or On the Hook,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uncommonthought.com/mtblog/archives/2007/12/08/iran_off_the_ho.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.uncommonthought.com/mtblog/archives/2007/12/08/iran_off_the_ho.php</a>, accessed December 10, 2007<br />
Since the …compiled the report.<br />
<br />
( ) If you’ve ever seen the film “Minority Report,” you might notice a similarity between its depiction of a world in which criminals are brought to justice before they ever commit a crime, and the U.S. doctrine of preemptive war. This is no coincidence – the police state of ‘Minority Report’ and the security state of the preemptive war doctrine are both founded on the absolute power of the state to identify and annihilate threats to ‘our’ secure tomorrow<br />

Such challenges to … faith as opposed to evidence.<br />
<br />
( ) Understood in light of ‘Minority Report,’ Bush’s recent statement that Iran was, is, and WILL BE dangerous takes on new significance – while most analysis focused on the history of Iran’s nuclear program, the President was deliberate in his identification of an amorphous Iranian threat, that seemingly lies always just over the horizon. These administration predictions are likely to become the basis for a shooting war with Iran.<br />
Matthew Rothschild, Editor of The Progressive, 12-4, 2007, “Bush May Still Bomb Iran, Despite NIE,” The Progressive, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.progressive.org/mag_wx120407" rel="nofollow">http://www.progressive.org/mag_wx120407</a>, accessed December 23, 2007<br />
Hold on a second here.… Don’t rule it out.<br />
<br />
( ) Iran is a crucial linchpin in the drive to security carried out by preemptive war – American certainty in the threat that Iran poses to our secure tomorrow becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Absent an interruption into the logic of preemption, the war on Iran will set in motion a chain of destruction and chaos.<br />
Brian Massumi, professor in the Département de Communication, L'Université de Montréal, 2007, “Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption,” Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 10, No. 2<br />
The War in Iraq … actualization exhausts.<br />
<br />
( ) But even if American bombs never fall on Tehran, the very threat of war creates a state of permanent militarism and violence. It’s crucial to understand what living under the threat of preemption does to ALL of us – the doctrine of preemption creates the entirety of both the American and the Iranian body politic as a mass of spectators, whose lives have already been sacrificed to the war just over the horizon. Only a refusal of the very possibility of preemption can break the stranglehold of the security state.<br />
Hamid Dabashi, the Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, February 18, 2007, Al-Ahram Weekly, “Thinking Beyond the Invasion of Iran,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/831/focus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/831/focus.htm</a>, accessed October 8, 2007<br />

<br />
Contention Two – Fight the Future<br />
<br />
( ) A ‘Minority Report’ represents an alternative conception of the future lodged against those who would do violence in the name of security. In this sense, the NIE represents a tangible minority report against the Bush administration’s drive to war with Iran. Vote affirmative to validate the minority report against the Bush doctrine – put whatever force your ballot has behind our dissent against the notion that Iran must be annihilated based on American conjecture. And make no mistake, our plan solves – to create a future free from the violence of preemption, the Bush administration must be forced to accept the minority reports of those advocating dialogue and diplomacy over endless war.<br />

<br />
( ) The survival society of risk analysis relies on games of simulation where we speculate on the insecurities that might arise from any deviation from the status quo and congratulate ourselves for constructing the most nightmarish scenarios possible. This is nowhere better personified than in debate – the idea that we can cull snippets from Lexis together to predict an 80% risk of a link to a 75% risk of an extinction impact involves an utter suspension of disbelief. These attempts to predict inevitable catastrophe create a culture of atomized, docile bodies who have forgone public critique in the name of a ‘secure’ future. In this survival politics, the real catastrophe is not the terrorist threat of tomorrow, but the very idea that we will go on living this way – in permanent fear of the catastrophe over the horizon, with life reduced to nothing more than preparation for the inevitable.<br />

Even if democracy contains the potential for abuse, the deliberative process it fosters must be embraced – state leaders are held accountable by a culture of public debate, which forces them to argue and justify their decisions. Our advocacy has intrinsic value, calling out the hypocrisy of the U.S. and Lebanese governments draws censure and restrains their destructive policies<br />

1AC Outline:<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention One – Bombs over Beirut<br />
In July 2006, with Washington’s blessing, Israel launched a devastating war on Lebanon that displaced a million people and destroyed tens of thousands of homes. In the year that followed, the U.S. has turned up its nose at the prospect of reconstruction, forcing Lebanon deep into debt to recover from an illegitimate war<br />
Emad Mekay, veteran journalist in the Middle East/Inter-Pres Service, Critics Decry 'Destroy and Lend' Policy in Lebanon, September 2, 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HI02Ak02.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HI02Ak02.html</a><br />
Lebanon is firmly… the IMF said.<br />
<br />
Last summer’s war on Lebanon was not an isolated event – it was calculated all along as the first step in an American plan to create what the Bush administration has termed a “New Middle East” by crushing resistance to American global dominance and literally redrawing the borders of the Middle East according to the whims of the U.S. The stage is set for increasing U.S. intervention aimed at cementing perpetual American control – Lebanon is key<br />
Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya, Research Associate of the Center for Research on Globalization, November 18, 2006, “Plans for Redrawing the Middle East: The Project for a “New Middle East,”” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=NAZ20061116&amp;articleId=3882" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=NAZ20061116&amp;articleId=3882</a>, accessed August 29, 2007<br />
The term “New Middle East… creative destruction…&quot;<br />
<br />
The decision to target Lebanese housing and population centers was not an unfortunate byproduct of the conflict – it was intrinsic to the plan for a “New Middle East”. Israel’s tactics were designed to conflate and abolish the distinction between innocent Lebanese civilians and ‘guilty’ Hezbollah terrorists, thereby legitimating Lebanon’s complete destruction. Razed Lebanese cities are the first casualties of the drive to create a “New Middle East.”<br />
Anthony Burke, Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2007, Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 10, No. 2<br />
War as a Way of Being… dead may disagree<br />
<br />
This all-out attack on the people of Lebanon paves the way for unending global war brought on by the intersection of the ‘war on terror’ and the drive to cement U.S. global dominance embodied in the planned recolonization of the “New Middle East”.<br />
Gilbert Achcar, professor of International Politics at the University of Paris, and Michel Warschawski, journalist and peace activist, founder of the Alternative Information Center in Jerusalem, 2007, The 33-Day War: Israel’s War on Hezbollah in Lebanon and Its Consequences, p. 57-60<br />
To launch an all-out… achieving global security.<br />
<br />
The impact is global annihilation – the destruction of Lebanon’s cities and population normalizes a permanent state of war against anyone who embodies the threat of terrorism. This perpetual drive to secure the city and the Middle East sets the stage for spiraling conflict that will destroy the world<br />
Michael Dudley, Research Associate with the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg, and professor of environmental psychology, and city history for the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Manitoba, 2007, Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 10, No. 2<br />
During the Cold War… purposes of the state.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – The Politics of Reconstruction<br />
The American plot for the “New Middle East” could not have emerged through last year’s war on Lebanon alone. In the wake of the destruction, the U.S. has forced Hezbollah and its construction consortium known as Jihad al-Binaa out of any role in Lebanon’s reconstruction. The decision to crowd out Jihad al-Binaa elevates our anti-terror ideology over the needs of those affected by the war and sets the stage for purging Lebanon of its undesired populations<br />
Susanne Scheidt, the coordinator of the Italian branch of Al-Awda, and an activist for Palestinian rights, The Lebanese Tragedy: a bit of suspicion, June 2, 2007, Middle East Online, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/opinion/?id=20935" rel="nofollow">http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/opinion/?id=20935</a><br />
Of the quantity of… excessive civilian casualties ...&quot;<br />
<br />
U.S. opposition to Jihad al-Binaa divides Lebanon’s government against its people and sets the stage for large-scale violence against Lebanon conducted in the name of the “New Middle East” – the upcoming election will provide cover for direct and violent intervention. Only a U.S. embrace of dialogue between the Siniora government and Jihad al-Binaa can prevent all-out catastrophe<br />
Franklin Lamb, International Lawyer, Research Associate at If Americans Knew, August 31, 2007, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0708/S00424.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0708/S00424.htm</a>, accessed October 4, 2007<br />
The Bush Administration… next month election<br />
<br />
The refusal to treat Jihad al-Binaa as an equal partner in Lebanon’s reconstruction institutionalizes a global politics of cruelty – embracing Jihad al-Binaa’s role in reconstruction is crucial to ending cycles of American militarism that threaten to extinguish life on the planet.<br />
Dr. Haider Mehdi, March 29, 2007, The Nation, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nation.com.pk/daily/mar-2007/29/columns3.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nation.com.pk/daily/mar-2007/29/columns3.php</a>, accessed October 6, 2007<br />
Sadiq el Mahdi… to stop now.<br />
<br />
Plan here – see above<br />
<br />
Contention Three – Reconstruction Site<br />
The strategy of securing Lebanon by excluding Jihad al-Binaa from reconstruction must be abandoned – international engagement for reconstruction must be made inclusive, by pursuing collaboration between actors throughout Lebanese society. Any plan for reconstruction that refuses to engage with Jihad al-Binaa is doomed to failure and to replicate Lebanon’s cycles of violence.<br />
David Connolly, Research Fellow at the Postwar Reconstruction and Development Unit at the University of York, and Christine Hamieh, Ph.D. Candidate in Politics at York University, November 2006, Revival, Issue 22, p. 15<br />
The war has challenged… parties and organisations.<br />
<br />
The U.S. stance is key – absent the plan, the U.S. will annihilate any solution to reconstruction that doesn’t conform to the objectives of the war on terror and the ‘New Middle East’<br />
Karim Makdisi, Assistant Professor of International Relations at The American University of Beirut, September 2006, “The Sixth War: Israel’s Invasion of Lebanon,” The MIT E-Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 6, p. 9-10<br />
Two general observations… the Lebanese people.”9<br />
<br />
Jihad Al Binaa’s participation in reconstruction breaks down the binaries created by the War on Terror and confronts the roots of militarism and violence. Collaboration between social movements and government builds coalitions to resist top-down neoliberal planning. This participatory process is the only way to resolve cycle of violence<br />
Stephen Graham, Professor of Human Geography at Durham University, 2004, Cities, War, and Terrorism, Ed. Stephen Graham, p. 331-334<br />
Editing this book has… in the first place.<br />
<br />
The U.S. must assume responsibility for the destruction of Lebanon – the failure to foreground U.S. complicity and responsibility in this debate reflects the politics of cruelty that threatens to lay waste to the globe. The impact of our responsibility must be foregrounded above bureaucratic and economic concerns.<br />

Contention One – War All The Time<br />
<br />
In 2006, with Washington's blessing, Israel launched a devastating war on Lebanon that displaced a million people and destroyed tens of thousands of homes. In the year that followed, the U.S. has turned up its nose at the prospect of reconstruction, forcing Lebanon deep into debt to recover from an illegitimate war<br />
Emad Mekay, veteran journalist in the Middle East/Inter-Pres Service, Critics Decry 'Destroy and Lend' Policy in Lebanon, September 2, 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HI02Ak02.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HI02Ak02.html</a><br />
Lebanon is firmly …much worse,&quot; the IMF said.<br />
<br />
Today, reconstruction is at a standstill. The Siniora government, desperate for the support of the U.S., has agreed to American demands to block Jihad al-Binaa, a construction consortium created by Hezbollah, from any role in reconstruction. The decision to crowd out Jihad al-Binaa elevates our anti-terror ideology over the needs of those affected by the war<br />
Susanne Scheidt, the coordinator of the Italian branch of Al-Awda, and an activist for Palestinian rights, The Lebanese Tragedy: a bit of suspicion, June 2, 2007, Middle East Online, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/opinion/?id=20935" rel="nofollow">http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/opinion/?id=20935</a><br />
Of the quantity of … arable once again.<br />
<br />
The violence in Lebanon led by the U.S. and Israel did not end on August 14, 2006 – it continues to this day. The bombing of Lebanon and the U.S.-led blacklisting of Jihad al-Binaa are two sides of the same coin. We'll analyze each in turn.<br />
<br />
a) The politics of urban destruction:<br />
<br />
The decision to target Lebanese housing and population centers was not an unfortunate byproduct of the conflict – it was its rationale from the very beginning. Israel's tactics attempted to erase the distinction between innocent Lebanese civilians and 'guilty' Hezbollah terrorists, thereby legitimating Lebanon's complete destruction. Razed Lebanese cities are the first casualties of the new war on urban space.<br />
Anthony Burke, Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2007, Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 10, No. 2<br />
War as a Way of Being: Lebanon 2006…the dead may disagree.<br />
<br />
( ) The destruction of Lebanon's cities reflects a broader shift in the ideology of the 'war on terror,' one that paves the way for global annihilation. The specter of terrorism that justifies urban destruction across Lebanon also functions to close off security policy from debate and critique, resulting in ever-more-destructive cycles of violence and destruction<br />
Michael Dudley, Research Associate with the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg, and professor of environmental psychology, and city history for the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Manitoba, 2007, Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 10, No. 2<br />
During the Cold War,… purposes of the state.<br />
<br />
b) The politics of urban reconstruction:<br />
<br />
The U.S. has unconditionally opposed any role in reconstruction for Jihad al-Binaa – in this refusal, war meets economics, as the U.S. draws up plans for reconstruction that empty Lebanon of undesirable populations, making way for new inflows of Western investment.<br />
Susanne Scheidt, the coordinator of the Italian branch of Al-Awda, and an activist for Palestinian rights, The Lebanese Tragedy: a bit of suspicion, June 2, 2007, Middle East Online, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/opinion/?id=20935" rel="nofollow">http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/opinion/?id=20935</a><br />
The Siniora government, …excessive civilian casualties ...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
It should come as no surprise that the reconstruction of Lebanon has been subordinated to the overarching narrative of the 'war on terrorism' – reconstruction is to proceed OUR way and OUR way only, in order to remake the cities of Lebanon as spaces free from the ever-present 'threat' of 'terrorism', and simultaneously spaces amenable to the inflow of neoliberal capital.<br />
Michael Dudley, Research Associate with the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg, and professor of environmental psychology, and city history for the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Manitoba, 2007, Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 10, No. 2<br />
Similarly, the events of 9/11 …Bush Administration policies.<br />
<br />
<br />
This all-out attack on the people of Lebanon paves the way for unending global war brought on by the intersection of the 'war on terror' and the drive to expand the neoliberal market across the globe.<br />
Gilbert Achcar, professor of International Politics at the University of Paris, and Michel Warschawski, journalist and peace activist, founder of the Alternative Information Center in Jerusalem, 2007, The 33-Day War: Israel's War on Hezbollah in Lebanon and Its Consequences, p. 57-60<br />
To launch an …achieving global security.<br />
<br />
( ) Devastating and perpetual wars are intrinsic to the global spread of neoliberalism backed up by the military might of the 'war on terror' – Lebanon is a key site for the contestation of the global politics of neoliberal 'anti-terrorism', which promises increasing cascades of violence as the globe is purged of 'undesirable populations'.<br />
Gilbert Achcar, professor of International Politics at the University of Paris, and Michel Warschawski, journalist and peace activist, founder of the Alternative Information Center in Jerusalem, 2007, The 33-Day War: Israel's War on Hezbollah in Lebanon and Its Consequences, p. 69-72<br />
The news in the Israeli … or in Lebanon.<br />
<br />
Thus, the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer the government of Lebanon all foreign assistance necessary to reconstruct housing and infrastructure damaged or destroyed during Israel's third invasion of Lebanon if the government of Lebanon agrees to provide this assistance to Jihad al-Binaa and to involve Jihad al-Binaa in reconstruction.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – Reconstruction Site<br />
<br />
The strategy of securing Lebanon by excluding Jihad al-Binaa from reconstruction must be abandoned – international engagement for reconstruction must be made inclusive, by pursuing collaboration between actors throughout Lebanese society. Any plan for reconstruction that refuses to engage with Jihad al-Binaa is doomed to failure and to replicate Lebanon's cycles of violence.<br />
David Connolly, Research Fellow at the Postwar Reconstruction and Development Unit at the University of York, and Christine Hamieh, Ph.D. Candidate in Politics at York University, November 2006, Revival, Issue 22, p. 15<br />
The war has c…pluralist political parties and organisations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jihad Al Binaa's participation in reconstruction breaks down the binaries created by the War on Terror and confronts the roots of militarism and violence. Collaboration between social movements and government builds coalitions to resist top-down neoliberal planning. This participatory process is the only way to resolve cycle of violence<br />
Stephen Graham, Professor of Human Geography at Durham University, 2004, Cities, War, and Terrorism, Ed. Stephen Graham, p. 331-334<br />
Editing this book has, …in the first place.<br />
<br />
The critical first step in collapsing the global 'war on terror' is the empowerment of the populations that have been thus far written out of reconstructing the social order. The plan's move to shatter the facile binaries of reconstruction led by the forces of 'truth-and-justice-qua-America' against the forces of 'evil-and-terrorism-qua-Hezbollah' enables true alternatives to the war on terror to emerge<br />
Donald Pease, Avalon Foundation Chair of the Humanities at Dartmouth College, 2003, boundary 2, Vol. 30, No. 3, p. 17-18<br />
Overall, 9/11 brought …which it has emerged.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, challenging the destruction of Lebanon goes far beyond a challenge to one specific policy or administration – the plan ruptures the chokehold of militarism on policymaking and on our very ways of knowing the world. Alternatives to the current global order must be seized from outside utilitarian strategic thought – otherwise our responses to violence will merely bottleneck into established ways of thinking and doing policy, with renewed militarism as the result. Only a steadfast commitment to questioning the imperatives of security policy can pave the way for a truly inclusive and peaceful global politics.<br />
Anthony Burke, Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2007, Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 10, No. 2<br />
This process Heidegger calls …and violence? Will our thought?<br />

Contention 1: Economic Machinations<br />
<br />
In 2006 Israel, with Washington's blessing, launched a war against Lebanon's civilians and infrastructure. In the aftermath, Lebanon has been plunged into debt, forced to rely on international lending to pay for reconstruction<br />
Emad Mekay, veteran journalist in the Middle East/Inter-Pres Service, Critics Decry 'Destroy and Lend' Policy in Lebanon, September 2, 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HI02Ak02.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HI02Ak02.html</a><br />
Lebanon is firmly …. the IMF said.<br />
<br />
The invasion has forced Lebanon into a cycle of debt and “aid” dependent on the mercy of international donor conferences. In compliance with the American neoliberal agenda, Lebanon implemented structural adjustments and “economic reform,” which pass the social costs of the debt onto the most economically vulnerable. Debt cancellation is their only escape from unemployment and poverty<br />

No relief for Lebanon’s debt is coming – instead, they’ve accepted a new avalanche of loans and aid that threatens their economy with total collapse<br />

The international conference … system and social welfare.<br />

The Lebanese like to stay… the government's coffers.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, this is all part of the plan for a “New Middle East”- by instigating violence and instability the U.S. hopes to use Lebanon as a pressure point with which to realign the region in accordance with neoliberal plans for global domination. Lebanon's destruction is seen as the 'birth pang' of a new economic order<br />

The neoliberal gangsterism operating in Lebanon relies on s a politics of fear, which targets Lebanon for destruction to keep it from potentially blocking American-Israeli dominance in the region. The war against Lebanon is the manifestation of a global strategy to concentrate wealth in the U.S. and its clients, and eliminate all who stand in the way<br />

The destructive and lethal forces … Israel to take military action.&quot;<br />
<br />
The prescriptions of structural adjustment being implemented in Lebanon are unfalsifiable and untested claims that serve to reproduce our ideological dominance - despite rhetoric about economic growth and equality, all other goals are quickly subordinated to neo-liberal stabilization and adjustment, eliminating questions about what purpose it serves. Designed by elites, the so-called science of neo-liberal economics rationalizes global inequality<br />

The IMF and the World Bank … loudly and forcefully.<br />
<br />
Neoliberal ideology treats anything and anyone who stands in the way of the market's global expansion as superfluous and disposable. The poor and excluded become failed citizens, who lack economic value and thus become invisible. Entire populations can be destroyed, if their suffering is necessary to maintain our privilege - this ongoing crime against humanity outweighs any other catastrophe<br />

Contention 2: A Wrench in the Machine<br />
<br />
Canceling Lebanon’s debt would challenge the global role of the IMF and induce countries around the globe to demand a more just economic system, reversing America’s neo-liberal agenda in the Middle East. Demands for debt cancellation link up with worldwide coalitions that challenge global poverty and inequality<br />

The strategic approach …. shaping the ‘global economy’.<br />
<br />
Lebanese poverty is not inevitable, it’s the result of an economic system we benefit from daily. We indirectly participate in government policy whether we choose to or not- avoiding institutional strategies is complicit in the sacrifice of the world’s most vulnerable.<br />
Patrick Hayden is Senior Lecturer in the School of International Relations, University of St. Andrews, Superfluous Humanity: An Arendtian Perspective on the Political Evil of Global Poverty, March 2007, Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Volume 35, Number 2, pg. 9-10<br />
Pogge maintains that … moral and political evil.62<br />
<br />
The tragedy in Lebanon cannot just be blamed on a few elites - we must take collective responsibility for the harm caused by exporting neo-liberalism. Only recognizing our own place in systems of privilege creates the mental ability to challenge such outcomes. Staying within the institutional roles assigned to us, as academics, consumers or policy debaters is the blindness that allows global exploitation to continue unabated<br />
Patrick Hayden is Senior Lecturer in the School of International Relations, University of St. Andrews, Superfluous Humanity: An Arendtian Perspective on the Political Evil of Global Poverty, March 2007, Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Volume 35, Number 2, Pg. 15-17<br />
In ‘Collective Responsibility’ (1968) … ‘world common to all people’.102<br />
<br />
Neoliberalism is perpetuated by the inability of the affluent to understand the forced sacrifice of the world’s poor. Our learned objectivity distances us from the reality of others lives, and allows us to remain complicit in their suffering. To judge responsibly, you should enlarge your thought to include the perspective of the Lebanese people, and the world’s poor in general who see no benefit from the economic freedoms we take for granted. Stepping away from our own standpoint is the only path to ethically responsible decision-making<br />

<br />
Refusing to step away from a view from the top of the neo-liberal economy detaches ethics from capitalism, which causes it to devour and destroy the planet. Without reconnecting ourselves to the perspective others, no one will accept responsibility as the bureaucratic machine that grinds away all that makes us human<br />
