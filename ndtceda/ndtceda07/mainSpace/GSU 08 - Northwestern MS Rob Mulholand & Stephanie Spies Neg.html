A production centered view of the environment makes extinction inevitable—it leads to marginal tinkering instead of structural changes in our consumptive practices and makes subsidies more likely<br />

Our alternative is to reject the aff’s production centered view of agriculture and the environment—leads to a rethinking of how humans relate to nature<br />

Centering our activism on the policymaking arena locks in a production centered approach to the environment—creating cycles of environmental destruction while ignoring difficult questions about consumption<br />

Export Control Condition CP<br />
<br />
Text<br />
The United States federal government should offer to retain nearly all domestic subsidies for biofuels and the $0.54 import tariff on ethanol if and only if the governments of Pakistan and Kazakhstan retain their export bans on grain. <br />
<br />
US can take the lean in reducing food prices – eliminating ethanol and connecting it to a broader agreement on export bans is key to create momentum that reduces price distortions <br />
Subramaniam, 08 <br />
(Meanwhile in the developing… about collective agreement.)<br />
<br />
These export bans are causing prices to skyrocket – Afghanistan is particularly hard hit by Pakistan’s recent ban – high food prices are creating instability and are destroying Karzai’s credibility <br />
Barker 08 <br />
(The 27-year-old ….100 a month)<br />
<br />
Further Talibanization of Afghanistan spill over in Pakistan, wars across Central Asia, and escalatory nuclear strikes against India and Israel. <br />
Morgan 06<br />
(However, the Taliban…NUCLEAR Pakistan)<br />
<br />
2NC<br />
<br />
Paki export bans is the cause of food crisis in Afghanistan – prevents food aid distribution from buying necessary supplies <br />
Star 08 <br />
(In fact, President … to find it)<br />
<br />
IT’s a forced choice – WTO members must choose between liberalizing trade unilaterally or multilaterally – and the two are mutually exclusive <br />
Mattoo and Subramanian 03<br />
(Against the backdrop…for India today)<br />
<br />
Eliminate means to remove from consideration<br />
Merriam Webster, 08 <br />
(transitive verb… of the playoffs)<br />
<br />
That means that CP competes removing subsidies from consideration requires unilateral cuts – the CP keeps subsidies in consideration in WTO negotiations by leaving the outcome of negotiation on subsidies uncertain <br />
Vaile 03<br />
(The US and EU … and subsidies)<br />
<br />
<br />
The CP by definition competes – ‘consideration’ requires negotiated term between parties – the plan must remove subsidies from negotiations <br />
Citizendium 08 <br />
(consideration means … to the rightful owner)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Empirically proven – unilateral concession are pocketed by competitors – despite rhetoric they’ll never actually open their markets unless it’s a condition of our reforms. <br />
Congress Daily, 08 <br />
(Meanwhile, lawmaker reaction… to the interests of U.S.)<br />
<br />
Unilateral cuts incentivize developing countries to free ride on US reductions and retain their own trade barriers – but, reciprocal cuts generate good will and spillover to agreements in other areas. <br />
Lichtenbaum 02<br />
(Developing countries made…to their economies)<br />
<br />
Other countries won’t reciprocate – Their strategy is to free ride<br />
Kearns and Tonelson 08 <br />
