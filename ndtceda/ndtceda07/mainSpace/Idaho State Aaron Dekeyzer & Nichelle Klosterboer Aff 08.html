<u><strong>Framework 2AC</strong></u><br />
We meet – we affirm the resolution<br />
<br />
Counter-interp – the resolution is a crossroads of imagination. It is a text that is the impetus for the scope of what is thinkable for all debaters. It is that which mobilizes us to debate. Debate is storytelling – it should be the story of the 1AC vs the 1NC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Extend Appandurai – first order pictures like the neg framework confine imaginative potential and choke the life of the game. Instead we should strive for dialogue between world pictures because neither is a fact. These frameworks are artifacts located within a historical process, which only through interaction can change the world. To understand this, one must be situated within a paradigm where knowledge production and research are viewed through an imaginative lens<br />
Arjun Appandurai, 2000, “Grassroots Globalization and the Research Imagination,” Public Culture 12.1<br />
We can return now to…the human sciences.<br />
<br />
<br />
Their framework is based on a disenchanted story about debate – a world where ground is destroyed, negs never win, and people quit<br />
a) this is just untrue – a decade of debate has shown that there are a multiplicity of ways to engage non-trad stuff<br />
b) their story discourages love of debate as it is – they hate the topic, they’re not protecting it, the topic is an imaginative crossroads, it’s what makes debate beautiful, they are only disenchanted by this<br />
c) Extend 1AC Bennett – enchantment is key to saving debate – in order to care about anything you have to love it first, they ook at the state of debate and say no, we say yes<br />
d) Proves our frameworks aren’t mutually exclusive – whatever style of debate they care about is best served by moments of enchantment<br />
Bennett 2001, The Enchantment of Modern Life, p. 158<br />
The source or rationale for this ethic…micro-agents act as midwife.<br />
<br />
Narratives and storytelling provide life to politics – trying to ban storytelling from debate is pointless – we should instead find more skillful ways to compare cometing stories of the world<br />
John E. McDonough, 2006, “Narrative Matters: The Power of the Personal Essay in Health Policy, Using and Misusing Anecdote in Policy Making, p. 13<br />
Asking “How do you know that?...intelligent consumers of stories.<br />
<br />
Storytelling assists policy makers in understanding the consequences of policy decisions – narratives identify important and neglected problems and should be given more weight in the political process<br />
McDonough, above<br />
The question to ask is, How do we…think about the potential political impact of their policy decisions.<br />
<br />
The stories we tell are central components of politics and life – the best training for becoming policy makers and legislators is embracing our human heritage of story telling as a way to understand and debate about events.<br />
McDonough, above<br />
Why is narrative so central…value of the r-square.<br />
<br />
Equality is impossible – exploitation and suffering are immanent to the essence of life. Their appeal to a world without oppression is more fundamentally an appeal to a world that is not ours. This is the foundation for the decay of life<br />
Neitzsche, beyond good and evil (no page number given)<br />
Refraining mutually from injury, violence, and exploitation…honest with themselves at least that far.<br />
<br />
Striving for fairness makes debaters the same, which is dangerous considering this is a community that is built upon difference and competition. Embrace the fracture.<br />
Linnell Secomb, 2000, “fractured community,” Hypatia, Vol. 15, No. 2, p. 138-139<br />
Benhabib’s critique of universalist…assume homogeneity and transparency.<br />
<br />
Predictability forces repetition rendering debate unconscious and promotes bad decision-making<br />
Murray Edelman, 1985, The Symbolic Uses of Politics, p. 124-125<br />
These are some of the functions of language…becomes a real gratification.<br />

 The 1AC begins with the resolution and then moves into a rant about many of the scenarios of many affs on the topic. There is an emphasis on repeated words &quot;mundane&quot; and &quot;magical.&quot;<br />
<br />
Our argument is that we are enchanted by the topic as an imaginative crossroads. This is what debate is for us: possibility. And that is why we are enchanted with the resolution and our reading of the multiple aff possibilities.<br />
<br />
The first piece of evidence says that reimagining politics is possible by affirming the topic.<br />
Dillon 99 (Politics of Security, in the first few pages of the intro)<br />
&quot;In making its contribution... freedom as possibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
We then quote a piece of Appandurai evidence from our previous 1AC that should already be on the caselist.<br />
&quot;the capability to imagine... practice of imagination.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next card is from Jane Bennett (The Enchantment of Modern Life: Attachments, Crossings, and Ethics, pp.111)<br />
&quot;Picture a world where... virtual possibilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
We say yes and affirm the resolution.<br />

Ophir and Azoulay 5 (adi, “the monsters tail”, in against the Wall ed. Micheal Sorkin, p. 20-24<br />
In other words-wall in Isreali eyes.<br />
<br />
A crazy logic of violence that prevents violence dominates the entire space of the conflict. A logic that ensures spatial security. Because the region is a permanent state of emergency mechanisms of violence are contuniulay intensified. This violence is especially terrifying because the target is not the human body, it is the spatial arrangement that situates them. Total control over the human body<br />
Ophir and Azoulay 5 (adi, “the monsters tail”, in against the Wall ed. Micheal Sorkin, p.8-9<br />
Indeed without the mediation of law-crazy logic<br />
<br />
Seeking to perfect separation Israel has systematically implemented a number of tunnels and bridges to ease the pain of the barrier. A three-dimensial elemnt of the Isreali Palestinain topology has originated in this conflict<br />

Judge: Daniel Mousstache<br />
<br />
The walls allow violence against space. And requires Palestinians to live a life that is bare minimum.<br />
<br />
The Affirmative makes a distinction between &quot;the wall&quot; and &quot;the walls&quot; of Israel and criticizes the latter.
