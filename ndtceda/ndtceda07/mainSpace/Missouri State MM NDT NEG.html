Engagement uses ties to massively increase the power of the US in the world to protect its security – for example when the US engaged dictators in the battle against communism.<br />
David Adesnik and Michael McFaul, Washington Quarterly 2006<br />
“Democracy promotion… by friendly dictatorships.”<br />
This stabilization of the globe is an attempt to conatin, secure, and manage desire. It mandates a war on difference. Life isn’t secure and it isn’t stable. It’s dangerous. This danger is what makes life beautiful and is integral to being human.<br />
Der Derian, On Security, 95<br />
“Nietzche trasvalues both… with its causes.”<br />
The character of the current administration has adopted an obsession with time – this need to chart out violence and war means adjusting forces to meet that schedule. This kills deliberation and makes war discourse seem necessary.<br />
Stahl, A Clockwork War, 2008<br />
“Post-industrial war… of social militarization.”<br />
Alt: Reject the affirmative. Our alternative is a reclamation of the political through the recognition that freedom is the essence of human being.<br />
Conflict cannot be controlled and should be embraced as part of human being. The call to secure the globe disciplines individuals and denies their fundamental freedom.<br />
