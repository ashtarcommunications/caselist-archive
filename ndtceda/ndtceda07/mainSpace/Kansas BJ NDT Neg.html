Team Name Neg Kansas BJ<br />
Round # 2<br />
Vs Team: Richmond CD<br />
Judge: Arnett Miller Watson<br />
<br />
<strong>Case Args:</strong><br />
<br />
AT = Cancer<br />
Iraq use overwhelms the U<br />
Japan proves that exposure = longer life and les cancer<br />
All of their evidence is hype - not true<br />
Radiation is not harmful -- improves immune system<br />
<br />
AT – Nuclear Taboo<br />
Consequences matter - moral absolutism is complicit in violence<br />
Have to focus on large scale conflicts before we focus on every day issues<br />
Violent Conflict can only be solved with policy<br />
Negative peace should be the biggest priority<br />
Right to life precedes claims about value to life<br />
Positive Peace fails<br />
<br />
<strong>Off Case Args:</strong><br />
<br />
T – Constructive Engagement = QPQ (Chan – The Peace Way Foundation – Burma Issues – March 96)<br />
Diplomatic Capital D/A (Pakistan)<br />
a) Boucher will be responsible for the diplomatic engagement in the plan. Boucher has been given responsibility for diplomacy in Afghanistan and Pakistan (Lee 8-22-07)<br />
b) The plan distracts Boucher from Pakistan Boucher is focused on Pakistan now Bhadrakumar March 26<br />
c) U.S. diplomacy K to stability in Pakistan (Lisa Curtis 2-15-08)<br />
<em>Columbia</em> <em>FTA</em><br />
<em>UN CP</em><br />
UN must take the lead in Afghanistan – critical to global credibility<br />
Collapse of UN credibility = Extinction<br />
<br />
<strong>Block Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
2NC – Cancer Advantage and Diplomatic Capital D/A<br />
1NR – Nuclear Taboo Advantage and CP<br />
<em>AT – Permuation</em> – Aid Fragmentation – The CP alone is best, multiple simultaneous donors diffuses responsibility for success of failure (Knack and Rahman 2004, Stephen “Donor Fragmentation and Bureaucratic quality in Aid Recipients)<br />
