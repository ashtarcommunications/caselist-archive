<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The tree was the only citrus tree in the garden that had a fruit on it. Gabriel had taken some pains to plant the tree to mark the Tropic of Cancer. A line. An imaginary line girdling the globe and separating North from South at the northernmost latitude reached by the overhead sun. Rafaela didn’t think much about Gabriel’s fascination with an imaginary line, but she knew instinctively the importance of the surviving orange.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In the days when it was a blossom of soft petals, she noticed a line—finer than the thread of a spiderweb—pulled with delicate tautness. Perhaps it was something like a laser beam or light passing through an optic fiber. When the baby orange appeared, it seemed to grasp that line as its parent, if a line could be a parent. And when the salty wind blew west from the sea rocking it back and forth like a small cradle, the curious line—now running through the growing orange—rocked back and forth with it like a lullaby. The orange fell irresistibly from a height of two meters, rolling down a small slope to a neutral place between the ownership and the highway. An old man carrying his suitcase along the highway toward the bus stop came upon the orange. He stopped, opened his suitcase, and put the orange in one corner. As he boarded the bus, the strands of the line extended from the orange, reaching out of the suitcase and slipping across the bus, through the windows and across the land. The bus pulled away from stop, starting its journey from the small city just north of Mazatlan to the US-Mexico border. On either side of the bus, the landscape was continually familiar, as if they were moving but not moving. Tired from five hundred years of travel, the old man closed his eyes for a long moment. He could see again the woman who sold him the nopales in the plaza,<br />
Haitian farmers burning and slashing cane,<br />
workers stirring molasses into white gold,<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">This exploitation depends on the naturalized divide between the Global North and the Global South. The North continually protects its own position, claiming that these protections benefit everyone. This dynamic is epitomized in the relationship between the United States and Mexico, in which an interlocking system of free trade and corn subsidies enables American agribusiness to flood Mexico with underpriced corn. Stripped of their livelihood and forced off their land, millions of displaced Mexican farmers migrate to the US, where they are further exploited as day laborers.

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">When the old man finally opened his eyes, he could see<br />
all 1,950 miles of the frontier stretched across from Tijuana on the Pacific<br />
to the end of its tail on the Gulf of México.<br />
It waited with seismic sensors and thermal imaging,<br />
with colonias of destitute skirmishing at its hard line<br />
with steel structures, barbed wire, infrared binoculars,<br />
INS detention centers, border patrols, rape,<br />
robbery, and death.<br />
It waited with its great history of migrations back and forth—<br />
the deportation of 400,000 Mexican citizens in 1932<br />
coaxing back of 2.2 million braceros in 1942<br />
only to exile the same 2.2 million wetbacks in 1953.<br />
They held the border to his throat like a great knife: What is your name? How old are you? Where were you born? Where is your vista? Your passport? Are you carrying any fruit or vegetables?<br />
The old man tried to respond, but his voice was swallowed up by the waves of floating paper money: a graceful movement of free capital carried across by hidden and cheap labor. Hundreds of thousands of the unemployed surged forward. Then came the corn and the sugar cane, the music and its rhythms, the halls of Moctezuma and all 40,000 Aztecs slain, the burned and strangled body of the Incan king Atahualpa, the spirit of ideologies thought to be dead and of the dead themselves. Everything and everybody got in lines—citizens and aliens—the great undocumented foment, the Third World War, the gliding wings of a dream. Mi casa es su casa. Mi tierra es su tierra. Mi mundo es su mundo. </span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">We believe debate should be about methodologies of the oppressed, forming a new consciousness that realizes our ability to shape reality. We ask you to utilize your ballot as a means of advocating magical realism as a tactic to transgress the static boundaries that corn subsidies are built upon. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This is a necessary confrontation of the singular, hegemonic view of reality in favor of a view that embraces fluidity and agency. Challenging our understanding of the supposedly neutral support of domestic agriculture enables us to pursue productive identity formation. The affirmation of magical realism in this round counters the exile of the unreal, activating a new potential for agency.
