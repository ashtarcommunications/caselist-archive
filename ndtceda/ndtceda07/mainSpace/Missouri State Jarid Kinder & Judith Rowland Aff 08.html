F-r-e-e-d-o-m! Where are you hiding? …. Don't hesitate. You can do it. We all can.<br />
<br />
Refugees in Lebanon are currently invisible within the law and are melted into the background of society with no hope of citizenship or recognition. Granting them documentation brings them out of the dark and allows us to interact ethically<br />

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency ….. are illegal, can you help us?' '' Mr. Cook said.<br />
<br />
Extending hospitality to the refugee overcomes our own egoistic attempts to dominate and becomes an instrument of ethical action and transformation<br />
David J. Gauthier December 2004 MARTIN HEIDEGGER, EMMANUEL LEVINAS, AND THE POLITICS OF DWELLING <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11052004-163310/unrestricted/Gauthier_dis.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11052004-163310/unrestricted/Gauthier_dis.pdf</a><br />
Like Heidegger, …. an instrument of ethical action.2<br />
<br />
PLAN: The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Lebanon by requesting the government of Lebanon grant the Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon political, economic and social rights and Lebanese citizenship. The United States will provide necessary foreign assistance required to support this transition to recognition and citizenship. Funding and enforcement guaranteed.<br />

We believe that life has value because it cannot be reduced to a calculation. We need to act morally simply because we SHOULD act morally, regardless of these idiosyncratic exceptions and minor justifications to the contrary. Anything less forces morality to sublimate itself to the rationalizations of calculability, effectively sidestepping and voiding the value of those very lives that reason purports to save<br />

But one can also be ready to die …. caring while trying to escape it.<br />
<br />
Recognizing our responsibility to the other allows true ethical freedom. This allows us to construct a radically different future and provides hope for a transformation of society<br />
Sandra Rosenthal (Loyola University) 2003 A Time for Bein Ethical: Levinas and Pragmatism The Journal of Speculative Philosophy 17.3 192-203<br />
This position gives a new …. I have another chance.<br />
<br />
Our responsibility to the other is infinite. We should not deliberate on our attempt to examine the consequences of this obligation. Any attempt at this sort of deliberation makes violence inevitable.<br />
Fryer 2004<br />
David Fryer The Intervention of the Other: Ethical Subjectivity in Levinas and Lacan p. 219-220<br />
For Levinas … my subjectivity<br />
<br />
To reimagine politics from the question of ethics rather than the comparison of net benefits is to acknowledge that subjectivity comes prior to practive, and that the relation to the other comes prior to the social construction of our identities. We must open ourselves to ethics by turning away from attempts to economize responsibility. Doing so forces us to acknowledge our complicity with the horrors in the world around us and to act as if our responsibility to act in the wake of those horrors is infinite<br />
Ann Murphy 04 Borderlands Volume 3.1 The Political Significance of Shame <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.borderlandsejournal.adelaide.edu.au/vol3no1_2004/murphy_shame.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.borderlandsejournal.adelaide.edu.au/vol3no1_2004/murphy_shame.htm</a><br />
Exactly what is motivating …. responsibility for the past.<br />
<br />
We must first recognize the Other’s call for hospitality as a part of our ethical encounter. Sovereign self-interest in not our first priority, but rather orienting our discourse around the view that refugees are real people. Instead of asking how best to exclude them, we should offer them refuge.<br />
Paul Miller, Australian National University 2004 Truth Overboard: What does it Mean for Politicians and Statesmen<br />
to Assume Responsibility for their Words of Mass Destruction? Borderlands Volume 3 Number 1, 2004<br />
Firstly, while ….how best to exclude them.<br />
<br />
Recognizing the situation of the refugee is the first call in our responsibility to the Other- We must have empathy for the Others longings and fears to meet these demands. This ethical challenge is anterior to pragmatic solutions and problem solving.<br />

How deep does the legal challenge that faces Palestine go? …. self-hating and, last but not least, anti-Semitic.<br />
