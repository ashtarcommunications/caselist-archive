 A guarantee is a positive extension of a security umbrella to prevent attack by a third party.<br />

Our interpretation: Security guarantees are positive commitments to defend a country against attack.:<br />
Security guarantees are positive commitments to protect a country in case of aggression – military cooperation and non-aggression are not enough to constitute a security gurantee<br />
Tertrais 2004, the Washington Quarterly, the Changing Nature of Militayr Alliances, 27.2 p. 135-147<br />
Modern military alliances are … as Pakistan or Burma.<br />
Guarantees are a commitment to defend against attack, assurances are a promise not to attack. Ukraine and North Korea are examples of security assurances – guarantees are NATO-like commitments.<br />
Efron, 2003 (Sonni, Previous Pacts May Inspire Deal on North Korea, Los Angeles Times, October 22, lexis)<br />
The second deal that might be considered … but we haven’t done it with enemies.” Pfaltzgraff said.<br />
Ukraine proves: U.S. officials were very explicit about the distinction between guarantees and assurances – assurances were informal non treaty-ratified commitments<br />
Keany and Mendelsohn 94 (Federal News Service, December1)<br />
What security guarantees might we see? Are we … that document.<br />
Our interp most predictable – only reference to security guarantees in U.S&gt; code is our positive security guarantee to NATO<br />

Some NATO members, such as Spain … as circumstances warrant.<br />
Security assurances are as tep down from gurantees – they are a negative commitment not to attack instead of a positive commitment to defend<br />
Walsh 2007, John McLaughlin’s “one on One”, fderla news Service July 7<br />
A quick question … might be there.<br />
Security guarantees are pledges of assisatan in the event of attack and re distinct form assurances<br />

T Constructive engagement<br />
Constructive engagmenet must be unconditional extension of incentives.<br />
1. The use of conditional incentives for specific quid pro quos in South Africa was a fundamental shift away from the policy of constructive engagement, which was undconditional, <br />
Baker 2000, Honey and Vinegar: Incentives, Sanctions and Foreign Policy, ed. Haas and O’Sullivan, p. 112-113<br />
In the end, a mix … its name.<br />
2. Unconditional engagement offers unilateral changes in U.S. policy without explicit reciprocation – quid pro quo’s are considered conditional engagemtn<br />
Haas and O’Sullivan 2000 (Richard N. and Meghan L., Honey and Vinegar: Incentives, Sanctions and Foreign Policy, p 4-6<br />
As is evident … orientation of regimes. 11<br />
B. The violation – the plan is conditional, not constructive, engagement – incentives are only offered as a part of a reciprocal quid pro quo.<br />
C. Standards – <br />
1. Predictable limits – the aff interpretation means we must be prepared not only for security gurantees and foreign assistance mechanisms, but also reforms in the recipient th e plan is conditioned on. Their interpretation multiplies the number of affs by an incredible fctor – it is impossible for the negative to predict what the aff incentive is used as a bargaining chip for.<br />
2. Aff condiotnality is uniquely bad – stable affa dvocacy is critical to negative ground, and the plan’s action si conditioned on the response of the recipient. The condition counteprlan should be negative ground.<br />
<br />
3. Precision – our evidence describes the historical evolution of constructive engagement as a policy. You should err neg for our interpretation because it is consistent with the literature description of constructive engagement, which ensures a better, more predictable literature base.<br />
