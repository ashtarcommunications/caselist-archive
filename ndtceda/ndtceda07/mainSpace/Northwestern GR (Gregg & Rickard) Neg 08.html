 <strong>Disengagement CP</strong><br />
Text- The USFG should establish and implement a policy of constructive disengagement (with is crossed out) towards the Middle East.<br />
<br />
Middle eats policy is grounded in a model of assistance, engagement, and entanglement. The aff’s commitment extends this model and elevates attachment to aan America-inclusive middle east.<br />
Leon Hadar, 2005 Cato Institute, Sandstorm: Policy Failure in the Middle East<br />
“Imagine if President… and global powers.<br />
<br />
Iraq proves now is key to disengage….<br />
Hadar again.<br />
“These and related… and global powers.”<br />
<br />
Every justification for U.S. engagement can be dealt with more effectively by the shift to regional governance with a European backdrop. Muslim and European governments have the know-how to deal with it sustainability.<br />
Edward Olsen, 2002 [U.S. National Defense for the Twenty-First century: The Grand Exit Strategy]<br />
“On the face of it… and mutually reinforcing.”<br />
<br />
<br />
U.S. commitments create escalating engagement commitments that lock in a spiraling increase in U.S. regional involvement—domestic interest groups lock in entanglement.<br />
Hadar again…<br />
“A spiral effect… the Middle Eastern players.”<br />
<br />
<br />
America’s addicted to involvement in the Mid East, diplomatic and economic commitments re-establish this American presence and rule out disengagement.<br />
Leon Hadar, 1994 [“The Real Lesson of the Oslo Accord: Localize the Arab-Israeli Conflict, Foreign Policy Briefing No. 31, May 9]<br />
“One can compare… its own interest.”<br />
<br />
<br />
This transition to regional governance is the only hope for enduring conflict resolution—US absence is on-balance more effective than U.S. constructive engagement and if there’s a conflict it won’t escalate.<br />
Barbara Conry, 1994 [ “America’s Misguided Policy of Dual Containment in the Persian Gulf”, Cato FoPo Briefing No. 33, 11/10]<br />
“Washington cannot control… invites disaster.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan collapses the transition to effective regional governance—U.S. initiatives crowd out planning and incentive.<br />
Leon Hadar, 1991 [Cato Institute, Extracting America from its Middle Easterm Entanglement”, Cato Policy Analysis]<br />
“The United States… intervention after another.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These conflicts will escalate only if the U.S. is still a player in the region—disengagement ensures no exscalation.<br />
Edward Olsen, 2002 [U.S. National Defense for the 21st Century: The Grand Exit Strategy]<br />
“Nonetheless, the possibility… in the cross-fire.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The bias in favor of engagement is set against a backdrop of distortion—self-serving interest in the paradigm’s corruption or existing scholarship—the very conflation of disengagement with chaos itself is the driver of conflict.<br />
Leon Hadar, 2005 [Sandstorm: Policy Failure in the Middle East]<br />
“Challenging the American… Americans to expect.”<br />
<br />
U.S. can’t stabilize Afghanistan—only disengagement strengthens Karzai.<br />
Japan Times ’07 [Gwynne Dyer, 8/23]<br />
“There are already… of Iraq, why not?”<br />
<br />
And a Dempsey and Lukas card about foreign assistance = dependence generically.<br />
<br />
<strong>Arms Deal DA</strong><br />
<br />
Bush proposed a large arms deal to Israel and moderate Arab nations—Congress will pass the arms deal this fall—aid to Israel means Olmert will not resist and neither will the Israel lobby.<br />
Heller, 8-16-2007 [The Gurdian, U.S. To Give Israel Record Military Aid, lexis.]<br />
“The United States offered…. Would be little opposition.”<br />
<br />
An inherent contradiction is perceived between Zionism and Pan-Arabism in the Middle East—this perception makes foreign policy with the Middle East a zero sum game—any policy that increases engagement with an Arab nation is perceived negatively by Israel.<br />
Sid-Ahmed, political analyst and contributing editor to Mid East Report, 2000 [Al-Ahram Weekly, Globalisation and specificity. March Issue. Lexis.]<br />
The explanation for…total defeat of the other.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Pissing off the lobby forces a foreign policy u-turn in which Bush must appease the lobby—Bush and congress will back down on the arms deal.<br />
Mearsheimer and Walt, The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, p. 214-15<br />
“Bush was not… another humiliating defeat.”<br />
<br />
Arms deal gives modern defenses to Middle East and increases containment efforts of Iran.<br />
Solomon, Wall Street Journal, July 30, 2007<br />
“The Bush administration.. and $15 billion.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Current defenses in the Middle East will not deter Iran—only weapons can prevent annihilation from nuclear war.<br />
Krauthammer, 2006, The Washington Post, The Tehran Calculus<br />
“In the region… off the map.”<br />

Neg. vs. Afghanistan Crop Substitution<br />
<br />
Off-Case Arguments:<br />
1. T - constructive engagement. Conditioning necessary - quid pro quo.<br />
2. CP - Constructive disengagement. US should disengage from the Saudi Arabia Arms Deal. Plan irritates Israel --&gt; arms deal not pass.
