Every decision is laced with ontology we must question the ontological assumptions of a decision or violence and war become inevitable<br />
Burke 2007 (Anthony, Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence and Reason” Theory and Event vol. 10.2, Project Muse)<br />

In a worst-case …many times over.<br />
<br />
<strong>Additionally, Israel Will Inevitably Attack Iran If Hardliners Remain In Power</strong><br />
<strong>LA Times</strong>, 2/7/200<strong>7</strong><br />
(Richard Bordeaux, “Israel sounds the alarm on Iran’s nuclear efforts,”)<br />
<u>Israel began secretly… opposes military action</u>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Israeli Attacks Would Escalate and Cause Worldwide Nuclear War</strong><br />

<strong><u>As Israeli society … a world conflagration</u></strong>.&quot; (44)<br />
<br />
<strong>PLAN:</strong><br />
<strong>The United States Federal Government should offer a security guarantee to the government of Iran that the United States will not preemptively attack Iran.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Contention 4: Solvency</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A Security Guarantee from the United States is the only way to empower the Iranian moderates and solve nuclear proliferation</strong><br />

Rather than conducting …Iranian nuclear policy.<br />
<br />
<strong>A US Security Guarantee would stop the Hardliners from using US policies for recruitment</strong><br />

So <u>perhaps Iran …that of Israel</u>.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>History Proves that Threats of military force by the US only drive nations to acquire nuclear weapons faster– US security guarantee would solve Iranian proliferation</strong></u><br />

<u>Today, the Islamic … Iran’s nuclear imbroglio.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>US security guarantee is the only way for European negotiations to succeed</strong><br />
<strong>Montgomery</strong>, postdoctoral fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, 200<strong>5</strong><br />
(Alexander, “Ringing in Proliferation,” International Security)<br />
If the North Korean … nuclear weapons threshold.<br />
<br />
<strong>Negotiations between Europe and Iran failed because of the lack of a US security guarantee – only the plan leads to successful negotiations</strong><br />

<u>That meant that … the Middle East</u>.
