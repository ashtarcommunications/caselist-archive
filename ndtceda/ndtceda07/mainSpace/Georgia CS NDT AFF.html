 We are not debating in a vacuum. This year’s resolution does not only ask the question of the USFG’s constructive engagement with the Middle East, it also calls all of us into question as students, as academics, as the producers of knowledge about the world around us. Adam and I affirm the resolution as dissident intellectuals, as students taught within an already imperial way of knowing. In this context, we recognize that we have been produced as consumers of information passed down from the authoritative structures of established knowledge. We refuse this passivity in affirmation of our student resistance in the here and now.<br />
Sophia McClennan, College literature, the geopolitical war on US higher education<br />
Consequently, the right’s…our best weapon.<br />
<br />
If the University is today under attack, we would do well to remember that none of this is new, none of this is sudden, we have seen this all before. From McCarthy to the Reagan Revolution to the current assault on the academy, we learn that institutions of thought are always the first victims of imperial interventions. Rather than limit our resistance to a reactionary anti-establishment anthem, we would first turn to something which has changed: the status of Middle East studies and its relationship to the policymaking establishment. The twentieth century witnessed a growing divide between those who study the ME and those who dictate policy towards it. What we see is the gradual replacement of intellectual interest with sound bites and conformism.<br />
Zachary Lockman, critique from the right: the neo-conservative assault on middle east studies<br />
But there was…as a doornail.<br />
<br />
In the spirit of constructive engagement, we would like to contrapuntally juxtapose this problematic of the American university with a story from the other end of the imperial dynamic. The story of Palestnian universities is the story of colonialism in the Arab world.<br />
Ibrahim Abu-Lughod, Palestinian higher education: national identity, liberation, and globalization<br />
Palestine is part…as a night school.<br />
<br />
What we learn through a contrapuntal reading of American and Palestinian education is that knowledge is never socially neutral. In both cases, the institutions which direct the production of knowledge are both reflective and productive of broader questions of culture and politics. Perhaps more critically, we learn that imperial and colonial cultures do not develop in isolation but enrich and compliment each other in important and often unacknowledged ways.<br />
Said, Culture and Imperialism, p. 258-261<br />
Politics—and the frankly…and the United States.<br />
<br />
The University is a key site for the regcognition of the hybrid contingency of imperial culture. We ask you to affirm this explorative possibility towards on-imperial ways of knowing.<br />
Said, Culture and Imperialism, p. xxv-xxvi<br />
We are still the…the emerging groups.<br />
<br />
We believe the best strategy for liberating the oppressed is to follow in the footsteps of Johnny the Red and his student movement that incarnated the events of May 1968 in Paris, France. Just like Johnny, we are a population of student intellectuals, much like his ‘politics club’ that met in the lecture hall at Nanterre. In this debate, we will defend the May ’68 strategy for liberating the oppressed. Webelieve that this strategy has three advantages that make it a better strategy for liberating the oppressed than the neg<br />

In Paris in…lasting political impact<br />

May 68 mobilized an entire city behind a student movement—quickly the whole of Paris turned on the de Gaulle government<br />
