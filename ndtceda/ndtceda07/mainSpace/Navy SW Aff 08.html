Ob 1: Inherency<br />
<br />
Current US efforts to curb drug production in Afghanistan focus on eradication, risking mission failure in Afghanistan.<br />
SENLIS Council, 2007 (Security and Development Policy Group, “Poppy for Medicine: Licensing poppy for the production of essential medicines: an integrated counter-narcotics, development and counter-insurgency model for Afghanistan”, June, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.poppyformedicine.net/documents/Poppy_for_medicine_in_Afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.poppyformedicine.net/documents/Poppy_for_medicine_in_Afghanistan</a>)<br />
<br />
Ob 2: Advantages<br />
Terrorism<br />
1. Counternarcotics effort in Afghanistan are counterproductive threatening security and stability<br />

<br />
2. Eradication increases hostility against the US, increasing ethnic tensions and giving the Taliban leverage.<br />
Brown 05. Vanda Felbab, fellow at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Afghanistan: When Counternarcotics Undermine. The Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Washington Quarterly.<br />
<br />
3. The Taliban relies on opium for financing--decreasing funding solves terrorism<br />
Townsend and Mili 07, Jacob, a research analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and Hayder, independent researcher specializing in terrorism and security issues. Afghanistan’s Drug Trade and How it Funds Taliban Operations, 10 May 2007 Terrorism Monitor. The Jamestown Foundation.<br />
<br />
4. The Taliban and Al Qaeda are the same thing in Afghanistan—cutting off the source of funding for the Taliban directly impacts Al Qaeda.<br />
CNN, 2007 (CNN: Special Investigations Unit, “Narco State: The Poppy Jihad”, air date September 15, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0709/15/siu.01.html" rel="nofollow">http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0709/15/siu.01.html</a>)<br />
<br />
Pakistan<br />
1. Afghanistan on the brink--Collapse of the government sparks a Sunni-Shia regional war and brings down Pakistan's government.<br />
Watt and Temko July 15, 2007 (&quot;Failure in Afghanistan risks rise in terror, say generals. Military chiefs warn No.10 that defeat could lead to change of regime in Pakistan The Observer)<br />
<br />
2. Eradication drives peasants to flee to Pakistan and join radical Islamic anti-American groups that fight the US—leading to political instability in Pakistan<br />
Brown 05. Vanda Felbab, fellow at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Afghanistan: When Counternarcotics Undermine. The Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Washington Quarterly.<br />
<br />
3. The impact to Pakistani collapse is an India-Pakistan nuclear war with 17 million dead.<br />
Davidson, 2002 (Kay, June 7, &quot;Nuclear Threat Has World on Edge,&quot; San Francisco Chronicle)<br />
<br />
4. US Successes in Afghanistan would spill over into Pakistan and throughout Central Asia, solving the India-Pakistan conflict.<br />
Millan, 03 (Colonel G. Joseph, US Army, “Poppy Cultivation in Afghanistan: A Global, Strategic Nemesis,” Army War College, 7-04, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A414543&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A414543&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Advantage 3: Women in Afghanistan<br />
1. Women in Afghanistan are sold to drug lords to pay off their parents’ debt.<br />
Noori, 2006 (Sweeta, Afghanistan Country Director, Women for Women, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.peacewomen.org/un/5thAnniversary/Open_Debate/Statements/SweetaNoori.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.peacewomen.org/un/5thAnniversary/Open_Debate/Statements/SweetaNoori.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
2. Selling women violates basic principles of human rights and human dignity.<br />
Cook, 1994 (Rebecca, Human Rights of Women: National and International Perspectives, University of Pennsylvania Press , page 194)<br />
<br />
3. Gender-based violations of rights leads to genocide.<br />
Amnesty International 98<br />
(October 1, pg. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGACT310061998?open&amp;of=ENG-347" rel="nofollow">http://news.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGACT310061998?open&amp;of=ENG-347</a> )<br />
<br />
Thus the Plan: The United States Federal Government should increase constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan by implementing the “Poppy for Medicine Project Model” outlined in the Senlis Council 2007 evidence, allowing for the licensing of poppy production for medicinal purposes. We reserve the right to clarify.<br />
<br />
Ob 3: Solvency<br />
<br />
1. Poppies for Medicine projects can solve the economic problems that drive villagers to Al Qaeda.<br />
SENLIS Council, 2007 (Security and Development Policy Group, “Poppy for Medicine: Licensing poppy for the production of essential medicines: an integrated counter-narcotics, development and counter-insurgency model for Afghanistan”, June, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.poppyformedicine.net/documents/Poppy_for_medicine_in_Afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.poppyformedicine.net/documents/Poppy_for_medicine_in_Afghanistan</a>)<br />
<br />
2. The plan’s grassroots economic development is key to winning locals’ hearts and minds.<br />
SENLIS Council, 2007 (Security and Development Policy Group, “Poppy for Medicine: Licensing poppy for the production of essential medicines: an integrated counter-narcotics, development and counter-insurgency model for Afghanistan”, June, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.poppyformedicine.net/documents/Poppy_for_medicine_in_Afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.poppyformedicine.net/documents/Poppy_for_medicine_in_Afghanistan</a>)<br />
<br />
3. Poppies for Medicine Projects entrench the rule of law in Afghanistan which is key to solving terrorism.<br />
SENLIS Council, 2007 (Security and Development Policy Group, “Poppy for Medicine: Licensing poppy for the production of essential medicines: an integrated counter-narcotics, development and counter-insurgency model for Afghanistan”, June, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.poppyformedicine.net/documents/Poppy_for_medicine_in_Afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.poppyformedicine.net/documents/Poppy_for_medicine_in_Afghanistan</a>)<br />
<br />
4. Put away your security press—Poppy for Medicine projects solve by integrating existing security and control institutions and giving local communities a stake in the project.<br />
SENLIS Council, 2007 (Security and Development Policy Group, “Poppy for Medicine: Licensing poppy for the production of essential medicines: an integrated counter-narcotics, development and counter-insurgency model for Afghanistan”, June, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.poppyformedicine.net/documents/Poppy_for_medicine_in_Afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.poppyformedicine.net/documents/Poppy_for_medicine_in_Afghanistan</a>)
