The shift from simple farming to mass agriculture represents the current stage of technology's seduction of Western existence -- the enframing of the Earth such that it can only be understood as a stockpile of objects, use and conceived of only insofar as it benefits the sovereign human self. As Heidegger famously stated in 1949 -- &quot;Agriculture is now a motorized food industry -- in essence the same as the manufacturing of corpses in gas chambers and extermination camps, the same as blockading and starving of nations, the same as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.&quot; Heidegger further explains in 1953.<br />
Heidegger, '53 (Martin, The Question Concerning Technology, Published in 1977 in Basic Writings)<br />
And yet the revealing that ... that keep a factory running.<br />
<br />
Nowhere is this enframing more painfully clear than in the modern Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, where animals are deemed livestock whose suffering is utterly discounted in an endless quest for efficiency and profit maximization that is not possible absent a tautological Cartesian understanding of non-human animals as inanimate objects incapable of thought or feeling.<br />
Ibrahim, '7 (Darian M. &quot;A Return to Descartes: Property, Profit, and the Corporate Ownership of Animals,&quot; 70 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs 89)<br />
The conditions for farm animals ... talk? but, Can they suffer'&quot;19<br />
<br />
Environmentalism up until now has been characterized by frenetic and pragmatic attempts to change managerialist tendencies -- all the while remaining firmly within technology's stranglehold on politics. Our resolve to reflect through releasement allows for the revelation of new modes of thought ushering in a new form of politics outside of the bimodial distinction between activity and passivity.<br />
McWhorter, '92 (LaDelle, Heidegger and the Earth: Essays in Environmental Philosophy, pp. 3-7)<br />
Heidegger's work is a call ... subjective existence in our age.<br />
<br />
This will reduces the world to a stable and predictable standing reserve to be called upon as it benefits the self and refuses to value the world as anything else. This ontology represents constant consumption which renders all beings objects--setting the tone for global warfare in the wake of the rejection of Being itself.<br />
Zimmerman, '81 (Michael E., Eclipse of the Self: The Development of Heidegger's Concept of Authenticity, pp. 220-224)<br />
In 1951 Heidegger noted that ... capitalist is a rational miser.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rather than abandon the resolution in steadfast rejection -- we release ourselves towards the topic allowing it to reveal itself to us in a multitude of alternative ways by resolving: that the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural suppert, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies, for biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat.</strong><br />
Odysseos, '7 (Louiza, The Subject of Coexistence, pp. 108)<br />
What is of concern is ... of coexistence in chapter 3.<br />
<br />
The refusal to allow for the revelation of the resolution in our mehtod of understanding would be to technologically enframe debate to ensure its infinite reproduction of conservativism and serve only to quell critical thinking. Do not misunderstand our argument -- we are NOT a new debate dogma but simply openness to new forms of debate.<br />
Shanahan and Heidegger, '93 (Bill &amp; Martin, &quot;kritik of thinking.&quot; Debater's Research Guide. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Shanahan1993HealthCare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Shanahan1993HealthCare.htm</a> .)<br />
Policy has a stranglehold on ... perspectives will open remains above. <br />
<br />
Our mode of thought reveals how simply being is a mode of politics which shatters egotistical managerialism into the expanse of Being.<br />
Zimmerman, '81 (above)<br />
Under the domination of egoism ... the personal God of Creation.<br />
<br />
Releasement reconceptualizes our very understaing of the political -- it cannot be viewed as an instrument for mastering the world. Rather than attempt to renegotiate political procedures, we question the very foundation of what it means to be political in favor of infinite potentiality.<br />
Geiman, '1 (Clare Pearson, &quot;Heidegger's Antigones&quot;, A Companion to Heidegger's Introduction to Metaphysics, eds. Richard Polt &amp; Gregory Fried, pp. 178-180)<br />
With the move to poetic ... to just such a move.31<br />
<br />
Ontology informs every decision. Beginning from an ontologically flawed position dooms action to failure.<br />
Dillon, '95 (Michael, Moral Spaces: Rethinking Ethics &amp; World Politics, pp. 96-99)<br />
Perhaps the most important development .. be technocrats of decision making.<br />
<br />
Our resolve is beyond the domain of the will.<br />
Pezze, '6 (Barbara Dalle, &quot;Heidegger on Gelassenheit,&quot; Minerva - Internet Journal of Philosophy 10 (2006): 94-122, Muse)<br />
Let us pause for a ... open towards the openness itself.
