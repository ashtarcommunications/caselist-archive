<strong>*“A beast approaches</strong><br />
<strong>Patient and confident, savoring the meal to come.</strong><br />
<strong>This beast is made of men and horses, swords and spears.</strong><br />
<strong>An army of slaves, vast beyond imagining,</strong><br />
<strong>ready to devour tiny Greece.</strong><br />
<strong>Ready to snuff out the world’s one hope for reason and justice.</strong><br />
<strong>I am here for all those voices which cannot be heard.<br />
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons.<br />
Three hundred families that bleed for our rights<br />
and for the very principles this room is built upon.</strong><br />
<strong>We’re at war, gentlemen.<br />
We must send the entire Spartan army to aid our king<br />
in the preservation of not just ourselves but of our children.</strong><br />
<strong>Send the army for the preservation of liberty.<br />
Send it for justice.<br />
Send it for law and order.<br />
Send it for reason.”</strong><br />
<strong>*FROM THE SCRIPT OF ‘300’</strong><br />
<strong>CONTENTION ONE – THE LEGACY OF 300 DEAD SPARTANS</strong><br />
<strong>AGAIN, THE FORCES OF REASON HAVE BEEN CALLED UPON TO DEFEND THE WORLD FROM THE BARBARIOUS THREAT OF IRAN. WHETHER OR NOT THE CHARACTERS ACTUALLY CORRESPOND TO THEIR DICTATED ROLES MATTERS LITTLE SINCE BOTH THE MOVIE AND THE NARRATIVE OF AMERICAN POLICY SEEKS TO THROW THE CITIZENRY INTO A FANTASTICAL WORLD OF ABSOLUTE TRUTH WHERE THE PERSIAN ARMY WE FACE IS COMPRISED OF MURDEROUS CONGLOMERATION OF ORCS, NINJA’S AND OTHER NIGHTMARES. SUCH A MYTH OF GOODNESS TRIUMPHING OVER EVIL PULLS THE WOOL OVER OUR EYES PREVENTING US FROM SEEING THAT WE FIT THE ROLE OF THE ‘EVIL PERSIAN EMPIRE’ MUCH BETTER THAN THE SAVIOR OF HUMANITY.</strong><br />

<strong><u>THE NARRATIVE FUSION at</u></strong>… <strong><u>its military adventurism</u></strong>.<br />
<strong>ONCE IRAN HAS BEEN CAST TO PLAY THE PERSIAN ENEMY OPPOSITE AMERICA’S SPARTA, THE ACTUAL POLICIES AND ACTIONS THEY TAKE ARE IRRELEVANT. THEY WILL ALWAYS BE A ‘SUPPORTER OF TERRORISM’ AND A ‘NUCLEAR THREAT’ BECAUSE AMERICAN POLICY MAKERS CAN’T RELATE OR IMAGINE ANYTHING DIFFERENT. THE REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE OR ENGAGE FORMALLY WITH IRAN INSURES NO COUNTER STORIES AND VISIONS BEYOND THE FANTASY AMERICAN POLICY MAKERS HAVE CREATED CAN EMERGE.</strong><br />

<strong><u>the decades-long conflict</u></strong>… <strong><u>imaginations of each</u></strong>.<br />
<strong>THE GOAL OF AMERICA’S STRUGGLE FOR GOOD IS ULTIMATELY APOCALYPTIC; LIKE THE SPARTAN WHO PROMISES TO KILL IN THE NAME OF REASON, AMERICA DEFINES ITS ENEMIES AS THE EMBODIMENT OF CHAOS AND IRRATIONALITY SUCH THAT THEY MUST BE WIPED OUT OF EXISTENCE THROUGH PERPETUAL WAR.</strong><br />

<strong><u>in mythic war</u></strong>… <strong><u>enemy to vanquish</u></strong>.<br />
<strong>THE PRIMARILY DIFFICULTY WITH BOTH THE ‘300’ STORY AND THE ONE THAT MOTIVATES AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY IS THAT WE TAKE THEM LITERALLY. WE BELIEVE THE WORLD ACTUALLY OPERATES THROUGH OUR LENS OF GOOD AND EVIL SO WE REPRESS ALL OTHER STORIES AND IMAGES OF REALITY UNDER THE AFFIRMATION OF STABILITY. THIS CREATES A SCHIZOPHRENIC DESIRE FOR INSTABILITY SO WE NEVER HAVE TO FACE A WORLD WITHOUT AN ENEMY TO DESTROY.</strong><br />

<strong><u>Literalism’s analytical focus</u></strong>… <strong><u>call</u></strong> “<strong><u>being realistic</u></strong>.”<br />
<strong>IRAN IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF OUR SCHIZOPHRENIC NEED FOR INSTABILITY; OUR NEED TO POSITION THEM AS A NUCLEAR THREAT TO FIT OUR FANTASY HAS LEAD THE UNITED STATES TO ACTUALLY FUND IRAN’S NUCLEAR PROGRAM. THIS IS NOT A CONSPIRACY, CONGRESS RECENTLY ADMITTED TO THIS LITTLE FACT.</strong><br />

<strong><u>The U.S. Energy</u></strong>… <strong><u>schizophrenic foreign policy</u></strong>.&quot;<br />
<strong>THE PROBLEM WITH MYTH LIES FIRST AND FOREMOST IN THE WAY WE APPROACH SECURITY; THE DEFINING OF ‘REAL’ SECURITY THREATS THROUGH THE OPINIONS OF EXPERTS AND NEWS SNIPPETS CREATES, IN ITSELF, CREATES A WORLD THAT HAS NO RELATION TO REALITY. SUCH AN ‘IMAGE-SALAD’ HELPS NUMB US TO FEAR AND IGNORE ACTUAL DANGER.</strong><br />

<strong><u>As we watch</u></strong><u>…</u> <strong><u>part that refuses to worry</u></strong><br />
<strong>ANALYZING AND DEBATING INCESSANTLY OVER PARTICULAR SCENERIOS FOR WAR MISSES THE POINT; AS LONG AS WE BELIEVE THE LITERAL TRUTH OF GOOD TRIUMPHING OVER EVIL WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE PSYCHOLOGICALLY NUMBED TOWARDS VIOLENCE. ANY EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE WORLD WITHOUT FIRST ADDRESSING THE STORIES THAT MAKE CONFLICT DESIRABLE ENSURES THE PREVENTION OF WAR BECOMES NOTHING MORE THAN PROOF OF AMERICAN BENEVOLENCE AND JUSTIFICATION FOR THE NEXT CONFLICT.</strong><br />

<strong><u>instead of constantly waiting</u></strong>… <strong><u>paramount condition of our lives</u></strong><br />
<strong>CONTENTION TWO – PERSIAN PERSUASION</strong><br />
<strong>WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE IRAN; SUCH A DIPLOMATIC OFFER WOULD COMMIT THE UNITED STATES TO ACCEPT IRAN’S REGIONAL POSITION AND ALLOW BOTH PARTIES TO RETRACT THEIR SHADOWY PROJECTIONS TOWARDS EACH OTHER. ENGAGEMENT AND DIALOGUE DOES NOT MEAN AN END TO CONFLICT BUT RATHER MEANS THE TWO COUNTRIES CAN RELATE TO EACH OTHER IN CONTEXTS BEYOND WAR.</strong><br />

<strong><u>Prior to</u></strong> Richard <strong><u>Nixon's</u></strong>… <strong><u>other than war occurs</u></strong>.<br />
<strong>IRAN IS LIKELY TO ACCEPT AMERICA’S OFFER; DESPITE THEIR RENUNCIATION OF AMERICA AS THE ‘GREAT SATAN’ THEY’D STILL BE WILLING TO AGREE TO DIALOGUE IN EXCHANGE FOR RECOGNITION.</strong><br />
