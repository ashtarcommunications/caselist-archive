<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The entire food supply has invisibly become dominated by corn --- the federal budget, in the form of taxpayer-funded subsidies, has locked-in commodity corn’s role. From processed foods to corn-fed animals, the crop has invisibly yet steadily turned us into an expanding race of corn consumers</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The battle over control of food production is an epic planetary struggle that will determine the fate of earth --- subsidizing agribusiness dominance over production distorts world food supplies and makes environmental degradation inevitable.
