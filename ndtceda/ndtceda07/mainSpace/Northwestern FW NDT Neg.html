<br />
F/W<br />
<br />
The Switch-side debating is crucial to education and effective political training—learning only one side of an issue, no matter how right they may be about the merits, destroys critical thinking collapses capacity for people to take their debate skills and translate them into the real world<br />
<br />
Muir 93 (Philosophy and rhetoric 26.4)<br />
<br />
The debate over…on the job.<br />
<br />
The lack of a positive or specific description of a better world leaves your project politically inept the celebration of otherness while maybe self congratulatory becomes so addicted to the fetishization of difference that is incapable of ever articulating a way to make things better<br />
<br />
Duncombe 01 (Notes from underground P. 184-5)<br />
<br />
I regularly ask…as a political.<br />
<br />
We have an external impact to fairness that is insulated from their case—preservation of equal ground and compliance with democratically agreed upon topic norms is crucial to instill an ethic of tolerance and respect for alterity—the idea that the 1ac is more important than giving the other side a chance to talk is the root of bigotry and tolerance<br />
<br />
Muir 93 (philosophy and rhetoric 26.4_<br />
<br />
Values clarification…rather than relativistic.<br />
<br />
<br />
The adherence to democratically established norms of communication is the baseline for effective politics—the insistence upon the correctness of one’s argument in contrast to procedural rules will end in violent revolutionary nightmares<br />
<br />
Wolin 4 (The seduction of Unreason p 312-313)<br />
<br />
The postmodernists…lost cause.<br />
<br />
<br />
This also takes out their offense—academic debate is simply not conducive to creating direct social change—you aren’t convincing the judges of anything substantive—far more important is preserving the method of switch-side debate.<br />
<br />
Muir 93 (Philosophy and rhetoric 26.4 p 278)<br />
<br />
The emphasis on…important gamesmanship.<br />
<br />
Learning how to defend a concise and written researched demand is essential to movement building<br />
<br />
Themba-Nixon 2k (Colorlines 3.2)<br />
<br />
Much of the work…making it so.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This turns their case at the most basic level—people will ignore your 1ac because you don’t give the other side a fair chance to respond<br />
<br />
Underwood summarizing Hovland 2k (psychology of communication, www.cultsock.ndirect.co.uk/MUHome/cshtml/psy/hovland3.html)<br />
<br />
Whether or not you…more intelligent audience.<br />
<br />
<br />
The last thing our political agenda needs is more personal conviction or ignoring rules—the war in Iraq was enabled precisely because of a lack of planning—wolfowitz and faith and bush fought the war based on their personal faith in the process—real policy arguments were ignored and made irrelevant in a strikingly similar fashion to the aff<br />

<br />
In Packer’s account…to achieve the war.<br />
<br />
This is the pre-eminent political task of our time—failure to inform ourselves about the policy process guarantees an endless cycle of Iraqs—the impact is the neoconservative annihilation of the planet<br />

TEXT: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER TO THE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA TO FACILITATE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEGOTIATED GOLAN HEIGHTS PEACE PARK IF THE GOVENRMENT OF SYRIA COMMITS TO CONCLUDING A PEACE DEAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL AND AGRRES TO CEASE INTERFERENCE IN LEBANON INCLUDING MILITARY SUPPORT FOR HEZBOLLAH AND OPPOSITION TO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.<br />
<br />
Continued Syrian meddling in Lebanon will ensure the failure of election and the end of the Cedar Revolution- only ending Syrian interference can put the political process on track and prevent instability throughout the Midle East<br />
<br />
Michael Young, “Showdown in Lebanon”, WSJ, 9/21/07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://michaelyoungscolumns.blowspot.com/2007/09/showdown-in-lebanon.html" rel="nofollow">http://michaelyoungscolumns.blowspot.com/2007/09/showdown-in-lebanon.html</a><br />
<br />
“On Wednesday Antoine Ghanem” and “a favorite into office.”<br />
<br />
Syria is preventing a resolution of the Lebanese election- increased pressure is key.<br />
<br />
Reuters 3/17, Ya Libnan, “Solana: Syria using proxies to prevent Lebanon elections, 17 March 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2008/03/solana_syria_us.php" rel="nofollow">http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2008/03/solana_syria_us.php</a><br />
<br />
“The European Union’s foreign” and “Forum on transatlantic relations.”<br />
<br />
Syrian intervention is paralyzing the Lebanese political process preventing necessary compromises- the onlger the lection is postponed the more likely the crisis will be resolved by bullets and bombs<br />
<br />
Mark Heller, INSS Insight, “Lebanon’s Dual Crisis”, 119/07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0711/S00169.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0711/S00169.htm</a><br />
<br />
“The current political crisis” and “the targets of a Syrian plot.”<br />
<br />
This conflict will quickly escalate to an all-out Middle East war<br />
<br />
Marvin Cetron and Owen Davies, 9/1/07, The Futurist 41 no. 5<br />
<br />
“There is more to come” and “everyone else for decades.”<br />
<br />
Syria says yes<br />
<br />
Syria will agree to abandon Hezbollah if it’s tied to a return of the Golan<br />
<br />
Alon Ben-Meir, “A way must be made to make Syria part of the solution instead of part of the problem”, 7 August 2006<br />
<br />
“Notwithstanding Syria’s military” and “through the guise of Hezbollah.”<br />
<br />
Bashar is pragmatic – he will do whatever is in Syria’s national interest<br />
<br />
Steven Simon and Johnathan Stevenson, Foreign Affairs, May-June 2004, The Road to Damascus<br />
<br />
“Critics argue that Assad’s” and “is in his best ineterest.”<br />
<br />
The return of the Golan is the primary goal of Syria- they’d be willing to make concessions to get it<br />
<br />
Cristiani 07, 7/27/07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=668&amp;language_id=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=668&amp;language_id=1</a><br />
<br />
“In bargaining with Israel” and “in addition to strategic ones.”<br />
<br />
2NC condition key<br />
<br />
Syria wont voluntarily withdraw from Lebanon, conditional offer is key<br />
<br />
Ron Synovitz, Radio Free Europe, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/syria/2005/syria-050302-rfer101.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/syria/2005/syria-050302-rfer101.htm</a><br />
<br />
“Still, some experts say they” and “a threat of punishment.”<br />
<br />
Syrian respect for Lebanese sovereignty must be a precondition to further negotiation, it will provide a key test of Syrian intentions for peace<br />
<br />
Emile El-Hokayem, “How to Engage Syria, If You Really Have to”, 07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stimson.org/pub.cfm?id=440" rel="nofollow">http://www.stimson.org/pub.cfm?id=440</a><br />
<br />
“Syria, we are told lately” and “did so in the 1990s.”<br />
<br />
AT: Escalation empirically denied<br />
<br />
Checks on escalation from previous Lebanese conflicts wouldn’t apply to a civil war ignited by the election – it would rapidly metastasize to a regional conflict<br />
<br />
Salim Nazzal, “Will Lebanon be Al-Qaeda’s third base after Afghanistan and Iraq?”, Arabic Media Internet Network, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amin.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.amin.org</a><br />
<br />
“Whoever you speak with” and “a major test right now.”<br />
<br />
2NC Turns Case<br />
<br />
Lebanon civil war accesses every impact – it’ll spill over to Iran, Israel and Syria<br />
<br />
David Aikman, 7/20/7, Implications: A Journal from the Trinity Forum, “Another Middle East War?”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ttf.org/index/journal/print/another-middle-east-war" rel="nofollow">http://www.ttf.org/index/journal/print/another-middle-east-war</a><br />
<br />
“But in the Middle East region” and “response against Syria proper.”<br />
<br />
The net benefit turns the case – an Israel/Syria peace deal will fail unless Syria ends interference in Lebanon<br />
<br />
Arlen Specter, 1/14/08, “Israel-Syria treaty the key to Mideast peace”, the Philadelphia Inquirer<br />
<br />
“Only Israel can decide for itself” and “clear. It’s either – or.”<br />
<br />
AND a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon gives Iran a launching pad for attacks and spreading its influence<br />
<br />
James Martin ’08, 1/16, “Lebanon hangs in the balance”, Baltimore Sun, “<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-op.lebanon16jan16,0,6001991.story" rel="nofollow">http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-op.lebanon16jan16,0,6001991.story</a><br />
<br />
“On the other hand, Iran and Syria” and “attack on Israel.”<br />
<br />
And a successful election in Lebanon is key to create momentum for peace throughout the region<br />
<br />
French Embassy ’07 (Daily Press Briefing, statements made by Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman, 11/9/07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ambafrance-us.org/news/briefing/us061107.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ambafrance-us.org/news/briefing/us061107.asp</a><br />
<br />
“I’ll first answer your” and “what happens in Lebanon.”<br />
<br />
Turns case – Arab Collective Action<br />
<br />
Peaceful resolution of the Lebanese crisis is key to collection Arab action for peace<br />
<br />
Bruce Maddy-Weitzman, “Slouching Towards Anapolis”, 10/30/07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aijac.org.au/updates/Nov-07/021107.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aijac.org.au/updates/Nov-07/021107.html</a><br />

 In 1979 middle east studies reached a corss-road: the choice of how to direct the field and make middle east studies relevant – gradually, they chose a path driven by said, spanos, imperialism and orientalism, which evolved into a condemnation of everything the west stood for in the middle east<br />
This model of scholarship and advocacy precipitated the downfall of a once prominent and impactful segment of the academic community and paved the way for the colonization of the American imagination by think thanks<br />
Kramer, editor of ME quarterly, 2001, ivory towers on sand pg 105<br />
“because senior faculty avoided “outreach” duties… than the entire membersip of MESA”<br />

“on the other hand, the practitioners of the Orientalist… increasingly ossified, if not something worse”<br />
<br />
They oerdetermine essentialism in strategic studies – acknowledging differences and outlets for violence is not a cultural indictment<br />
Gary Kamiya 2006, how Edward Said took intellectuals for a ride www.salon.com/books/feature/2006/12/06/orientalism<br />
