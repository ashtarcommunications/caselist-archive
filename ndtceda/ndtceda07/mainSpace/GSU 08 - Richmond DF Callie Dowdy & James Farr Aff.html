<br />
Contention One: The Topic<br />
<br />
1. The United States' status quo policy of<br />
licensing the operation of concentrated animal<br />
feeding operations exists under a strict<br />
environmental regulatory regime. This regulatory<br />
regime inscribes calculable ways to manage the<br />
earth and its inhabitants via standards and<br />
previsions outlined by the Clean Water Act. All<br />
of this occurs despite the EPA's blatant<br />
admission that almost half of our water supply<br />
is poisonous.<br />
EPA, 2008. [Environmental Protection Agency,<br />
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System<br />
Permit Regulation and Effluent Limitation<br />
Guidelines and Standards for Concentrated Animal<br />
Feeding Operations (CAFOs); Final Rule,&quot; Federal<br />
Register, Vol. 68, No. 29, February 12, p.<br />
7176.]<br />
<br />
&quot;Today’s final rule revises and clarifies …<br />
range of tools to assist small and medium-size<br />
AFOs.&quot;<br />
<br />
2. The EPA's ceaseless revision of failed policy<br />
is an element of management like none else -<br />
guilt as management technology. They assume a<br />
technological enframing of the environment that<br />
can only ensure the continued domination of the<br />
technological will over the earth. This will has<br />
obscured the problem and solution alike – they<br />
are merely coordinates in an endless circulation<br />
of standing reserve in which everything can be<br />
planned or replaced.<br />
Ladelle McWhorter, 1992, forthcoming. [my<br />
philosophy professor at the University of<br />
Richmond, &quot;Guilt as Management Technology: A<br />
Call to Heideggerian Reflection,&quot; in Heidegger<br />
and the Earth, 2nd edition, University of<br />
Toronto Press, actually 2009, pp. 16-31.]<br />
<br />
&quot;Guilt is a standard defense …people have become<br />
resources, human resources, personnel to be<br />
managed, or populations to be controlled.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
3. The focal point of this managerial control<br />
oscillates between a man/animal distinction on<br />
which the very foundation of what it means to be<br />
human is constructed. Our refusal to think<br />
animality in its &quot;essence&quot; - a calculative<br />
mastery of animality - has produced our modern<br />
condition of nihilism.<br />
Jeremy Bendik-Keymer, 2004. [Professor of<br />
Philosophy at Colorado College, &quot;Openness and<br />
Meaning,&quot; in Humanities and Social Sciences,<br />
February 2004, p. 1-3.]<br />
<br />
&quot;Western metaphysics has predicated what it is<br />
to be human…might be an example of the kind of<br />
non-technological use-relation he has in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Resolved<br />
<br />
Resolved: The United States Federal Government<br />
should revoke all permits for Concentrated<br />
Animal Feeding Operations.<br />
<br />
4. This is not a typical plan of action, our<br />
will to be implemented or enacted—rather our<br />
resolve represents an ontological openness to<br />
thinking animality in its essence. Resolution is<br />
not to be found in decision or action, rather it<br />
lies in opening oneself, in thought, toward the<br />
expanse of being.<br />
Jeremy Bendik-Keymer, 2004. [Professor of<br />
Philosophy at Colorado College, &quot;Openness and<br />
Meaning,&quot; in Humanities and Social Sciences,<br />
February 2004, p. 4.]<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, how could we, of any imagination,<br />
accept factory farming…what we lose when we let<br />
ourselves live callous lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Our affirmative does not simply &quot;do nothing.&quot;<br />
This thinking the resolution, rather than<br />
willing the resolution, is an invitation of<br />
paradox - a simultaneous acting-but-not-acting.<br />
Only within this paradox can we inaugurate a<br />
manner of thought that evades technology and the<br />
destruction that it entails. Thinking takes on a<br />
new direction in the absence of a guiding<br />
will—its trajectory is outward into the openness<br />
of Being. Only such a fundamental openness can<br />
orient us appropriately toward Being and<br />
animality.<br />
Ladelle McWhorter, 1992, forthcoming. [my<br />
philosophy professor at the University of<br />
Richmond, &quot;Guilt as Management Technology: A<br />
Call to Heideggerian Reflection,&quot; in Heidegger<br />
and the Earth, 2nd edition, University of<br />
Toronto Press, actually 2009, pp. 16-31.]<br />
<br />
&quot;Heidegger's work is a call to<br />
reflect…directions of which we may never be able<br />
to dream.&quot;<br />
