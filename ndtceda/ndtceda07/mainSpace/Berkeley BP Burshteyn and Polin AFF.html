<u><strong>Cotton aff- from Gonzaga caselist:</strong></u><br />
<br />
Contention One – Subsidies Kill<br />
US cotton subsidies prioritize the protection of U.S. agribusiness over the rest of the world's farmers increasing global economic inequalities <br />
Mittal 2, &quot;Giving Away the Farm: The 2002 Farm Bill,&quot; Summer, Food-First Backgrounder, Vol. 8, No, 3, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foodfirst.org/pubs/backgrdrs/2002/s02v8n3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodfirst.org/pubs/backgrdrs/2002/s02v8n3.html</a><br />
Not only does the 2002 farm bill, countries by about $250 million. <br />
<br />
Best studies conclude US subsidy removal would benefit millions<br />

&quot;Reform of US Cotton Subsidies Could Feed, Education Millions in Poor West African Countries,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.infozine.com/news/stories/op/storiesView/sid/23736" rel="nofollow">http://www.infozine.com/news/stories/op/storiesView/sid/23736</a><br />
Substantial reform of American cotton…through farming and fair trade.<br />
<br />
US cotton subsidy cuts are the most effective short term solution<br />

<br />
Millions die per year<br />
Gilligan 96<br />
<br />
These deaths are a direct result of the political status quo's belief that everyday Americans don't care. Understanding where our tax money goes and speaking out against unjust agricultural policies can sow the seeds for change<br />
Bread for the World Institute 3, &quot;chapter 7: what you can do,&quot; bread.org/learn/hunger-reports/hunger-reports-pdfs/hunger-report-2003/chapter-7.pdf<br />
Every day lives are lost to hunger…the only thing that ever has. <br />
<br />
Contention Two – The WTO <br />
The US sabotaged global trade talks in Geneva to avoid the subject of reducing cotton subsidies. Bush continues to prioritize agribusiness profit margins over the interests of global farmers and refuses to consider any deal that would require U.S. citizens to make actual sacrifices <br />
The Week Daily, 8-15, &quot;How they see us: Is the U.S. to blame for failed trade talks?&quot;<br />
The finger-pointing has begun…accept any deal that requires sacrifices to be made by its own citizens.<br />
<br />
In 2004 the WTO ruled that U.S. cotton subsidies were in violation of global trade rules. At first this seemed to be a huge victory for governments and international activists looking to level the playing field and looked to be the beginning of a broader debate about global trade rules – however bush ignored the ruling<br />
Smith and Rice 4, &quot;WTO hands a Critical Victory to African Farmers,&quot; Brookings<br />
Africa has secured few victories in the race…will have to keep listening to Africa's small farmers.<br />
<br />
Had this ruling been respected it would have created a precedent that would require the complete dismantling of US and European farm subsidies with a slew of benefits for global farmers<br />
MacKenzie 4, &quot;Talking 'bout a revolution: The decision that US cotton subsidies are illegal under world trade rules will have profound implications,&quot; May 8, New Scientist<br />
A Ruling by a World trade Organization panel last week…huge shift in agricultural production from richer to poorer countries. <br />
<br />
The reason for Bush's refusal to listen to the WTO in this matter is the same imperial impules behind the invasion of Iraq. Bush is seeking in favor of a new doctrine of unilateralism that seeks to expand the U.S.'s control over the rest of the world in every way possible. Mobilizing civil society and governments in a struggle towards strengthening international institutions which can constrain the U.S. and placing economic justice at the forefront is necessary to counter Bush's drive towards global empire. <br />
Phyllis Bennis, 2003, &quot;Going Global: Building A Movement Against Empire,&quot; Foreign Policy In Focus <br />
As the Bush administration strengthens its military victory…challenging empire while building a new internationalism. <br />
<br />
Restraining U.S. unilateralism is key to solve a host of global problems that risk planetary extinction <br />
Schell 4, &quot;The Empire Backfires,&quot; Znet<br />
Richard Perle, who until recently…ideology is the enemy of fact, and empire is the nemesis of progress. <br />
<br />
Criticizing U.S. uniltaeralism in refusing to cut cotton subsidies and listen to the WTO allows us to begin to transform international institutions into arrangements will become pivotal in the struggle against a unilateral foreign policy that guarantees global war and in favor of global economic and social justice. Rejecting the WTO only strengthens Bush's hand – instead we must discuss the policies that would make the global trading system more equitable and WTO decision-making more democratic.<br />
Mark Ritchie, 2003, &quot;Global Civil Society or Global Civil War: What Direction for the Post Neoliberal-Neoconservative World?,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldforum.org/Commission-On-Globalisation/homelinks/MR_globalsociety.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldforum.org/Commission-On-Globalisation/homelinks/MR_globalsociety.htm</a><br />
Fourth, the general assault on the international system…must be won, then re-won, and then re-won again.<br />
<br />
Requiring the U.S. to abide by WTO decisions it has been ignoring is an important step towards internationalization and strengthening global institution<br />
Peter Gowan, 1, &quot;The State, Globalization, and the New Imperialism: A Roundtable Discussion,&quot; <br />
Let us leave to one side for the moment…namely, members of the UN Security Council. <br />
<br />
The United States federal government should eliminate agricultural support for cotton that is in violation of the World Trade Organization ruling against United States support for cotton.<br />
<br />
We must work to transform the WTO from a tool used by rich nations to safeguard their markets while opening up everyone else's to our corporations to one which can be used to struggle for economic justice<br />
