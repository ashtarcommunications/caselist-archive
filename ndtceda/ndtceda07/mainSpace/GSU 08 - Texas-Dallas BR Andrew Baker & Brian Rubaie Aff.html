<strong>Plan</strong><br />
<br />
The United State Federal Government should decrease its support for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations by ending the concentrated animal feeding operations eligibility for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program.<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE IS DISEASE –<br />
<br />
CAFOs cause massive disease spread through groundwater, byproducts, and multidrug resistant pathogens<br />

<br />
Waterborne diseases. Concerns persist about surface and groundwater contamination … instead of enhanced hygiene, air filtration, biosecurity and disease surveillance.<br />
<br />
SCENARIO ONE IS ANTIBIOTIC RESISTIANCE –<br />
<br />
First, CAFOs rapidly overprescribe antibiotics – this undermines human effectiveness and goes airborn<br />

<br />
Antibiotics are used in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) … conveyed to the laboratory for bacterial isolation and speciation.<br />
<br />
Livestock are key – they’re the primary user of antibiotics<br />
Union of Concerned Scientists, ‘1<br />

<br />
Livestock use accounts for the lion's share of the total quantity … which uses producer surveys to gather information on pesticide use each year.<br />
<br />
<br />
CAFO practices undermine disease resistance through crowding, stress and poor facility maintenance<br />

<br />
Animal crowding, CAFO hygiene, temperature and ventilation control … is made to limit inappropriate use, both with humans and animals.<br />
<br />
Antibiotic resistance makes humans vulnerable to pathogens by creating drug-resistant mutations – the result is mass death<br />

<br />
Antibiotic resistance. State of science. Antibiotic resistance is increasing among most human pathogens … diseases that were formerly treatable will be capable of causing severe illness or death (NAS 2003).<br />
<br />
Resistance culminates in human extinction<br />
Steinbruner, ‘98 – Senior Fellow at Brookings Institution<br />
[John D., “Biological weapons: A plague upon all houses,” Foreign Policy, Dec 22, LN]<br />
<br />
It is a considerable comfort and undoubtedly a key to our survival that … a fundamental security problem for the species as a whole.<br />
<br />
SCENARIO TWO is AVIAN FLU –<br />
<br />
First, CAFOs are the main route for spreading H5N1<br />
CQ, ‘7<br />
[Weeks, J. (2007, January 12). Factory farms. CQ Researcher, 17, 25-48. Retrieved July 28, 2008, from CQ Researcher Online, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre2007011200" rel="nofollow">http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre2007011200</a>]<br />
<br />
Then in 2003 and '04, a deadly strain of avian flu (H5N1) spread … could spread readily through a centralized national food industry.<br />
<br />
The global livestock trade magnifies the risk of exposure, ensuring whirlwind spread<br />
Brown, ‘6<br />
[Jonathan. “BIRD FLU: Factory farms in Asia blamed for pandemic.” The Independent (London). April 8. p. Lexis]<br />
<br />
Crucial to the case that bird flu is linked to factory farming … migratory birds are an easy target since nobody is to blame.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
US CAFO policies are modeled – they’re the root of drug resistance to H5N1<br />

<br />
In the 1960s, though, a breakthrough was made. A new class of drugs … sick people by squandering them today for animals that are not sick at all.”520<br />
<br />
H5N1 is the greatest catastrophe in history, collapses the economy, spreads quickly, and is almost certain to occur<br />

<br />
A pandemic today could be many times worse than the pandemic of 1918 … We are half a step away from a worldwide pandemic catastrophe.”579<br />
<br />
Ending concentrated feeding is the first step in halting the risk – it is the primary disease vector and a prerequisite to any other action<br />
Seedling, ‘6<br />
[Journal of the think-tank Grain.org. “Fowl play: The poultry industry's central.” Feb. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.grain.org/briefings/?id=194" rel="nofollow">http://www.grain.org/briefings/?id=194</a>]<br />
<br />
Even before the advent of the current bird flu crisis, factory poultry farming … start building food systems that put people before profits.<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO is SUSTAINABILITY –<br />
<br />
First, the colonization of rural America has begun – CAFOs are the vital node in the destruction of rural culture and ecosystems.<br />
Ikerd, ‘3<br />
[John, Professor Emeritus of Agricultural Economics University of Missouri Columbia College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources, “Corporate Hog Production: The Colonization of Rural America” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/HogColonalism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/HogColonalism.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
Today, rural America is being “colonized.” … and this time, to build them sustainably – economically, ecologically, and culturally.<br />
<br />
SCENARIO ONE is DIVERSITY –<br />
<br />
First, CAFOS are the core factor in diversity collapse.<br />
Mulvany &amp; Gura, ‘7<br />
[Patrick &amp; Susanne, advised the league for Pastoral Peoples and Endogenous Livestock Development, “Reclaiming liovestock keepers’ rights” Seedling, January 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.grain.org/seedling/?id=459" rel="nofollow">http://www.grain.org/seedling/?id=459</a>]<br />
<br />
At an intergovernmental conference organised by FAO later this year, pastoralists and small-scale livestock keepers … livestock breeds will continue to be lost at an alarming rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
This loss of diversity will lead to extinction.<br />
Boyce, ‘4<br />

<br />
There is a future for small farms. Or, to be more precise, there can be … all of us share responsibility for the cultivation of agricultural biodiversity<br />
<br />
SCENARIO TWO is DESTRUCTION –<br />
<br />
The consolidation of livestock has devastating impacts on soil and water resources – directly as a result of animal waste and indirectly from feed production.<br />
PEW Commission, ‘7<br />
[Farm Animal Waste Management, “Environmental Impact of Industrial Farm Animal Production” Technical Reports, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ncifap.org/reports/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncifap.org/reports/</a>]<br />
<br />
Like many industries, Industrial Farm Animal Production (ifap) results in a number of environmental impacts … production model to continue to be viable.<br />
<br />
Second, feed crops place enormous stress on water resources – contaminating ground water and aquifers.<br />
Pew Commission, 8 [“Putting Meat on the Table: Industrial Farm Animal Production in America,” A Project of The Pew Charitable Trusts and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Industrial_Agriculture/PCIFAP_FINAL.pdf, pg. 27]<br />
<br />
Like other aspects of ifap (such as manure disposal), … drinking water supplies for a huge area of the United States.<br />
<br />
There is no alternative to the Ogallala aquifer – its collapse will spark a global food crisis.<br />
De Villiers, '01<br />
[Marq, veteran journalist, magazine editor and writer, who has worked as a foreign correspondent in Moscow, South Africa, and other places, Water: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource, Pg 161-162]<br />
<br />
The problem, though, is that the bankrupting of agriculture in the region … the geopolitical- consequences that constitute water's most potent crisis.<br />
<br />
SCENARIO THREE is FOSSIL FUELS –<br />
<br />
CAFOs use consume enormous amounts of fossil fuels<br />
Steinfeld &amp; Gerber et al, ‘7<br />
[Henning &amp; Pierre, Coordinator of the Livestock Environment and Development “Livestock’s Long Shadow: environmental issues and options” Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, Rome, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
The share of energy consumption accounted for by the different stages of livestock production … fossil fuel for machinery generally exceeds that for fertilizer production.<br />
<br />
<br />
This reliance of fossil fuels makes the collapse of agriculture inevitable and will lead to extinction.<br />

<br />
The coming end of the petroleum age involves much more than the question … The coming collapse of the petroleum economy endangers us all – even the heads of the oligarchs are on the block.<br />
<br />
Alone these effects are devastating, but combined they constitute another degree of magnitude that must be considered on par with nuclear war &amp; global warming.<br />
Freusdenberger, ‘3<br />
(PhD Agronomy, expert on global agriculture, Professor Emeritus @ Luther Seminary, Consultant at Oberlin College for the Environmental Ethics Program, Journal of Lutheran Ethics, March 20)<br />
The predominant land ethic operative in our nation at this time … task before us is awesome, promising, and transforming.<br />
<br />
Alternatives to confinement reduce water pollution and soil damage.<br />

<br />
Cattle are capable of receiving all or most of their dietary requirements from pasture … productivity was about 3 percent below that of conventional animal operations.<br />
<br />
Solvency –<br />
<br />
Subsidies to CAFOs are responsible for the industrial consolidation of animal farming – elimination subsides is key.<br />
Maron &amp; MacDonald, ‘7<br />
[Amy &amp; Mia, independent consultant, Brighter Green” The 2007 Farm Bill” Farm Sanctuary, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.farmsanctuary.org</a> /mediacenter/assets/farm_bill_whiteFINAL.pdf]<br />
<br />
FACTORY FARMING Factory farms are growing … It should require transparency and make polluters accountable for the harm they cause.<br />
<br />
CAFOs are at a unique economic climate – high grain prices have virtually eliminated indirect subsidies exposing the artificial supports that prop up animal confinement operations.<br />
Starmer &amp; Wise, ‘7<br />
[Elanor &amp; Timothy, Research Fellow and Deputy Director of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts UniversityConfined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), sometimes called factory farms or industrial animal operations, are defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as livestock operations that do not sustain their own crops or other animal feed and that, “Living High on the Hog: factory farms, Federal Policy and the Structural Transformation of Swine Production, Global Development and Environmental Institute, Working Paper No. 07-04 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/07-04LivingHighOnHog.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/07-04LivingHighOnHog.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
We conclude that in an economic climate of full-cost feed … favored large-scale industrial animal production.<br />
<br />
<br />
High grain prices support a shift to diversified animal operations but ending EQIP subsidies and loopholes is the only way to reverse the economic slide of small farmers.<br />
Wise, ‘5<br />

<br />
The corporations that dominate the industrial livestock sector … might begin to reverse their downward economic slide (NFFC 2005).<br />
<br />
EQIP subsidies uniquely impact small farms – the new language is designed to support industrial operations.<br />
Gurian-Sherman, ‘8<br />
[Doug, sr. scientist and the Center for Food Safety, founding co-director and science director for the biotechnology project at he Center for Science in Public Interest “CAFOs Uncovered: The untold costs of confined animal feeding operations” Union of Concerned Scientist, April 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/sustainable_food/cafos-uncovered.html" rel="nofollow">http://ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/sustainable_food/cafos-uncovered.html</a>]<br />
<br />
EQIP originated as part of the 1985 farm bill and was renewed … Most EQIP applications therefore remain unfunded.<br />
<br />
The NEG will say we should more strictly enforce new pollution controls – but absent the plan new regulations will favor large operation and increase consolidation.<br />
Dicks, ‘7<br />
[Michael R., Professor Agricultural Economics, Oklahoma State University, 9-6-2007, Senate Environment and Public Works, Congressional Quarterly, 9-6-2007, l/n]<br />
<br />
The animal feeding industry is actively seeking new technologies … then acquired by larger firms, increasing industry concentration.
