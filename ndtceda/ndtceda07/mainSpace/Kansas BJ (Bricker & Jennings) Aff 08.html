PLAN: The United States federal government should offer a guarantee to the government of Iran that the United States will not pursue regime change in iran in exchange for a temporary suspension of enrichment-related activities and an agreement to negotiate a long-term nuclear agreement.<br />
<br />
Contention one- the foundations of democracy<br />
<br />
Reformist groups in Iran are currently consolidating forces- this is key to a unified anti-Ahmadinejad force in the upcoming parlimentary elections.<br />

&quot;Another factor that might complicate... own final parlimentary list&quot;<br />
<br />
Even if the parliamentary power is limited by the government's structure, an election victory for the reformists would build momentum to take down ahmadenijad in 2009.<br />

&quot;But, as I have argued elsewhere... and electoral processes in place&quot;<br />
<br />
Contention two- electoral politics<br />
<br />
Removing the constant threat of war with iran is key to decreasing public nationalist support for conservatives- this is necessary to terminally limit ahmadinejad's power.<br />
Simon Jenkins 1/16 &quot;bush's trip, without principle or plan, had one big winner&quot; the guardian<br />
&quot;only one man can rescue... Has he forgotten 9/11?&quot;<br />

Continuing threat of regime change allows to conservatives to rally support in the 2008 election- the plan is key to strengthening the fragile reformist movement which spills over into limiting all conservative politics.<br />
Perthes 7 (12/27, the scotsman, &quot;honest engagement best way to show up a devious foe's faults&quot; ln)<br />
&quot;Iranians do not like to be.... that are at fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
Conservatives will take power in 2008- the plan allows reformists to retake power in 3 ways:<br />
first, us meddling causes a crackdown on conversational space. second, us regime policy allows conservatives to coalesce around a single cause of opposing the us. thirs, forcing a concession on the nuclear issue exposes the weakness of the conservatves and rallies the reformist issue.<br />
Farhi 1/13 (Farideh, &quot;if americans are wise they would not meddle in iran's affairs&quot;)<br />
&quot;Calling for the use of American... and not in their deeds&quot;<br />

Iran's current economic stagnation has made reformist victory possible- however, us war-talk and anti-iran posture allows conservatives to shore up support and threatens iranian democracy.<br />
Buzbee 7 (Sept. &quot;Iran reformist warns democracy at stake&quot;)<br />
&quot;One of Iran's top reform politicians,,, politica agenda.&quot; he said&quot;<br />

<br />
SURVIVING SCIENTISTS WOULD REBUILD PROGRAM<br />
<u>Barnaby 07 <strong>(frank, Nuclear issues consultant; “Would Air strikes work?” Oxford research group</strong></u><br />
As discussed above, a military attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities could kill a number of<br />
nuclear scientists and engineers, and may be designed partly to do just that, but it is very unlikely<br />
to destroy Iran’s nuclear knowledge base completely. In time, surviving scientists would be<br />
able to repair damage done to nuclear facilities, or rebuild them completely, and resume<br />
the nuclear programme.<br />
<br />
BRIEF SURGICAL STRIKES NOT POSSIBLE<br />
<u>Barnaby 07 <strong>(frank, Nuclear issues consultant; “Would Air strikes work?” Oxford research group</strong></u><br />
Each nuclear site contains many targets so that a large number, perhaps many hundreds,<br />
of aircraft sorties would be required if all the sites were to be targeted. There is an inherent<br />
contradiction in arguments that a military strike could both encompass all key nuclear facilities<br />
and be surgical and brief. Furthermore, many of these targets are in built-up, heavily populated areas,<br />
increasring significantly the risk of collateral damage and civilian casualties.<br />

<u>“Maddam speaker… president’s intentions regarding iran”</u><br />
Madam Speaker, you don't negotiate with the barrel of a gun, but that seems to be the President's strategy with respect to Iran. <u>That is why the House must legislate to ensure that the President cannot unilaterally start another war in the Middle East, this time with Iran.</u><br />
<u>The President has lost all credibility, and the world worries that another war will be waged in Iran in the name of regime change. It has been over a quarter of a century since the U.S. tried constructive engagement instead of destructive isolationism in dealing with Iran.</u><br />
Foreign policy under this President has played a role in pushing Iran's leaders to the fringe. The Iranian President appears intransigent and willing to use strident rhetoric to drive a wedge between the United States and other nations. What is our response? Showdown and confrontation are the diplomatic skills of this White House, a repeat of the spin cycle to foment a march to war against Iraq. Today it is economic sanctions against Iran, but what about tomorrow?<br />

The proposed measure does not purport to speak to all forms of deductions or subtractions from income; if it did, then it would have used a conjunction, &quot;and,&quot; rather than using the word &quot;including&quot; (the present participial form of the verb &quot;include&quot;), in the subordinate clause in the sentence in question. &quot;Include&quot; means &quot;to place, list, or rate as a part or component of a whole or of a larger group, class, or aggregate.&quot; Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary at 1143. When placed in the subordinate clause, &quot;including&quot; indicates that those things listed fit the description in the independent clause that precedes the subordinate clause -- in this case, &quot;proportional&quot; voter-approved tax cuts. It follows that the proposed measure refers only to those deductions or subtractions from income that fit the description in the independent clause, i.e., those that truly are &quot;proportional.&quot;<br />

Individually, these seven pillars seem insignificant, but together they can go a long way in shaping a strategy that can serve both the national interests of the United States as well as the will of the Iranian people. For Iran, democracy is no longer just a political ideal, but a sheer economic necessity. Only a democratic Iran can attract the requisite investments needed to solve Iran's endemic unemployment problems. For the United States, particularly during the second Bush administration, it has become the avowed centerpiece of U.S. policy in the Middle East. Ultimately, a successful U.S. strategy must assist the democratic movement and have the patience for the Tehran regime to collapse under its own inconsistencies. Internationally, part of the regime's raison d'etre and legitimacy in the eyes of its Hizballah flanks rests in its commitment to anti-Americanism. At the same time, in obvious contradiction to its self-ascribed anti-U.S. role, Tehran increasingly seeks a security guarantee or promise that the United States will not seek to overthrow the regime. It also wants and needs U.S. approval for the flow of capital desperately needed to solve Iran's economic woes.<br />

LITERATURE ON IRAN PROVES W’ERE TOPICAL<br />
WRIGHT 2/11/1993 (LA Times)<br />
U.S. analysts have identified three policy options to deal with Iran:</strong>__<br />
<br />
<ul><li>The first amounts to constructive engagement, or assisting Iran economically on the assumption that market reforms and prosperity will lead to political moderation. Rafsanjani's government clearly hopes the Clinton Administration adopts this policy, according to Western envoys and as openly noted in Kayhan this week.</li></ul><br />
&quot;Tehran-Washington ties is (sic) in need of defusing,&quot; Kayhan said. &quot;This period of expectation can be used very positively and constructively by the new U.S. Administration if it should have any interest in mending ties.&quot;<br />
<br />
The newspaper encouraged the Clinton Administration to get involved in Iran now rather than later because of the billions of dollars that Iran plans to spend abroad to reconstruct or modernize its industries. Otherwise, Kayhan said, &quot;Washington will never be part of this bonanza. In a competitive trade world, this is a considerable loss.&quot;<br />
<br />
In truth, however, Iran's troubled economy needs the United States in the short term far more than Washington could profit from Iran, which is now suffering a serious liquidity problem. But in the long term, the two nations together could produce significant new markets for each other, according to Western envoys here.<br />
<br />
Constructive engagement with Tehran has long been practiced by Japan and key European nations such as Germany -- at considerable profit until Iran became a credit risk over the past few months.<br />
<br />
Although U.S. sanctions on Iranian imports are still in effect, U.S. exports to Iran increased from $167 million in 1990 to about $780 million last year, according to a coming report by the Congressional Research Service. The United States is now Iran's fifth-largest trading partner. And last month, an Iranian oil delegation held talks with U.S. oil companies on possible future cooperation.<br />
<br />
But during the last two Republican administrations, the U.S. experience with constructive engagement as a means of inducing policy changes in hard-line states -- such as Iraq and South Africa -- was distinctly unsuccessful.<br />
<br />
The 1985-86 arms-for-hostages swap, which eventually resulted in the Iran-Contra scandal, was also predicated largely on engaging Iran in a constructive dialogue. But that was a debacle from which both countries have yet to recover and in which their perceptions of each other were seriously damaged, according to officials in both Washington and Tehran.<br />
<br />
<ul><li>The second option is the carrot-and-stick approach, or a more subtle policy of rewards for positive actions -- such as improvement in Iran's human rights record -- combined with penalties for actions such as support for anti-Western groups in the Middle East and beyond.</li></ul><br />
Several U.S. specialists on the Mideast favor this approach, arguing that recent leadership shifts in both countries -- the passing of Republican administrations tainted by the Iran-Contra affair and the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme Iranian leader who imposed the death sentence on Rushdie -- offer a new opportunity to gradually end one of the world's most hostile relationships.<br />
<br />
Indeed, Tehran feels that it has recently offered more than one concession to ward off the U.S. stick, most notably when Iran used its influence 14 months ago on Shiite Muslim brethren in Lebanon to end the most contentious issue between the two countries.<br />
<br />
&quot;Iran has already done its part by . . . using its influence to secure the release of American hostages in Lebanon,&quot; the Kayhan editorial noted. &quot;The new U.S. Administration can do its part . . . and show in concrete terms its sincerity in opening ties with Tehran.&quot;<br />
<br />
In light of Tehran's quiet cooperation with the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq during Operation Desert Storm, the Iranian leadership also feels that it showed a new willingness to deal with the outside world.<br />
<br />
Central to this option, however, is acceptance of the Iranian government. The Bush Administration publicly said it did not seek the overthrow of the Tehran regime, and Western intelligence agencies generally agree that no internal or external opposition group has sufficient support to challenge Rafsanjani's government.<br />
<br />
But late last year, Al Gore, now vice president, signed a letter circulated through Congress calling for U.S. support of the People's Moujahedeen, one of the revolutionary groups that helped oust Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979 and later split with the Islamic fundamentalist clergymen who replaced him. The group, whose platform mixes Islam and socialism, has been waging a covert war for years from bases in neighboring Iraq, Iran's old foe.<br />
<br />
Before his inauguration, President Clinton also briefly met with Moujahedeen representatives, according to the Congressional Research Service report. &quot;This suggests that recognition or support for the (Moujahedeen) might be under consideration,&quot; wrote Kenneth Katzman, author of the CRS report and also of a new book on Iran titled &quot;The Warriors of Islam.&quot;<br />
<br />
· The third option is containment, or doing whatever is necessary, including military action, to prevent the spread of Iran's Islamic ideology, with the hope that its system will eventually collapse. This option is favored by Patrick Clawson, author of a new policy paper on Iran for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the influential pro-Israeli think tank whose director, Martin Indyk, recently left to become director of Mideast affairs on the new National Security Council staff.<br />

ISRAEL NOT ANGERED B PLAN<br />
MAKOVSKY 2006 <strong>DIRECTOR OF MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROJECT (Iran possible sore point in US-Israel Relations. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/12001/makovsky.html%29__" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/12001/makovsky.html)__</a><br />
Let’s switch to Iran, which has made no secret of its hatred for Israel and the Israelis of course seem to be the country most alarmed about a potential Iranian nuclear bomb. The politics in the United States on this issue seem to be more uncertain with the new defense secretary, Robert M. Gates coming aboard. He’s on the record as advocating direct dialogue with Iran. Is this a potential sore point in U.S.-Israeli relations?<br />
<br />
Yes, it’s a sore point, but is one of those things that will never be the subject of a public acrimonious exchange. I think there clearly has been a nervousness in Jerusalem about a new secretary of defense who has talked about a conciliatory approach towards Iran. Prime Minister Olmert is very careful to publicly and repeatedly say that Israel does not seek a military solution and that if there was a diplomatic solution that would deny Iran nuclear weapons, he would be the first one to be overjoyed by that. But also look at what Olmert is saying: he calls Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad “the new Adolf Hitler” because of his comments calling for Israel being “wiped off the map.” Israel doesn’t see Iran as a status quo power but as a destabilizing ideological force which means what it says and even if it didn’t use nuclear weapons itself, it could certainly give them to terror groups that it supports such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad.<br />
<br />
So many Israelis see a very genocidal approach that is being advocated by the president of Iran. But at the same time they don’t want to be seen as beating the drums for a war or advocating American military action, and I believe Olmert when he says that he’d be the happiest person around if they could solve this thing diplomatically. But his fear is that it won’t be solved diplomatically because Russia and China and the UN Security Council have their own commercial interests and therefore sanctions are not going to be serious. They read that the Bushehr nuclear reactor [being built by Russia for Iran] is going to be exempted somehow to these sanctions. And they read the Iranian press and they feel the Iranians are laughing at the UN Security Council, saying that there’s really no political will there.<br />
<br />
So that obviously gets the Israelis nervous, but it’s a nervousness that will probably not find that much public expression because Olmert, like his patron Ariel Sharon, is very careful not to get on the wrong side of the White House. The midterm elections don’t really change anything because Israel feels it has a lot of friends on both sides of the aisle.<br />

In the worst case, an American administration may seek to pressure the Israelis and might even reduce the level of cooperation (for example, by suspending arms deliveries or reducing strategic cooperation), but the ties today are so broad and deep that the alliance is unlikely to crack. Unlike Dwight Eisenhower in 1956-57, no president today can credibly threaten a cutoff of aid, for Congress would not support such action. Economic, academic, and personal relations between citizens of the two countries are largely immune to political vagaries. Further development of this remarkable relationship might be retarded, but not reversed.<br />

Washington had promised Israel a substantial increase in its financial support to bolster it against Muslim nations. US officials, however, have decided to reconsider their pledge because of high costs of the continued occupation of Iraq. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert convened an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday to discuss the new US decision, which would cause a budget deficit in Israel. Officials discussed ways of dealing with the £250 million deficit in the next year's budget, which Israeli analysts believe would result in austerity measures. There are also fears that the shortfall would have a significant impact on the ability of the regime to maintain its military capabilities. The tension over the delayed American funds has tarnished relations between the two allies, which were boosted only last week when Israel confirmed it would enjoy a 25 percent surge in US aid over the next 10 years<br />

According to Arad, Gates' predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, never visited Israel partly because he focused on Iraq, but there were also tensions in Israel's relations with the Pentagon. U.S. officials have been suspicious of Israel's ties with Communist China. The United States forced Israel to cancel a multimillion-dollar agreement to provide China with the Falcon airborne system. The United States said that system could endanger American pilots' lives while in that area. Later the Pentagon fumed over Israeli moves to upgrade drones sold to China. Eventually the Pentagon reportedly refused to deal with senior Defense Ministry officials.<br />

The U.S.-Israeli alliance, unique in world affairs, dates from Israel’s 1967 military conquests, reinforced in 1970 when Israel barred possible Syrian intervention in Jordan to protect Palestinians who were being slaughtered during Black September. Such intervention by Syria was regarded in Washington as a threat to its ally Jordan and, more important, to the oil-producers that were Washington’s clients. U.S. aid to Israel roughly quadrupled. The pattern is fairly consistent since, extending to secondary Israeli services to U.S. power outside the Middle East, particularly in Latin America and southern Africa. The system of domination has worked quite well for the people who matter. Energy corporation profits are breaking all records. High-tech (including military) industry has lucrative ties with Israel, as do the major financial institutions, and Israel serves virtually as an offshore military base and provider of equipment and training. One may argue that other policies would have been more beneficial to the concentrations of domestic power that largely determine policy, but they seem to find these arrangements quite tolerable. If they did not, they could easily move to terminate them. And in fact,</strong></u> when there are conflicts between U.S. and Israeli state power, Israel naturally backs down; exports of military technology to China are a recent example, when the Bush administration went out of its way to humiliate Israel after it was initially reluctant to follow the orders of what Israeli commentator Aluf Benn calls “the boss-man called ‘partner.’”<br />

Israel is also very concerned about the United States being seen as fighting a war for Israel, given how quickly American domestic opinion changes. That concern may underlie the release of its earlier warnings about Iraq. While Israel wants Iran weakened, it does not want to be blamed by American voters for another failed military adventure. Bush and Cheney, meanwhile, have an interest in using the protection of Israel as a way to de-fang potential Democratic opposition.</u></strong><br />

Critics of engagement argue that diplomatic relations with Iran will reward this ''axis of evil'' member for years of supporting terrorism and pursuing nuclear weapons. In fact, an American presence in Iran is the mullahs' worst nightmare. Iran's government has long used its ongoing tensions with the United States, as well as the embargo, as an excuse for the economic difficulties that are, in fact, the direct results of the regime's incompetence and corruption. Tehran's leaders have conveniently labeled nearly all of their opponents as ''agents of America.'' Most important, part of the regime's self-declared legitimacy lies in its claim to be the only Muslim country fighting what it sees as U.S. imperialism. If the United States could prove it's not an enemy of the Iranian people, the legitimacy of Iran's leaders would diminish.<br />

Unfortunately, in 2003, the US ignored the interconnectedness of the two countries' fates, and so it adopted divergent policies toward them. While Iraq was confronted, Iran was ignored. Over time, the US policy of neglecting Iran was eventually replaced by a policy of appeasement. This divergence in US policy toward the two countries enabled Iran to renew its traditional bid for control over Iraq just as it was making moves toward regional domination through its nuclear weapons program, its cooptation of the Syrian regime, the expansion of its military and political influence over Lebanon through Hizbullah, and its sponsorship of the Palestinian war against Israel.<br />

he president would like to make the argument that Iraq is about the same struggle. It’s not, for several important reasons. In contrast to the Soviet and Chinese communists, or for that matter the fascists of the 1930s and '40s, Al Qaeda and its ilk have no universalist program, no persuasive alternative ideology to globalization and some brand of democracy. They are nihilists, and they have failed to capture half the world’s attention as communism and socialism once did. So, yes, while a U.S. pullout would no doubt inspire a great deal of Al Qaeda propaganda about how they succeeded in forcing the Americans to withdraw from Iraq as they forced the Soviets to do in Afghanistan, the majority of the world’s elites won’t buy it. And the truth is, the slow bleed of America’s might and prestige on the streets of Iraq makes for a far more compelling picture of U.S. weakness than any Al Qaeda propaganda could ever do. If we leave, Al Qaeda will rant triumphantly on the Web sites and perhaps win more adherents, but that won’t get them any closer to “victory” over us than they are now.<br />

No. After 9/11, Washington cordially invited Iran into an anti-terrorism coalition; later, Bush denounced Iran as part of an &quot;axis of evil&quot;; now, he embraces diplomatic talks. To the extent that his administration does momentarily recognize Iran's evil, its response has been ludicrous: to thwart Iran's nuclear program, U.S. diplomats scrounged for votes at the U.N. to pass toothless sanctions, and tried to put financial &quot;pressure&quot; on Iran (e.g., by preventing it from trading oil in dollars), an absurdly futile scheme (Iran now trades in euros).<br />
<br />
Moreover, when Bush has gone to war, it was not to crush an evil enemy, but to bring it &quot;democracy.&quot; Bush's messianic crusade in the Middle East is a selfless war of sacrifice to needy Afghanis and Iraqis--not a war to uphold the moral goal of safeguarding the lives of Americans.<br />

Bush's self-effacing, immoral foreign policy--like the appeasing gambit of engagement--licenses Iran to pursue its hostile goals with impunity.<br />

MH: The MEK should not be removed. The signal to the people of Iran would be devastating because they despise the MEK for its treason in the Iraq-Iran war. The equivalent would be a John Walker Lindh-type individual disenfranchised with his home country (the U.S.) and taking arms against Americans. Imagine a scenario where he would desire a place of leadership in the United States' executive branch after fighting against Americans in Afghanistan. How many Americans would support, vote, or consider him a legitimate form of government? Not many if at all. The same holds true for most Iranians' view of MEK. In addition, the State Department criteria for removing groups from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list is unambiguous. The State Department's statutory criteria is based on the use of the &quot;administrative record&quot; for reviewing organizations. The administrative record is &quot;classified&quot; information. MEK has had two failed attempts in Federal court in the District of Columbia seeking removal from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list where the judges had &quot;in camera&quot; access to these files. Any U.S. support of MEK would dishearten many Iranians, continue to cultivate mistrust that the U.S. is far removed from the desires of the Iranian people, and would be a set-back to the U</strong>S<br />

In his op-ed “Empowering the democratic opposition in Iran” (July 24), Dick Armey was correct in stating that military intervention is not viable in Iran. However, his assertion that America and its partners should support democratic opposition and remove MEK from the terrorist list of organizations is highly misinformed. Support for the MEK and removing it from the list of terrorist organizations will only backfire on the U.S. The MEK’s strategy to invade Iran will never work, nor will any U.S. attempt to fund organizations set on undermining the existing Iranian regime.<br />
Iranian reformists believe that democracy can’t be imported. It must be indigenous. They believe that the best the U.S. can do for democracy in Iran is to leave them alone. Noninterference in Iran’s domestic affairs is a legal obligation of the United States. This was stipulated in the Algiers Accord that the United States signed with Iran in 1981 to end the hostage crisis. … Aware of their own deep unpopularity, the hardliners in Iran are terrified by the prospects of a “velvet revolution” and have become obsessed with preventing contacts between Iranian scholars, artists, journalists and political activists and their American counterparts. One need not look further than the current situation of Dr. Haleh Esfandiari and Dr. Kian Tajbakhsh, among others, who have been arrested and accused by the Iranian government of taking money from the U.S. government and acting as spies.
