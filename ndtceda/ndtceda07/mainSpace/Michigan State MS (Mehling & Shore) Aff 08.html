</em>PLAN:<em><br />
<br />
</em>The United States Federal Government should offer the government of Iran a comprehensive settlement of diplomatic issues. This offer should include –<em><br />

<strong>-</strong> </em>A security guarantee which commits to not use force to change the borders or form of government of Iran;<em><br />
<strong>-</strong> </em>A commitment to end unilateral sanctions against Iran;<em><br />
<strong>-</strong> </em>The reestablishment of diplomatic relations;<em><br />
<strong>-</strong> </em>A commitment to support Iran’s application for accession to the World Trade Organization;<em><br />

<strong>-</strong> </em>An agreement to the commencement of an ongoing strategic dialogue with Iran as a forum for assessing each side’s implementation of its commitments.<em><br />
<br />
</em>The United States Federal Government will make clear that its implementation of this offer is dependent on Iran’s acceptance of the following conditions:<em><br />
<br />
<strong>-</strong> </em>Iran should agree to limit its fuel cycle activities to a delayed limited enrichment program. This should include full transparency, agreement to intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and a commitment to ratify and implement the Additional Protocol to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty;<em><br />
<strong>-</strong> </em>Iran should issue a statement expressing support for a just and lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict;<em><br />
<strong>-</strong> </em>Iran should commit to work for Hezbollah’s transformation into an exclusively political and social organization and to press Palestinian opposition groups to stop violent action;<em><br />
<strong>-</strong> </em>Iran should commit to an ongoing human rights dialogue with the United States;<em><br />
<strong>-</strong> </em>Iran should commit to stopping the provision of training, supplies, and funds to organizations designated as terrorist organizations by the United States; and<em><br />
<strong>-</strong> </em>Iran should commit to work with the United States to ensure the emergence of a stable, unitary, and democratic political order in Iraq.<em><br />

PLAN:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer the government of Iran a comprehensive settlement of diplomatic issues. This offer should include –<br />
<br />
<strong>-</strong> A security guarantee which commits to not preemptively use force to change the borders or form of government of Iran;<br />
<strong>-</strong> A commitment to end unilateral sanctions against Iran;<br />
<strong>-</strong> The reestablishment of diplomatic relations;<br />
<strong>-</strong> A commitment to support Iran’s application for accession to the World Trade Organization;<br />
<strong>-</strong> A commitment to terminate Iran’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism; and<br />
<strong>-</strong> An agreement to the commencement of an ongoing strategic dialogue with Iran as a forum for assessing each side’s implementation of its commitments.<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government will make clear that its implementation of this offer is dependent on Iran’s acceptance of the following conditions:<br />
<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should agree to limit its fuel cycle activities to a delayed limited enrichment program. This should include full transparency, agreement to intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and a commitment to ratify and implement the Additional Protocol to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty;<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should issue a statement expressing support for a just and lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict;<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should commit to work for Hezbollah’s transformation into an exclusively political and social organization and to press Palestinian opposition groups to stop violent action;<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should commit to an ongoing human rights dialogue with the United States;<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should commit to stopping the provision of training, supplies, and funds to organizations designated as terrorist organizations by the United States; and<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should commit to work with the United States to ensure the emergence of a stable, unitary, and democratic political order in Iraq.<br />
<br />
Funding and enforcement guaranteed. We’ll clarify intent.<br />
