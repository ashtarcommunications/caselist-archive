 <strong>Soft Power</strong> <br />
Soft Power is unrecoverable without addressing Iraq – the entire theory is based upon vague, untestable assertions and willful blindness about the root cause of America’s decline<br />
Afrasiabi 11-13 (Kaveh, Asia Times, “The illusion of American ‘smart power’,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://atimes.com/" rel="nofollow">atimes.com</a>)<br />
Over the years … under new guises<br />
No impact to terrorism<br />

Politicians who talk about … course and fade away”<br />
Hegemony is high and sustainable<br />

Capitulating to American demands causes public overthrow of the regime<br />
Rubin 07 (in 1nc wiki)<br />
But the strongest argument … <u>everything the same</u>.<br />
Assad is resilient because he can direct Islamic opposition toward the US – your takeouts don’t assume our link<br />
Corbin 07 (Ethan, “Lessons from the interior: Insurgency and counter-insurgency in Syria,” The Fletcher School Journal for issues relation to Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization, Spring, pg. 7-8)<br />
Yes there are … <u>long-term regime survival</u>.<br />
Resiliency is false – Bashar can’t withstand hits to his regime<br />
Zisser 06 (Eyal, “What does the future hold for Syria?,” Middle East Quarterly, June)<br />
The series of developments … <u>Bashar and his regime</u>.<br />
Predictions of regime collapse are always met with skepticism – there’s too much discontent to ignore our impact<br />
Carnegie 06 (“Reform in Syria: Steering between the Chinese Model and Regime Change,” Carngie Papers Middle East Series, No. 69, July, pg. 15)<br />
<u>A complete collapse</u> … social freedoms<br />
Takeouts about their current limitations don’t assume the boost that they would receive from regime collapse<br />
Abbot 05 (Sebastian, “Regime Change in Syria and the Role Islam Could Play”)<br />
<u>Even if</u> Moubayed … among the people.<br />
Regime collapse = muslim brotherhood<br />
Zisser 2006 (above)<br />
One may thus suppose … from Wahhabis.<br />
Anti American sentiment strengthening bashar now<br />
Zisser 2008<br />
Such pariah status may…on the right horse.<br />
Bashar strong – predictive and no concessions<br />
Economist 3/16<br />
Power remains in the hands of … hold on power.<br />
Agreeing to the condition ends bashar’s ability to control public anti-american sentiment<br />
Barry Rubin 2007, The truth about Syria, p. 262-3<br />
While others seek to educate…and obey him.<br />
That outweighs turns<br />
Rubin 2007, The truth about Syria, p. 2-3<br />
To understand Syria’s special role…without human rights.<br />
Muslim brotherhood turns the case<br />
Abbot 2005 (above)<br />
Despite Bush’s apparent fixation on toppling bashar…in the middle east.<br />
Negotiating Golan peace collapses bashar<br />
Rubin 2007 (above)<br />
Barry rubin: indeed, the assad regime has failed…its regional ambitions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Security K</strong><br />
Attempts to stabilize the Middle East generate perpetual violence<br />
Noorani 2005 (Yaseen, Assistant professor in Near Eastern Studies at U Arizona, “The Rhetoric of Security,” CR: The New Centennial Review 5.1, Project Muse)<br />
The Bush administration … foreseeable future<br />
Disorder and insecurity are inevitable and attempts to control it make extinction inevitable. The alternative is to affirm difference and admit that everything is dangerous<br />
Der Derian 98 (James, Polisci Professor at U Massachusetts, On Security, ed: Lipschitz, The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard, Decentering Security)<br />
No other concept … a fearful sameness<br />
<strong>LOST Good</strong><br />
Bush needs capital with the GOP to pass LOST – its key to sustaining the Ocean<br />
Salter 3-10 (Howard, New York Times Editorial, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/opinion/116oceans.html?ref=opinion" rel="nofollow">__http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03 /16/opinion/116oceans.html?ref =opinion__</a>)<br />
<u>We are in danger</u> … and its people<br />
Plan wrecks Bush’s capital<br />
Zunes 04 (Stephen, Spring, “US Policy towards Syria and the Triumph of Neoconservatism,” Middle East Policy 11.1, Proquest)<br />
<u>With overwhelming bipartisan</u> … in New York<br />
US ratification key to prevent an arctic conflict<br />
Borgerson March/April 2008 (Scotty G., “Arctic Meltdown: The Economic and Security Implications of Global Warming”<br />
Thanks to global warming … <u>dash for its resources</u>.<br />
Arctic tensions cause miscalculation and accidental nuclear war<br />
Huebert 07 (Rob, Appendix 4, Canada and the Circumpolar World: Meeting the Challenges of Cooperation into the Twenty-First Century: A Critique of Chapter 4 – “Post-Cold War Cooperation in the Arctic: From Interstate Conflict to New Agendas for Seucirty”)<br />
<u>The potential for</u> … the Borei class<br />

<strong>CP – Soft Power/no replacement of Bashar al-Assad</strong><br />
Text: The United States Federal Government should publicly ban torture as an interrogation technique, including banning the use of waterboarding. The United States should end the use of its military base at Guantanamo Bay as a detention facility. The Executive Branch of the United States Federal Government should make an internal, classified decision to not attempt to forcibly replace the administration of Bashar al-Assad<br />
Banning torture solves soft power<br />
Podesta 07 (John, “Revitalizing the Transatlantic Partnership,” December 13)<br />
Because the truth is that … in American history.<br />
Executives can make a classified decision <br />
Kassop 03 (Nancy, “The War Power and its Limits,” Presidential Studies Quarterly, Volume 33, Issue 3, September)<br />
