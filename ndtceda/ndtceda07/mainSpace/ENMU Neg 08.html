Critique of Orientalism<br />
<br />
<strong>VERSION ONE</strong><br />
The affirmative is a product of and produces distorted mythologies of “the Orient” and Western obligations to it. This undergirds the culture of colonial domination in the name of “giving civilization to inferior peoples”.<br />
Edward. W. Said, Culture and Imperialism. 1993 p. 9-11<br />
“Neither imperialism or colonialism is a simple act…perspective, historical sense, emotions, and traditions.”<br />
<br />
And, policy rhetoric in relation to the Middle East contributes to the prevailing Orientalist and imperialist attitudes, desensitizing us from human suffering and erasing history—the equivalent of cultural genocide.<br />
Edward W. Said. “Preface” to Orientalism. 2003 p. xxi<br />
“One specifically American contribution… contemptuous American phrase, ‘you’re history.’”<br />
<br />
Next, academic work such as the aff serves its institutional masters-- the state and corporate interests. This leads to policy failures and turns case.<br />
Edward W. Said. Covering Islam: how the media and experts determine how we see the rest of the world. Pantheon Books: New York, 1981 p. 17-19<br />
“The experts whose field was modern Islam… successful modernization were what was studied.”<br />
<br />
In this framework, Orwellian language manipulation calls slavery “aid”; war “peace”; and domination “engagement”. This makes atrocities like nuclear war, genocide and annihilation possible.<br />
John Collins, Professor of History at St. Lawrence University; and Ross Glover, Professor of Sociology at St. Lawrence University. Collateral Language: a user’s guide to America’s new war. New York University Press. 2002 p.7<br />
“As any university student knows, theories… mental gaze from the physical effects of violence.”<br />
<br />
Prefer our critical framework: voting negative upholds the vital investigative space demanded by our academic model and checks nationalism.<br />
Edward. W. Said, Culture and Imperialism. 1993 p.xxv<br />
“Yet the ideological concern over… than reject the emerging groups.”<br />
