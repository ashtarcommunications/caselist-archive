Failure of the unitary state system risks terrorism in Russia and throughout the region – ensuring political balance can result in regional collaboraqtion and economic development<br />
Hale 2 (critics of the unitary state solution…regional collaboration. We need to get this one right)<br />

Community development independently marginalizes extremists and decreases recruitment<br />

Terrorism against Russia would cause retaliation against the US and global wars<br />

There’s no risk of offense – the fallbacks of a federalist system are magnified with any alternative<br />
Hale 2 (given the dangers associated with federal state structures…run in a democratic system)<br />

Regenerating community development and stifling poverty is essential to prevent a Taliban re-entry into the govt – the impact is ethnic war in the region, drawing in major powers<br />

<strong><u>2ac AT Federalism Bad</u></strong><br />
<br />
There’s already a de-facto federal system in Afghanistan – strengthening it is key to achieve the benefits of federalism<br />
Smith 2 (on the ground today, there is an imperfect…Afghanistan will be bridged)<br />
<br />
Neo Taliban<br />
A. decentralized power structure would pacify competing factions – neo-Taliban will accept nothing less<br />
Giustozzi 7 (despite many reports to the contrary…win and an unlikely peace)<br />
<br />
B. neo-taliban movement will destabilize the entire country – only devolution limits their influence<br />
Giustozzi 7 (moreover, the support of the clergy…conflicts cannot be underestimated)<br />
<br />
Ethnic diversity makes federalism more sustainable, not less – empiricism proves<br />
Best 1 (the war in Afghanistan is characterized by a new…where there is great diversity)<br />
<br />
We don’t lead to absolutely decentralized ethno-territories – the current system is over-centralized and ineffective<br />
