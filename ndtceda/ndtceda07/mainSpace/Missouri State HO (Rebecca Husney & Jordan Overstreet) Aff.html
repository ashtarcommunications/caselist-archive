PLAN: <br />
<strong>The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Syria. This should include offering them a security guarantee that the United States does not seek regime change in Syria as an inducement to engage in dialogue about the US-Syria relationship. This engagement will also include the United States announcing that it will return an ambassador to Syria, support negotiations for and the return of the Golan Heights to Syria, acknowledge Syria's special interest in Lebanon, and announce that it will be willing to remove Syria from the Department of State's list of countries sponsoring terrorism in exchange for Syria's ending of support for militant/terrorist organizations, cooperation on Iraq and respect for the political independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon.</strong> <br />
Advantages:<br />
Israel-Syria relations good<br />
US-Syria relations good<br />
