 Here's the latest aff we've read<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should end its regime change activities targeted at the Palestinian Legislative Council and recognize the Palestinian Legislative Council as part of the legitimate governing authority of the Palestinian Authority. This engagement should be conditioned on meeting established benchmarks that should include: relinquishing sole control of the Gaza, securing the release of hostages, instituting a comprehensive ceasefire, and authorizing Fatah to negotiate with Israel.<br />

 <br />
The United States federal government should invite the elected Palestinian Legislative Council and the Palestinian Presidency to participate in the Annapolis Peace Summit. The invitation should be conditioned on the creation of power-sharing agreement between the two. The United States federal government should end its military assistance to the Palestinian Presidency for the purpose of regime change activities targeted at the PLC. This engagement should be conditioned on meeting established bench marks that should include: imposing order in the Gaza, securing the release of hostages, instituting a comprehensive ceasefire, and authorizing Fatah to negotiate with Israel.<br />

 <strong>Plan:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The United States federal government should cease its military assistance to the Palestinian Presidency that is for the purpose of regime change activities targeted at the elected Palestinian Legislative Council. The United States federal Government should invite the elected Palestinian Legislative Council to participate in the Middle East Peace Summit host by the Bush Administration. The talks should be used to push for a renewed Fatah-Hamas power sharing agreement. The invitation should be conditioned on respect for agreements negotiated by the Palestinian Authority.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Peace Process Advantage</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The Bush administration is hosting a November Summit that could lead to a lasting peace in the Middle East—however continued exclusion of Hamas guarantees failure</strong><br />

<strong>Somehow, during the course of the hot August days, a presidential address which seemed to promise rather little has become an effort in Middle East peace summitry that is beginning to raise expectations and is the first of its kind in almost seven</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>The US has always known this, but has for years conducted itself according to erroneous priorities. It failed to understand that if there is an Achilles heel in the Mideast problem, it can be found in the Palestinian question and not in the fight against terror, Iraq or in enforcing democracy in Arab states. Only after six years of stubbornness, Bush admitted that &quot;Iraq was not the only key axis in the Middle East.&quot; Bush's initiative is his last effort to salvage America's status in the region, after the United States has found itself on the defensive on all fronts. Ironically, the call for an international conference is also a call to declare war on Hamas,</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>At the same time, however; Hamas is aiming to derail the process with a new wave of terrorist strikes and rocket attacks.</strong><br />

<strong>Egypt Advantage</strong><br />

<strong>Mubarak is conducting a major crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood—slamming the political door shut leads to civil unrest and violent extremism</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The Mubarak regime in Egypt is staging a major crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's main Islamist</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The US is uniquely contributing to this violence—continued isolation of Hamas gives Mubarak the greenlight to prevent the Brotherhood from participating in the political process</strong><br />
<strong>Stratfor 06 [Geopolitical Diary, &quot;The MB and Mubarak's Countermeasures,&quot; 2/15)</strong><br />
<strong>The upper house of Egypt's parliament voted Tuesday to extend the terms of the country’s 4,500 local council members by two years. The measure, approved by 348 of 454 lawmakers, ostensibly was passed to allow enough time to draft a new law granting the municipalities more power. In reality, it is President Rosni Mubaraks move to counter election gains by the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and maintain the ruling National Democratic Party's (NDP's) grip on power. Mass arrests and beatings have been the regime's weapons of choice for containing its Islamist opposition, but now the NDP is turning to &quot;democratic&quot; means to contain the MB. For instance, because the Brotherhood is officially banned in Egypt</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The threshold is low—a small unexpected event could trigger an escalating spiral of violence that threatens the regime</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The problem for Hamas is that its constituency -the rank and file- and the wider Islamist movement have now embarked on a period of introspection.</strong><br />

<strong>The government thus remains the one player that creates new realities on the ground and is expected to provide answers to the problems of uncontrolled population growth and the resulting societal needs, as well as to challenges of globalization and foreign policy. With this do-it-all syndrome, the government has made all other players and society in general irrelevant It has contributed to strengthening the barrier between political authority and society at a time when society's mobilization is needed so that the development process can be inclusive and thus succeed.
