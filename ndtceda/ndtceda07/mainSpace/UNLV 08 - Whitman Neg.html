Resistance will inevitably occur in nature and resistance in animals is caused by humans – their evidence uses flawed methodology<br />

Antibiotic-resistance genes …in these animals.<br />

Drug resistance is caused by hospitals, a decrease in antibiotics in feed does nothing to control resistance and endangers the food supply<br />

For its part, the meat-production industry contends that there is not enough conclusive evidence to support measures like the FDA's proposed ban against flouroquinolones. Although none deny that the spread of antibacterial resistance is a real problem, proponents of sub-therapeutic antibiotic use in animals point out that the problem stems … &quot;prudent use principles.&quot;<br />
