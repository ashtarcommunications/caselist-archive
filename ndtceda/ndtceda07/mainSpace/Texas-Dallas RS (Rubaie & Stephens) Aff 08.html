bipartisanship -- the plan moves the bush admin toward Congressional democrats<br />
WP 4-4-7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401351.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401351.html</a><br />
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met Syria's president in a hilltop palace in Damascus on Wednesday in a visit that came despite the Bush administration's objections and appeared to underline Syria's gradual emergence from years of international isolation.<br />
Pelosi (D-Calif.), the highest-ranking U.S. government figure to visit Syria since 2003, said President Bashar al-Assad assured her of his willingness to engage in peace talks with <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/countries/israel.html?nav=el" rel="nofollow">Israel</a>. The pledge appeared to diverge little from past public statements by Syria, and the visit's more lasting impact may be the symbolic import of Syria returning to the center of the region's diplomacy after being as estranged from the United States and Europe as at any time in a generation. &quot;Syria tries to read the American tea leaves very closely, and this type of signal is read as very significant in Damascus,&quot; said Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. &quot;The way they understand the United States is that U.S. policy changes dramatically. And generally they wait it out until there's a change and then try to recoup their losses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hagel suports syirna engagement<br />
WP 4-30-07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/04/hagel_on_iraq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/04/hagel_on_iraq.html</a><br />
The regional problem, as described by Hagel, is a U.S. policy breakdown with a failure to engage Iran and Syria. &quot;I do know that there are a number of Israelis who would like to engage Syria,&quot; said Hagel. &quot;They have said that Elliott Abrams keeps pushing them back.&quot; He quoted foreign ministers, ambassadors and former U.S. officials as saying they believe Abrams &quot;is making policy in the Middle East.&quot;<br />
Hagel certainly is no peace-now zealot. &quot;We're not going to precipitously pull out,&quot; he told me. &quot;We have [national] interests in Iraq.&quot; While he asserted &quot;we can't get out by the end of the year,&quot; he called for &quot;pulling some of our guys out -- not all of them, but you've got to get them out of [Baghdad] at least, get them out of the middle of civil war.&quot; If not, Hagel said, &quot;then the prospects of the Republican Party are very dim next year.&quot;<br />
Hagel is a litmus test for Republican support<br />
WP 4-30-07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/29/AR2007042901562.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/29/AR2007042901562.html</a><br />
These judgments come from someone credited with rebuilding Nebraska's Republican Party and who has earned a lifetime conservative voting rating of 85.2 percent from the American Conservative Union. Hagel represents millions of Republicans who are repelled by the Democrats' personal assault on President Bush but are deeply unhappy about his course in Iraq.<br />

Engagement with syria now<br />

<br />
he Bush administration has dismantled a special committee that was established last year to coordinate aggressive actions against Iran and Syria, according to State Department officials.<br />
The committee, the Iran-Syria Policy and Operations Group, met weekly throughout much of 2006 to coordinate actions such as curtailing Iran's access to credit and banking institutions, organizing the sale of military equipment to Iran's neighbors and supporting forces that oppose the two regimes.<br />
State Department and White House officials said the dissolution of the group was simply a bureaucratic reorganization, but many analysts saw it as evidence of a softening in the U.S. strategy toward the two countries. It comes as the Bush administration has embarked on a significant new effort to hold high-level meetings with Iran and Syria.<br />
The group had become the focus for administration critics who feared that it was plotting covert actions that could escalate into a military conflict with Iran or Syria. The air of secrecy surrounding the group when it was established in March 2006, coupled with the fact that it was modeled after a similar special committee on Iraq, contributed to those suspicions.<br />
A senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press, said the group was shut down because of a widespread public perception that it was designed to enact regime change. State Department officials have said the focus of the Iran-Syria group was persuading the two regimes to change their behavior, not toppling them.<br />
Nicholas Burns, the State Department's under secretary for political affairs, revealed in a written statement to a senator in the past week that the group was disbanded in March in &quot;favor of a more standard process&quot; of coordinating between the White House, the State Department, Defense Department and intelligence agencies. Burns's statement came in a written response to questions submitted by Senator Robert Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat.<br />
Shortly before the Iran-Syria group was shut down, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice launched a major initiative to engage Iran and Syria in a regional effort to stabilize Iraq, reversing longstanding U.S. policy against high-level contact with the countries.<br />
For years, the Bush administration has shunned meetings with Syria. The administration cited concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions and accused both nations of supporting militants in Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. Diplomatic ties between the United States and Iran were cut off following the 1979 Iranian revolution.<br />
But Rice met this month with Syria's foreign minister in Egypt, the first such high-level meeting between the two countries since 2004, and on Monday, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, is scheduled to meet his Iranian counterpart in Baghdad.<br />
Kenneth Katzman, a Middle East specialist at the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of the U.S. Congress, said he did not think it was a coincidence that the Iran-Syria group was disbanded at the same time the State Department began its diplomatic outreach.<br />
&quot;I think the rationale for that group was promoting regime change, and Rice is going in a much different direction from that,&quot; Katzman said. &quot;The regime-change school within the administration has really gotten quite a bit weaker.&quot;<br />

Status quo engagement perceived<br />
CSM 5-4-7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0504/p01s01-wome.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0504/p01s01-wome.html</a><br />
In a move signaling a significant change in US policy, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Thursday with her Syrian counterpart on the margins of an international meeting about Iraq.<br />
Though largely limited to a statement of US concerns about Syrian action with impact on Iraq, the meeting opens the door to further contact and signals a new Bush administration willingness to engage even its diplomatic foes to improve conditions in Iraq.<br />
Dr. Rice came to a two-day gathering of Iraq's neighbors hinting at her willingness to meet with Iranian officials, who are seen as perhaps the most important outside influence on Iraq. But as the meeting opened Thursday, US officials were playing down prospects for that meeting and talking up the likelihood – and utility – of a meeting with the Syrians.<br />
Rice's meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moalem focused on security issues, specifically, US concerns over the destabilizing influence of a porous Syrian border with Iraq, according to State Department officials.<br />
Mr. Moalem told reporters that the meeting was &quot;frank and constructive&quot; and indicated that it was limited to Iraq. At the same time, US military officials in Baghdad said at a press conference that they were seeing indications of greater Syrian effort to control its border with Iraq.<br />
Rice's meeting with Moalem reflects the administration's decision to step up diplomacy – while not making that the focus of its Iraq policy, say some Middle East analysts.<br />
