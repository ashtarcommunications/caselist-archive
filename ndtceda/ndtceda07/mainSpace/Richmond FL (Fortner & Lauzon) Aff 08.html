Contention 1: Us complicity<br />
Hamas was the victor of the free and fair elections that were called for by the US. Since the election, the US has led the charge of violent and tragic isolation.<br />

Plan Text:<br />
<br />
Resolved: that the United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of the Palestinian Authority through negotiations including Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya by, in part, removing Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya from the U.S. Department of State's Foreign Terrorist Organizations List, and it should include offering the Palestinian Authority a security guarantee that rescinds the United States' support of Israeli suppression of the Palestinians in exchange for continued efforts toward a national unity government.<br />
Advantage 1: Alienation<br />
<br />
The Palestinian vote for Hamas was not a vote for violence. Yes, Fatah, Hamas, and Israel have all committed various atrocities, as has the United States. Hamas offers a democratic alternative, if engaged, yet it is still demonized by the US because of its policies of resistance. These characterizations have catastrophic effects.<br />

<br />
The rhetoric used by the US in the War on Terror vilifies Hamas in order to exclude them. This locks in violence. This locks in violence, making the future untenable for Israel, the US, and the Palestinians.<br />

<br />
Demonization of Hamas should be rejected because it justifies a culture of war and violence. Only rehumanizing rituals – like removing Hamas from the terrorist list and engaging them – can break down these constructions and allow for peace. This framework comes prior to manipulations within a status quo beset by the war culture and the construction of evil.<br />

<br />
Advantage 2:<br />
A) Suffering:<br />
The current situation in Gaza is humanitarian catastrophe. The Palestinians are reduced to sub-human status while the world watches silently.<br />

<br />
Bloodshed and violence will cease if the US includes Hamas in its November peace talks and stops its policy of isolation. Genuine peace is attainable if the US presents a equitable solution<br />

This debate matters! This debate matters! American knowledge production on Israel and Palestine is just as much a part of the problem as Israeli tanks and guns. The US has a unique position with and is the only country that can break this violent deadlock on peace.<br />

Contention 2: Solvency<br />
<br />
Hamas will not disappear. Hamas will not disappear. Hamas is a flexible and pragmatic organization that will accept genuine opportunities of peace.<br />

<br />
We must engage Hamas now – failure to act before November dooms negotiation and long-term peace with Israel. Fortunately, our plan text solves by moving toward a national unity government – the essential precondition for stability.<br />

A third-way is possible –there is space for sustained democratic participation within the Palestinian Authority. Acting now opens the possibility of deep multi-party democracy taking root.<br />
