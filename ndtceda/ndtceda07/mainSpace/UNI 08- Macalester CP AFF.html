Abundance 1AC<br />
<br />
Observation 1 is Abundance:<br />
<br />
<br />
The US Food Supply is Dominated By the Concept of Abundance—Agricultural Subsidies Fuel This Drive By Encouraging Massive Overproduction of Initial Crops and Resulting Commodities <br />
Tom Philpott, Food Editor For Grist, “Reform School,” February 6th, 2007 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.grist.org/comments/food/2007/02/06/farm_bill3/" rel="nofollow">http://www.grist.org/comments/food/2007/02/06/farm_bill3/</a>)<br />
<br />
For about a century, … focused on ever-fewer crops.  <br />
<br />
<br />
These Subsidies Reflect a Particular Desire For Universal Abundance—Attempting to Gain, Produce and Know Everything—This Desire is Connected With a Linear Conception of Proress and the Possibility of Possessing Truth and Knowledge<br />
Margaret Chon, Assistant Professor of Law, Syracuse University College of Law, “POSTMODERN * &quot;PROGRESS&quot;: RECONSIDERING THE COPYRIGHT AND PATENT POWER,” DePaul Law Review, Fall, 1993, p. lexis<br />
<br />
<br />
This &quot;Progress&quot; of knowledge … postmodernist traditions, discussed in the next section.<br />
<br />
This Drive for Abundance is Rooted in the Basic Structure of Subjectivity and Abundance Itself Becomes the Model of the Object—As Such, It is Entirely Impossible, Abundance and Lack are Structurally Dependent On One Another—The Obsession With Feeding Everyone is Precisely The Reason Why Famine Exists <br />
Jenny Edkins, Lecturer at University of Wales, Whose Hunger? Concepts of Famine, Practices of Aid, 2000, p. 123-124<br />
<br />
Famine images, like the sexual images they parallel, … hunger for a world free from hunger.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Impact is Violence and Extermination—The Object’s Shattering of the Fantasy of Abundnace Warrants its Elimination—Maintaining this Fact as the Structuring Element of Society Enforces the Necessity of Such Outbreaks <br />
Slavoj Zizek, “Ideology between Fiction and Fantasy,”  Cardozo Law Review, 1995, p. lexis<br />
<br />
Our argument can be briefly summarized as follows: … dimensions acquired by the remainder...<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Federal Government Should Remove All Its Agricultural Subsidies for <br />
Biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, Corn, Cotton, Dairy, Fisheries, Rice, Soybeans, Sugar and Wheat. <br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 2 is Our Relation to Desire:<br />
<br />
We Must Address the Primary Question of the Fantasy to Have Any Chance at Addressing Any of the Issues it Contains—Only the Affirmative Methodology Can Escape the Status Quo Desire for Abundance (Evidence Has been Gender Modified)<br />
Bernard Selinger, “The Navajo, Psychosis, Lacan, and Derrida,” Texas Studies in Literature and Language Vol 49 Iss 1, 2007 p. 64-100 <br />
<br />
<br />
Discovering the &quot;truth&quot; about oneself … phantasy becomes the drive.&quot; 37 <br />
<br />
Your Disads are Irrelevant—The Attempt to Determine Precise Cause and Effect Structures With Regard to Agricultue Subsidies Ignores the Underlying Complextity—We Must Focus on Theory and Methodology to Effectively Intervene in these Questions<br />
Nick Srnicek, “Complexity and the Food Crisis,” The Accursed Share, May 13th, 2008 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://accursedshare.blogspot.com/2008/05/complexity-and-food-crisis.html" rel="nofollow">http://accursedshare.blogspot.com/2008/05/complexity-and-food-crisis.html</a>)<br />
In considering the causes of the recent world food crisis (…This is the threat.<br />
<br />
This Acceptance of Responsibility in the Act is the only Possibility for a True Ethical Commitment—Any Refusal to Make Ethics a Universal Claim Defers this Responsibility and Becomes an Excuse for Violence and Torture<br />
Slavoj Zizek, Robespierre or the &quot;Divine Violence&quot; of Terror, Lacan.com, 2007 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizrobes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizrobes.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
We can see now why Lacan's motto …determining what my duty is.<br />
<br />
Don’t Trust the Negative Impact Comparisons—Our Primary Mission Must Be a Confrontation With Desire—Focusing on Utilitarian Impact Calculations Can Only Lead Us to Ignore the Primacy of these Issues and Cause the Impacts You Aim To Avoid<br />
Rolando Gaete, “ARTICLE: Law &amp; The Sacred: Desecration, Law and Evil,” Law/Text/Culture, 2000, p. lexis<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the terror that Burke wrote … as the repressed&quot; (La Capra 1992: 126).
