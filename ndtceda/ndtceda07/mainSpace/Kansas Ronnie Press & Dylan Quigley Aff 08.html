Contention 1: Engagement Now<br />
The US is increasing foreign assistance towards the Palestinian Authority now but failure to condition aid will result in total policy failure<br />
Rep. Gary L. Ackerman 07 [Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, “Connecting the Money to the Mission: The Past, Present, and Future of U.S. Assistance to the Palestinians” House Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia December 12, 2007]<br />
There are some signs … the Palestinian Authority.<br />
<br />
The State Department has already assured approval of $410 million to Palestinian moderates including $150 million directly to the Palestinian Authority<br />

The U.S. State … Bergner said.<br />
<br />
The US is engaging Fatah and Israel over peace deals in the status quo<br />
Markus Bouillon and Michael Shtender-Auerbach 1/16 [2008, former director of the International Peace Academy’s Middle East Program,, Push for Peace Now, Before Bush and Abbas Step Down, The Jewish Daily Forward, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.forward.com/articles/12493/" rel="nofollow">http://www.forward.com/articles/12493/</a><br />
In his last year in … to an end.<br />
<br />
Bush and Olmert have already signaled commitment to Abbas in order to weaken Hamas<br />
Haaretz 07 [Olmert: New PA government deserves a chance, assistance <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/872633.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/872633.html</a>]<br />
Prime Minister Ehud … to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Federal Government should offer the Palestinian Authority a substantial increase in police training assistance on the condition that the Palestinian Authority implements corruption reforms.<br />
<br />
Contention 2: Solvency<br />
The US should offer assistance including police training to the Palestinian Authority on the condition that the PA adopts corruption reform measures-this is key to solve Palestinian impoverishment and de-escalate conflict Rep. Gary L. Ackerman 07 [Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, “Connecting the Money to the Mission: The Past, Present, and Future of U.S. Assistance to the Palestinians” House Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia December 12, 2007]<br />
The immediate needs … help themselves?<br />
<br />
Conditioning foreign assistance on corruption reform is key to empower Palestinian moderates<br />
James Prince 07 [December 26, president of the Democracy Council, is a former consultant to the Palestinian Finance Ministry, Condition Aid to Palestinians on Accountability, The Jewish Daily Forward, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.forward.com/articles/12339/" rel="nofollow">http://www.forward.com/articles/12339/</a>]<br />
Constructive conditions on foreign … at peace with Israel.<br />
<br />
The Advantage: Hamastan<br />
Hamas is actively preparing for a complete take over the West Bank because of corruption within Fatah<br />
Aaron Klein 07 [November, Hamas caught prepping for West Bank takeover <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=58900" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=58900</a>]<br />
WND first reported … stated al-Zahar.<br />
<br />
Current aid to Fatah emboldens Hamas-it goes in the pockets of corrupt officials<br />

He is also Research Director of the IDC’s Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy, and Strategy; the editor of the journal Turkish Studies; the editor of The Middle East Review of International Affairs (MERIA); <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1200572498910&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull" rel="nofollow">http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1200572498910&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull</a>]<br />
In addition, the PA … their intentions.<br />
<br />
We’ll isolate 2 scenarios. The first is Israeli-Palestinian escalation<br />
<br />
Strengthening Palestinian moderates is key to prevent Hamas expansion to the West Bank which will transform current violence into religious conflict<br />
David Makovsky 07 [September 5, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near Eeast Policy, Palestinian Moderates Need Help]<br />
For the past several … resolution impossible<br />
<br />
This guarantees permanent Israeli-Palestinian conflict with no chance of de-escalation Allan C Brownfeld 02 [The Growing Danger of Transforming the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict Into a Jewish-Muslim Religious War, The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]<br />
The great danger … in the past.<br />
<br />
And this conflict risks global nuclear war that outweighs any superpower confrontation<br />
Chomsky 99 [Noam, Professor of Linguistics @ MIT, Fateful Triangle, pg. 449]<br />
The disasters threatening … a resolution of this conflict.<br />
<br />
Global escalation is guaranteed if Israel-Palestinian violence is not contained<br />
Niall Ferguson 06 [The Next War of the Worlds, Lexis]<br />
The obvious conclusion is … Palestine and Mesopotamia.<br />
<br />
The 2nd scenario is regional wars<br />
A Hamas take over of the West Bank will cause massive rocket attacks into Israel and prompt full Israeli aggression into Palestinian territory<br />
Jeff Hermann December 07 [“The Madness of the Middle East <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.middleeastupdate.net/archives/1149" rel="nofollow">http://www.middleeastupdate.net/archives/1149</a>]<br />
All major western … amazement.<br />
<br />
This will guarantee escalation. If Hamas continues to expand power it will cause a Middle East war that draws in regional superpowers<br />
Robert Berger 07 [Berger, &quot;War or Peace? The Middle East at the Crossroads,&quot; Address to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, 7/19]<br />
I’m often asked … and ultimately Iran.<br />
<br />
Israel will be compelled to use nuclear weapons during war which will spark regional nuclear confrontation<br />
Beres 07 - Prof of I-Law @ Purdue [Lois Rene, &quot;Israel's Uncertain Strategic Future,&quot; Parameters, Spring]<br />
What if enemy … American preemptions.<br />
<br />
Even absent escalation, a regional nuclear war in the Middle East leads to extinction<br />
Ian Hoffman, December 12, 06 [“Nuclear Winter Looms, experts say”, MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers]<br />
With superpower … according to Rutgers' Robock.<br />
<br />
The Middle East is also the most likely scenario for escalation and nuclear war<br />
Dr. Ephraim Kam 07 [Deputy Head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies and served as a colonel in the Research Division of IDF Military Intelligencehttp://www.tau.ac.il/jcss/memoranda/memo88.pdf<br />
The statements by Iranian … not yet exist.<br />
<br />
Hamas control of the West Bank leads to instability in Jordan<br />
Ami Ayalon December 07 [Commander of chief in Israeli Navy <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.middleeastprogress.org/2007/12/07/" rel="nofollow">http://www.middleeastprogress.org/2007/12/07/</a>]<br />
I think the … to succeed.<br />
<br />
Hamas take over of the West Bank will overwhelm Jordan’s border and subject Israel to massive ground attacks Caroline B.

Everyone wants to go…it has got neither.<br />
The United States Conflict with Iran is not one obased on objective facts but developed through mutual governmental demonization.
