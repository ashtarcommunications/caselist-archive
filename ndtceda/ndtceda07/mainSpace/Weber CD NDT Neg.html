 Framework<br />
God K<br />
Aff is wrong about history—belief that history is contingent on human action ignores our true role. All we can do is make a decision about the decision God has already made.<br />
Robin W. Lovin <u>Strike Terror No More</u>, 161-163<br />
“Good politics understands these limits…what the real choice is.”<br />
The 1AC is a call to perfect and tame history by making it static and predictable. This administers beings without history where there can be no difference between life and death<br />
Jurgen Moltmann 1996<br />
<u>The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology</u> p 220-222<br />
“The idea of the ‘administered world’ which Max…than human beings themselves!”<br />
And their impacts are inebitable—death is sovereign over the fallen world. Any attempts to reduce death to a mere biological event ignore this. Only death will live after us until Christ comes.<br />
William Stringfellow 1964 <u>Free in Obedience</u> 64-66<br />
“Apart from the sovereignty of God…things exist within the realm of death.”<br />
Finally, the alternative is eucharistic hope<br />
Vu Chi Huy in 2004<br />
Paul, &quot;The Pledge of Future Glory: The Eschatological Dimension of the EUcharist&quot; March 2004<br />
Moral tunnel vision is key to value to life<br />
Conor Cunningham 2002 “Genealogy of Nihilism” 174-175<br />
“What we may begin to realise… that a ‘nonoccurrence’ can occur.”<br />

Cunningham 1999 “Language: Wittgenstein after Theology” <u>Radical Orthodoxy</u> 64-68<br />
“This essay defines philosophical…came close to doing so.”<br />
Their call to effectiveness rejects God’s sovereignty over the world and embraces the tyranny of death<br />
William Stringfellow 1984 <u>The Politics of Spirituality</u> p 23<br />
“The Incarnation, as that is vested…embodied in Jesus Christ.”<br />
Ontology is key to ethical choices<br />
J. Stan Rowe 2001<br />
“Naess insists that ethics or right…ethical/environmental theories.”<br />
Wars in the Middle East constitute the start of the fulfillment of the Apocalypse our only choice is to accept God’s choice of us or perish in eternal flame<br />
Craig Crawford 1999 “The Prophecies: A journey to the end of time…” 59-60<br />
“As God looks down upon the Earth…eight people were saved.”<br />

 <strong>T- Incentives</strong><br />
Interpretation – Constructive Engagement is unconditionally giving incentives<br />

<u>Constructive Engagement was under</u> … power-sharing with blacks<br />

<strong>God/Historicism K</strong><br />
1NC:<br />
The affs portrayal of history as continent on human action ignores our true role. All we can do is make a decision about a decision that God has already made. All attempts to mobilize society through fear and threats are heretical dualism, they act as if we had the choice to embrace good or evil futures or natures. In fact all we can do is try to act rightly in light of our fallen nature<br />
Lovin 2002 (Robin W., Professor of Ethics at SMU, Faith Ethics and Evil, <em>Strike Terror no More</em>, 161-3)<br />
Good politics understands … what the real choice is<br />
The 1AC is a call to perfect and tame history by making it static and predictable. This approach administers beings without history, where there can be no difference between life and death, the preservation of the world or its annihilation; by correcting the natural deformity of human race, the denizens of the future can no longer be human beings at all<br />
Moltmann 96 (Jurgen, “The Coming to God: Christian Eschatology,” pg. 220-22)<br />
The idea of the ‘administered world’ … human beings themselves.<br />
Their impacts are inevitable – death is sovereign over the fallen world. Any attempts to reduce death to a mere biological event ignore this. Every institution we build will die, every life we save will die, every baby born will die. Only death will live after us until Christ comes<br />
Stringfellow 64 (William, JD Harvard, Theologian, “Free in Obedience,” pg. 64-66)<br />
<u>Apart from the sovereignty</u> … within the realm of death<br />
Alternative: Eucharistic Hope<br />
Only the impossible gift of god can fill the void left by liberalism and the scarcity ethic; making life meaningful by the recognition that death is not the end<br />
Vu Chi Hy in 2004 (Paul, Doctoral Candidate in the School of Theology, Australian Catholic University, “The Pledge of Future Glory: The Eschatological Dimension of the Eucharist: A Systematic Exploration,” March, pg. 53-56)<br />
Firstly, Marcel’s insight…<u>transformation of the world</u><br />
2NC AT: Framework<br />
Engaging eschatology key to effective policymaking. It is more important than politics or economics in shaping world events<br />
Forrester 05 (Duncan B., Prof of Theology at University of Edinburgh, <em>Apocalypse Now? Reflections on Faithin a time of terror</em>, pg. 36-7)<br />
The point at which … ideology or theory<br />
2NC AT: Perm<br />
Perm can’t solve – the belief that institutions can be transformed ignores the falleness of the world. The tension between law and grace must be preserved to preserve hope of life in a world perfected<br />
Mcthenia 97 (Andrew, Prof of Law at Washington and Lee, Prophet of Justice Prophet of Life, pg. 122-3)<br />
It is not, as some … into and transfiguring history<br />
