<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Across the border of Mexico and the United States, dozens of crosses spot the landscape—people that have lost their lives crossing a “no man’s land.” “</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt">In spots all along the border wall, those who have lost loved ones have been memorializing those who have died while crossing the border. At one of these memorials where the wall reaches the ocean is a tally of the lives that have been lost under Operation Gatekeeper. And a question is posed--&quot;How many more?&quot; Reading the names, ages, and state of origin is a vivid reminder that these aren't statistics--these are individuals. Quite a few of those who died could not be identified, so the listing often reads ‘No Identificado.’”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20Caitlin%20Gray%20%26%20Luis%20Magallon%20Aff%2008.html#_ftn1">[1</a>]</span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"> </span><br />

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The aesthetics within the commemoration of Latinos that have died along the border searching for a refuge away from a homeland shows the mundane forms of empowerment and resistance to marginalization. Our own personal backyard—the border and Los Angeles in particular—are places of borderlands that act as a site of political contestation of larger transnational and global oppressions via commemoration and appeal to our culture as the last remaining marks of self-affirmation. These tactics are a way of holding on to a memory of a lost past. BRADLEY MCDONALD explains… </span><br />

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Across the world and in similar circumstances of displacement, different Palestinian refugees in Lebanon have found themselves in a conflicted reality, seeking refuge in unwelcoming countries including the United States. A hidden invisibility perpetuates their marginalization. The history of exile and continued silencing of Palestinian commemorative politics is at the root of all conflicts where there is complete distrust between displaced Palestinians and their residing countries—the conditions that are legitimized against Palestinians in Lebanon allow for perpetual colonization.

On the contrary, it acts as a spatio-temporal ephemeral moment that seeks to find fulfillment and embrace of the self in relation to the present. The fluidity of these commemorative practices is in itself a transgression for the sake of survival and a constructive engagement with others. Khalili explains… </span><br />

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Specifically, Sumud is a form of commemoration where in the face of annihilation, people are motivated to hang on, whether via protection of neighbors, infrapolitics, restoration of burial sites, rituals, or other practices.

 Framework:<br />
<br />
Debate is about constructive engagement with the oppressed – use your ballot to oppose the wall<br />
<br />
This form of debate is destructive<br />
<br />
C/I – must be based in one of the topic countries and be grounded in literature<br />
<br />
2 impacts:<br />
1. Peacemaking processes leave out culture in political space<br />
2. Psychic injury must be addressed first<br />
<br />
Debate is about praxis and agency – about whether oppressed can or cannot engage the government<br />
<br />
Debate is a form of education – we control uniqueness – communities are excluded from debate<br />
<br />
Not having a plan doesn’t destroy debate – this is the same as border control<br />
<br />
Texts are uniquely bad – creates social dislocation<br />
<br />
Neg has ground – could defend squo, say checkpoints good<br />
<br />
Advocate perm of framework – have to have a multipolarity of strategies<br />
<br />
CP:<br />
<br />
Doesn’t create agency – worse form of deference<br />
<br />
Links to a victimization K<br />
<br />
Conditioning aid links to cap<br />
<br />
Anti – Semitism<br />
<br />
No link<br />
<br />
We aren’t anti-semitism – we say violence occurs against both<br />
<br />
CPW proves – Israeli women who challenge the passports. WE don’t elevate one ideology over another<br />
<br />
Alt is circular – links back to cap K – elevation of a particular identity<br />
<br />
Overlooks borderland people<br />
<br />
Current checkpoints more likely to increase terrorism<br />
<br />
Cap K:<br />
<br />
Wall is the reason cap exists – plan eliminates checkpoints<br />
<br />
Focus on cap is culturally insensitive – overlooks those outside cap<br />
<br />
We can use the aff to break down cap – Zizek concedes<br />
<br />
Intersectionality – alt ignores other forms of oppression which are distinct. The alt prevents us from solving them. Maoism proves a revolution won’t solve.<br />

<h3 id="toc11"><a name="x-Team Name Aff: Fullerton GM-Answers To Major Case Args"></a><em>Answers To Major Case Args</em></h3>
 Solvency args assume oppressed and body as static constructions<br />

Pedagogy is fluid – this allows us to transgress oppression<br />

<h3 id="toc12"><a name="x-Team Name Aff: Fullerton GM-1ar Strategy Notes"></a><em>1ar Strategy Notes</em></h3>
 Cap isn’t the root cause – it can’t explain racist and sexist exploitation<br />
Gibson Graham – capitalism is not monolithic, aff is a better strategy than neg’s totalizing approach<br />
No link to the anti – Semitism argument – don’t elevate one oppressed group over another, adopt a strategy that transcends difference<br />

The U.S.-Mexican border is an open wound where the Third World grates against the first and bleeds. And before a scab forms it hemorrhages again, the lifeblood of two worlds merging to form a third country—a border culture. Borders are set up to define the places that are safe and unsafe, to distinguish <em>us</em> from <em>them</em>. … A borderland is a vague and undetermined place created by the emotional residue of an unnatural boundary. It is in a constant state of transition. The prohibited and forbidden are its inhabitants: the perverse, the queer, the troublesome, the mongrel, the mulatto, the half-breed, the half dead; Do not enter, trespassers will be raped, maimed, strangled, gassed, shot. Ambivalence and unrest reside there and death is no stranger. This is what it’s like to be in the borderlands.<br />
<br />
Similar to the U.S.-Mexican border, the Israel-Palestine wall border is an open wound where the communities grate against barbed wires and bleed. The West Bank wall is a barrier consisting of vehicle-barrier trenches, high-tech surveillance, and concrete linings. Built along the 1949 Armistice line, or “Green Line”, the wall has been creeping into Palestinian territory, and the barrier is said to continue its construction, which was supposed to end in 2005. “In January 2006 there were 471 physical obstacles [checkpoints] placed by the Israeli army on roads … manned by army personnel, through which both vehicles and pedestrians must pass. Currently there are approximately fifty manned checkpoints throughout the West Bank. … New terminals are designed to provide maximal protection to the soldiers. … When the terminals were designed, parental considerations regarding the well-being of the soldiers at the checkpoints gave this issue precedence.”<a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20Caitlin%20Gray%20%26%20Luis%20Magallon%20Aff%2008.html#_ftn1">[1</a>]<br />
<br />
A small group of women who became aware of the expansion and growing significance of the checkpoints…our summary of the Saturday shift, as any other day, is that the soldiers of the Israeli army, stood there according to their nature and the instructions of the day and abused by the Palestinian people because it is Palestinian. That is more or less all.<br />
<br />
The US- Mexican border and the Israel- Palestine barriers’ colonizing agendas are maximized at these checkpoints. The psychic injury that is created by the separation of the wall and the everyday form of humiliation at checkpoints is the biggest impact. Ruchama Marton and Dalit Baym describe the psychological effect that the wall has where splitting is the psychological defense mechanism. It does not reduce the anxiety, only blocks it; it does not enable working through the causes of the anxiety, but just distances them. The physical separation from the wall cretes alienation between the Mexicans Americans and Israelis- Palestinians creating a system of distrust and the erasure of the other’s face in the realm of the local, domestic, foreign and international. Psychic injury through thepsychic splitting is what drives individuals to destroy each other, distrust each other eithin their communities and against their neighbors. Psychic injury propogates the injurious forms in politics in which every form of engagement between indivduals is tainted by distrust, frar, and violent opposition. Our method is not intended to demonize either the Israelis or Palestinians since we recognize that violence occurs against both sides. Our affirmative is not a stance against all borders, the Israeli nation, or a mere criticism of security! Rather, our intention is to recognize the psychic destruction of the invisible border peoples that resulted from the western separation of Israelis and Palestinians, just like we relate to immigrant families in the border of Mexico and the US.<br />
<br />
We believe debate should be about methodologies of the oppressed and constructive engagement with the oppressed by forcing ourselves to utilize our privilege and bodies for successful negotiations. Constrictive engagement entails a more inclusive forum where we challenge the traditional ways of speed reading, line by line, and techne that is utilized by our community. We ask you to utilize your ballot as a collective protest against the wall, similar to the transgressive tactics that the womyn of the CPW embrace; namely, they stand directly in fron of the border agents, protest, distribute survival resources, and strategically utilize their sexualities and bodies This is a borderland ethical and symbolic alignment that is necessary to delegitimize the form of power that is produced by the wall, something that you can embrace within your social location. This year’s resolution allows Luis and I to view debate rounds as a checkpoint where constructive engagement occurs. As a white, privileged young womyn, I engage with Luis’ social location as an un as an undocumented, invisible individual. This is a similarity with the CPW that portrays the potentiality of our method withinj the everyday. Our stance is not solely reliant on the physical destruction of the wall. Rather we believe that it Is more important to take a performative, everyday stance against the violent implementation of the border and checkpoints which is historically used as a mechanism of permit surveillance of peoples at the borders.<br />
<br />
Marc Gopin<br />
<br />
The only way out of that conundrum of fear and violence if a constructive engagement…to each community jeopardizing survival<br />
<br />
<br />
We feel that our form of constructive engagement is most consistent with Chela Sandoval’s process for methodologies of the oppressed in which the oppressed appropriate strategies for self-empowerment to establish a more inclusive forum for real world movements/praxis. Within this framework, Sandoval asks us to question our privilefe by challenging the forms of discourse and education we accumulate- in other words, the kind of education that policy debate produces is taken for granted and merely becomes master signs to observe the world that is occurring around us, making all oppressed groups passive and unintelligible. This is a matter of survival. Jeannette Rodriguez explains:<br />
<br />
Sandoval develops an understanding of what she calls…depend for operation.<br />

This is a similarity with the CPW that portrays the potentiality of our method within the everyday. Our stance is not solely reliant on the physical destruction of the wall. Rather, we believe that it is more important to take a performative, everyday stance against the violent implementation of the border and checkpoints, which is historically used as a mechanism of permit surveillance of peoples at the border. The wall is a product of Western discursive and social relations as it enforces Checkpoints, which is why our exposure of the dangerous social relations is the beginning of the end of the wall.<br />
<br />
The remainder of the framework is the same as previous caselists.<br />

<strong>Round 1 – Fullerton GM vs Wyoming NP</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Fullerton’s aff as reported by Luis:</strong><br />
<br />
We begin with a poem and description of the Mexico/US border by Gloria<br />
Anzaldua that shows how the border has been forcefully constructed in<br />
order to displace entire populations and deem them as the prohibited<br />
and forbidden. The government has created enforcement through<br />
identification documents that are part of a larger system of<br />
exclusion.<br />
<br />
We compare the U.S.-Mexican border to the Israel-Palestine wall<br />
border, which was created by Western powers. The wall constitutes a<br />
shrinking of space that destroys individual resistance via control of<br />
every aspect of people's lives. We read excerpts from an article by<br />
Michael Sorkin (Michael Sorkin, &quot;Introduction: Up Against the Wall,&quot;<br />
Against the Wall).<br />
<br />
We read a narrative by Terry Boullata ( &quot;In the Spirit of Activism,&quot;<br />
Against the Wall.), headmistress of the New Generation Kindergarten<br />
and School in Abu-Dis, that reflects upon the conditions of the<br />
enforcement of the border—mainly, beatings, gassing, and separation of<br />
families.<br />
<br />
We claim that psychic injury that occurs through physical separation<br />
is the biggest impact. Ruchama Marton &amp; Dalit Baum describe the<br />
psychological effect that the wall has where &quot;splitting is the<br />
psychological defense mechanism that separates good from bad, both in<br />
oneself and in the Other.&quot; All violence becomes inevitable in a world<br />
of alienation from the 'other', which occurs through the wall's<br />
separation of people.<br />
<br />
We engage in a framework of methodologies of the oppressed.<br />
<br />
We have an interpretation of constructive engagement as an engagement<br />
with the cultural experiences/subjectivities of Palestinians-Israelis<br />
that were excluded within the Oslo Peace Process (Marc Gopin, Holy<br />
War, Holy Peace: How Religion Can Bring Peace to the Middle East).<br />
<br />
We feel that this is consistent with Chela Sandoval's process for<br />
methodologies of the oppressed in which the oppressed create their own<br />
strategies to end their marginalization. This guarantees<br />
intelligibility of the oppressed, as well as strategies for their<br />
survival.<br />

THE WALL DEBATE<br />
<br />
<br />
*the wall is constructed during the 1AC and progressively taken down as the debate progresses*<br />
<br />
Fullerton 1AC<br />
<br />
US Mexican border lies as an open wound and creates a “border culture” between two worlds<br />
<br />
This border culture is a vague and undetermined place which is always in a constant state of transition that establishes one side as aliens, creating a “Do Not Enter” mentality and tension<br />
<br />
This conflict is reflected in the Israel Palestinian border – Israel is not to blame but rather the Western Powers are to blame<br />
<br />
Construction of the wall is to continue even though it was supposed to cease in 2005<br />
<br />
This all leads to forced biopolitics where the state can invade lives at any time, by sectioning people off by the wall they have total control over the body<br />
<br />
*Evidence – Israel searches at any time, creates roadblocks, divides and sections off life, people have to jump the walls to live and get my, everyone is subject to this oppression, students and the elderly alike have to jump to get by<br />
<br />
Colonizing agendas of those in power, supposed to be justified by security for one side, marks failed policy and power relations, this leads to psychological impacts which are the biggest impacts in the round<br />
<br />
Walls create a psychological split through both countries and the self, cordoning off Good and Evil where the evil can be separated and eliminated<br />
<br />
This leads to alienation which creates distrust at all levels, the self, local, state, national gov etc.<br />
<br />
The psychological split propagates the injurious form of policy that results in violence against an other<br />
<br />
To fight the wall we must recognize the border and the psychological split and in turn recognize our bodies as forms to be utlilized as a collective protest against the wall, this is necessary to delegitimize the power formed by the wall<br />
<br />
Our protest must not be directed at the wall itself but rather at the violent imposition and enforcement of the wall on others<br />
<br />
The enforcement of the wall creates elitism which is perpetuated in the peace process, the only way to avoid that elitism is to engage culture<br />
<br />
Thus we use the methodologies of the oppressed to engage culture and question our priveledge<br />
<br />
The education from Policy Debate is taken for granted and we must theorize within the constructs of the wall<br />
<br />
CROSS-X<br />
They aff has no plan, the ballot is an alignment with Aff methodology that PA wall is bad, and we can use our bodies as a protest<br />
<br />
Don’t defend all borders as being bad only the PA wall<br />
<br />
Constructive Eng means we have to engage culture<br />
<br />
2AC AT Framework and T<br />
<br />
The ballot is an ethical protest to the wall, we constructively engage by using our bodies, while we build walls to make interaction harsh and difficult we can take the walls down<br />
<br />
The neg framework excludes the people in between, uses the wall as an apartheid<br />
<br />
Our ethics involve placing ourselves at the border<br />
<br />
Stable borders will never exist so there is no impact to globalization, globalization is not real<br />
<br />
Wall is useless in creating security for terrorism, wall itself leads to violence<br />
<br />
The psychic industry must be addressed first<br />
<br />
Methodology of the oppressed is our framework, unanswered by the neg, not Methodology FOR the oppressed<br />
<br />
Focus on “spectacular” claims of violence, ie impacts of the DA, ignores the systemic and real harms in the aff<br />
<br />
Neg education does not lead to liberalization and is anti-democratic<br />
<br />
Lack of plan text does not limit engagement, writing a text carries a racist ideology, text takes time, money, and resources that some people don’t have, a text tells us psychologically that we are not good enough<br />
<br />
Without resisting traditional limits we become subject to the wall and oppression<br />
<br />
Opressed cannot switch places with the oppressor<br />
Switch side debate is a form of assimilation<br />
<br />
As long as the wall exists, neg impacts are meaningless<br />
<br />
We can perm and combine both frameworks, the neg framework does not allow for this<br />
