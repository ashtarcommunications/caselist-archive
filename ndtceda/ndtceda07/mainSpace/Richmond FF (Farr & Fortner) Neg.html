 Round 7, UNT<br />
NEG v. OU CY<br />
Judge: Cram-Helwich<br />
<br />
A. The 1AC depictions of Middle Eastern crises are rooted in a Western &quot;expert knowledge&quot; of the Middle East -- their claims to rational truth naturalize and reinforce power relations and are founded in assumptions that make domination inevitable<br />
<br />
Munif, '6 (Yasser, Vol. 6, Summer 2006, The MIT Electronic Journal of Middle East Studies, &quot;Media is The Continuation of War by Other Means&quot;)<br />
As Edward Said argues, ... foundations of European modernity.<br />
<br />
B. This outweighs and turns the case - the knowledge apparatus of Western policy thinking is the root cause of Middle East instability and makes global extinction inevitable<br />
<br />
Bilgin, '5 (Pinar, Regional Security in the Middle East: A Critical Perspective, pg. 164-5)<br />
Thinking about the future ... in the Middle East.<br />
<br />
C. Our alternative is to vote negative to reject traditional practices of Middle East analysis<br />
<br />
Bilgin, '5 (same, pg. 58)<br />
Emphasizing the mutually interactive ... the subject of research (Wyn Jones 1999:148-150)<br />
<br />
D. The role of the ballot is to interrogate assumptions about the Middle East -- this must precede material analysis of the plan's effects<br />
<br />
Bilgin, '5 (same, pg. 58)<br />
This leads me to ... also in 'word politics' (Bilgin 2000-1).
