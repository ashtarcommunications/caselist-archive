<br />
<strong>“Regime Change” CP:</strong><br />
The USFG should cease any current for planned engagement with Iran and appoint an Iran coordinator to oversee the substantial expansion of US internal regime change efforts within Iran, including replacing Radio Farda’s popular music programming with strategic communications assistance to dissident groups within Iran, and disseminating information within Iran about constitutional change.<br />
<br />
The CP spurs institutional change in Iran. Groves 3-26(?)-06, lexis, steven, heritage foundation reports, “the Iranian constitution is a cancer that must be excised….. to widen the potential audience.”<br />
<br />
Funding strategic communication has a strong history of success- cold war proves wimbush 07 (enders, 1/31, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/110/wim013101.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/110/wim013101.htm</a>) “Radio Farda’s confusion is elementary… pumped out popular music.”<br />
<br />
CP will bolster youth movement and spur democracy Fakhravar 06 (amir, 7/20, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hsgac.senate.gov/_files/072006Fakravar.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://hsgac.senate.gov/_files/072006Fakravar.pdf</a>) “we, the Iranian youth and students, have shown that we have great power…. See the need for regime change.”<br />
<br />
Regime change can happen- further loss of cred is the tipping point taheri 06 (amir, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/cm/main/viewArticle.html?id=10134" rel="nofollow">http://www.commentarymagazine.com/cm/main/viewArticle.html?id=10134</a>) “but- some might object- even granting the virtue of the idea…Mustadafeen (“Mobilization of the Dispossessed”) “<br />
