I believe all the other stuff was updated on the case list itself by the other scout, but below are the cap cites<br />
<br />
A. Attemps to remedy specific forms of oppression naturalize experience as a prerequisite for activism and perpetuate isolated, molecular politics obscuring the commonality of capitalist exploitation.<br />
Ebert, 96 (Theresa L., Ludic Feminism and After, p 118-119)<br />
Post-al politics...for the other<br />
<br />
B. Particular demands against oppressive state practives are revolution without a revolution- single issue political organization lacks concrete universality, allowing it to be absorbed and reinforce capitalist forces without leveraging radical change.<br />
Zizek, 02 (Slavoj, Revolution at the Gates, p 296-302)<br />
So the struggle ahead...democratic institutions.<br />
<br />
C. Capitalism is a ruthless system of economis expansion- it instrumentalizes the gains of the affirmative and makes racism, sexism, miltiarism, environmental destruction and eventually planetary extinction inevitable.<br />
Dyer- Witheford, 99 (Nick, Cyber-Marx, p 9-12)<br />
The result of this critique...of the solution<br />
<br />
D. We advocate a universal opposition to capitalism- grounding political resistance in universality and demanding what is currently seen as impossible refuses liberal reformist blackmail and opens the possibility for alternatives to capitalism to emerge.<br />
Zizek, 2K (Slavoj, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, 325-6)<br />
Today, however, the relationship...so be it<br />

Round # 6<br />
<br />
Vs Team: Oklahoma GW<br />
<br />
Judge:<br />
<br />
Case Args:<br />
<br />
Consequences matter<br />
<br />
The tunnel vision of moral absolutism generates evil and political irrelevance<br />
<br />
Isaac 2002 (Dissent, Spring, v49, n2, ProQuest)<br />
<br />
“an unyielding concern…undermines political effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Our ethic of consequences enables political responsibility and freedom – their framework cannot be projected onto the entire world w/o denying the reality of politicvs and human limitation<br />
<br />
Williams, 2005 (The realist tradition and the limits of International Relations, p 174-176)<br />
<br />
“A commitment to an ethic…and imperative toward, responsibility.”<br />
<br />
Maximizing lives is the only way to affirm equal and unconditional human dignity<br />
<br />
Cummiskey, 1996 (Kantian Consequentialism, 145-146)<br />
<br />
“We must not obscure the issue…some to save many.”<br />
<br />
Can’t escape calculative thought<br />
<br />
Buckley, 1996 (“Rationality and responsibility in Heidegger’s and Husserl’s View of Technology” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ulla.mcgill.ca/arts150/arts150r3.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://ulla.mcgill.ca/arts150/arts150r3.htm)</a><br />
<br />
“At the root of Heidegger’s…thought as Gelassenheit.”<br />
<br />
Calculation stops the zero point by increasing diversity and social limitation. Failure of the alt increases violence and exclusion<br />
<br />
Williams, 2005 (The realist tradition and the limits of International Relations, p 165-166)<br />
<br />
“Yet it is my claim…the same old dichotomies.”<br />
<br />
Suffering is life-denying and demands action. Minimizing injustice and suffering is intrinsically good. It affirms humanity and allows people the choice to reach their own understanding of life.<br />
<br />
Smolkin, 1989 (Understanding Pain: Interpretation and Philosophy, p 74-79)<br />
<br />
“Albert Camus, the final…to die in a happy city.”<br />
<br />
Heidegger’s K, grounded in the language of German Existentialism, creates a jargon of authenticity – this mythical language refers not to historical, actual structures of oppression, but only to ideal linguistic concepts – it masks political and social structures of violence and makes oppression inevitable<br />
<br />
Schroyer, 1973 (The Jargon of Authenticity, p xiii-xvi)<br />
<br />
“In The Jargon of Authenticity…political-economic framework of society.”<br />
<br />
The concept of “being” is the ultimate link to the K of jargon – elevated beyond concrete understandings , which masks hidden contradictions within philosophical thought and creates an addiction to empty rhetoric<br />
<br />
Adorno, 1973 (The Jargon of Authenticity, p 9-13)<br />
<br />
“The fact that the words…by its favorite philosophy.”<br />
<br />
Buzzwords like “enframing of being” are empty of any concrete meaning within the context of modern technology – attempts to divorce tech from social context dooms the K to failure<br />
<br />
Feenberg, 2000 (From Essentialism to Constructivism: Philosophy of Technology at the Crossroads, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www-rohan.sdsu/edu/faculty/feenberg/talk4.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www-rohan.sdsu/edu/faculty/feenberg/talk4.htm)</a><br />
<br />
“Heidegger and Habermas…with the modern and the technical?”<br />
<br />
Ontology is useless philosophical narrative condemning actual people to death<br />
<br />
Caputo, 2003 (Against Ethics, p 70)<br />
<br />
“That would mean you…for remembering proper names.”<br />
<br />
Focusing on ontology fails<br />
<br />
Thiele, 2003 (Foucault and Heidegger: Critical Encounters, p 229)<br />
<br />
“At the same time…discovered in the Volk.”<br />
<br />
Existence is a prereq<br />
<br />
Wapner, 2003 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dissentmagazine.org/menutest/articles/wi03/wapner.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.dissentmagazine.org/menutest/articles/wi03/wapner.htm)</a><br />
<br />
“The third response…of environmental protection.”<br />
<br />
Ontological focus forever delays political action<br />
<br />
Jarvis, 2000 (International Relations and the Challenge of Postmodernism, p 139-140)<br />
<br />
“This we might interpret…global in character.”<br />
<br />
Ontological focus kills policy analysis needed to confront global challenges – the trade-off is real and ongoing in IR<br />
<br />
Jarvis, 2000 (International Relations and the Challenge of Postmodernism, p 2)<br />
<br />
“While Hoffman might…form of scholarship.”<br />
<br />
Turn – total rejection makes the alt a dissent IR and reproduces sovereignty and exploitation<br />
<br />
Agathangelou and Ling, 1997 (Studies in Political Economy, v54, Fall p 7-8)<br />
<br />
“Yet, ironically if not tragically…theory from problem-solving.”<br />
<br />
Their K takes the language of “being” as gospel and ignores all of the other ways of being in the world and modern political reality<br />
<br />
Yar, 2000 (Cultural Values, v4, no.1)<br />
<br />
“The first and perhaps most…being characteristic of society.”<br />
<br />
Ontological pluralism is the best option – the alt lapses into perpetual inaction<br />
<br />
Fearon and Wendt, 2002 (Handbook of International Relations, p 53)<br />
<br />
“It is important to…ontological pluralism instead.”<br />
<br />
Only the neg forgets Being when they engage in a totalizing account of technologization – abandoning empiricism and the traditional sciences is the fastes path to their impacts<br />
<br />
Latour, 1993 (We Have Never Been Modern, p 65-67)<br />
<br />
“Who has forgotten Being?... ‘Einai gar kai entautha theous.’”<br />
<br />
Alternative cannot solve their links – cedes the battle to destructive hyper-capitalism that their links and impacts identify<br />
<br />
Graham, 1999 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.philgraham.net/HH_conf.pdf%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.philgraham.net/HH_conf.pdf)</a><br />
<br />
“Societies should get worried…the least of all worries.”<br />
<br />
Heidegger’s silence on the Holocaust warrants rejection<br />
<br />
Lang, 1996 (Heidegger’s Silence, p13-15)<br />
<br />
“There was then …(including his own).”<br />
<br />
Heidegger was a Nazi<br />
<br />
Lyotard, 1990 (Heidegger and “the jews” p 52)<br />
<br />
“Second, one must admit…A leaden silence.”<br />
<br />
Heidegger’s Nazism wasn’t a personal error, but as a result of his elevation of ontology – the K is complicit with the worst crimes against humanity<br />
<br />
Zizek, 1999 (The Ticklish Subject, p 13-14)<br />
<br />
“As Heidegger himself…Nazi political engagement.”<br />
<br />
Our method of arg enables challenges to normalizing and monological belief systems<br />
<br />
Risse, 2000 (‘Let’s Argue!’: Communicative Action in World Politics, p 1-2)<br />
<br />
“The controversy between…accused of norm violation.”<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
<br />
Framework<br />
<br />
Framework is good<br />
<br />
Keenan, 1998 (Theory and Event, Project Muse)<br />
<br />
“The anti-political nature of guilt…dreariness of political action.”<br />
<br />
Anti-Politics – The negative’s retreat from politics dooms their ability to change the world – it creates atrocity and causes a vacuum that gets filled by the right<br />
<br />
Boggs, 1997 (Theory and Society 26: 741-780)<br />
<br />
“The false sense of empowerment…vanished from civil society.”<br />
<br />
Because politics is currently screwed, we need a POLITICAL realm to capitalize upon its failings. They give up on that, and we save it<br />
<br />
Boggs, 1997 (Theory and Society 26: 741-780)<br />
<br />
“So it follows that…early twenty-first century.”<br />
<br />
Role playing is key to active engagement in political discourse<br />
<br />
Joyner 99<br />
<br />
“By assessing the role of international law…to fit the merits of their case.”<br />
<br />
Effective politics requires judgment and limits – expanding what counts as political is bad when at the expense of argumentative norms<br />
<br />
Shively, 2000 (Political theory and Partisan Politics, p 186)<br />
<br />
“To sum up the argument…political contest require these judgments.”<br />
<br />
Defending the rez is key to fair debate and effective engagement. Rez learning is good. Rez focus is key to predict and prepare to debate – their framework makes debate impossible<br />
<br />
Shively, 2000 (Political theory and Partisan Politics, p 181-182)<br />
<br />
“This means, first, that…basic agreement or harmony.”<br />
<br />
Unlimited advocacy collapses into conservatism – our attempt to limit the discussion in a fair way enables productive political contestation and true revolutionary advocacies. Refusal to exclude anything means their framework is self-defeating<br />
<br />
Shively, 2000 (Political theory and Partisan Politics, p 180-181)<br />
<br />
“Thus far, I have argued…those who reject civility and democracy.”<br />

Stats bad<br />
<br />
Focus on statistics ignores its inherently political nature – stat s were created and used to justify domination<br />
<br />

<br />
“The scientific method is a ……… paradigms of domination.”<br />
<br />

<br />
They’re wrong – statistics are inherently tied to the politics that motivate them – they can never be objective<br />
<br />
Hughes 1995 “Women’s Studies International Forum” pp 396 – 397<br />
<br />
“It is impossible to separate…….as regression analysis.”<br />
<br />
The drive for stats is basis for otherization – ends in methodology is genocide<br />
