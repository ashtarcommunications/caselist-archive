 <br />
When the U.S. claimed ‘you’re with us or the terrorists’ it did NOT establish the permanent binary that most people assumed – rather, the project of dividing the globe into states who comply with the U.S.-led global order and those who don’t is an active and mobile one. U.S. diplomatic engagement with states in the Middle East is pursued under the rubric of simultaneously cementing our domination of the globe and clearly establishing those who reject our engagement as targets for legitimate annihilation.<br />
David Campbell, Professor of Geography at the University of Durham, et. al., (Alison J. Williams, Post-Doctoral Research Associate in the International Boundaries Research Unit in the Department of Geography at Durham University; Luiza Bialasiewicz, Professor of Geography at Royal Halloway University, London; Stuart Elden, Professor of Geography at Durham; Alex Jeffrey, Professor of Geography, Politics &amp; Sociology at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne; Stephen Graham, Professor of Geography at Durham), 2007, Political Geography, Vol. 26, p. 415-416<br />
As we argue … United States and Europe (Bush, 2005).<br />
<br />
States who face the prospect of U.S. engagement have two choices – assimilate to the global liberal order or face annihilation – it doesn’t matter that the plan warms relations or provides concessions to <u>- bringing</u> _ into the fold today merely paves the way for war against ‘our’ remaining enemies tomorrow – the impact is perpetual war on a global scale.<br />
