<br />
First the new budget has massively increased aid to Afghanistan<br />

contention 2 is inherency<br />
<br />
1st the US is not adequaetely funding archaeological site protection in Afghanistan, this leads to widespread obliteration of cultural artifacts<br />

3rd looting of sites is rampant and continues<br />

looters are still ransacking the treasures…..and it continues,” he said<br />
<br />
<br />
C3 is the harm<br />
Subpoint A is culture<br />
<br />
1st the security of afghan archaeological sites is inadequate. Their destruction threatens afghan and global cultural heritage. The US has a unique obligation to aid Afghanistan<br />

Waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=printfriendly&amp;id=3339<br />
As executive director of the premiere North American organization……and our own cultural heritage<br />
<br />
2nd afghan is the crossroads of asia and the middle east. This location renders afghan artifacts as irreplaceable monuments to disparate cultures in the history of human civilization<br />

Afghanistan’s strategic position at the junction of china, India…..was destroyed is irreplaceable.<br />

This puts the cultural heritage of all humanity at state<br />

Pg 272<br />
Today Afghanistan needs food, doctors….forgotten and abandoned country<br />
<br />
Finaly the impact transcends any discanvantages. Because our mortality is assured the destruction of cultural heritage is uniquely egregious because it marks death upon our very being as a collective species in both the past and the future<br />

Subpoitn B is afghan stability<br />
<br />
Two scenarios<br />
First is govt stability<br />
Initially Afghanistan is on the brink of collapse, necessitating a strengthened government<br />

Thus we propose the plan:<br />
The United States federal government should increase its constructive engagement with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by substantially increasing foreign assistance to provide training and funding to deploy and pay 500 guards to protect archaeological sites in Afghanistan, so long as the government of Afghanistan agrees to allow the guards to also undergo human rights training.<br />
