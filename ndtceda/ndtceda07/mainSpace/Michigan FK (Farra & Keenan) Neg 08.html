Security guarantees are issued … a non-use obliation.<br />
Security guarantees are legally binding commitments like NATO – assurances are only pledges and not legally binding<br />
National Academy of Sciences, 1997, the future of U.S. nuclear weapons policy, p. 52-53<br />
There are two basic types … under its umbrella.<br />
Vote negative<br />
1. Core negative groun d- binding guarantees are key to core negative ground like diplomatic capital, alliance credibility, disadvantages based on diplomatic credibility and counterplans to not use legally binding.<br />
2/ Prevent topic explosion – allowing non-binding promises means an exponentially large number of possible agreement mechanisms – specific mechanism advantages ensure the neg will always play catchup on possible new ff impacts.<br />
3. Potential abuse is a voter<br />

You might remember the…truth about Palestine.<br />
