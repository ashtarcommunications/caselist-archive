Landmines 1AC (pg. 1 of 11)Observation 1: Current efforts to de-mine Afghanistan are woefully inadequate:Afghanistan is one of the heaviest mined countries in the world—it hasthe world's third highest death rate from land-mines on the planet:<br />
Reuters Foundation, September 17, 2007(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LRON-775ATL?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LRON-775ATL?OpenDocument</a>)<br />
Afghanistan is one of the heaviest mined countries in the world...since the beginning of 2005.<br />
<br />
The problem is that current de-mining efforts in Afghanistan areplagued by antiquated technology—the lack of funding for advancedde-mining technology makes existing efforts almost completelyineffective:<br />
The Rand Corporation, 2003 (February 18, 2003,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rand.org/news/press.03/02.18.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rand.org/news/press.03/02.18.html</a>)<br />
It could take about 450 years...by far the greatest limitation of the process.<br />
Therefore, we offer the following plan:<br />
The United States federal government should increase its constructiveengagement with the government of Afghanistan by offering thegovernment of Afghanistan $50 million for high-technology de-miningequipment modeled after the AN/PSS 14 Handheld Standoff Mine DetectionSystem, if the government of Afghanistan agrees to employhigh-technology de-mining equipment in de-mining efforts. Questions,please ask.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 is civilian lives:Mines have killed or injured over 150,000 people in Afghanistan &amp;threaten more every day:<br />
Relief Web, 8/30/2007(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/SHES-76KKDC?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/SHES-76KKDC?OpenDocument</a>)<br />
In the last 18 years... for disabled and martyrs affairs.<br />
Despite current demining efforts, Afghanistan is one of the world'sheaviest mined countries in the world—the mines kill people everysingle day:<br />
Afghan Network 2006 (&quot;Afghanistan: Landmine Fact Sheet&quot; Oct 12,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/" rel="nofollow">http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/</a>)<br />
&quot;Afghanistan has suffered greatly... die due to lack of medical facilities.&quot;<br />
We have a unique moral obligation to protect innocent life that isdirectly threatened—more immediate and direct threats to innocent lifeshould be privileged over highly implausible scenarios like nuclearwar:<br />
David Oki Ahearn, &amp; Peter R. Gathje, 2005 (Doing Right and Being Good, pg. 255)<br />
Not every moral issue undermines... genocide or other intentionaltaking of noncombatant life morally permissible.<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 is development:Landmines in Afghanistan uniquely undermine development:<br />
Human Rights Watch Backgrounder, 2001(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/arms/landmines-bck1011.htm,%20October2001" rel="nofollow">http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/arms/landmines-bck1011.htm, October 2001</a>)<br />
Landmines in Afghanistan... Even the capital, Kabul, is mine-affected.<br />
Failure to clear landmines prevents people from developing vastamounts of Afghanistan:<br />
Tayler, Newsday Reporter, 2002 (Letta, January,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.banminesusa.org/news/983_afghan/983_1_16_02d.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.banminesusa.org/news/983_afghan/983_1_16_02d.html</a>)<br />
&quot;Although the war is over... burrowed throughout this country the sizeof Texas, Karim said.&quot;<br />
<br />
Development &amp; prosperity in Afghanistan is key to decreasing terrorism:<br />
Los Angeles Times, August 27, 2007 (Home Edition, SECTION: MAIN NEWS;bad desk code; Editorial_pages Desk; Part A; Pg. 14, Lexis)<br />
&quot;The United States can... to try harder.&quot;<br />
Terrorism threatens civilization itself<br />
Yonah Alexander, August 28, 2003 (Inter-University for TerrorismStudies Director and<br />
Professor, WASHINGTON TIMES, p. A20) Lexis<br />
&quot;Last week's brutal suicide bombings...national, regional and globalsecurity concerns.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 3 is poverty:Landmines cause poverty:<br />
Lincoln Bloomfield, 2/13/2004 (U.S. Special Representative to thePresident and Secretary of State for Mine Action Africa News,2/13/2004, Lexis)<br />
Persistent landmines...desperation, and regional instability.<br />
Poverty is the equivalent to a thermonuclear war between Russia andthe US ­ this systemic impact is bigger and more probable than any war<br />
James Gilligan, Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School,2000 edition, Violence: Reflections on Our Deadliest Epidemic, p.195-196<br />
The 14 to 18 million deaths... throughout the world.<br />
Observation 2: SolvencyA major research &amp; development program is necessary to accelerateefforts to improve technology for demining:<br />
The Rand Corporation, 2003 (February 18, 2003,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rand.org/news/press.03/02.18.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rand.org/news/press.03/02.18.html</a>)<br />
A major research and development program costing about $50million...according to a RAND report issued today.<br />
The US is key because it has access to the HSTAMIDS system—this systemmassively speeds up demining efforts:<br />
Skillings, , 2006 (Staff Writer for CNET Jonathan, &quot;High Tech's Slowmarch in Landmine Campaign,&quot;)<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.news.com/High-techs-slow-march-in-land-mine-campaign---page-2/2100-1008_3-6092261-2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.news.com/High-techs-slow-march-in-land-mine-campaign---page-2/2100-1008_3-6092261-2.html</a><br />
&quot;One tool that is helping to distinguish... the U.N.'s Mulliner said.&quot;<br />
The HSTAMIDS technology improves demining efficiency by 645% in Afghanistan:<br />
Doheny 2006 (Robert, Deputy of US Humantiarian Mine Action Program, August 29)<br />
&quot;HSTAMIDS performed equally well...which projects to a 645% increasein productivity.&quot;<br />
High-technology solutions will be embraced in Afghanistan—there is noreason Afghanistan won't say yes to the plan:<br />
Jennifer Brennan, 2003(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rdecom.army.mil/rdemagazine/200311/itf_cerdec_landmines.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rdecom.army.mil/rdemagazine/200311/itf_cerdec_landmines.html</a>)<br />
Minelab F1A4, a commercial, off-the shelf device...&quot;They love it,&quot; hesaid. &quot;It's a lot more reliable in detecting mines and they have a lotof confidence in the systems.&quot;<br />
The United States is key because solutions to the landmines crisisdepend on sustained engagement and leadership by the United States:<br />
SEN. PATRICK LEAHY, 2006 (States News Service, August 1, 2006; Lexis)<br />
I want to emphasize...significantly to the benefit of our troops andthe innocent.<br />
<br />
The US is key because it has vast expertise in demining: it hasassisted with 36 countries:<br />
John D. Holum, 2000 (Department of State, To Walk the Earth in Safety:The United States Commitment to Humanitarian Demining Policy PapersJuly, 2000)<br />
The U.S. Government has now approved programs... Leahy War Victims Fund.)<br />
The US has a unique moral responsibility to take a leading role inmine clean-up efforts:<br />
San Jose Mercury News, 1999 (November 12, 1999; Lexis)<br />
Shamefully, the Clinton administration...The task is enormous, and theneed is pressing.<br />
And, focusing on Afghan demining bolsters international demining efforts:<br />
Joe Lokey, Deputy Director, MAIC, accessed 2007(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://maic.jmu.edu/JOURNAL/5.3/features/joe_lokey/joe_lokey.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maic.jmu.edu/JOURNAL/5.3/features/joe_lokey/joe_lokey.htm</a>)<br />
However, in many other ways... in all mine-plagued countries around the world.<br />
And their disads are hopelessly non-unique: The House and Senate havepassed a continuing resolution guaranteeing billions in aid toAfghanistan in the status quo:<br />
Leys 10/7/2007 (Jeff, &quot;Iraq-Afghanistan War Spending: LegislativeUpdate&quot;, 10/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://vcnv.org/iraq-afghanistan-war-spending-legislative-update-oct-7-2007" rel="nofollow">http://vcnv.org/iraq-afghanistan-war-spending-legislative-update-oct-7-2007</a>)<br />
