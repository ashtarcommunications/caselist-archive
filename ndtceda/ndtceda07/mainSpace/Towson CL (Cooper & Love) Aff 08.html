Play <em>Freedom Time</em><br />
<br />
Like Lauren says its freedom time<br />
This is a war with the mind over territory<br />
Where we at war with the psychological destruction to defer to norms and<br />
Procedures of traditional debate<br />
Never taught to engage in liberation as an escape<br />
<br />
Who will dominate the opinion the oppressor or the people<br />
Holding us to the imprisonment of the topic’s steeple<br />
We need to resist the systemic depravity<br />
Before its spread to all of humanity<br />
<br />
Debate teaching us to defend America as the exception<br />
Assimilating us to a Eurocentric cultural deception<br />
Leaving us with self hatred and lack of true self perception<br />
<br />
We need to Engage in strategies that defy the imperial eye<br />
See when the truth comes we are taught not to hear it<br />
And this activity tells us to fear it…<br />
But we need to defer to our own self-determined spirit.<br />
<br />
Dayvon and I believe Debate should be about the liberation of the oppressed and changing conditions of oppression that exist in society<br />
Our framework is who best engages in a consistent practice and advocacy that advances the liberation of the oppressed.<br />
<br />
The U.S.’s current conception of constructive engagement has been one that has had detrimental effects on the Palestinians. Specicially, the lop sided media coverage about the Palestinians.<br />
American Muslim Society, “From Violence to Constructive Engagement,” Dec 2006<br />
<br />
The popular narrative regarding…of the Palestinian people.<br />
<br />
The relationship that exists between U.S. and countries of color is one of the master and slave<br />
Through the topic we are forced to use the same mechanisms of the U.S. to maintain the master slave relationship such as Constructive engagement.<br />
This paternalistic attitude is one that is imperialist, patriarchal, and privileged that becomes exported to the broader society<br />
Bell Hooks, Professor at Berea College, 2004 (In The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love)<br />
<br />
Writing about the connection…women and children.<br />
<br />
This Debate activity is a system that’s threatening the viability for liberation of people of color just like a lot of higher learning institutions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shelton K. Hill Goes deeper into this issue with his study of African Americans in debate where he concludes that<br />
<br />
For African American competitors, debate…for parting from the group.<br />
<br />
We must align ourselves with the struggle against white supremacy and racism we must engage in race talk<br />
<br />
The time for a counter hegemonic “race talk” is now<br />
Hooks, ’95 (Bell, “Killing Rage Ending Racism,” p. 5-6)<br />
<br />
Overt racist discrimination is not…our voices now.<br />
<br />
Without the process of actualization in this community of the racist and imperialist views we harness in this activity they will be exported larger society<br />
William Spanos in Joe Miller’s book Cross-ex (p. 467) speaks about this as well<br />
<br />
I am very much aware…world must occur<br />
<br />
You as a judge(s) must act now to create the possibility for forensic multicultural evolution to be strengthened, inability to move beyond a state of stasis risks extinction of our community<br />

<br />
It has been argued…or risk extinction.<br />
<br />
We must be the subjects of our educational process if we want to transform the world around us this includes debate<br />

This Debate activity is a system that’s threatening the viability for liberation of people of color just like a lot of higher learning institutions<br />
<br />
We find solidarity as black people to the Palestinian people<br />
and their plight (draws connections)<br />
<br />
Friere in Pedagogy of the oppressed says we need to be<br />
subjects and not objects<br />
of our education...debate becomes that space to claim<br />
subjectivity<br />
<br />
In order to engage debate in a pluralistic manner that engages people of color and allow us to engage in debate as a pedagogical tool of empowerment for all people<br />
The Ceda/Ndt Community should orient its intellectual work to challenge all forms of domination in all of our discussion, particularly the traditional notions and concepts of US constructive engagement.<br />
<br />
THE TIME FOR A COUNTER HEGEMONIC “RACE TALK” IS NOW<br />
hooks English Proessor @ City College NY 95<br />
Engaging in debate this way means critically examining the topic from our social location and embracing alternative forms of knowledge construction such as hip-hop and personal experience<br />
This allows us to understand how Americans come to interact and formulate policies that are viewed with hostility by people of color.<br />

 Plan: We demand that the USFG constructivley engage<br />
the Palestinian authority by publicly acknowledging<br />
the pain of people of color throughout the world,<br />
particularily the pain that it has been complicit in<br />
inflicting on Palestinians. This would also include a<br />
vow not to be complicit with, or engage in acts of<br />
aggression against the palestinian people, including<br />
an end to financial and political support of israel.<br />
<br />
We make parallels between the black community in the<br />
US and Palestine.<br />
<br />
We claim to fight white supremacy and imperialism.<br />
