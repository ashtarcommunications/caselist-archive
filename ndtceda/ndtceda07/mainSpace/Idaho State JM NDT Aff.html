 <strong>The 1AC is a story about the US governments relationship with Israel.</strong><br />
<strong>Similar to story on wiki.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Part 1 – Special relationship</strong><br />
<strong>Explaining the relationship with the US and Israel</strong><br />
<br />
View of others = root cause of war<br />
“Derek Gregory, the colonial present, pp 19-20<br />
“more than a rational calculation of interests takes us to war… imagine and speak of others”<br />
<br />
Cultures are fake<br />
Shapiro, same<br />
“unified and fixed national cultures are inventions… only dangerous ways of fixing culture”<br />
<br />
Culture = war<br />
Shapiro Cinematic Political thought: narrating race, nation, and gender, pg. 66<br />
“the culture of a country… even fragile”<br />
<br />
Relationship with Israel<br />
Mearshimer, the Israel lobby and US foreigh policy, 25- 28<br />
<br />
<strong>Part 2 – Twilight of Idols</strong><br />
<strong>USFG = judge in American Idol judging topic countries and Israel. When asked for his vote reads the resolution, therefore rejecting Israel.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Part 3 Denouement</strong><br />
We must understand Israel and America in a historical montage mutually constituting each other with mythic nationalist stories, we must counter these stories<br />
<strong>Shapiro same, pg 65-66</strong><br />
“A primary sustaining mechanism of the American national…national stories that construct the culturally dangerous alien other.”<br />

 No link – we critique all forms of oppression<br />
No reason our method is bad – Link of omission at best<br />
Permutation do both solves – talking in debate format key<br />
Focus on white supremacy creates a new dominant narrative<br />
Stories solve the impact of white supremacy<br />
