Observation 1:  The Issues at Hand<br />
Modern agriculture is dominated by mechanized industry such as concentrated animal feed operations<br />
Ibrahim 2007<br />
(Darian, Associate Professor, University of Arizona, A RETURN TO DESCARTES: PROPERTY, PROFIT, AND THE CORPORATE OWNERSHIP OF ANIMALS, 70 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 89, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?70+Law+&amp;+Contemp.+Probs.+89+(winter+2007" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?70+Law+&amp;+Contemp.+Probs.+89+(winter+2007</a>))<br />
<br />
Animals aren’t machines; they deserve the right to live<br />
Harold D. Guither 1998<br />
(“Animal Rights: History and Scope of a Radical Social Movement”,  Southern Illinois University Press, Questia)<br />
<br />
Factory farms practices are legally “inhumane”<br />
Environment News Service – 2008 <br />
(“New Jersey Court Rules Factory Farm Practices Not Humane”, 7/31/2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2008/2008-07-31-093.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2008/2008-07-31-093.asp</a>)<br />
<br />
Government subsidies encourage abusive factory farm practices<br />

<br />
<br />
PLAN: <br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations by eliminating all subsides. <br />
Advantage 1:  Disease<br />
The horrifyingly unhealthy practices of Factory Farming accelerates the spread of disease and hinders growth, which means that the animals in CAFOs are fed perpetual, unnecessary doses of antibiotics.<br />
HFA 2007<br />
(HFA 2007 “Factory Farming” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hfa.org/factory/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hfa.org/factory/index.html</a> Humane Farming Association, Founded in 1985, has over 190,000 members. In 1991, HFA created the Humane Farming Action Fund (HFAF), the nation's only political lobbying organization founded to protect farm animals.)<br />
<br />
CAFOs in the US are breeding hyper-resistant strains of bacteria that are immune to nearly all medicine. Workers at CAFOs are over 30 times as likely to get infected as other people.<br />
Robinson 2007<br />
(Robinson, John December 11, 2007 “Gov. Blunt Overlooks CAFOs as Superbug Threat” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.protectparks.org/Superbug.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.protectparks.org/Superbug.pdf</a> (Robinson is former director of the Missouri Division of Tourism)<br />
<br />
Superbugs will cause human extinction.<br />
BBC 1999<br />
(BBC 23rd November 1999 “Extinction Level Events” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A207415" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A207415</a>)<br />
<br />
Observation 2:  How We Help<br />
We must reevaluate our ethical relationship with those we eat; the current framework of moral regulation creates a soulless world of rational calculation<br />
SMITH 2002<br />
Mick, Division of Sociology, University of Abertay, The ‘Ethical’ Space of the Abattoir: On the (In)human(e) Slaughter of Other Animals, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her92/92smith.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her92/92smith.pdf</a><br />
<br />
The status quo is untenable; only the ethical action will change our relationship with nonhumans <br />
CASSUTO, 2007<br />
(David, Bred Meat: The Cultural Foundation of the Factory Farm, Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 70)<br />
<br />
Cafos Would Be Shut Down Without Subsidies<br />
Starmer and Wise 2007<br />
(Elanor Starmer and Timothy A. Wise, December 2007 Tufts University  (Living High on the Hog, GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENT INSTITUTE, WORKING PAPER NO. 07-04), Pg 22)<br />
<br />
It is now the crucial time to end all immoral animal treatments in factory farms<br />
Singer 2006<br />
(Peter Singer – Philosopher and Professor at Princeton University –“Factory Farming: A Moral Issue”, The Minnesota Daily, March 22, 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/20060322.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/20060322.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
Even in a utilitarian framework, where animal and human interests are weighted, we have an obligation to end animal suffering.<br />
Matheny 2006<br />
(Jason Gaverick Matheny - Ph Student @ School of Public Health. Johns Hopkins University “In Defense of Animal”, Malden, MA ; Oxford : Blackwell Pub., 2006, pg 16 – 17)
