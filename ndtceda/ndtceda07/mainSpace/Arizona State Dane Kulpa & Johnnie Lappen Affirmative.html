<br />
First Off is the Jerusalem Syndrome…<br />
Palestinian authorities continue to pledge ownership over the city of Jerusalem. Fueling the brink is the israeli construction around Al-Aqsa mosque.<br />
<strong>Almeghari, 2/21/2007</strong> <u>(Rami, IMEMC,</u> Muslims and Christians in Palestine Unite in Defense of Jerusalem, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.imemc.org/article/47124?print_page=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.imemc.org/article /47124?print_page=true</a>)<br />
<br />
However, this is not just a one sided conflict, Israel participates in discriminitory policies that place palistinians into a precarious existence.<br />
<strong>Asser 5/22/2007</strong> (Martin, Bbc news, Obstacles to peace: Jerusalem, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6668603.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi /middle_east/6668603.stm</a>)<br />
<br />
Making things worse are critiques of Anti-Semitism that do not go far enough to realize the implicit paradox in the status quo. The best way to avoid this deadlock is to recognize that there lies both Anti-Semitism and Zionism.<br />
Zizek 2006, (Slavoj, Parallax View, Pg. 257-9)<br />
<br />
And, the claims toward jerusalem are a method of identifying with the city through the development of an idealogy based on security concerns.<br />
<br />
Hulme 2006, (David, doctorate in international relations from USC, identity ideology and the future of jarusalem pg 28-30)<br />
<br />
And, the illustration of danger legitimizes the destruction of an inhuman other. such logic results in a pre-emptive right against “the inevitable and unpredictable” threats. gender edited...<br />
Bunzl and Beit-Hallahmi 2002, (John/ Benjamin, university of vienna and university of haifa, psychoanalysis, identity and ideology: critical essays on the israel/palestine case pg 87<br />
<br />
And, terrorism is the result of the lack of any recognition—our impact is narcissistic rage.<br />
<u>Sucharov 2005, (Asst. Prof. of poli sci @ carleton university, The international self: Psychoanalysis and the search for Israeli-palestinian peace, 2005, pg 38)</u><br />
<br />
But don’t be fooled, the United States is the greatest sponsor of global terrorism. the ongoing threat of war hightens all political struggles only to psychologically attach to the greatest possible impact.<br />
Dabashi 2007 (Hamid, ME professor @ columbia, thinking beyond the us invasion of iran, feb issue no. 831, al-ahram weekly online, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/831/focus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg /2007/831/focus.htm</a>”)<br />
<br />
Therefore it isn’t hard to imagine scenarios like:<br />
A.<br />
Sid-Ahmed in 2004 (Mohamed, staff writer, Al-Ahram, Sept. 1, issue number 705, “Extinction!”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg /2004/705/op5.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
And, B.<br />
Beres 2002, (Louis Rene (Ph.D. Princeton) author, “Palestine” or nuclear war, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gamla.org.il/english/article/2002/march/ber2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamla.org.il /english/article/2002/march /ber2.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
Plan:<br />
In exchange for the Palestinian Authority renouncing its claims to Jerusalem, the United States Federal Government should offer a security guarantee that Jerusalem will be free of all state control.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second Off is the Policy…<br />
<strong><u>The transition of jerusalem doesn’t have to be violent and the U.s. should act as a third-party facilitator to end the cycle of violence.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Sucharov 2005, (Asst. Prof. of poli sci @ carleton university, The international self: Psychoanalysis and the search for Israeli-palestinian peace, 2005, pgs 166-7)</u></strong><br />
<br />
And, the fantasmatic attachment to jerusalem only results in nightmares. our proposal is for a radical act to position jerusalem beyond the bounds of political influence.<br />
Zizek 2006, (Slavoj, international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, LRB | Vol. 28 No. 16 dated 17 August 2006 , <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n16/letters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n16 /letters.html</a>)<br />
<br />
And, cutting the symptomal knot in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is necessary to prevent the replacement of all those that do not fit within the framework of the dominant ideology.<br />
zizek 2003, international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, iraq: the borrowed kettle, Pg. 38-41)<br />
<br />
Finally, we cannot always expect the leaders of the government to change their identities of conflict. Rather, it is important to recognize that questions of identity should also result in the answering of the question of who we want to be.<br />
Hulme 2006, (David, doctorate in international relations from USC, identity ideology and the future of jarusalem pg 189-90)
