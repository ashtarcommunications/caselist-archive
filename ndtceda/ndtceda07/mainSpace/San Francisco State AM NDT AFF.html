<br />
Cross-x<br />
Why should the judges vote affirmative?<br />
Performance of the 1ac is an interruption of certain dominant discourses. Voting aff highlights politics of interruption<br />
<br />
Can the neg just agree with your advocacy?<br />
Agreeing with us doesn’t mean you do the same thing as us. Interruption precludes problems of authenticity<br />

 <strong>2ac A2: Framework</strong><br />
We Meet – we defend consequences – they just happen to be epistemological rather than body count<br />
We Meet – Reagan constructively engages Afghanistan (sexually)<br />
A2: Plan Focus Good – plan focus is reductive, doesn’t create good education, can’t go about changing relationships we have – debate should be about interruption<br />
A2: Predictability<br />

San Francisco State AM Aff<br />
Round # 1<br />
vs Team: Wake GL<br />
Judge: Archer, Veronica Guevara, Lyle<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan Text<br />
<br />
There isn’t really a plan.<br />
<br />
1ac w/ cites<br />
<br />
It is functionally the same heteronormativity thing they’ve been reading. It begins with a faux speech by Ronald Reagan from, what I assume, would be the 1AC- but they both talk, in a sort of dualistic speech. They say that war only exists because there is n aesthetic of war that we all believe and accept. It destroys all difference. They advocate a queer aesthetic of the middle east and to interrupt how a text becomes knowledge. They want to disrupt the natural by creating difference in the world. They want to challenge the idea that hetero is normal. The aff tries to interrupt that dominant discourses. Then there is some more Ronald Reagan stuff, talking about what it was like to go visit the Afghanistan. Then they talk about getting blow jobs from Osama Bin Laden and simulate having anal sex with each other.<br />
