 <em>US</em> <em>policy on Iran is a disaster – Unilateral sanctions and isolation have no chance to curb their nuclear program</em><br />
<br />
Joseph <strong>Cirincione</strong>, Senior Fellow and Director for Nuclear Policy at the Center for American Progress <strong>And</strong> Andrew <strong>Grotto</strong>, Senior National Security Analyst at the Center for American Progress, “Contain and Engage” Center for American Progress, March 20<strong>07</strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf</a><br />
<br />
<strong>The</strong> first <strong>option, to “muddle through,”…</strong> as we detail on page 24.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Thus we offer the following plan: Through all necessary means the United States Federal Government should constructively engage the Government of Iran by offering to lift United States domestic restrictions on and opposition to foreign investment in Iran’s gasoline refinery sector, a promise to not engage in or support regime change or first strikes in Iran, and the United States will support all necessary funding for Iranian access to an international nuclear fuel bank in exchange for Iranian commitment to discontinue uranium enrichment.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Iran</em> <em>is close to developing industrial centrifuges – dubbed “the point of no return” by the United States and other nations</em><br />
<br />
Phillip <strong>Kurata</strong>, Washington File Staff Writer, “Iran Approaches Point of No-Return on Acquiring a Nuclear Program”, The Washington File, April 20<strong>06</strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&amp;y=2006&amp;m=April&amp;x=20060421175140cpataruk0.9464533" rel="nofollow">http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&amp;y=2006&amp;m=April&amp;x=20060421175140cpataruk0.9464533</a><br />
<br />
Washington <strong>-- Iran is approaching the .. including weapons grade material</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Second - there are several “known unknowns” about Iran’s nuclear program which could substantially speed up its development of weapons grade material</em><br />
<br />
Joseph <strong>Cirincione</strong>, Senior Fellow and Director for Nuclear Policy at the Center for American Progress <strong>And</strong> Andrew <strong>Grotto</strong>, Senior National Security Analyst at the Center for American Progress, “Contain and Engage” Center for American Progress, March 20<strong>07</strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Iran</strong> <strong>will</strong> most likely <strong>overcome … competence with centrifuge technology</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Third – Once Iran comes public with its industrial nuclear capabilities – it will inspire other nations to develop so called “peaceful” nuclear programs – this virtual arms race ensures nuclear war</em><br />
<br />
Joseph <strong>Cirincione</strong>, Senior Fellow and Director for Nuclear Policy at the Center for American Progress <strong>And</strong> Andrew <strong>Grotto</strong>, Senior National Security Analyst at the Center for American Progress, “Contain and Engage” Center for American Progress, March 20<strong>07</strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Regardless of how Iran behaves with a nuclear … this is a recipe for nuclear war.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>And Fourth – Middle East nuclear war escalates to a global nuclear conflict</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Steinbach</strong>, DC Iraq Coalition, March 20<strong>02</strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/02.03/0331steinbachisraeli.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/02.03/0331steinbachisraeli.htm</a><br />
<br />
Meanwhile, <strong>the existence of an arsenal of mass destruction … conflict could trigger a world conflagration.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Advantage 2 – Global Proliferation</strong><br />
<br />
<em><strong>First – the NPT exception to the development of nuclear power crushes its credibility – every signatory has the “inalienable right” to develop technology that can convert peaceful nuclear power into nuclear weapons in a matter of weeks</strong></em><br />
<br />
Y. J. <strong>Choi</strong>, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations and former Chancellor of the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, “THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND PROLIFERATION CHALLENGES TO THE NPT REGIME”, March 20<strong>07</strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gsinstitute.org/mpi/docs/A6F_Vienna_Choi.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsinstitute.org/mpi/docs/A6F_Vienna_Choi.pdf</a><br />
<br />
<strong>It is well known that the current NPT regime … extremely complex and highly sensitive</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Second – The NPT is critical to stop global proliferation</em><br />
<br />
Jayantha <strong>Dhanapala</strong>, Undersecretary General for Disarmament Affairs UN, “The State of the Global Nuclear Non-Proliferation Regime: 2001”, 21-23 May 20<strong>01</strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.un.org/speech/21may2001.htm" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.un.org/speech/21may2001.htm</a><br />
<br />
For their part, <strong>multilateralists</strong> must pay closer attention … <strong>our &quot;Last Chance&quot; for a safer world for everybody</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Proliferation results in nuclear war and extinction</em><br />
<br />
Victor A. <strong>Utgoff</strong>, Deputy Director of the Strategy, Forces, and Resources Division of the Institute for Defense Analysis, Survival Vol 44 No 2 Proliferation, Missile Defence and American Ambitions, p. 87-90 20<strong>02</strong><br />
<br />
Many readers are probably wilting to accept that nuclear proliferation … <u>dead cities or even whole nations.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 3: Solvency:<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>First – An international fuel bank would solve regional proliferation and close the loophole in the NPT</em><br />
<br />
Joseph <strong>Cirincione</strong>, Senior Fellow and Director for Nuclear Policy at the Center for American Progress <strong>And</strong> Andrew <strong>Grotto</strong>, Senior National Security Analyst at the Center for American Progress, “Contain and Engage” Center for American Progress, March 20<strong>07</strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf</a><br />
<br />
<strong>The United States and its partners …</strong> Iran to forego uranium enrichment<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Second – the plan solves proliferation</em><br />
<br />
Joseph <strong>Cirincione</strong>, Senior Fellow and Director for Nuclear Policy at the Center for American Progress <strong>And</strong> Andrew <strong>Grotto</strong>, Senior National Security Analyst at the Center for American Progress, “Contain and Engage” Center for American Progress, March 20<strong>07</strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf</a><br />
<br />
But it is no more than that. <strong>Russia and China … the support of key allies and partners</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Third - The security guarantee is key to getting Iran to abandon its nuclear program – they fear US regime change</strong></em><br />
<br />
Joseph <strong>Cirincione</strong>, Senior Fellow and Director for Nuclear Policy at the Center for American Progress <strong>And</strong> Andrew <strong>Grotto</strong>, Senior National Security Analyst at the Center for American Progress, “Contain and Engage” Center for American Progress, March 20<strong>07</strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf</a><br />
<br />
<strong>The Bush administration made a tactical adjustment … its enrichment program.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Fourth - Lifting sanctions is key – it revitalizes the oil sector which is essential to getting the Iranian public to support the plan</strong></em><br />
<br />
Joseph <strong>Cirincione</strong>, Senior Fellow and Director for Nuclear Policy at the Center for American Progress <strong>And</strong> Andrew <strong>Grotto</strong>, Senior National Security Analyst at the Center for American Progress, “Contain and Engage” Center for American Progress, March 20<strong>07</strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/02/pdf/iran_report.pdf</a><br />
<br />
The United States should continue … <strong>doubt the wisdom of his policy decisions.</strong><br />

<u>Scene One: The Master and the Puppet</u><br />
<br />
The United States has taken the role of the “sole-madman” arranging the strategic goal posts of our <em>external</em> order in an attempt to conquer the violence and inequality that permeates our <em>internal</em> order. Paranoid that Iran’s proliferation efforts will threaten the global harmony that sustains our ideological primacy, it is our responsibility to restore order by promoting democracy and human rights.<br />
<br />
Siavoj Zizek. International director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities. August 11, 2005. Give Iranian Nukes a Chance. In These Times. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizekiranian.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizekiranian.htm</a> (Jason Pearsall)<br />
<br />
The ideology of spreading democracy and globalization through the promotion of human rights depoliticizes strategic interventions creating a cycle of victimization that hinders subjective identity.<br />
<br />
Slavoj Zizek. 2006. The Parallax View. P. 340-341. (Pearsall)<br />
<br />
And, this logic of restoring order and removing the threat of Iran can be understood as an attempt to master the undemocratic and inhumane excess that antagonize neo-liberalism.<br />
<br />
Glyn Daly. Senior Lecturer in Politics in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at University College. June 1999. Ideology and its paradoxes: Dimensions of fantasy and enjoyment. Journal of Political Ideologies. Vol. 4, Iss. 2; pg. 219-239. (Jason Pearsall)<br />
<br />
This desire to control the ideological direction of Iran emerges from the death drive—this psychic apparatus justifies and is the cause for all forms of violence.<br />
<br />
Slavoj Zizek. 1989. The Sublime Object of Ideology. P. Introduction. (Jason Pearsall)<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Scene Two: The Parallax</u><br />
<br />
Human rights promotion strategically maintains the ideological primacy of the United States by creating a democratic existence for the “other” that is tolerable because it does not threaten neo-liberal interests. The radical political act of arming Iran in an effort to promote freedom confronts the death drive and alters the coordinates of possibility within the constitutive limits of contemporary democracy.<br />
<br />
Slavoj Zizek 2004. From Politics to Biopolitics…and Back. The South Atlantic Quarterly. Project Muse. (Jason Pearsall)<br />
<br />
Our ethical political obligation is to redefine the coordinates of the symbolic order by problematizing the benevolent relationship between democratic human rights promotion and our strategic economic interests.<br />
<br />
Glyn Daly and Slavoj Zizek. 2004. Conversations with Zizek. P. 13-18. (Jason Pearsall)<br />
<br />
The authentic political act acknowledges that it is the attempt to create utopia that creates the conditions of totalitarianism – coping with denial of constitutive antagonism is the necessary first step to bettering our world.<br />
