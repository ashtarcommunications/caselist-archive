 Relsim wil continues to be a part of the world – not other theory even comes close to explaning the world as realism does- there is no escapre, despite the pessisim of realism<br />
Sean m lynn-jones 99 [contemporary security and strategy, ed, craig syder, page 71]<br />
Rejecting realism is not only impossible but counterproductive- rejction is the surest way to reproduce realism in a more harmful manner<br />

Off Case Args:<br />
<br />
A interpretation – the affirmative must affirm the topic instrumentally. The 1AC must include a topical plan that is justified with a normative defense of federal government adoption of such policy option<br />
<br />
b. definitional support<br />
<br />
1. the topic is defined by6 the phrase following the colon- the USFG is the agent of the resolution,<br />
<br />
Websters 2k<br />
<br />
The clause flowing…of the sentence<br />
<br />
2. should denotes an expectation of enacting a plan<br />
<br />
American heritage 2K<br />
<br />
Used to express expectation<br />
<br />
c. violation- the affirmative is not an instrumental affirmation of the resolution- they affirm the topic as an imaginative exercise, which is utiopian<br />

d. reasons to prefer.<br />

Their alternative/ solvency fails, it conceptualizes this, the university, the space in which it is situated as a sight for meaningful criticism, the modern university makes that impossible<br />
<br />

<br />
It is a popular belief…a loyalty oath<br />
<br />
Their alternative is hopelessly compromised by the place of the University , you cant counter military industrial interests when the University is the place of military industrial interest<br />
<br />

<br />
furthermore, the popular…to the contrary<br />
<br />
no solvency/alternative- you assume yourself to be situated outside of power, youre not, your criticism exists because it benefits the present constitution of power. Its pretty simple trace the funding tht puts them in this place to argue what they argue. The four years of freedom of the University, particularly as represented by their AFF/ alternative are necessary to maintain structures of domination<br />

<br />
since the 1880’s…of the world<br />
<br />
Four factors vitiate attempts for intel independence 1) the argument or research as commondity 2) the dependency on argumentative marketability 3) the increasing and unrelenting control of the University by capitalist domination 4) the reorientation of the unieverstity as fully constituted within these apparatuses of power<br />
