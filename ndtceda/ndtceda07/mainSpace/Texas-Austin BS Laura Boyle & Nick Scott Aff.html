CONTENTION ONE: THE CAMP<br />
<br />
WE BEGIN WITH GLIMPSE INSIDE THE WALLS OF A FACTORY FARM WHERE BILLIONS OF ANIMALS ARE CONDEMNED TO LIVES FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT SUFFERING AND TORTURE.<br />
<br />
Farm Sanctuary, 2008 (“Factory Farming”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org/issues/factoryfarming/" rel="nofollow">http://www.farmsanctuary.org/issues/factoryfarming/</a>, the card is the combined articles on eggs, pork, beef, dairy, and poultry)<br />
<br />
“There are approximately… diseases, and cancer.”<br />
<br />
THESE HORRORS DO NOT OCCUR IN ISOLATION BUT RATHER ARE PART AND PARCEL OF THE LARGER INSTITUTION OF CONTEMPORARY GLOBAL BIOPOLITICS - VAST MECHANISMS OF SURVEILLNCE AND MANAGEMENT ARE EXERTED OVER COUNTLESS ANIMALS WITHIN FACTORY FARMS, SUCH AS THE BATTERY HEN, IN AN EFFORT TO MAXIMIZE FOOD PRODUCTION – THIS IS A RESULT OF HUMAN SOCIETY BEING UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST THE CATEGORY OF THE HUMAN IS IN A STATE OF CONSTANT FLUX AND THAT SECONDLY ALL HUMANS CONTAIN WITHIN THEM A FORM OF ANIMALITY. BY CLOSING OURSELVES OFF TO THESE POSSIBILITIES WE CREATE WAYS TO DISTANCE OURSELVES FROM ANIMALS - THE RESULT IS THE CREATION OF BARE LIFE WHICH MAKES THINGS SUCH AS DEATH MEANINGLESS BECAUSE SUBJECTS ARE FORCED INTO THE REALM OF THE LIVING DEAD.<br />

“Five hundred police… an eternal Treblinka&quot;”<br />
<br />
OUR CONTENTION IS BECAUSE THE CATEGORY OF HUMAN IS IN THIS STATE OF FLUX IT IS ULTIMATELY A FICTION, HOWEVER RATHER THAT RECOGNIZING THIS TRUTH WE CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR THE MISSING LINK WHICH NECESSITATES THE CREATION OF THE CATEGORY OF THE SUB-HUMAN. IT IS THIS CEASELESS STRUGGLE OVER THE CONSTITUTION OF THE HUMAN THAT PROVIDES AN ETHICAL LOOPHOLE FOR VIOLENCE BY ALLOWING US TO JUSTIFY OUR ACTIONS BECAUSE WE CAN ALWAYS SAY OUR VICTIMS ARE NOT HUMAN AND THEREFORE NOT AFFORDED THE SAME PROTECTIONS. ONLY A POLITICAL PROJECT, WHICH SEEKS TO INTEROGATE THE CATEGORY OF THE HUMAN, ANTD ITS RELATIONSHIP TO ITS OWN ANIMALITY CAN RESCUE US FROM THE BIOPOLITICS OF THE STATUS QUO.<br />

<br />
“14. It is perhaps… humanity or animal”<br />
<br />
CONTINUING TO UPHOLD THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HUMAN AND ANIMAL HAS DISASTOROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR ENTITIES ALL OVER THE GLOBE – THE IMPULSE TO DOMINATE AND CONTORL ALL ‘LOWER BEINGS’ MANIFESTS ITSELF AS AN ABSOLUTE FAITH THAT REASON CAN, WILL, AND MUST TRIUMPH OVER THE DISORDERED NATURAL WORLD; THIS RIGID AND VIOLENT ORIENTATION DOOMS EVERY BEING EXTERMINATION.<br />

PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ELIMINATE ALL OF THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S DOMESTIC SUBSIDIES FOR CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS.<br />
<br />
ELIMINATING SUBSIDIES IS NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE CAFOS<br />
<br />
Gurian-Sherman, 2008 (Doug, April, senior scientist in the USC food and enviro program, PhD from Berkeley, EPA health assessor for biotechnology and FDA advisor for food biotechnology, “CAFOs Uncovered: The Untold costs of Confined Animal Feeding Operations”, the Union of Concerned Scientists for Environment Solutions, www.ucsusa.org)<br />
<br />
“Systems that are… communities than CAFOs”<br />
<br />
VOTING AFF REPRESENTS MORE THAN JUST AN AFFIRMATION OF A CONSEQUENTIAL POLTICAL ACTION – AN AFF BALLOT REPRESENTS A STRATEGIC INTERVENTION AIMED AT MAINTAINING THE CATEGORY OF THE HUMAN AS OPEN - WE RECOGNIZE THAT SAID CATEGORY IS A FICTION AND IT ONLY ACQUIRES A STABLE MEANING VIA ITS RELATION WITH ITS OPPISOTE IE THE CATEGORY OF THE ANIMAL. THEREFORE VOTING AFF REPRESENTS AN IDENTIFICATION WITH OUR OWN ANIMALITY WHICH IS CRUCIAL TO INTERRUPT THE PROCESS OF CONSTANT DEFERRAL ONLY AN SUCH AS THIS DISALLOWS NOT ONLY ANIMAL SUFFERING BUT SOVERIEGN VIOLENCE AS WELL.<br />

“16. To the extent… by both entities”<br />
<br />
We are all complicity in the CAFO system since our tax money pays for the subsidies<br />
Porter, 2006 (Ana, graduate of the Master in Divinity program at UChicago, Jan. 8 “Getting Real About Food”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uua.org/spirituallife/worshipweb/sermons/submissions/8783.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.uua.org/spirituallife/worshipweb/sermons/submissions/8783.shtml</a>)<br />
<br />
“And here’s the… we are standing”<br />
<br />
Given our obligation to minimize suffering, we must reject our complicity in CAFOs or we are no better than the Nazi doctors who turned a blind eye to the camps. Voting aff to acknowledge that we are personally responsible for the pain of hundreds of animals is the only ethical choice you can make to solve.<br />

CONTENTION ONE: CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS<br />
<br />
THE MODERN POLITICAL STATE IS FOUNDED ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANIMALS AND HUMANS – IN THAT THE IDEA OF MEAT CREATED THE NEED FOR STATE REGULATIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE HEART OF BIOPOLITICS.<br />
<br />
YOUNG, 6 (UC Berkeley, ‘6 Katherine, Ph.D. Candidate Political Science Department Colorado State University, “Animal Politics: Sovereignty and the Animal Body,” Annual Meeting of the Western Political Science Association Albuquerque, New Mexico March 16-18, 2006, Http:<em>www.allacademic.com</em>meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/9/7/2/6/pages97264/p97264-1.php)<br />
<br />
“In Chapter VII… substantiate its power”<br />
<br />
INDEED – THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANIMAL AND HUMAN IS WHY WE ALL – BOTH HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN – LIVE AND DIE IN THE CONFINED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATION THAT IS BIOPOLITICS.<br />

<br />
BIOPOLITICS ROOTED IN THE ANIMAL-HUMAN DICHOTOMY ENSURES THE INEVITABLE EXTINCTION OF BOTH HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN ANIMALS.<br />

<br />
Agamben’s essay anticipates… Agamben’s earlier writings<br />
<br />
THE CONTINUAL FAILURE OF HUMANITY TO LIVE UP TO ITS NON-ANIMALITY ENSURES THE STATE OF EXCEPTION AT HEART IN MODERN BIOPOLITICS WILL ALWAYS EXIST – MEANING THERE WILL ALWAYS BE DEATH, EXCLUSION, AND WAR UNTIL WE GIT IT TO THE ROOT OF BIOPOLITICS.<br />

<br />
Agamben’s relation to… hope to stop it.<br />
<br />
PREFER OUR STRUCTURAL IMPACTS TO THEIR SPECIFIC DISADS – EACH LINK, INTERNAL LINK, AND IMPACT CLAIM IS ENFRAMED AND ROOTED IN THE RISK ANALYSIS OF BIOPOLITICIANS – THIS ENSURES EVERY QUEST FOR SECURITY OR LIFE ALWAYS ENDS UP WITH INSECURITY AND DEATH. MAKING DISADS INEVITABLE.<br />

<br />
Contra Ojakangas, then,… and disturbs you<br />
<br />
INDEED – TRYING TO AVOID A SPECIFIC EXTINCTION EVENT LIKE THEIR DISADS ENSURES ANOTHER ONE WILL POP UP – UNTIL ONE ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE – BIOPOLITICS.<br />

PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ELIMINATE SUBSIDIES FOR CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS BY ELIMINATING ALL SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: THE BALLOT<br />
<br />
OUR INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL IN CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS INCLUDES BOTH HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN ANIMALS - THIS THE BEST WAY TO FORCE OUR COMMUNITY TO CONFRONT THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL MACHINE BY TAKING DEBATES AWAY FROM HIGHLY TECHNOLOGIZED EMORY OR DARTMOUTH STYLE EQUIP ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT DISEASE OR MECHANIZED AGRICULTURE AFFS – SHIFTING IT TO AN ONTOLOGICAL FOCUS ON THE HUMAN-ANIMAL DICHOTOMY.<br />
<br />
STARBUCK, 6 (Jennifer P., Senior Lecturer in the Department of Drama, Theatre, and Performance Studies at Roehampton University, Theatre Journal 58.4, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/v058/58.4starbuck.html0" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/v058/58.4starbuck.html0</a><br />
<br />
Revisiting the expansiveness… a becoming-animate<br />
<br />
THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE THE MODERN DAY CAFO THAT IS BIOPOLITICS IS TO REFUSE TO DRAW LINES OF ANY KIND BETWEEN ZOE AND BIOS – NOT ONLY MUST THIS REFUSAL TAKE PLACE ON THE TERM ANIMAL, IT MUST ALSO HAPPEN OVER THE TERM SUBSIDY MEANING WE MUST REFUSE THE SOVERIEGN IN TOTALITY OR NOT AT ALL.<br />
<br />

<br />
One potential form… or bare life<br />
<br />
CONFRONTING THE HUMAN-ANIMAL DICHOTOMY IN RELATIONSHIP TO SOVEREIGNTY IS THE BEST WAY TO RADICALY RUPTURE BIOPOLITICS.<br />

<br />
16. To the extent… by both entities<br />
<br />
MAKE NO MISTAKE VOTING AFF DOESN’T PASS OUR PLAN, DOESN’T PUT YOU ON THE PETA PICKET LINES, NOR DOES IT BRING AN END TO THE STATE. AN AFFIRMATIVE BALLOT IS PRECISELY HOW WE AS A DEBATE COMMUNITY ESCAPE THE MORAL REGULATION AT HEART IN BIOPOLITICS AND PRECISELY HOW WE FOSTER AN ETHICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ANIMALITY. SOCIETY DOES NOT CHANGE FROM PLEES TO THE MASTER TO PULL OR STOP PULLING THE LEVER, BUT FROM LOCAL INTERROGATIONS OF THE HUMAN-ANIMAL DICHOTOMY.<br />

<br />
What does it… of animal Others<br />
<br />
IT IS THIS VERY ETHICAL COMPONENT OF OUR 1AC THAT CAN END THE ANTHROPOLGICAL MACHINE FROM WITHIN – PUTTING ABSTRACT NOTIONS OF FIAT, AGENT COUNTERPLANS, OR POLITICS PROPER FIRST ENSURES BIOPOLITICS WILL RECONSTITUTE ITSELF IN EQUALLY HORRIFIC WAYS.<br />
