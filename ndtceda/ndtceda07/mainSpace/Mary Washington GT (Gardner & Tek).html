Thus the plan: the United States Federal Government should guarantee not to threaten Iran's sovereignty or territorial integrity if Iran agrees to end significant production of enriched uranium and agrees to rotor speed limits on all centrifuges.<br />

 Now is key, the NIE missed the point – Iran will be able to produce a bomb from its civilian energy program in two years – the mere prospect will drive a regional arms race<br />

A Middle East arms race has resulted, causing destabilizing, fast proliferation. This makes nuclear war inevitable – engagement is key to solve<br />

Miscalculation and lack of communication guarantee war- engagement is necessary to create viable deterrence<br />

A nuclear Middle East would not be stable- deterrence will be unable to prevent cascading proliferation, nuclear war and nuclear terrorism<br />

 Iran's pursuit of nuclear power is creating a crisis- unless the US offers concessions to Iran the issue will be irresolvable- Iran will pursue weaponization and miscalculation guarantees pressure will escalate to war<br />
Abrahamian, 07<br />
[Ervand, interviewed by David Barsamian, Targeting Iran, written by David Barsamian, 71-75]<br />
I would say the present crisis is not so much of a group wanting war<br />

Compromising on rotor speed is the perfect deal to prevent proliferation- it saves Iran face, appeals to global and Iranian opinion and allows effective monitoring<br />
Clawson and Eisenstadt , November 06<br />
[Patrick, and Michael, &quot;Forcing Hard Choices on Tehran's Leaders,&quot; google]<br />
Similar creative compromises should be sought<br />
ill-considered measures , debated only by diplomats without adequate consultation with technical experts, that end up being speed bumps that only slow down Iran's nuclear program .<br />
<br />
<br />
Security guarantees are key solve- it's a real incentive that changes the nature of relations and strengthens moderates<br />
Larrabee, 3-9 -06<br />

The negotiations between the E uropean U nion troika (Britain, France and Germany) have failed largely<br />
around President Ahmadinejad and result in a less intransigent Iranian nuclear policy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Engagement is key- pressure strengthens hardliners by allowing them to appeal to nationalism- security incentives will strengthen pragmatists who advocate rapprochement<br />

The Bush administration can applaud itself for finally managing<br />

Reaching out to the pragmatists solves- Khamenei has ensured they have a voice on the nuclear issue<br />
