California BP – neg vs. Iran Ga SW<br />
Counterplan: The USFG should adopt and announce a binding policy of non-aggression towards the governement of Iran. The USFG shold diplomatically engage Iran in an attempt to commit to a verifiable agreement to limit its nuclear facilities to civilian use.<br />
Observation 1: Theory<br />
<ol><li>The CP is legitimate. It tests the conditional nature of the plan’s security guarantee which is the heart of the topic and a germane policy consideration.</li></ol><br />
<ol><li>Competition: Mutual exclusivity – The Plan conditionally offers a security guarantee. The CP unconditionally ends the threat of strikes or regime change.</li></ol><br />
Observation 2: Net Benefits. Solves the case better and avoids disadvantages to conditional security guarantee offers.<br />
<ol><li>Negotiations.</li></ol><br />
<ol><ol><ol><li>Uncondtionally removing the military option is criticial to spurring successful negotiations. The plan is an extension of the status quo’s threat based foreign policy that props up Iranian hardliners and drives nuclearization, BOSTON GLOBE, 5-3-07, “advocacy of force as a last resort” and “undermines both the prospect of Iranian disarmament” “strengthens the argument of those who suggest that the best way”</li><li>In order for talks to succee, regime change cannot be a background threat, or even used as a bargaining chip. It must be OFF THE AGENDA before the negotiations begin. Jerusalem Report, 06, “the secret negotiations with Libya that culminated in the landmark agreement” “Crucially for the building of mutual trust between the sides” “he does not rule out military action” “but that is totally absent”</li></ol></ol></ol><br />
<ol><li>Miscalculation<ol><ol><li>Negotiations will be long and drawn up with multiple tough issues to resolve – In the world of the plan, the military option is always on the table and in the event of diplomatic breakdown their 1AC evidence proves there is a risk of miscalc. Only the CP can resolve this risk. Brezinski, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cfr.org/" rel="nofollow">cfr.org</a>, “Report on an Independt Task Force” “Time for a New Approach” “A quarter century of enmity and estrangement” and “significant difference between worldviews and strategic priorities”</li><li>Perception of diplomatic breakdown will cause strikes, Gulf News, 4-16-06, “nuclear strikes if diplomacy failed”</li></ol></ol></li></ol><ul><li>Manipulation – The plan will become a justification for strikes, O’Brien, Irish Times, 3-13-06, “A process of sanction is about” and “will have to do so if military strikes against”<br />
Iranian Politics Disad<ol><li>Ending US hardline rhetoric is key to disempower hardliners in Iran. As long as we push regime change, aggressors control the debates among the political elite. BOSTON GLOBE, 5-3-07, “for such negotiations to succeed” and “ensuring the cause of disarmament”</li><li>Impact – Economic collapse risks violent Iranian adventurism and turns the case, ASIA TIMES, 5-30-07, “What can the west offer the Islamic” and “broke down under the pressure of America’s military buildup” “imperial adventure” and “cautious old men like” “able to stop them”</li></ol><br />
