Our alternative is to not do the aff – capitalist relations should be withdrawn from and rejected, we must stop participating in rescue operations for capital.<br />

1. (T) Security Guarantee is not a Quid Pro Quo<br />
<br />
2. (T) Security Assurances are not Guarantees:<br />
<br />
1. Security Guarantees are positive commitments to protect a country in case of aggression—Military cooperation and non-aggression are not enough to constitute a security guarantee.<br />
Tertrais 2004 (Bruno, senior research fellow @ the Fondation pour la Recherche Strategique and an associate researcher @ the Center d’Etudes et de Recherches Internationales, The Washington Quarterly, “The Changing Nature of Military Alliances”, 27.2, p. 135-147)<br />
<br />
“Modern military alliances are the subject of a rich body of theoretical literature…well as China and Asian states such as Pakistan or Burma.<br />
<br />
2. A guarantee is a positive extension of a security umbrella to prevent attack by a third party<br />
Dictionary of 20th Century World Politics, 1993, (Jay Shafritz and Phil Williams, UPitt School of Public and International Affairs, Ronald Callinger, Prof. of History @ Catholic U., p. 318)<br />
<br />
3. The Ukraine example proves—security guarantees are positive commitments to extend a security umbrella—less substantial incentives are considered security assurances<br />
Foran and Spector ’97, (Virginia I., research director of Security Assurances Program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and Leonard S., senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and director of the Endowment’s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Project, The Price of Peace: Incentives and International Conflict Prevention, ed. David Cortright, p. 49, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/price/chap02.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/price/chap02.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
“A number of general objections have been raised to the use of security guarantees and other incentives…nuclear weapons, the negative security assurances, that proved important to reaching an agreement.”<br />
<br />
2NC Cards:<br />
<br />
Guarantees distinct from assurances—Guarantees are rarely extended positive commitments to protect from aggression<br />
Kuzio ’94, (Tara, Ukrainian Weekly, Vol. LXII, Iss. 19, May 8, “Ukrainian security to the end of the decade”, p. Proquest)<br />
<br />
“Although Ukranian security policy has demanded security guarantees…to restrain a more assertive future Russian national president.”<br />
<br />
Iran fears and needs security guarantees against other actors—Israel and Pakistan<br />
Odom 2007, (Lieutenant General William E. (Retired), senior fellow with the Hudson Institute and a professor @ Yale University, Yale Global, May 29, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=9223" rel="nofollow">http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=9223</a>)<br />
<br />
“Iran might settle for a security guarantee against...calls on the US to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities.”<br />
<br />
There is advocacy for extension of the nuclear umbrella beyond traditional allies<br />
Martel and Pendley ’94, (William C. and William T., Nuclear Coexistance, Air War College, Stuides in National Security No. 1, April, p. 146)<br />
<br />
“U.S. policy further undercuts the arguments of…only peripherally by nuclear ownership.”<br />

<br />
NATO is in the midst of a transitional period, failure to consult genuinely before foreign policy decisions will undermine the alliance<br />
