 <strong>Observation 1: Competition</strong><br />
<strong>A) <u>Not Topical</u> – It is not ‘resolved’ because the plan does not necessarily get passed.</strong><br />
<strong>B) <u>Permutations Don’t Compete</u> – because they would sever the immediate nature of the plan’s enforcement.</strong><br />

framework<br />
<br />
A. OUR INTERPRETATION: THE AFFIRMATIVE SHOULD PRESENT A TOPICAL PLAN OF ACTION AND DEFEND THE ADOPTION OF THAT POLICY BY THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS AN ENDPOINT OF THEIR ADVOCACY<br />
<br />
B. DEFINITIONS:<br />
<br />
1. THE TOPIC IS DEFINED BY THE PHRASE FOLLOWING THE COLON – THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE AGENT OF THE RESOLUTION, NOT THE INDIVIDUAL DEBATERS<br />
WEBSTER’S GUIDE TO GRAMMAR AND WRITING 2000 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm</a><br />
<br />
Use of a colon before a list or an explanation that is preceded by a clause that can stand by itself. Think of the colon as a gate, inviting one to go on… If the introductory phrase preceding the colon is very brief and the clause following the colon represents the real business of the sentence, begin the clause after the colon with a capital letter.<br />
<br />
2. “RESOLVED” EXPRESSES INTENT TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN<br />
AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY 2K www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=resolved<br />
<br />
To find a solution to; solve …<br />
To bring to a usually successful conclusion<br />
<br />
3. “SHOULD” DENOTES AN EXPECTATION OF ENACTING A PLAN<br />
AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY 2000 [www.dictionary.com]<br />
<br />
Used to express probability or expectation<br />
<br />
4. OUR DEFINITION EXCLUDES ACTION BY SMALLER POLITICAL GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALS.<br />
BLACK’S LAW 1999 Dictionary Seventh Edition Ed. Bryan A. Garner (chief) ‘99<br />
<br />
Federal government 1. A national government that exercises some degree of control over smaller political units that have surrendered some degree of power in exchange for the right to participate in national political matters.<br />
<br />
C. VIOLATION – THE AFFIRMATIVE IS NOT AN INSTRUMENTAL AFFIRMATION OF THE RESOLUTION<br />
<br />
D. REASONS TO PREFER –<br />
<br />
1. PREDICTABILITY:<br />
<br />
2. VAUGUENESS<br />
<br />
3. EXTRA TOPICALITY:<br />
<br />
4. EDUCATION: ROLEPLAYING IS A PREREQUISITE TO CRITICAL ARGUMENT AND THE FOUNDATION FOR POLITICAL PARTICIPATION<br />
JOYNER 1999 ([prof of I-Law @ Georgetown],“TEACHING INTERNATIONAL LAW: VIEWS FROM AN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS POLITICAL SCIENTIST” 5 ISLA Intn’l &amp; Comp. L 377) IB<br />
<br />
5. EXPLODING THE LIMITS OF DEBATE BY REJECTING THE NORMATIVE CALLS OF THE RESOLUTION NEUTRALIZES THE BENEFITS OF VOTING AFFIRMATIVE<br />
Shively 2000<br />
<br />
6. A CRITICAL FRAMEWORK UNDERMINES POLICY DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE IT SIDESTEPS INSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS<br />
SPEICE AND LYLE 2003 (Patrick [Wake Forest University] and Jim [Debate Coach, Clarion University], “Traditional Policy Debate: Now More Than Ever”, accessed 02/01/07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/SpeiceLyle2003htm.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/SpeiceLyle2003htm.htm)</a> IB<br />
