Trinity—Aid Trade Off DA<br />
<br />
a) Uniqueness—Bush has recently pledged large amounts of aid to Latin America in order to decrease growing anti-American sentiment.<br />
Alberts 2007 (Sheldon, National Post, “Bush doles out some Latin love: South American trip aimed at mending relations,” 3/9, factiva)<br />
“For the better part of his…Council on Foreign Relations.”<br />
<br />
b) Link—New foreign assistance programs designed to foster security trade-off with aid to Latin America<br />
Sanchez 2006 (Marcela, “Linking foreign aid and security”, San Diego Tribune, 1/28, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060128/news_lzle28sanchez.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060128/news_lzle28sanchez.html</a><br />
“Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice last week…our national security objectives.”<br />
<br />
<br />
c) Impact—US aid is vital to pro US sentiment in Latin America<br />
Chico 2007 (Gery, Chicago Sun-Times, “If US wants to spread democracy, don’t forget Latin America,” 1/6, factiva)<br />
“If we worried about…basics in various nations there.”<br />
<br />
d) US disengagement from South America has left a vacuum for China to fill in. The history of communism proves that South American countries will soon fall like dominoes, opening the door to full state conflict.<br />
<br />
Frisch 2005 (Gordon, Research Editor/Geopolitical Analyst for International Harry Schultz Letter, the world’s premier international investment, financial, geopolitical newsletter with subscribers in 71 countries, “Commentary on Global Issues,” 3/05, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jrnyquist.com/frisch_2005_0305.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jrnyquist.com/frisch_2005_0305.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
“The China Factor: In November 2004, Chinese President…nuclear missile delivery systems.”<br />
<br />
<br />
e) China will use this new position with Latin America to encircle the U.S.<br />

<br />
“The shortest distance between two points…strategic encirclement emerges.”<br />
<br />
Successful encirclement leads to a preemptive biological weapons strike against the US designed to decimate the US population<br />
Nyquist 2007, Jeffrey, former contractor in Soviet/Russian Analysis Group for U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Former Ph.D. Student at UC-Irvine in Political Sociologyk, and widely syndicated columnist and published author, “China’s Military Strategy,” 3/09, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/geo/pastanalysis/2007/0309.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/geo/pastanalysis/2007/0309.html</a><br />
