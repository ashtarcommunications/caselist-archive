TEXAS SWINGS<br />
ORDER IN THE COURT OF LOVE<br />
<br />
WE HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT<br />
<br />
A LETTER HAS BEEN DELIVERED FROM TEXAS AJ TO BE DICTATED BEFORE THE COUNCIL<br />
<br />
THE TEXT IS AS FOLLOWS:<br />
<br />
DEAR &lt;Insert Opponent Names and Judges Name&gt;,<br />
<br />
<br />
We stand here today in this round as participants of this great activity known as debate. Daniel and I believe that the true spirit of this activity<br />
lies in its unique position as a forum of communication and plurality. We are so very glad to be able to participate in this round with you. Our love<br />
for this activity is evidenced by our participation within it and is supported by our ability to debate in the first place. To further this end,<br />
however, we believe that certain norms of debate have evolved and betrayed its original purpose as an open, distinct public sphere. Exclusion still<br />
pervades our forum of communication. This is not an accident, however. Societal norms have penetrated our activity and have brainwashed our<br />
perspectives. Daniel and I believe that too many view this as natural and inevitable. We believe that this understanding is what perpetuates violence<br />
such as the exclusion of the feminine identity within our activity and within Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
So friends, lovers, and even those who can’t stand us:<br />
<br />
We want to extend our deepest sincerities to everyone in the room, and indeed all those in the activity. Love to you judge, Love to you negating<br />
team, and love to the feminine identities that are being excluded from the public sphere in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Thus we will defend:<br />
<br />
THE DENIAL OF THE FEMININE FROM AFGHANISTAN’S PUBLIC SPHERE ESTABLISHES A DENIAL SOCIETY-WIDE. THE ATROCITIES OCCURING IN AFGHANISTAN ARE JUST A SMALL PORTION OF WHAT IS OCCURING IN THE STATUS QUO. THE HIERARCHY OF VALUE THAT IS CREATED BY THIS GENDERCIDE IS PERMEATING ACROSS THE GLOBE AS ACCEPTABLE AND JUSTIFIED VIOLENCE.<br />
Lauryn Oates, November 3, 2006, Vice-president of the Calgary-based Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan, manager of the CIDA-funded Women's Rights in Afghanistan Fund from 2002 to 2006, The Globe and Mail<br />
<br />
AND IT IS THIS REMOVAL OF WOMEN FROM PUBLIC CONSIDERATION THAT LEGITIMIZES GENOCIDAL RAPE AND DESTROYS CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES WORLDWIDE.<br />
Rumna Chowdhury, J.D. University of Minnesota, “Kadic v. Karadzic- Rape as a Crime Against Women as a Class,” 2002<br />
<br />
THIS EXCLUSION OF THE FEMININE FROM THE PUBLIC SPHERE IS THE WORST FORM OF ONTO-DISCURSIVE VIOLENCE THAT STRIPS THE SUBJECT<br />
DOWN TO MERE BIOLOGICAL STATUS ALLOWING FOR THE GENOCIDE OF WORTHLESS LIVES DEVOID OF SUBJECTIVITY.<br />
Judith Butler, Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature @ U.C. Berkeley, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, 2004, pg. xix-xxi<br />
<br />
THIS VALUATION, DIVISION, AND EXCLUSION OF THE FEMININE ARE FORMS OF BIOPOLITICAL SOCIETAL PURIFICATION.<br />
Ransom, John S. 1997 (Professor of Political Science at Duke University, pgs 46- 55, Foucault's Discipline: The Politics of Subjectivity, Duke University Press)<br />
<br />
BIOPOLITICAL SUBJUGATION MAKES VIOLENCE, NUCLEAR WAR, AND GENOCIDE INEVITABLE AND NECESSARY.<br />
Dean Mitchell , 2001 Professor of Sociology at Macquarie University, (“Demonic Societies: Liberalism, biopolitics, and sovereignty.” Ethnographic Explorations of the Postcolonial State, ed. Hanson and Stepputat, p. 55-58)<br />
<br />
<br />
THUS, DANIEL AND I STAND RESOLVED THAT THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD INCREASE ITS CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH<br />
THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN BY OFFERING FOREIGN ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF LEGAL ASSISTANCE BASED UPON A RECONSTITUTED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXCLUDED FEMININITY AND THE FALSELY CONSTRUCTED DICHOTOMY OF THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE SPHERE. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE ASK. DON’T ASSUME ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
UNFORTUNATELY, SUCH A PLAN IS SADLY IMPOSSIBLE IN OUR CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS. DON’T GET US WRONG, WE STILL SUPPORT THE PLAN AND DO BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN. HOWEVER, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL BODIES IS TOO SKEWED AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS OF GENDER INEQUALITY ARE TOO FIRMLY ENTRENCHED TO TAKE CONVENTIONAL COURSES OF ACTION. ALSO, AS WE ARE ALL CULPABLE FOR THE HARMS IN THE STATUS QUO, IT IS NOT ONLY A PROBLEM THAT AFGHANISTAN MUST FACE. IT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE MUST ALL EVALUATE. THE COURSE OF ACTION PRESENTED BY THE PLAN IS NOT AN IMPOSSIBILITY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE AFFIRMATIVE. BUT THE PRESENTATION OF THE AFFIRMATIVE IS A PREREQUISITE TO ANY UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICAL MOVEMENTS. THE AFFIRMATIVE RECONSTITUTES THE CONCEPT OF GENDER AND ITS SUPPOSED ROLE WITHIN SOCIAL RELATIONS THROUGH THE SUBVERSIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE 1AC THAT ALLOWS FOR THE REFORMULATION OF SUBJECTIVITY.<br />
<br />
<br />
LES PRECIEUSES WERE THE MEMBERS OF ONE OF THE LAST FLOWING WOMEN’S LITERARY COURTS. THEY EXISTED THROUGH COURTS OF LOVE IN WHICH WOMEN FORCED THEMSELVES INTO THE PUBLIC SPHERE THROUGH RECONSTITUTING TRADITIONAL LAW WITH A LAW THAT ALLOWED A BLOOMING OF FEMININE IDENTITY. THIS MOVEMENT WAS FOUGHT WITH OPPOSITION PRECISELY BECAUSE IT STOOD IN A FANTASMIC OPPOSITION TO THEIR IDENTITY BEING FORCED TO EXIST IN PRIVATE. THIS HOSTILE RELATIONSHIP IS PRECISELY WHERE THE COURT FINDS ITS APPEAL AND ITS POWER.<br />
Peter Goodrich, Corporation of London Professor of Law, University of London, Birkbeck College; Visiting Professor, UCLA School of Law, Epistolary Justice: The Love Letter as Law, Yale Journal of Law &amp; the Humanities, Summer,9 Yale J.L. &amp; Human. 245, 1997<br />
<br />
THE COURTS OF LOVE SERVED TO EXPLODE THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE SPHERE AS THEY CONCEIVED OF JUSTICE IN THEIR SEPARATE JURISDICTION, THEIR IMAGINARY SPACE, IN THEIR DISTINCT PUBLIC SPHERE. THROUGH THIS REVOLUTIONARY REAPPROPRIATION OF THE CONCEPTION OF LAW THEY WERE ABLE TO RECONCEPTUALIZE THE FEMININE IDENTITY OUTSIDE OF PATRIARCHAL VALUE SYSTEMS.<br />
Peter Goodrich, Corporation of London Professor of Law, University of London, Birkbeck College; Visiting Professor, UCLA School of Law, Epistolary Justice: The Love Letter as Law, Yale Journal of Law &amp; the Humanities, Summer,9 Yale J.L. &amp; Human. 245, 1997<br />
<br />
THE METAPHOR OF THE LOVE LETTER IS AN ONTOLOGICAL PURSUIT TO DENOUNCE MASCULINITY AND FEMININITY AS SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS AND TO EXPOSE THE UNDERLYING, UNCONSCIOUS HIERARCHY OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE. THIS OPENING OF PERSPECTIVES CREATES AN ETHICO-POLITICAL SPACE TO RECONCEPTUALIZE SUBJECTIVITY, A BLANK TABLEAU TO BEGIN ANEW.<br />
Peter Goodrich, Corporation of London Professor of Law, University of London, Birkbeck College; Visiting Professor, UCLA School of Law, Epistolary Justice: The Love Letter as Law, Yale Journal of Law &amp; the Humanities, Summer,9 Yale J.L. &amp; Human. 245, 1997<br />
<br />
THE GLOBAL VIOLENCE AND EXCLUSION OF THE FEMININE IS NOT A RESULT OF DISTANT ACTIONS BUT IS CAUSED BY EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US THROUGH THE VERY ACTIONS THAT WE CONDONE AND PARTICIPATE IN EVERY DAY.<br />
Susanne Kappeler, Associate Professor at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, 1995, pg. 8-9<br />
<br />
UNDERSTANDING THE AFFIRMATIVE AS AN ETHICAL PERFORMANCE OPENS DOORWAYS TO UNEXPLORED REALMS. ONLY THROUGH THIS UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICS AS ETHICAL DISCOURSE CAN WE EVER BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE MICROPOLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE WORLD, WHICH IS<br />
THE ONLY WAY TO EXPLODE THE FALSELY CONSTRUCTED PUBLIC/PRIVATE DICHOTOMY CREATED TO JUSTIFY THE EXCLUSIONARY VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN. WE MUST FIRST EXAMINE THE INTRICACIES OF EVERYDAY LIFE TO COUNTER DOMINATION.<br />
Jessica Kulynych, Winthrop University, Polity, V. XXX, N. 2, Winter, 1997<br />
<br />
THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT IS JUST A PROJECTED PHANTASMAGORICAL CONCEPT THAT WE DISPLACE ON OURSELVES. THE WORLD TRULY EXISTS<br />
THROUGH THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS AND POWER ONLY FUNCTIONS AS A MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AS REALITY. CHANGING THE WORLD THROUGH PHYSICAL ABSTRACTIONS THEREFORE IS ALWAYS DOOMED TO FAIL AS IT IS ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT EXIST. ONLY BY RECONSTITUTING OURSELVES IN RELATION TO EACH OTHER WITHIN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES CAN WE BEGIN TO EMANCIPATE OURSELVES FROM THE VIOLENCE OF THE WORLD. OUR IMAGINED STRUCTURES OF REALITY WILL NATURALLY FOLLOW COURSE.<br />
Jayan Nayar, School of Law at the University of Warwick, Transnational Law &amp; Contemporary Problems, 1999<br />
