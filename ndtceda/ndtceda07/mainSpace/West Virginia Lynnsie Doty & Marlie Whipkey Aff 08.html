Plan text: The United States Federal Government should increase its Constructive engagement with the Islamic Republic of Iran by offering a security guarantee in the form of a treaty pleding that the Uinted States will halt all efforts to impede Iran’s development of nuclear technology. Enforcement and Implementation guaranteed thorugh normal means. We reserve right to clarify <br />

Don’t bother running procedural because our plan is a security gurantee <br />

Inherency <br />
Current international efforts to halt Iranian nuclear prolif are a miserable failure. Regardless of what you hear in “The No Spin Zone” coercive international pressure has done nothing to stop Iran’s development of nuclear weapons <br />

In fact, US saber rattling has rendered Iranian procurement of nuclear weapons inevitable <br />

Buy why is it that we seek to stop Iran’s development of nuclear weapons. Are nuclear aeapons in the nds of Iran more threatening than nuclear weapons in the hands of the US, THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS ACTUALLY USED THE WAPONS IN THE PAST? Why does Bill O’Reilley feel justified when he blatantly describes the Iranian regime as an existential threat to the entire world? A careful examination of the history of US-Iranian relations answers these questions: <br />
Our fears that Iranian nuclear weapons pose a global threat are neither objective nor neutral. Instead, they indebted to an imperialist line of thinking under which the Islamic Republoic is viewed as inherently evil, irrational, and diametriacally opposed to the Liberal Democratic values that define America. <br />
Hurd, ’04 (“The International Politics of Secularism: US Foreign Policy and the Islamic Republic of Iran” <em>Alternative: Global, Local, Political</em>) <br />
The politics of secularism..remain so contentious <br />

Advantage 2: Nuclear Orientalism <br />
The construction of Iran as violent and irrational is ever present in the debate aobut Iranian nuclear weapons. The idea that Iran, unlike the US, cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons is merely a continuation of the Orientalist assumptions that have underscored US foreign policy since the Iranian Revolution. This form of Orientalism is an ideological apparatus that sustains a heirarchichal conception of the US-Iranian relations under whichi domination and imperlaism are essential to matintain international order. <br />
Gusterson 99 (“Nuclear Weapons and the Other in Western Imagination” JSTOR) <br />
Following Anthony…of various kinds” (1990) <br />
<br />
At bottom, this externalization of violence is the root casue of conflict between the US and Iran. Until we are able free ourseovels from the prison of Orientalism, violent conflict between the US and Iran is inevitable. Its try or die. <br />
Zizek ’05 (online) <br />
But are nuclear…feel threatened <br />
<br />
Solvency <br />
Our plan exposes the dominant narratives that permeate the discussion of Iranian nuclear weapons as what ehy are: normative political assertions designed to legitmaize imperliasm. In a wolrd absent the aff, these narrative foreclose the possibility of true progressive change <br />
