Imperialism Kritik<br />
<br />
Framing Afghanistan assistance in terms of threats to US and global security generates a militarized biopolitical paradigm that objecitifies and oppresses afghani recipients. We need to break the discursive linking of assistance and US security.<br />

We must start with an alternative discourse of peace. Dominant security claims crowd out and coopt bottom up peacebuilding efforts. Problematizing the affs discourse stability through aid condtionality is a prerequisite to true peace instead of an imperial victors peace<br />

Violation-territorial entity rather then government<br />
<br />
Framicality<br />
<br />
A, Interp-voting aff means advocating that the plan would be a good ideas if it is passed. Ethical args can be used to prove plan is good, but must vote aff on plan not ethics.<br />
<br />
B. K2 fair debate<br />
<br />
1. Stable focus k2 clash-it would be impossible to negate the possible multiple ethical stances in a single debate, ethical issues are too large.<br />
<br />
2. Extra T-advocating an ethic outside of the action of the plan lets the aff whisk away negative solvency arguments. We cannot prepare to argue against the unpredictable ethic thye attach to it to get automatic solvency and extra advantages. Extra T is a voter, severance makes the 2NR impossible cuz we have to go for T to get back to square 1.<br />
<br />
3. Ethical stances unlimit-there are infinite number of ways the aff could use ethics to enhance their plan.<br />
<br />
4. Avoids Irony-plan as a starting point justifies irony makes topic bi-directional.<br />
