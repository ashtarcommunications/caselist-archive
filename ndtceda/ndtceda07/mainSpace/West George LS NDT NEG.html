Nuclear stuff = genocide of the natives L<br />
<br />
Nuclear power being built on land of indigenous Arabs in Iran is cultural genocide<br />
<br />
British Ahwazi Friendship Society 2008<br />
<br />
Indigenous Ahwazi Arabs have condemned the construction of a … nuclear power station.<br />
<br />
We should support Iranian public’s right to call for halt of nuclear power facilities<br />
<br />
Fiyouzat 2007<br />
<br />
Forget IAEA inspections! In Iran what we really need…its own citizenry.<br />
<br />
Reject the affirmative’s discursive invisibility of indigenous peoples. The project of nuclear mapping must precede technocratic solutions like the plan. Only by making the history of the nuclear landscape visible can we oppose cultural marginalization<br />
<br />
Kuletz 1998, The Tainted Desert, p. 6<br />
<br />
Naming and mapping the nuclear landscape…those landscapes.<br />
<br />
CP – don’t force Iran to have a civilian nuclear facility<br />
<br />
Shun Emory<br />
<br />
Private schooling = capitalist exploitation<br />
<br />
Palonsky 1993, Critical Issues in Education, p. 72<br />

The patrons of private…equal opportunity.<br />
<br />
Rejection of private education is key to change<br />
<br />

Cobb 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ginacobb.typepad.com" rel="nofollow">http://ginacobb.typepad.com</a><br />

<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
T—CE is QPQ<br />
The distinguishing feature of engagement strategies is the use of incentives to shape the behavior of the target<br />
Haas and O’Sullivan 2000, Honey and Vinegar, p. 1-2<br />
The term engagement was…States has important disagreements<br />
<br />
CE is by definition conditional—it depends on change by the target government<br />
Crocker 89, Southern Africa: Eight Years Later<br />
Regarding South Africa, constructive…of fundamental internal change<br />
<br />
Sudan proves—the offer of CE must be a quid pro quo to be accepted or refused<br />
Prendergast, 2006 “so how come we haven’t stopped it?”<br />
Indeed, Washington’s constructive…peacekeepers. Khartoum refused.<br />
<br />
T—Security Guarantee must be positive<br />
Security guarantees are positive commitments to protect a country in case of aggression—military cooperation and non-aggression are not enough to constitute a security guarantee<br />
Tertais 2004, The changing nature of military alliances, p. 135-147<br />
Modern military alliances are…Pakistan or Burma<br />
<br />
A guarantee is a positive extension of a security umbrella to prevent attack by a third party<br />
Dictionary of 20th Century World Politics 1993 p. 318<br />
Guarantee Some kind of security….see also ALLIANCE<br />
<br />
The Ukraine example proves—security guarantees are positive commitments to extend a security umbrella—less substantial incentives are considered assurances<br />
Foran and Spector 97, the Price of Peace: Incentives and international conflict prevention, p. 49<br />
A number of general…reaching an agreement.<br />
<br />
T—include means more than<br />

Include does not mean limited to<br />
Cumbow 2004, www.wsba.org/media/publications/barnews/2004/aug-04-cumbow.htm<br />

“From the longer view offered by a historical-materialist critique of capitalism … the new naked imperialism.”<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to not do the aff – capitalist relations should be withdrawn from and rejected, we must stop participating in rescue operations for capital.<br />

A. Our interpretation: Security guarantees are positive commitments to defend a country against attack.:<br />
Security guarantees are positive commitments to protect a country in case of aggression – military cooperation and non-aggression are not enough to constitute a security gurantee<br />
Tertrais 2004, the Washington Quarterly, the Changing Nature of Militayr Alliances, 27.2 p. 135-147<br />
Modern military alliances are … as Pakistan or Burma.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guarantees are a commitment to defend against attack, assurances are a promise not to attack. Ukraine and North Korea are examples of security assurances – guarantees are NATO-like commitments.<br />
Efron, 2003 (Sonni, Previous Pacts May Inspire Deal on North Korea, Los Angeles Times, October 22, lexis)<br />
The second deal that might be considered … but we haven’t done it with enemies.” Pfaltzgraff said.<br />

Kritik- capitalism with some imperialism links<br />
<br />
The USFG isn’t pursuing the plan as a matter of choice, not because they are unaware of the harms. The affs “we should” mentality makes them part of the bootlicking intelligentsia who assume:<br />
<br />
that the US imperialism, war mongering, and oppression are merely a “mistake” and<br />
that the USFG actually gives a shit what they think:<br />
herod 2001, “a stake, not a mistake: on not seeing the enemy”<br />
<br />
I spent several years in the…to see another way<br />
<br />
The plans rejection of the bush administration imperial war-mongering is an attempt to return to the “velvet glove’ which hides the mailed fist of imperialism. The interests of capital support the aff, to better control the world. Such management will also fail to stop global chaos—the harms of the aff just point to the fundamental contradiction of capital<br />
<br />
Wallerstein 2003 “U.S. weakness and the Struggle for Hegemony”<br />
<br />
Enter the hawks. The hawks…which they rely<br />
<br />
The drive for hegemonic imperialism is inevitable according to the logic of capitalism—only the alternative avoids multiple scenarios of inevitable extinction<br />
<br />
Foster 2005 (john bellamy, monthly review, September, vol 57, iss 4 “naked imperialism”)<br />
<br />
From the longer view offered…the new naked imperialism<br />

Our alternative is to not do the aff- capitalist relations should be withdrawn from and rejected, we must stop participating in rescue operations for capital<br />

Regardless of our alts solvency, we have an ethical obligation to get over capitalism—our utopian thinking is key to resistance and transcendence<br />
