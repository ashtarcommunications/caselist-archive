 The United States federal government should increase its constructive engagement by committing to the Islamic Republic of Iran that the United States will: forgo use of force to change borders or government; end unilateral sanctions, reestablish diplomatic relations, settle all bilateral claims, and work in pursuit of common economic interests; terminate designation as a state sponsor of terror; commence an ongoing strategic dialogue; in exchange for the Islamic Republic of Iran’s government committing to: definitively address concerns about its nuclear fuel cycle activities, including providing full transparency and ratifying and implementing the Additional Protocol; issue a statement expressing support for United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 337, including affirmation of a two-state solution; work toward Hezbollah’s transformation into an exclusively political and social organization and press Palestinian opposition groups to stop violent action, through stopping the provision of training, supplies, and funds to organizations designated as terrorist organizations by the United States; commence an ongoing human rights dialogue with the United States, including representatives from nongovernmental organizations in both countries; and to work with the United States in ensuring a stable, democratic Iraq.<br />

Acceptance should require that the entire package be agreed upon initially, with specific negotiations to follow.<br />
