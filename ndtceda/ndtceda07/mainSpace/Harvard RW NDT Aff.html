The filiation between…anti-universalist argument.<br />
Only the perm solves – realist caution is key<br />

In this section…them more coherent.<br />
Alt can’t solve – e/I neg better reps, aff is still challenging larger reps which are more entrenched<br />

Abstract K fails – policy is key<br />

Although Devetak’s…theory and peace.<br />
Dominant reps k/t action<br />
Bilgin<br />

Scenario evaluation is key – pure kritik is insufficient<br />
Michael Williams, 2005, the realist tradition and the limits of international relations, 165-7<br />

<strong><em>Answers To Off Case Args</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>T QpQ - Answers on caselist</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>CP (PIC out of &quot;regime&quot;)</em></strong><br />
1. Turn – linguistic change strategies fail, offending terms will just be replaced by ones that seem benign but they’ll be used to justify the same practices. Zizek ’99 (Slaboj, <em>The Ticklish Subject</em> p. 253-54. “Take politically correct probing… inflicting wounds on himself.”)<br />
2. Turn – resignification—the refusal to turn dominant language against itself is politically paralyzing dogmatism that precludes critical interrogation. Butler ’97 (Judith, <em>Excitable Speech</em> p 162. “Such dogmatism appears….that we keep in question?”)<br />
3. Turn—their K’s totalizing position shuts down movements—endorsing both strategies for change creates space for an activist politics. Krishna ’93 (Sankaran, Alternatives, Summer, p 400-401. “Chaloupka centers this difference….impact on such an activist politics.”)<br />
4. Turn—quibbling over undecidable language choices diverts use from real issues and blocks social change. Churchill ’96 (Ward, “Semantic Masturbation on the Left,” <em>From A Native Son,</em> p 460. “There can be little doubt….effecting positive social change.”)<br />
5. Attempt at controlling speech betrays politics for moralism, precludes thoughtful discussion of the terms…etc. Brown ’01 (Wendy, Politics Out of History, p 35. “Speech codes kill critique…historically specific social powers.”<br />
6. Their reduction of oppression to passive utterances obfuscates the material circumstances of people’s lives…actively tradesoff with real politics by reducing it to a matter of discursive policing. Brown ’01, same cite as above, p 30. “But moralistic reproaches…don’t mourn, moralize.”<br />
7. SQ = regime change. Bush is still seeking regime change in Iran. Leverett and Mann 12/7/07. (Flynt and Hilary, “Bush’s real lie about Iran,” lexis. “Unfortunately, when the Bush… remains unrealized.”)<br />
<strong><em>India deal</em></strong><br />
1. Nuke deal threatening india’s coalition – collapse the Indian government. The Korea Herald 3/26/08. “India’s growing security….legitimate nuclear states.”<br />
2. India wont advance the deal without support of the left parties. The Statesman 3/26/08. (“India today said it would not…yet to be resolved.”<br />
3. Hyde Act compliance blocks deal. The Press Trust of India 3/24/08. (“The Left parties, stoutly…no success with communist leaders.”)<br />
4. Left parties won’t support it. The Daily Telegraph 3/19/08. (“India’s foreign minister was…in New Delhi on Monday.”)<br />
