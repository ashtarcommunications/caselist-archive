Round 7<br />
<br />
Trade Advantage<br />
<br />
The US is moving to tighten Iran sanctions—this will trigger secondary sanctions against European companies. Inside U.S. Trade ’07 (“Eu, Business Caution against tough Iran sanctions.” 7/20, Lexis. “A new Iran sanctions….terms of the act.”)<br />
<br />
Recent IRGC sanctions will trigger secondary sanctions. Jerusalem Post ’07 (Hillary Leili, “Foreign firms liable to be hit by tough US measures on Iran,” 10/26, Lexis. “The bush administration slapped…to do its business.”<br />
<br />
That causes a US-EU WTO dispute over Iran. Gordon ’07 (Philip, Federal News Service, 10/23, Lexis. “Second, I think we need…progress in that regard.”<br />
<br />
This causes a trade war collapsing US trade leadership and the WTO. Financial Times ’98 (“Iran presents a no-win situation,” 1/22. “As the time available…policy towards Tehran.”)<br />

WTO Solves nuclear war – Copley News Service 99 (12/1, WBW. “For decades, many…be celebrating it”)<br />
<br />
Gas Advantage<br />
<br />
Opposition to US pressure has become a bargaining chip for Russia to block natural gas exports thru Iran—this allows Russia to maintain a gas monopoly and political leverage over Europe including Ukraine – Howard ’07 (Roger, “Iran Oil: The New Middle East Challenge to America, p 108-109. “Besides seeking to export…foreseeable future.”)<br />
<br />
That will collapse democracy in Ukraine (Daily Telegraph ’07. Con Coughlin, “Russia on the march—again”, 4/13. Lexis. “The new Cold War…their former occupiers.”<br />
<br />
Combination of Russian aggression/stalled democracy causes war in Eastern Europe – Morz and Pabliuk ’96 (John, Foreign Affairs. “Ukraine: Europe’s linchpin. Vol 75 Iss 3. “With a landmasss….crisis and ecological disasters.”)<br />

<br />
European dependence on Russian energy is triggering increased biofuel use – IHT 2/7/08 (Elisabeth Rosenthal, “Studies conclude that biofuels are not so green.” “While it is important…with input from industry.”)<br />
<br />
Reducing dependence on Russia is the key factor. IPS ’07 (David Cronin, “EU: European commission acknowledges downside of biofuels,” 7/3. “Kaat said cecological…result of biofuel production.”<br />
<br />
EU is moving on biofuels now—dependence on Russia is a key consideration. The Jakarta Post ’06 (“GOVT looking into diversified energy sourcing amid oil crisis,” 6/7. “Meanwhile, the European”…”the electricity plants.”)<br />
<br />
<br />
EU is the key global market for biofuels – AFX ’07 (“Biofutures Intl Plc – Final results” 6/21. “Today’s key market…2020 for biofuel use.”)<br />
<br />
Expanding use of biofuels=runaway warming – Mombiot ’07 (George, “The Western Appetite for biofuels is causing starvation in the poor world,” 11/6. “In principle, burning…runaway climate change.”)<br />
<br />
Warmingà extinction – Brandenburg and Paxson ‘99<br />
<br />
“One can imagine”…”hardy microbes surviving.”<br />
<br />
Biofuel spikes cause food spikes—triggers war in Mexico and South Asia. Chalder ’07 (Chris, “The biofuel hoax is causing a world food crisis!” 12/19. “Dramatic increases in food prices…bullets and bombs.”)<br />
<br />
Indo-Pak nuclear war à xtn – Caldicott ’02 “The use of Pakistani…most life on earth.”<br />
<br />
Mexico civil war causes collapse of US influence in Latin America – Tobin ’06 (Rick, “The Coming Civil War in Mexico,” 4/29. “IN a fast moving…latin America links.”)<br />
<br />
That causes global war<br />
<br />

No link—Plan doesn’t say it is OK for the US to have uclear weapons or that some people aren’t able to handle or control them. We only say nuclear weapons are dangerous, especially in environments with short distances and historical animosity and we shouldn’t encourage their spread.

<strong>T- constructive engagement</strong><br />
Counter interp—constructive engagement is conditional<br />
Chester A. Crocker 89, “Southern Africa: Eight Years Later”, Foreign Affairs, Fall, l/n<br />
Prefer our interp<br />
Ground—ensures aff flexibility and advantage creativity avoiding sterile plan mechanisms—also provides better neg link ground for perception, internal regime ars and diplomatic process disads and cps<br />
Literature---they write grand bargain out of the topic---means they moot the most predictable and wiedely researched Iran proposal in the context engeatement—deestroys relevant dedu and proves their interpreation is arbitrary which flips ground and predictablilty<br />
Limits---they make every aff unconditional meaning they will always lose to the ocndition on not striking Israel or condition on not striking the US cps---makes it impossible to be aff against Iran<br />
Don’t vote on competing interps---leads to a race to botom of mnor distinctions which the 1AR can’t cover and leads to substance crowd-out which destroys edu—fluctuatioins in the case list are inevitable due to advantages which means our offense would o/w minor changes in neg strat<br />
<strong>CP</strong><br />
Conditioning cps are bad and a voting issue<br />
Crushes predictability---there are a virtually unlimited number of demands they could put on the Iranian gov in domestic and foreign policy, as well as conditioning on other courntries and changes in the manner of negotiations –makes it impossible for us to research and gneerate offense and skews debate massively neg<br />
Ground loss—steals all 1ac forcing us to start over with new advantages and solvencey in the 2ac---mooting the 1ac is a rigged game if we have ypothetical ground like say not, ther is no comparatie lit on the plan v. the cp which leads to arbitrary and bad debates<br />
Leads to bdad plan writing---makes affs deliberatley shaday about any negotiations and do stupid stuff like remove puid pro puos from the plan which is net worse for neg ground<br />
Counterinterp---they get andy cp that doesn’t’ compete by severing the crtainty or mmediacy of the plan<br />
Perm: do the cp—perm is legit<br />
Functionally—competition assumes we have to defend ertainty which is at best normal means---severing normal means is bad b/c it leads to subjective competition<br />
Textrually---cps should compete textrually an functionally---this is key to check judge intervention and prevent shady imlicitly competitive cps<br />
Perm: do both---perm useds the cp to clarify the nature of the aff off er as existing under the conditions of the cp<br />
Perm: do cp---if Iran says no do the plan—perm is legit b/c it defends a security guarantee if Iran agrees to te plan---plust it is key to test the certaintly of the condition in the cp whcich is reciprocal to all their justifications ---our interp is that timeframe perms are leti if they test the severance of certainty and do one action immediately following another<br />
No civil war-agitators understand that a civil war will not help their causes.<br />
