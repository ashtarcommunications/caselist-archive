Soccer challenges the American political structure is it not baseball or fottball and apple pie- it is the sport of the radically dispossessed and politically exiled<br />

Globalization is inevitable—the question is whether its dominated by authoritiarian or cosmopolitanism<br />
Kaldor 2K (Mary, Centre for the study of global governance, Londong school of economics- “cosmopolitanism and organized violence” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theglobalsite.ac.uk/press/010kaldor.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.theglobalsite.ac.uk/press/010kaldor.htm</a>) <br />
<br />
Globalization cannot be reversed…this implies a global social contract- a global civil society <br />
<br />
Right now America’s choice seems to be the latter- we have taken on isolationist identity that separates us from the global community- our national attitude towards soccer demonstrates our poisonous sense of American exceptionalism <br />
<br />

(Andrei S., and Steven L, Andrei, Offsides: Soccer and American Exceptionalism, princeton university press, 2001, p.4-5)<br />
<br />
Soccer failed to gain more than…integration into America<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, America isn’t the only nation having issues with soccer- the Afghan education system has failed to fully integrate spots into the schools<br />

Reversing our attitude towards soccer traverses American exceptionalism and embraces cosmopolitanism- changing our attitude towards the global sport will transform globalization into a peaceful force for the United States and Islamic Nations<br />

<br />
Why is soccer so despised in America?...make soccer fans out of Americans<br />
<br />
Our patriotic fervor for American identity as exemplified by our national pastime, baseball, are dangerous- we must pursue cosmopolitan ideas that place us equally amongst the global economy<br />
<br />
Nussbaum 96(Martha, Brown philosopher “Patriotism and Cosmopolitanism” For Love of country: debating the limits of patriotism, ed, pp.3-5) <br />
<br />
Embracing an attitude of cultural cosmopolitanism is key to laying the infrastructure for institutional cosmopolitanism and overcoming malignant forms of nationalism<br />
<br />

Cosmopolites are critical…the age of cosmopolitanism<br />
<br />
Our new sense of global consciousness if key to overcoming malignant nationalism- there will bever be true peace until we accept our part in the global citizenry<br />
<br />
Rouche 1997 World Citizenship: Allegiance to Humanity p.139-141<br />
<br />
Loyalty to all humankind…peace in the family<br />
<br />
However, our participation in the global community does not preclude our memberiship in our national communities- soccer unifies societies on the local and national levels and erases social cleavages<br />
<br />
Giulianotti 99<br />
(Richard, Lecturer in Sociology; Football: A sociology of the global game p.14-5)<br />
Issues such as solidarity….civic and national level<br />
<br />
Soccer is essential to solving the issues of unity on the national and international levels- soccer is a vehicle for change that helps the US and Islamis world to navigate the complex economic, political, and cultural implications of globalization<br />

The sport was encouraged widely…a return to secular nationalism<br />
<br />
Soccer is the greatest possible<br />
Perina 2007 (Rubin Soccer and Life, Americas English edition vol. 59 Jan-Feb 2007)<br />
<br />
Soccer like other team sports…using soccer as an instrument for peace and in the fight against racism and child poverty. <br />

Thus we stand resolved that the United states federal government should substantially increase its constructive engagement with the government of afghanistan by substantially increasing financial assistance to the afghanistan ministry of education to establish youth football programs in the schools, so long as they abide by the “soccer for all” policy.<br />
<br />
Funding and enforcement through normal means-speeches and cross x will clarify intent<br />
<br />
We must question the reasoning behind America’s withdrawl from international soccer. We have lived in solation from the worlds most popular sport for centuries. This is a direct manifestation of American Exceptionalism.<br />

”the question, of course.. the most dominant european sport, soccer.”<br />

Today we are standing at the crossroads-we ar moving forward down the trail of globalization-the choice is ours whether or not our final destination is oppression or liberation-it is not a question of how do we stop it-it is a question of how we shape it<br />

finally, soccer is the greatest thing possible for the global community-it promotes values that are essential to the successful development of individuals and nationa,s in addition to being an effective tool to build peace and fight agasint racism<br />

embracing soccer allows us to examine the impact of globalization of the world-it allowsus to imagine a world consumed in conflict, which conversely allows for alternatives to war.<br />
