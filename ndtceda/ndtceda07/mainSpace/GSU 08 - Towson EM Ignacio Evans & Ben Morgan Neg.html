<br />
Caselist Towson EM—story is more of “black rage” than black aesthetic—the advocacy statement makes it clear as to why this is the case. Their main beef with displaced ethics is that our alternative is functionally doing nothing—we merely accept that we are the problem. For the aff to solve the project, they say, there must actually be black rage performance—i.e., we have to read poetry or buck hegemonic discourses. <br />
<br />
They also emphasized heavily authenticity—that’s a reason the “perm” backfires<br />
