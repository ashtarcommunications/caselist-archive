EU Sanctions Counterplan (Iran)<br />
Text varies – crux of the counterplan is the EU threat to impose heavy sanctions on Iran unless plan condition is met.<br />

The European Union is much better equipped than the US to exert leverage on Iran; the counterplan would threaten to shut down its economy in a matter of months.<br />

Security K<br />
Security threats do not emerge independently, they are a product of a new relationship between the agency of the US and whatever it sees fit for preservation at the time. This biopolitical move requires constant conflict and killing for the sake of promoting life elsewhere.<br />
