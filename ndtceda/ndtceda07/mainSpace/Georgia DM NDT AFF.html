Plan Text<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should offer the government of Syria a substantial increase in foreign assistance for refugees from Iraq on the condition that Syria allows refugees from Iraq into Syria, with the option of staying in Syria.<br />
<br />
1ac w/ cites<br />
<br />
Cont 1 – Assistance Now<br />
<br />
Foreign assistance across the board<br />
<br />
Lobe 12-20-07 IPS “Politics-US: Congress clears more funds for both war and relief”<br />
<br />
“Racing to adjourn…Bush had requested.”<br />
<br />
Afghanistan and Sudan<br />
<br />
Lobe above<br />
<br />
“The bill provides…violence-torn Sudanese region.”<br />
<br />
There’s more to this description of the squo than just uniqueness – given the way it’s increasing, it’s crucial to investigate the politics of who the US decides to aid – and who it doesn’t<br />
<br />
These decisions made in the context of war planning – our designation of Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism have forced Syria to close their doors to Iraqi refugees<br />
<br />

<br />
“This week, the last door…policy and once again welcome the refugees.”<br />
<br />
Cont 2 – Fear and Loathing in Damascus<br />
<br />
Refusal to aid Syria reflects neglect of US responsibility for invading Iraq<br />

<br />
“The near-blind eye…mitigated and controlled.”<br />
<br />
America’s lack of concern for Iraqi refugees is a cold, malicious calculus<br />
<br />

“I am grateful to…in far larger numbers.”<br />

US views Iraqis as the disposable byproducts of a Middle East remade in our vision of freedom and democracy<br />

Impact is limitless war<br />

Anthony Burke 05 “Freedom’s Freedom: American Enlightenment and Permanent War” Social Identities Vol 11 July<br />
<br />
“In this light, we can…foundational transgression of human hubris.”<br />
<br />
Must take collective responsibility for wars fought in our name – intervention only occurs because we don’t take responsibility<br />
<br />
Patrick Hayden 07 March, Millennium Journal of International Studies<br />
<br />
“In Collective Responsibility (1968)…in the ‘world common to all people.’”<br />
<br />
Only including perspectives of those who bear the costs of our political decisions can challenge ideology<br />
<br />
Hayden<br />

“Second, we can also draw…the lives of millions.”<br />
<br />
Cont 3 – Solvency<br />
<br />
We must be open to dialogue – strategic rationality is bad and feels no consequence from its actions<br />
<br />
Burke<br />
<br />
“The arguments of Bin Laden and Bush…it annihilates it.”<br />
<br />
US assistance directly to Syria is key to build infrastructure, the normal rules of burden-sharing don’t apply since we started the war in Iraq<br />
<br />
Frelick 11-15-07 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/11/15/iraq17340.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/11/15/iraq17340.htm</a><br />
<br />
“But the solution to this problem…costs in the years to come.”<br />
<br />
In wake of our neglect, Syria has drawn up plans to address the needs of Iraqis, but needs money – the US has funded similar projects in Jordan<br />
<br />
Younes 9-17-07<br />
<br />
“The majority of assistance that Iraqis…need to be developed to facilitate this entire process.”<br />
<br />
A substantial increase in US assistance is key to resettlement<br />
<br />
Pruce 07<br />
<br />
“Unpacking the potential…homes of innocent Iraqis.”<br />
<br />
Thoes concerned with peace both globally and within the ME have a responsibility to advocate both a reframing of the debate ion the Iraq war towardsa a consideration of the consequences felt by refugees<br />
