Geographic Imagination K<br />
<br />
A. Engagement marks the boundaries of humanity… Political Recognition is a part of the political process of Killing for Life. Every inclusion marks the exclusion of those worthy of Death.<br />
Cairo 06<br />
(“The Duty of the Benevolent Master: From Sovereignty to Suzerainty and the Biopolitics of Intervention,”<br />
Heriberto, Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociología, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Alternatives 31 285–311)<br />
<br />
B. Their approach to the phenomena of Violence is deeply flawed:<br />
It misconstrues sovereign power<br />
It is based on aesthetic, epistemic, and ontological habits of Colonial Violence<br />
It fails at explaining the existence of Humanitarian Violence<br />
<br />
Rajaram 06<br />
(Kumar, no shit, Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology, Central European University, Budapest, Hungary “Dystopic Geographies of Empire,” Alternatives 31, 475–506)<br />
<br />
<br />
C. Our Framework: This is not a Floating Pic or a Utopian Alternative- so Put you backfiles away. The world disclosing that’s involved in their Method of Analysis can be challenged SEPARATE FROM any debate about their policy option. Evidence that dismantles their frontline from:<br />

(David, Reader on Political Theory at the University of Southampton, “Re-orienting International Relations: On Pragmatism, Pluralism and Practical Reasoning,” Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Vol. 31, No. 3, pp. 653-673)<br />
<br />
D. Just because our argument occurs at a PRIOR level to their advantage claims doesn’t mean we don’t have a monster impact… It only means that they have nothing to weigh against it. This way of thinking will end all life unless we actively challenge it<br />

<br />
The Links<br />
A. Palestine Links<br />
1. The problems of the 1AC are one of class—every harm they describe is rooted in capitalist exploitation, and their class ignorance forecloses upon a universal workers movement, which is necessary to solve the case<br />
<br />
Vann ’98<br />
(Bill, Socialist Equality Party, “Fifty Years Since Israel’s Founding,” World Socialist Web Site May 29, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wsws.org/news/1998/may1998/isrl-m29.shtml%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/news/1998/may1998/isrl-m29.shtml)</a><br />
<br />
2. The framework of Palestinian liberation only props up the Arab bourgeoise, which will sell out the interests of the people<br />
<br />
Marsden &amp; Gray ‘04<br />
(Chris, news analyst; Barry, editorial board, “Yasser Arafat: 1929-2004,” World Socialist Web Site, November 12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/nov2004/araf-n12.shtml%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/nov2004/araf-n12.shtml)</a><br />
<br />
B. Rights Links<br />
1. Rights discourse is based on a perverted ontology—what is ethical isn’t the rights we need but rather the rights necessary to guarantee the hegemony of liberal market capitalism<br />
<br />
BROWN (Prof Poli Sci at Berkeley) 04<br />
[Wendy, “The Most we Can Hope For: Human Rights and the Politics of Fatalism”, South Atlantic Quarterly, Spring/Summer, p. asp]<br />
<br />
2. Isolating rights is merely a symptom of our material guilt—appeals to be ethical become a stand-in for remedying the fundamental cause of human misery—material inequality. This ensure that oppression will increase<br />
<br />
PEERENBOOM (School of Law @ UCLA) 05<br />
[Randall, “Human Rights, China, and Cross-Cultural Inquiry”, Philosophy East &amp; West, April, v55n]<br />
<br />
C. Their politics<br />
The aff’s focus on the discursive/symbolic reveals the extent to which they have given up on actually challenging the structures of oppression—but far from being a post-cap age in which all social experience is textually produced, it is a material world, and only a material method can account for the ways in which classes create and deploy rhetoric to legitimize capitalist social relations<br />
<br />
CLOUD (Prof of Comm at Texas) 01<br />
[Dana, “The Affirmative Masquerade”, p. online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.acjournal.org/holdings/vol4/iss3/special/cloud.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acjournal.org/holdings/vol4/iss3/special/cloud.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
The Impact<br />
<br />
A. From the perspective of structural kritik, they cannot ‘make things better’—their model of politics exagerates formal politics at the expense of class—only a shift to criticizing the strucutre will create the mass social consciousness ncessary to overcome this failure of politics<br />
<br />
HARNECKER K<br />
[Marta, Dir of MEPLA, Links, p. online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dsp.org.au/links/back/issue16/harnecker.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsp.org.au/links/back/issue16/harnecker.html</a>]<br />
<br />
B. Capitalism instrumentalizes all life—it is the logic that mobilizes and allows their 1AC impact<br />
<br />
DYER-WITHERFORD (professor of Library and Info. Sciences at the U of Western Ontario) 99<br />
[Nick. Cyber Marx: Cycles and Circuits of Struggle in High Technology Capitalism.]<br />
<br />
C. Ethics cannot stand outside of politics—positing the aff as prior to the structural negation of capital is the largest violation of ethics<br />
<br />
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 95<br />
[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, p. 409-410]<br />
<br />
The Alternative<br />
A. Text: Vote Negative to validate and adopt the method of structural/historical criticism that is the 1NC.<br />
<br />
B. This is the only option—method is the foremost political question because one must understand the existing social totality before one can act on it—grounding political contestation outside of labor and surplus labor merely humanizes capital and prevents a transition to a non-oppressive society<br />
<br />
TUMINO (Prof. English @ Pitt) 01<br />
[Stephen, “What is Orthodox Marxism and Why it Matters Now More than Ever”, Red Critique, p. online ]<br />
<br />
C. Resistance to capital must be a total negation—while some inside gains might be possible, they are trumped by the ability of the system to use reforms to re-stabilize capital and marginalize labor as a social alternative<br />
<br />
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 95<br />
[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, p. 738<br />
<br />
D. The permutation is doomed—capitalism is an inertial system and any vestige remaining int eh perm will inevitably spin back up—like a many-headed hydra, it will regenerate with every attempt that attacks the instrument as opposed to the system itself<br />
<br />
KOVEL (Alger Hiss Prof. At Bard) 02<br />
[Joel, The Enemy of Nature, Zed Books, p. 142-3]<br />
<br />
E. Method is the foremost point of departure to any political project—you should evaluate epistemology first because the way you think about problems structures how you respond<br />
