<br />
A. Interpretation-<br />
Engagement is the use of diplomatic tools to elicit co-operative behavior<br />
Victor D. <u>Cha</u>, Gov’t Prof. @ Georgetown, Engaging China: The Management of an Emerging Power, edited by A. Johnston and R. Ross, pg. 36, 19<u>99</u><br />

Constructive supports this<br />
<u>Merriam Webster</u> Dictionary, Online <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/constructive" rel="nofollow">http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/constructive</a><br />
<br />
Main Entry: <u>con·struc·tive</u><br />
3 : <u>promoting improvement or development</u> &lt;constructive criticism&gt;<br />
<br />
B. Violation:<br />
The affirmative team hands incentives over to (insert country) but does nothing to elicit co-operative behavior. The country doesn’t have to do anything in return for the incentives.<br />
C. STANDARDS:<br />
1. GROUND: IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ALL OF OUR SAY NO GROUND AS WELL AS OUR GROUND TO CP OUT OF EFFORTS TO ELICIT CO-OPERATION<br />
2. PREDICTABILITY- ENGAGEMENT IS MORE PREDICTABLE WHEN IT MEANS TO ACTUALLY TRY TO GAIN CO-OPERATION WITH A COUNTRY RATHER THAN JUST GIVE THEM ASSISTANCE OR SECURITY<br />
3. EACH WORD HAS MEANING- BOTH CONSTRUCTIVE AND ENGAGEMENT HAVE MEANING IN THE RESOLUTION AND IF THEY COMBINE TO FORM THE BEST INTERPRETATION YOU MUST ACCEPT IT<br />
4. COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS BEST—GUARANTEES THE DEBATE FOCUSES ON CLASH, AND PROVIDES THE BEST EDUCATION AND FAIRNESS.<br />
D. TOPICALITY IS A VOTING ISSUE FOR REASONS OF JURISDICTION, EDUCATION, AND COMPETITIVE EQUITY.<br />
<br />
<u>Timetable T</u><br />
<br />
A. INTERPRETATION—CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT MUST BE LONG-TERM, STRENGTHEN TIES, AND SET CONDITIONS ON A SPECIFIED TIMEFRAME.<br />
<br />
N. <u>Chan</u>, “Gentle and Slow Persuasion,” <u>Burma Issues Newsletter</u>, v. 6 n. 3, March 19<u>96</u>.<br />
<br />
B. VIOLATION—THE AFFIRMATIVE FAILS TO CREATE A LONG-TERM, VERIFIABLE STRUCTURE FOR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH CLEAR DEADLINES.<br />
<br />
C. REASONS TO PREFER –<br />
<br />
1. GROUND – HAVING A SET TIMEFRAME AND VERIFICATION PROCESS IS ESSENTIAL TO UNIQUENESS, BECAUSE THE AFF CAN ARGUE ENGAGEMENT HAPPENS AFTER OUR SCENARIO.<br />
2. INCLUSIVE AND EXCLUSIVE – OUR DEFINITION ESTABLISHES POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CONDITIONS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT, WHICH ESTABLISHES THE MOST TRANSPARENT LIMITS.<br />
3. PREDICTABILITY– ESTABLISHING A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP BASED ON A VERIFIABLE STRUCTURE GUARANTEES PREDICTABILITY WITHIN THIS ROUND.<br />
4. COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS BEST—GUARANTEES THE DEBATE FOCUSES ON CLASH, AND PROVIDES THE BEST EDUCATION AND FAIRNESS.<br />
<br />
D. TOPICALITY IS A VOTING ISSUE FOR REASONS OF JURISDICTION, AND COMPETITIVE EQUITY.<br />

Capitalism<br />
Kritik – must embrace a Marxist methodology to confront capitalism; must embrace a historical materialism method to completely reject capitalism (Cloud and Mazaros evidence)<br />
Dana Cloud, 2001, “the affirmative masquerade” www.acjournal.org/holdings/vol4/iss3/special/cloud.htm<br />
<br />
Cloud 2003, “Marxism and oppression” talk for regional socialist conference, 4/19/03, online<br />
<br />
Meszaros, 1995, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, p 738<br />
<br />
The ALT: method is the foremost political question b/c one must understand the existing social totality before one can act on it – grounding the sites of political contestation or knowledge outside of labor and surplus value merely serve to humanize capital and prevent a transition to a society beyond oppression<br />
Stephen Tumino, 2001, “what is orthodox Marxism and why it matters now more than ever” Red Critique, online<br />
“any effective political theory…systematic inequality….masquerades as social theory”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FRAMEWORK – 1NC<br />
A. our interp – the aff should present a topical plan of action and defend their policy should be adopted by the USFG<br />
<br />
B. defs<br />
1. the topic is defined by the phrase following the colon – the USFG is the agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters:<br />
Websters 2000 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm</a><br />
<br />
2. resolved expresses intent to implement the plan<br />
American heritage dictionary 2000, www.dictionary.com<br />
<br />
3. should denotes an expectioan of enacting a plan<br />
American heritage dict.<br />
<br />
4. our def excludes action by small political groups or individuals<br />
Blacks Law, 1999 (“federal gov’t)<br />
<br />
C. violation – the aff is not an instrumental affirmation of the resolution<br />
<br />
RTP<br />
1. ground – the aff will always win that the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract – we can only debate the merits of their fw if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation<br />
Michael Ignatieff, Lesser Evils, 2004, p. 20-21<br />
As for moral perfectionism…betray another<br />
<br />
Without predictable grounds debate becomes meaningless and produces pllitical strategy that is wedded to violence and fails to achieve productive change<br />
Ruth Lessi Shively, 2000, Political theory and partisan politics, p. 182-183<br />
The point may seem trite…the act of argumentation<br />
<br />
Lastly, this is an independent reason to vote neg – the fairness of the aff’s advocacy must precede considerations of its merits or else all contestation is meaningless<br />
Shively, 2k, p. 181-182<br />
The requirements given…agreement or harmony<br />
<br />
<br />
Next is topical education – by manipulating the topic to access their political project they skirt debate about the implementation of policies by the gov’t. their education is distrusting of institutional study and pragmatic reform. Even if their intentions are noble, their message results in fascist totalitarianism.<br />
Martin Lewis, Green Delusions, 1992, p. 258<br />
A majority of those born…inconvenient niceties<br />
<br />
Again, this argument is an independent voting issue<br />
Shively, p. 186<br />
To sum up the argument…require these judgments<br />
<br />
<br />
Next is limits – there are limitless contexts or avenues through which they could purport to advocate the plan. Our interp limits debate to promote politically relevant dialogue and structured communication<br />
Donald S. Lutz, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, 2000, p. 39-40<br />
Aristotle notes in the Politics…logical clarity…moral vision of the non-theorist<br />
<br />
<br />
And, exploring predictable limits neutralizes the discursive benefits to debate and renders their advocacy meaningless – only our interp preserves the revolutionary potential of a deliberative activity<br />
Shively, p. 180<br />
Thus far, I have argued…reject civility and democracy<br />
<br />
<br />
Voting Issues –<br />
1. this argument provides a-priori reasons to vote negative. You must use yoru ballot to ratify constraints on discourse to preserve a politically-enabling discussion<br />
Shively, p. 179<br />
To put this point another way…firm support that we can give them<br />
<br />
2. the deliberative implications of their advocacy are an a-priori question – pre-conditions of agreement are necessary for your decision to have any political value<br />
Adolf G. Gundersen, 2000, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p. 104-105<br />
Indirect political engagement…important extent the same question<br />
<br />
Geographic Imagination K<br />
<br />
A. Engagement marks the boundaries of humanity… Political Recognition is a part of the political process of Killing for Life. Every inclusion marks the exclusion of those worthy of Death.<br />

(“The Duty of the Benevolent Master: From Sovereignty to Suzerainty and the Biopolitics of Intervention,”<br />
Heriberto, Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociología, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Alternatives 31 285–311)<br />
<br />
B. Their approach to the phenomena of Violence is deeply flawed:<br />
It misconstrues sovereign power<br />
It is based on aesthetic, epistemic, and ontological habits of Colonial Violence<br />
It fails at explaining the existence of Humanitarian Violence<br />
<br />

(Kumar, no shit, Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology, Central European University, Budapest, Hungary “Dystopic Geographies of Empire,” Alternatives 31, 475–506)<br />
<br />
<br />
C. Our Framework: This is not a Floating Pic or a Utopian Alternative- so Put you backfiles away. The world disclosing that’s involved in their Method of Analysis can be challenged SEPARATE FROM any debate about their policy option. Evidence that dismantles their frontline from:<br />

<br />
D. Just because our argument occurs at a PRIOR level to their advantage claims doesn’t mean we don’t have a monster impact… It only means that they have nothing to weigh against it. This way of thinking will end all life unless we actively challenge it<br />

The Links<br />
A. Palestine Links<br />
1. The problems of the 1AC are one of class—every harm they describe is rooted in capitalist exploitation, and their class ignorance forecloses upon a universal workers movement, which is necessary to solve the case<br />
<br />
Vann ’98<br />
(Bill, Socialist Equality Party, “Fifty Years Since Israel’s Founding,” World Socialist Web Site May 29, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wsws.org/news/1998/may1998/isrl-m29.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/news/1998/may1998/isrl-m29.shtml</a>)<br />
<br />
2. The framework of Palestinian liberation only props up the Arab bourgeoise, which will sell out the interests of the people<br />

<br />
B. Rights Links<br />
1. Rights discourse is based on a perverted ontology—what is ethical isn’t the rights we need but rather the rights necessary to guarantee the hegemony of liberal market capitalism<br />
<br />
BROWN (Prof Poli Sci at Berkeley) 04<br />
[Wendy, “The Most we Can Hope For: Human Rights and the Politics of Fatalism”, South Atlantic Quarterly, Spring/Summer, p. asp]<br />
<br />
2. Isolating rights is merely a symptom of our material guilt—appeals to be ethical become a stand-in for remedying the fundamental cause of human misery—material inequality. This ensure that oppression will increase<br />
<br />
PEERENBOOM (School of Law @ UCLA) 05<br />
[Randall, “Human Rights, China, and Cross-Cultural Inquiry”, Philosophy East &amp; West, April, v55n]<br />
<br />
C. Their politics<br />
The aff’s focus on the discursive/symbolic reveals the extent to which they have given up on actually challenging the structures of oppression—but far from being a post-cap age in which all social experience is textually produced, it is a material world, and only a material method can account for the ways in which classes create and deploy rhetoric to legitimize capitalist social relations<br />
<br />
CLOUD (Prof of Comm at Texas) 01<br />
[Dana, “The Affirmative Masquerade”, p. online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.acjournal.org/holdings/vol4/iss3/special/cloud.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acjournal.org/holdings/vol4/iss3/special/cloud.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
The Impact<br />
<br />
A. From the perspective of structural kritik, they cannot ‘make things better’—their model of politics exagerates formal politics at the expense of class—only a shift to criticizing the strucutre will create the mass social consciousness ncessary to overcome this failure of politics<br />
<br />
HARNECKER K<br />

<br />
B. Capitalism instrumentalizes all life—it is the logic that mobilizes and allows their 1AC impact<br />
<br />
DYER-WITHERFORD (professor of Library and Info. Sciences at the U of Western Ontario) 99<br />
[Nick. Cyber Marx: Cycles and Circuits of Struggle in High Technology Capitalism.]<br />
<br />
C. Ethics cannot stand outside of politics—positing the aff as prior to the structural negation of capital is the largest violation of ethics<br />
<br />
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 95<br />
[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, p. 409-410]<br />
<br />
The Alternative<br />
A. Text: Vote Negative to validate and adopt the method of structural/historical criticism that is the 1NC.<br />
<br />
B. This is the only option—method is the foremost political question because one must understand the existing social totality before one can act on it—grounding political contestation outside of labor and surplus labor merely humanizes capital and prevents a transition to a non-oppressive society<br />
<br />
TUMINO (Prof. English @ Pitt) 01<br />
[Stephen, “What is Orthodox Marxism and Why it Matters Now More than Ever”, Red Critique, p. online ]<br />
<br />
C. Resistance to capital must be a total negation—while some inside gains might be possible, they are trumped by the ability of the system to use reforms to re-stabilize capital and marginalize labor as a social alternative<br />
<br />
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 95<br />
[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, p. 738<br />
<br />
D. The permutation is doomed—capitalism is an inertial system and any vestige remaining int eh perm will inevitably spin back up—like a many-headed hydra, it will regenerate with every attempt that attacks the instrument as opposed to the system itself<br />
<br />
KOVEL (Alger Hiss Prof. At Bard) 02<br />
[Joel, The Enemy of Nature, Zed Books, p. 142-3]<br />
<br />
E. Method is the foremost point of departure to any political project—you should evaluate epistemology first because the way you think about problems structures how you respond<br />
