<br />
The United States federal government should propose and initiate a backchannel negotiation between Syria and Israel. The United States should authorize Israel to enter the talks and negotiate over the return of the Golan Heights. The United States should support Syria in these negotiations, should such an action be necessary to reach a settlement.<br />
<br />
<br />
The US should secretly allow Israel to test Syria’s negotiating position through a back channel and mediate talks over the Golan<br />

The United States federal government should adopt and implement a strategy to establish and strengthen the authority and autonomy of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
