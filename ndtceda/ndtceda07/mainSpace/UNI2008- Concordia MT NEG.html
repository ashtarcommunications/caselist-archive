Case Debate<br />
The aff’s animal welfarism legitimizes and strengthens the system of cruelty they criticize – their objection to ‘inhumane’ slaughter does nothing to affirm the inherent value of non-human life, staving off real change in favor of reforms which only benefits human oppressors<br />

Our alt conceptin of the ballot locates ethical justification for the plan as a leap of faith which represent the condition for possibility of ethics itself.<br />
<br />
Our alt capture all plan an dits pragmatic effects and competes by critiquing their decision to link the justificaitno of the plan to a claim to knowledge<br />
<br />
We must bring into question discourse and the language of representation. Oru alt is an act which responds without knowing, putting undecidability and impossibility of signification intouch with political responsiveness<br />

Only the neg conception of ballot can give ethical con3ent to decision to act. Aff strips action of its calim to ethics and responsibility it is irresponsible and anti-ethical to the core<br />
