Contention 1: Poverty<br />
<br />
American cotton subsidies have forced millions into poverty by driving down the global price of the world’s most popular cash crop<br />
Jayne Thomisee, National Peace Corps Association campaign coordinator and served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Kyrgyzstan, Fall 2k5 (Worldview Magazine Online Vol 18, No 3 “The Cotton Debate” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldviewmagazine.com/issues/article.cfm?id=163&amp;issue=39" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldviewmagazine.com/issues/article.cfm?id=163&amp;issue=39</a>)<br />
Here at home… dependent developing countries<br />
<br />
American subsidies destroy agricultural markets around the globe. Eliminating these trade distortions can repair damage done by boosting GDP and reducing reliance on foreign aid.<br />
Max Borders, adjunct scholar and H. Sterling Burnett, senior fellow with the National Center for Policy Analysis, March 24, 2k6 (National Center for Policy Analysis “Farm Subsidies: Devastating the World's Poor and the Environment” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba/ba547/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba/ba547/</a>)<br />
Subsidized agriculture… of millions of people.<br />
<br />
US cotton subsidies exacerbate poverty around the globe – we have a moral responsibility to reform agricultural policy<br />
Gerson 07 [Michael, Robert Hertog Senior Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations. “Cotton and Conscience” 11/7, Washington Post, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/14730/cotton_and_conscience.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/14730/cotton_and_conscience.html</a>]<br />
But whatever the… of those responsibilities<br />
<br />
Increased revenue from farming would allow developing countries to develop health infrastructures and spend more on environmental protections<br />
Max Borders, adjunct scholar and H. Sterling Burnett, senior fellow with the National Center for Policy Analysis, March 24, 2k6 (National Center for Policy Analysis “Farm Subsidies: Devastating the World's Poor and the Environment” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba/ba547/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba/ba547/</a>)<br />
Indirect Impact… welfare $100 billion.<br />
<br />
Trade is the real cause of famines, not food shortages<br />
George Pyle, editorial writer for the Salt Lake Tribune, 2k5 (Raising Less Corn, More Hell, p. 60-61)<br />
The world as… clearly the problem.<br />
<br />
Decision-making is always ethical. The aff provides meaning to being by incorporating a responsibility to the other<br />
David Campbell, 1993, Politics Without Principle, 92-93<br />
<br />
Ethics mandate the aff since we have a contributory role in this starvation. Since we deny this obligation, we deny the responsibility to the other<br />
Hugh LaFollette, the Cole Chair in Ethics University of South Florida St. Petersburg, 2k3, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stpt.usf.edu/hhl/papers/World.Hunger.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.stpt.usf.edu/hhl/papers/World.Hunger.htm</a><br />
The same economic… some responsibility for their plight<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 2: Brazil<br />
<br />
Brazil is set to take retaliatory actions against US cotton subsidies<br />
AFP, Aug 4, 2k8 (“Brazilian minister threatens court action on US subsidies: report”)<br />
Brazil is prepared …which is subsidies.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
The only way to stop these sanctions is by fully complying with the WTO ruling<br />
New York Times, June 4, 2k8 [AP. “Brazil to Seek Sanctions Over U.S. Cotton Subsidies” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/business/worldbusiness/04cotton.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/business/worldbusiness/04cotton.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss</a>] <br />
Brazil will seek …global cotton market. <br />
<br />
Scenario 1: Trade War<br />
<br />
Sanctions over cotton spillover to cause a trade war<br />
BBC 05 [10/07, &quot;US-Brazil Rift on Cotton Deepens&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/business/4317846.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/business/4317846.stm</a>]<br />
The US has said …maybe others will too.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The impact is nuclear war<br />
Spicer, 1996 economist; member of the British Parliament, [Michael, The Challenge from the East and the Rebirth of the West, p. 121]<br />
The choice facing t…the years ahead.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2: AIDS<br />
<br />
The retaliation will be on intellectual property rights, specifically pharmaceutical patents – allowing Brazil to ignore international law and produce generics <br />
Hirsh 2005 (Jerry, “Trade Battle With Brazil Threatens US Copyrights” Los Angeles Times June 10th 2005) <br />
Entertainment and software …Comargo said.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suspending US intellectual property rights is a huge hit for research and innovation  and ultimately harms pharmaceutical production for major diseases like HIV AIDS <br />
Gerhardsen 2007 (Iren S., “Brazil Takes Steps to Import Cheaper AIDs Drugs Under Trade Law” Intellectual Property Watch”) <br />
“This expropriation of …companies’ commercial interests.”<br />
<br />
Additionally, Pharmaceutical industry innovation is critical to stop AIDS – failure to protect intellectual property dooms this<br />
EFPIA, 2000+ (no date given, European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Assocations. “5 Common Misunderstandings at Patents…” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.efpia.org/2_indust/pharmainnovation.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.efpia.org/2_indust/pharmainnovation.pdf</a>)<br />
Access to drugs in …so desperately needed. <br />
<br />
<br />
And, Left untreated, the spread of AIDS will subject entire continents to dehumanizing deaths, culminating in extinction.<br />
The Jakarta Post, March 6, 2000, pg. – l/n<br />
But his vision, …the human race.<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should eliminate nearly all domestic subsidies for cotton.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eliminating cotton subsidies would improve the lives of people around the globe and restore trade leadership<br />
Oxfam, June 21, 2k7 (Laura Rusu, Senior Press Officer “Reform of US Cotton Subsidies Could Feed, Educate Millions in Poor West African Countries” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/press_releases/archive2007/reform-of-us-cotton-subsidies-could-feed-educate-millions-in-poor-west-african-countries" rel="nofollow">http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/press_releases/archive2007/reform-of-us-cotton-subsidies-could-feed-educate-millions-in-poor-west-african-countries</a>)<br />
Substantial reform …trade negotiations.<br />
<br />
And only the plan gives the international signal that the US is committed to free trade – nobody will budge on conditions absent this gesture first<br />
Domain-B, 17 June 2k8 (Domain-B.com “World trade deal just a dollar away, says Kamal Nath” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.domain-b.com/organisation/wto/20080617_kamal_nath.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.domain-b.com/organisation/wto/20080617_kamal_nath.html</a>)<br />
India and other …US farm subsidies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Congress empirically makes concessions to comply with WTO rulings on cotton<br />
US Trade Representative, Feb 1, 2k6 (“Congress Approves Legislation Repealing Cotton Subsidy Program” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2006/February/Congress_Approves_Legislation_Repealing_Cotton_Subsidy_Program.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2006/February/Congress_Approves_Legislation_Repealing_Cotton_Subsidy_Program.html</a>)<br />
Today, the U.S. House …critical issues.
