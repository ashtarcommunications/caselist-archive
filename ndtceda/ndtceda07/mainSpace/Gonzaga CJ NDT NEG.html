t- qpq<br />
<br />
aspec- don’t spec the agent of aganistan<br />
<br />
k- antinuclear activism represses an irrational desire for the bomb critisicm that falls within the paramteres of logical analysis remains devoted to the bomb<br />
<br />
chernus, 91, ira, nuclear madness: on religion and psychology in the nuclear age, page 185-187<br />
<br />
the affirmatives fascination with the bomb becomes a worship of all destructive technology, and constantly pushes us to raise the stakes to keep death interesting. All of us become cogs in a grand nuclear machine wthat rewards us for our devotion only by grinding us to death; first metaphorically, and then literally<br />
<br />
chernus, 86 [ira, dr. strangegod, page 136- 140]<br />
<br />
our alternative is to accept richmond’s declaration of impending world wars, global proliferation and middle east instability. We should the image of a policymaker and affirm our inability to prevent death and our complicity in evil through despair, vote negative to give death its due.<br />
<br />
Demo Promo DA-<br />
<br />
Demo promo is on the retrat- low us cred in the middle east is forcing a more limited approach<br />
<br />
Ian trayor, june 6 2007, the London guardian<br />
<br />
George bush last night south to breathe new life……….criticism and denunciation.<br />
<br />
The perception of the US as assosicated with civilian casualties makes democracy promotion possible- the plan restores the credibility necessary to promote democracy<br />
<br />
Christian science monitor, may 20, 2004<br />
<br />
Across the region, we’ve encountered increasing reservations……….in Iraq and around the globe.<br />
<br />
Democracy promotiuon is built on a crusader mentality bent of eradicating any state that doesn’t conform to American demand<br />
<br />
Christpher layne, 2006 [the peace of illusions: American grand strategy from 1940 to the present, page 121-122]<br />
<br />
Just as American policymakers fear that……..and nondemocratic states.<br />
<br />
<br />
CP<br />
<br />
the United State federal government should increase its constructive engagement with the current national governing entity in the former kingdom of khorasan by offering them a security guarantee not to use depleted uranim munitions against khorasan and by offering them a substantial increase in assistance that includes all necessary resources and funding to enforce US army regulation 700-48, including conducting a systematic risk assessment of the areas exposed to depleted uranium and the decontamination and clean-up of areas affected by depleted uranium<br />
<br />
the word afganistan litteraly means lanf od the pashtuns which explicitly marginalizes and ignores the numerous other culture heritages of the region this has lead to constant cycles of internal conflict<br />
<br />
Nichols, 5 [Robert, “afghan historiography: classical study, conventional narrative, national polemic”, history compass 3 as141, 1-16]<br />
<br />
Before the colonial powers got their hands on the region this land was called khorasan, an identity that all the ethnic groups could reate to. Only a complete rejection of the term Afghanistan end embracing khorasan can bring the county together<br />

<br />
Threat construction is good * Burke 98<br />
<br />
Should make predictions * Kurasawa 4<br />

T: CE = QPQ<br />
<br />
Vio – doesn't require a change from P.O.'s behavior<br />
<br />
CP – “Human” PIC<br />

Block Strategy:<br />
<br />
<br />
2NC takes F/W, T<br />
<br />
F/W:<br />
<br />
AT Personal Politics -- USFG = gov't in Washington DC (2 cards)<br />
<br />
Just have to defend an endpoint – we still allow for your interpretation, just have to be more than that<br />
<br />
Not real world in the political<br />
<br />
Purely local bad * Mobin 4<br />
<br />
Traditional policy debate key to education, effective policymaking by gov't * Broudy 6<br />
<br />
Kaplar assumes USFG is never responsible – but they can be responsible for violence<br />
<br />
Shapiro evidence just says aff choice with a card behind it – skews neg, no way to answer<br />
<br />
Shapiro isn't in context of aff<br />
<br />
QPQ:<br />
<br />
Endpoint / behavior change must be in the plan text<br />
<br />
QPQ ensures the action by USFG is substantial<br />
<br />
1NR takes CP<br />
<br />
Defining human simultaneously defines non-human – this definition is unstable – allows re-interpretation --&gt; violence<br />
<br />
No evidence defends the notion of “human.”<br />
<br />
HR depoliticize the issue<br />
<br />
AT Perm- Chernus '1<br />
<br />
2nr Strategy:<br />
<br />
<br />
Answers conditionality on F/W and then goes for the CP<br />
