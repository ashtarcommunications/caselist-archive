LEBANON TODAY IS STANDING ON THE CLIFF’S EDGE FACING OBLIVION.<br />
<br />
SUCKED INTO THE BLACK HOLE OF POVERTY AND DESPAIR CREATED BY THE INFLUX OF CAPITAL AND GLOBALIZATION, POOR SOCIAL CONDITIONS TURNED INTO SOCIETAL ALIENATION. THIS ALIENATION FED OFF OF THE MILITARIZATION OF IDENTITIES THAT WAS BEING PROMOTED BY THE VARIOUS IMPERIAL POWERS.<br />
<br />
CAUGHT IN THE DESPERATE POSITION BETWEEN GLOBALIZATION AND COLONIAL DOMINATION, THE LEBANESE STATE QUICKLY DETERIORIATED, CREATING A VOID THAT WAS QUICKLY FILLED BY SECTARIAN MILITIAS.<br />
<br />
THESE MILITARIZED FACTIONS WERE FORMED TO PROTECT THE INTEREST OF VARIOUS GROUPS EXCLUDED FROM LEBANESE SOCIETY BY THE FORCES OF CAPITALISM AND POWER POLITICS AND WERE FUNDED BY OTHER REGIONAL POWERS IN AN ATTEMPT TO COUNTER-BALANCE THE IMPERIALISM OF THE WEST.<br />
<br />
IN LIGHT OF THIS HISTORY, THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT NOW FACES A CHOICE OF WHETHER TO FIGHT FOR THE WELFARE OF EVERYONE LIVING IN LEBANON, OR SLOWLY AND VIOLENTLY EXIT THE WORLD STAGE LIKE THE NEIGHBORING BALKANS.<br />
<br />
RATHER THAN MAKE A SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO LEBANESE RECONSTRUCTION, THE UNITED STATES, ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL ARCHITECTS AND PERPETRATORS OF BEIRUT’S DEMISE – SITS ON THE SIDELINES – QUIETLY AMBIVALENT SO LONG AS NO DANGER COMES TO ITS ISRAELI FRIENDS.<br />

<strong><u>OBESERVATION ONE: INHERENCY AND HARMS</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>ADVANTAGE ONE: WOMEN'S RIGHTS</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>SCENARIO A: AFGHANISTAN</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>WOMEN IN AFGHANISTAN HAVE NOT BEEN &quot;LIBERATED&quot; – THEY SUFFER SYSTEMATIC RAPE, ABUSE, AND SEVERE HEALTH PROBLEMS – THE BEST WEAPON AGAINST THIS OPPRESSION IS EDUCATION</strong><br />
South China Morning Post, 12-12-05, Ravina Shamdasani, lexis<br />
&quot;an afghan rights activist…fathers, husbands and sons.&quot;<br />

<strong>VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING – NOW IS THE KEY TIME TO ACT</strong><br />
Feminist Majority Foundation, 2007 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.feminist.org/" rel="nofollow">www.feminist.org</a>)<br />
&quot;Five years after the fall…take away their rights.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS AN OBLIGATION TO ENSURE AFGHAN WOMEN ARE FREE FROM ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE AND HAVE A RIGHT TO EDUCATION – THE AFGHAN WOMEN EMPOWERMENT ACT IS KEY</strong><br />
Representative Carolyn Maloney, 2006 (empowering afghan women and girls, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://maloney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1113&amp;itemid=61" rel="nofollow"> http://maloney.house.gov/index .php?option=com_content&amp;task �0�view&amp;id�1�1113&amp;itemid=61</a> )<br />
&quot;Women's rights in Afghanistan…Afghan Women Empowerment Act is passed.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong><u>SCENARIO B: WOMEN OF THE WORLD</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>AFGHANISTAN</strong> <strong>IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW US UNIVERSALIST RHETORIC OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROMOTION IGNORES WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN PRACTICE</strong><br />
Hallock, 2005 (Meghan, William and mary journal of women and the law, lexis)<br />
&quot;President George W. Bush…eyes of the law.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>LACK OF RECOGNITION FOR THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN UNDERPIN THE ROOTS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT</strong><br />

&quot;For decades Dr. Sima Samar…the Afghan people,&quot; she said.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong><u>ADVANTAGE TWO: POSITIVE PEACE</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>THE RHETORIC OF LIBERATING THE WOMEN OF AFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN CO-OPTED THROUGH THE LOGIC OF MASCULINIST PROTECTION TO RALLY SUPPORT FOR MILITARISTIC FOREIGN POLICY – THIS ONLY SERVES TO REPRODUCE DIRECT AND STRUCTURAL VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</strong><br />
Armstrong and Prashad, 2005 (Elizabeth and Vijay, The New Centennial Review, project Muse)<br />
&quot;War has never been men's work…for U.S. military invasions.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>CURRENT NOTIONS OF SECURITY UNDERSTAND WAR AS AN ISOLATED EVENT DETACHED FROM THE STATUS QUO FRAMEWORK OF NEGATIVE PEACE – THIS ONTOLOGY PERPETUATES CRISIS POLITICS THAT ENTRENCH GLOBAL MILITARISM – ONLY A COMMITMENT TO POSITIVE PEACE CAN CHALLENGE OMNIPRESENT MILITARISM</strong><br />
Chris J. <strong><u>Cuomo</u></strong>, 19<strong><u>96</u></strong>, activist, artist, and Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at the University of Cincinnati, author of The Philosopher Queen: Feminist Essays on War, Love, and Knowledge, &quot;War Is Not Just an Event: Reflections on the Significance of Everyday Violence!&quot; hypatia, 1996, Proquest<br />
&quot;Philosophical attention to war…inevitability of war and militarism.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>THIS RELIANCE ON WAR AS THE ULTIMATE TOOL OF FOREIGN POLICY MAKES HUMAN EXTINCTION INEVITABLE</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>POLICY ACTION TO FUND GOVERNMENTAL AND GRASSROOTS WOMEN'S ORGANIZATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN INCORPORATES FEMINIST CRITIQUES INTO MAINSTREAM SECURITY DISCOURSES AND IS CRITICAL TO THE REJECTION OF THE CREEPING MILITARIZATION OF SECURITY DISCOURSES</strong><br />
<br />
Susan <strong><u>McKay</u></strong>, 200<strong><u>4</u></strong>, <em>Conflict and Human Security: A Search for New Approaches of Peace-building</em>, Chapter 7, &quot;Women, Human Security, and Peace-building: A Feminist Analysis,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://home.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/heiwa/Pub/E19/Chap7.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://home.hiroshima-u.ac.jp /heiwa/Pub/E19/Chap7.pdf</a><br />
&quot;In recognizing the current…and women's human security.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>PLAN:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONSTRUCTIVELY ENGAGE THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN, SPECIFICALLY THE MINISTRY OF WOMEN'S AFFAIRS, AND OFFER FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AS PER THE AFGHAN WOMEN EMPOWERMENT ACT</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>OBSERVATION TWO: SOLVENCY</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>THE AFGHAN WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT ACT IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR AFGHAN WOMEN TO SUCCESSFULLY PROMOTE THEIR OWN BRAND OF FEMINISM</strong><br />

&quot;Now, I'm not trying to say…email to your representative directly.&quot;<br />
<br />
CONSTRUCTIVELY ENGAGING THE MINISTRY OF WOMEN'S AFFAIRS GIVES WOMEN A SEAT AT THE TABLE – THIS COMBINED WITH U.S. ASSISTANCE TO WOMEN'S CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS CAN IMPROVE CRITICAL AREAS SUCH AS EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE<br />
<strong><u>SHAMLEY</u></strong>, PhD, Afghani prof of cultural anthropology at the University of Western Michigan, <strong><u>NO DATE GIVEN</u></strong> [Zieba Shorish-Shamley, &quot;Afghan Women in Peace Processes&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wapha.org/peace.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.wapha.org/peace.pdf</a>]<br />
&quot;Within the peace initiative…skill building, advocacy and development.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>WOMEN'S GROUPS ARE GAINING POLITICAL MOMENTUM BUT ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND BROADER RESOURCES ARE CRITICAL TO THEIR SUCCESS</strong><br />
Hassan, 2007 (palwasha, Women's Empowerment in Post Conflict Afghanistan, <u>Scratching the Surface: Democracy, Traditions, Gender</u>)<br />
&quot;Through the creation of these…involvement in the reconstruction processes.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>SUPPORTING THE AFGHAN MINISTRY OF WOMEN'S AFFAIRS IS CRITICAL TO ITS PERFORMANCE AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF GLOBAL COALITIONS TO COMBAT OPPRESSION OF WOMEN – NOT ONLY CREATES POLICY TO SUPPORT THE EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN BUT ALSO CHECKS VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, SUPPORTS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, GRASSROOTS NGOs AND ACCESS TO EDUCATION</strong><br />
BBC Worldwide Monitoring, 10-4-06 lexis<br />
&quot;The media informed the public…welfare like other countries do.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong><u>OBSERVATION THREE: METHODOLOGY</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>TRADITIONAL POLICY ANALYSIS IGNORES THE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH POLICIES ARE MADE – ONLY EXAMINING THE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR ACTION CAN BOTH CREATE POSITIVE ACTION AND PROVIDE A LOCUS FOR CHANGE</strong><br />
Jochem 2001, (Center for Energy policy and economics in zurich, <u>society, behavior and climate change mitigation</u>)<br />
&quot;If communication persuasion and the…to dominate a policy debate.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>FAILURE TO INCORPORATE GENDER INTO AN UNDERSTANDING OF VIOLENCE UNDERMINES THE NEGATIVE'S METHODOLOGY AND ENSURES REPLICATION OF THE HARMS</strong><br />
Petersen and Runyan, 1999 (V. Spike and Anne, <u>Global Gender Issues</u>, 2nd ed, 1-3)<br />
&quot;Whenever we study a topic…and potentially disastrous, guides.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>APPLYING GENDERED ANALYSIS TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CHECKS HEGEMONIC MASCULINITY</strong><br />
Tickner, 1992 (J. Ann, <u>Gender in International Relations: Feminist Perspectives on Achieving Global Security</u>, 128-129)<br />
&quot;Inlcuding previously hidden gender…own security has been defined.&quot;
