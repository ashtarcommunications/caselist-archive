<br />
The Plan<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should increase its constructive engagement by committing to the the Islamic Republic of Iran that the United States will:<br />
forgo use of force to change borders or government;<br />
end unilateral sanctions, reestablish diplomatic relations, settle all bilateral claims, and work in pursuit of common economic interests;<br />
terminate designation as a state sponsor of terror;<br />
commence an ongoing strategic dialgoue;<br />
in exchange for the Islamic Republic of Iran’s government committing to:<br />
definitively address concerns about its nuclear fuel cycle activities, including providing full transparency and ratifying and implementing the Additional Protocol;<br />
issue a statement expressing support for United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 337, including affirmation of a two-state solution;<br />
work toward Hezbollah’s transformation into an exclusively political and social organization and press Palestinian opposition groups to stop violent action, through stopping the provision of training, supplies, and funds to organizations designated as terrorist organizations by the United States;<br />
commence an ongoing human rights dialogue with the United States, including representatives from nongovernmental organizations in both countires; <br />
and to work with the United States in ensuring a stable, democratic Iraq.<br />
<br />
Acceptance should require that the entire package be agreed upon initially, with specific negotiations to follow.<br />
<br />
Funding and enforcement are guaranteed.<br />

Contention One: Another Brutal War<br />
<br />
If you voted for Nader because there just wasn’t much of a difference between Gush and Bore… You have got to feel pretty awful right about now.<br />
<br />
And it’s about to get a whole lot worse.<br />
<br />
It’s 2003, the Government of Iran offered a Grand Bargain… offering to reverse policy on most of the complaints that the US has had about its policies. But… it seems that some folks in the administration weren’t interested. Criminally, they chose a path to confrontation instead of opening negotiations.<br />

Plan<br />
<br />
<br />
We believe the United States federal government should accept Iran’s 2003 overture for reconciliation. We should give security guarantees and other forms of constructive engagement to the government of Iran, who would in turn agree to forgo the pursuit for nuclear weapons, abandon support for violent groups, and work for peace.<br />
