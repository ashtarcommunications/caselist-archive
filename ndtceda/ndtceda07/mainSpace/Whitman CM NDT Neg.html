 No national psyche – Spanos says it doesn’t make it true<br />
<br />
Affirmative can’t solve, no spillover claim from debate<br />
<br />
Tons of alt. cause to imperialism<br />
<br />
Completely rejecting humanism is self-marginalizing and disabling to effective coalitional politics<br />
J Russell Perkin, 1993, Theorizing the culture wars<br />
“My final criticism is that Spanos, by his attempt… endorses a coalition of liberalism and the left.”<br />
<br />
Humanism is inescapable<br />
Tony Davies, 1997, humanism, 130-132<br />
“So there will not after all be, nor indeed… even, can that danger be turned aside?”<br />
<br />
Even if it worked in Vietnam, protest will fail – not enough people<br />
Jason Rosenbaum, 2007, are successful protests” the seminal<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theseminal.com/category/political-tactics/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theseminal.com/category/political-tactics/</a><br />
“whether or not veitnam era protests were effective… correspond to dwindling effectiveness”<br />
<br />
The aff’s protest against imperialism is totally ineffective and designed to make them feel good while ignoring the fact that the state doesn’t give a shit<br />
Chelsey Clammer 2007, how nonviolence protects the state, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://feministreview.blogspot.com/2007/07/how-nonviolence-protects-state.html" rel="nofollow">http://feministreview.blogspot.com/2007/07/how-nonviolence-protects-state.html</a><br />
“do anti-war protests really stop the united states… her notions of “activism” and “change””<br />
<br />
Protesting the system is completely ineffectual – they’re the worst form of naïve narcissism and only serve to reinforce a pointless activist lifestyle that reinforces consumer culture<br />
Marc Cooper, 2005, activism and anti-intellectualism, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://marccooper.typepad.com/marccooper/2005/01/activism_and_an.html" rel="nofollow">http://marccooper.typepad.com/marccooper/2005/01/activism_and_an.html</a><br />

Destroy political change<br />
Shipley 1<br />
<br />
Restricting other arguments = revolutionary exception to ideas<br />
Gunnerson 00<br />
<br />
The outward turn destroys activism by forcing debaters to be political before they’ve formed opinions – supporting insular debate creates impulses towards training for more potent politics<br />
Alan Coverstone, MBA guy, 95<br />
“mitchell’s argument underestimates the nature of academic debate… that there are people trying to break out”<br />
<br />
<strong>CP</strong><br />
Text: The United States federal government should dismantle the United States military, and should not intervene in other countries. The United States federal government should publicly apologize for the negative effects of American exceptionalism, and for United States involvement in past wars and atrocities.<br />
<br />
Solves 1AC but doesn’t constructively engage inherent in their advocacy.<br />
Jacob Hornerberger 1992, dismantling america’s military empire, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fff.org/freedom/0792a.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.fff.org/freedom/0792a.asp</a><br />
“as president Dwight d Eisenhower warned us thirty years… military might, but instead the dismantling of it.”<br />
<br />
<strong>K</strong><br />
The subordination of politics to metaphysics renders critical theory irrelevant and constructs an anti-political form of politics that renders political engagement possible<br />
Stephen Eric Bronner 2004, reclaiming the enlightenment: towards a politics of radical engagement p 97-98<br />
“in the shadow of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, critical theory… history rather than metaphysics”<br />
<br />
Especially true in the case of foreign policy. The K boils down to a complaint about US imperialism that provides no alternative political course.<br />
Todd Gitlin, 2006, the intellectuals and the flag, 83-85<br />
“The right’s masterful apparatus for purveying its messages and organizing for power is not… it amounts to secession from the world where most people live”<br />
<br />
Fort Hayes’ failure to hypothesize solutions to imperialism is endemic to a larger gap between the academic and the political that renders their project irrelevant<br />
David McClean 2001 the cultural left and the limits of social hope<br />
www.american-philosopgy.org/archieves/past_conference_programs/pc2001/Discussion%20papers/david_mcclean.htm<br />
“leftist American culture critics might put their considerable talents… front lines of…”<br />
<br />
Failure to engage won’t challenge the system – imperialism and management of global politics will continue dominated by violence ensuring that their K replications orders of power<br />
George Monbiot 2004 manifesto for a new world order, p 11-13<br />
“the quest for global solutions is difficult and divisive. Some members… conditions it requires for its survival.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Politics</strong><br />
No Columbia now<br />
<br />
Bush pushing now, will boost capital<br />
<br />
Columbia FTA is bad<br />
<br />
<strong>CP</strong><br />
“We affirm he topical exile, that, according to Spanos and others, belongs to, is part of and is inside “Resolved: that the United States federal government should increases its constructive engagement with the government of one or more of: Khorasan, Iran, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, and Syria, and it should include offering them a security guarantee(s) and/or a substantial increase in foreign assistance.<br />
<br />
The term Afghanistan is an imperial term that only recognizes pashtuns as legitimate citizens- the impacts are extension of colonialism and civil instability<br />
Ali Maisam Nazary, 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.citynoise.org/article/5471" rel="nofollow">http://www.citynoise.org/article/5471</a><br />
“Even to this day most people did not know when the name… future with civil and sectarian violence”<br />
<br />
Colonization leads to extinction<br />
Robert porter, 1998<br />
“nonetheless, this otherwise natural process… people being colonized to the point of extinction”<br />
<br />
The alternative is the term KHorasan which represents the diverse identities of people in Afghanistan better<br />

 There is no universal aesthics that if we could only leave society and the will we could reflect upon. To turn inward means there is no ability to access the aesthetics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><br />
Gould, Carold C, “Constructivism and Practice,” 175-6, 2002<br />
Now to turn our attention…<u>as what history is</u><br />
<br />
Their politics elevate particularized “resistance” against some amorphous “power” into a hegemonic ideology, which by definition precludes the emergence of a discourse that would actually challenge dominant power relations<br />
Slavoj Zizek, Senior Researched at the Institute for Social Studies in Ljubljana, 2002, Welcome to the Desert of the Real, pg. 66-7<br />
<br />
The ‘aesthetic’ is nothing but social construction means to ensure class based domination. There is no universal aesthic that exists. It is a delusion meant to maintain bourgeois dominance<br />
