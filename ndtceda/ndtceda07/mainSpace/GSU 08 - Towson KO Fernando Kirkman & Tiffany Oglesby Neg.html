<strong>Towson KO<br />
GSU Round 6 vs. critical ethics Aff (Zupancic, Zizek, Herschok) that reject resolution in search of unmediated ethical relationships.<br />
Judge: Mick Souders<br />
<br />
Off-Case:</strong><br />
Robert Bullock, What's the Solution (clip for :35)<br />
- That was a clip from Robert Bullock, Father of the Environmental Justice movement explaining how we must admit that there are fund. problems w/ the way larger society views racial issues and white supremacy.<br />
-This community must admit that we participate in the norms and practices that perpetuate the invisibility of white supremacy - that's a problem!<br />
- Often, when we are confronting these issues as black we are greeted with shock as if we did something wrong instead of being embraced and understood this is a manifestation of how racism and white supremacy will never be solved .... discomfort is needed.<br />
<br />
DiAngelo, <u>Inclusion in Urban Educational Environments</u>, 2006; p. 216-217.<br />
At the same time... the most superficial ways.<br />
<br />
- This debate activity is a system that's threatening the viability for liberation of people of [blank]. After the struggles of the civil rights and black power movement we seem to come to this activity and are greeted with same segregation and exclusion as Martin, Malcolm, Dubois, and Fannie. The traditional notions of how to advocate the resolution objectifies us because it makes us orient our agency to the state. It teaches to assimilate into western ideals of American exceptionalism and advocate white supremacist notions of viewing the world. We actively have agency to change the systems around us like debate. It is one of those systems that must be engaging in education as freedom with our agency.<br />
<br />
This framework most teams use excludes our personal connection to the topic. This process makes us necrophilic and mechanical and devoid us of creativity to have freedom over our educational credit.<br />
<br />
- This activity has been one that has grown from roots of white supremacy. This methods of debate reflect white ways of viewing and knowing the world. This method is presented in a privileged illusory fait fantasy that is uncritical of racism and white supremacy<br />
<br />
- The somatic norming of the white body in this activity makes the white debate makes the white debate performance ideal and average.<br />
Mills, <u>The Racial Contract</u>, '97<br />
&quot;Finally, the norming of... ugly and dark races&quot;<br />
<br />
White supremacy an invisible unnamed system that has made the modern world what it is today.<br />
Mills, THE RACIAL CONTRACT, 1997 p. [none given]<br />
White supremacy is the…as political, are highlighted.<br />
<br />
Because all the system we live in are define by the invisible system of white supremacy we think the epistemology build in the affirmative will be fundamentally flawed until we engage solvency for white supremacy.<br />
<br />
We are uncompromising on this issue because we tried to engage in coalitional politics but it becomes an analytical trick that sways us from addressing the root of white supremacy<br />
<br />
Their 1AC only attempts to trim the leaves of a larger problem that will not be addressed with the epistemological assumptions of the Affirmative notions<br />

Mills, as above, 97 p. 3<br />
What is needed is….this unacknowledged system.”<br />
<br />
Therefore our Framework:<br />
Tiffany and I believe that our global theoretical in Debate should be about the liberation of the oppressed.<br />
Our framework is who best engages in a consistent practice and advocacy that advances the liberation of the oppressed.<br />
<br />
IN DEBATE, ALL ARGUMENTS ARE INTERCONNECTED—This interrelation occurs because in the effort the oppressed, we make argument that are applicable and damning against all their arguments (and framework within their framework). Hold them accountable for what they have said throughout the round is the best way to avoid to avoid inauthentic engagements with the oppressed.<br />
<br />
Adovacay: Thus Tiffany anad I adococate is that the debate community should embrace a revolutionary asthetic in order to destroy the dominate white western asthetic<br />
<br />
As black people we don’t embrace a universal astheic because our social location must be infused in our discursive acts to lead credents to the issues we speak of—our methodology of a revolutionary asthetic is a way for people to self determine their own wa to view identity and how to topple oppression that faces them.<br />
<br />
Larry Neal sheds light to our advocacy by writing:<br />
<br />
“The move behind the Black aesthetic is the destruction of the white thing, the destruction of white ideas, and white ways of looking at the world. The aesthetic is mostly predicated on the Ethics which asks the question: whose vision of the world is finally more meaningful, ours of the white oppressors’? what is truth? Or more precisely, whose truth shall we express, that of the oppressed or of the oppressors.?”<br />
<br />
The black asthetic is a method the embodies the black liberation struggle for black self determination.<br />
Hooks, BLACK LOOKS, 92, p. 2<br />
Theorizing the black experience….break their colonizing gaze.<br />
<br />
There are a few isolated impacts their engagement of the dominant aesthiec creates. <br />
<br />
1st Epistemological—their silence on the issue of white supremacy and hit functions Agricultural subsidies, and society creates a bad academic practice.<br />
Mills, RACIAL CONTRACT, 97 p.18-19<br />
This in effect, on….alarmed real-life counterparts.<br />
<br />
2nd Agency—Furthermore their claims only lead to align full reliance on the federal government and giving our personal agency for them to change white supremacist oppression that they caused in the first place…we don’t have the power to change the state but we can change the state of debate…our pre-cursor to their 1AC advocacy is to use our agency to engage change in this activity so more will not be exported.<br />
<br />
3rd Export racism and imperialism—their lack of breath or depth of the white supremacist system further creates and re-entrenches impericalism to be exported.<br />
Spanos, in J. Miller, CROSS-EX, p. 467<br />
I am very much…debate world must occur.<br />
<br />
4th Switch-sides is a way in which we convince people and the oppressed of arguments that the oppressor believes—this is the lgoci of the psychic injury where we indoctrinate the other only for our education. Switch sides fundamentally concedes that the oppressor is wrong, but should still emobody, learn from it it. This is the internal reason for assimilation and destruction of our culture.<br />
<br />
And, this is a way in which the oppressed are forced to defer their agency, which makes them passive. Switch side ignores the millions of people who live in this country without documents, resources, and language capabilities that restrict from accessing their education.<br />
