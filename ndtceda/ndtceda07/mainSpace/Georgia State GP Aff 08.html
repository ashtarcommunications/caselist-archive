PLAN: The United States federal government should condition its military assistance to the Palestinian Presidency on the assistance not being for the purpose of regime change activities targeted at the elected Palestinian Legislative Council and its security apparatus. The United Stated federal government should invite the elected Palestinian Legislative Council to participate in the November Middle East Peace Summit. The talks should be used to renew the Hamas-Fatah power sharing agreement. Their invitation should be conditioned on their respect for agreements negotiated by the Palestinian Authority. <br />
<br />
Contention One: The Summit <br />
The Bush administration is hosting a November Summit that could lead to a lasting peace in the Middle East—however continued exclusion of Hamas guarantees failure<br />

And, the US is dedicated to politically excluding Hamas. There is no chance they will be invite to the Summit in the status quo<br />

[Leslie Susser, &quot;The Portent of Hamas: What Will Transpire?,&quot; Jewish Exponent Volume 222, Issue 23, August 30, 2007 pg. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wwwjewishexponent.comlarticlel139/" rel="nofollow">http://wwwjewishexponent.comlarticlel139</a> 1 11] <br />

First, including Hamas in the Summit solves—it gives them a stake in a successful outcome<br />
