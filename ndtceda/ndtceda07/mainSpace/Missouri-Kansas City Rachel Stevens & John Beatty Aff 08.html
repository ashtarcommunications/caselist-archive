<strong>Iranian relations are not doomed-pragmatist camps are in support of positive relations with the US.

Ahmadinejad’s antics have…. <u>achieve its national objectives</u><br />

<u>OBSERVATION ONE IS INHERENCY:</u><br />
CURRENT RECONSTRUCTION IN AFGHANISTAN IS FAILING BECAUSE OF INEFFICIENT USES OF MONEY.<br />
Nawa in ‘6 (Fariba, Afghan-American Journalist, socialist worker online, Afghanistan the myth of reconstruction, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=8851" rel="nofollow">http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=8851</a>)<br />
The Qalai Qazi...only got worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE PLAN:<br />
THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN FOREIGN ASSISTANCE BY OFFERING TO GIVE ALL FOREIGN ASSISTANCE EARMARKED FOR AFGHANISTAN DIRECTLY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN.<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>THE ADVANTAGE IS RECONSTRUCTION:</u><br />
Afghanistan is on the brink of collapse—only political and economic stabilization can save it—and this is try or die—the alternative is another generation of warefare and terrorism.<br />
LA TIMES IN ‘7 (A PROMISE TO KEEP, AUG 27, LN)<br />
The United States is now...other economic interests.<br />
<br />
AND, The reconstruction of Afghanistan is failing miserably—local Afghanis must watch as AID is given to private contractors at the expense of helping citizens in their everyday lives. This is undermining the credibility of the Afghani government, setting back reconstruction for years.<br />
Korgun in ‘6 (Victor, Head of the Afghanistan sector of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, author of dozens of publications on Afghanistan, worked in Afghanistan for along time, Afghanistan.ru, fate of American aid to Afghanistan, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.afghanistan.ru/doc/17.html" rel="nofollow">http://en.afghanistan.ru/doc/17.html</a>)<br />
Naturally, Afghan public...support for reconstruction.<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>SCNEARIO ONE IS MIDDLE EAST WAR:</u><br />
Public support of reconstruction efforts is the strongest internal link to successful reconstruction—failure in Afghanistan ensures a civil war throughout the Middle East.<br />
Watt and Temko in ‘7 (Nicholas and Ned, The Observer, failure in Afghanistan risks rise in terror, say generals, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2126817,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2126817,00.html</a>)<br />
Britain's most senior...we cannot afford.'<br />
<br />
WAR IN the MIDDLE EAST GOES NUCLEAR AND SPREADS GLOBALLY.<br />

<br />
<br />
<u>SCENARIO two IS CENTRAL ASIA:</u><br />
If Afghanistan Collapses, it will spillover into Asia and eventually into the rest of the world. Social and economic reform is needed now.<br />
Akbulut in ‘7 (Isil, (U.S.A.K.) member of the International Strategic Research Organization, July 19, “If Afghanistan Collapses?”, Turkish Weekly, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.turkishweekly.net/news.php?id=46931#" rel="nofollow">http://www.turkishweekly.net/news.php?id=46931#</a>)<br />
Considering the economic...and social change.<br />
<br />
CENTRAL ASIAN INSTABILITY CAUSES THERMONUCLEAR EXCHANGES.<br />
Ahrari in ‘1 (M. Ehsan, Professor of National Security and Strategy of the Joint and Combined Warfighting School at the Armed Forces Staff College, &quot;Jihadi Groups, Nuclear Pakistan and the New Great Game,&quot; August)<br />
South and Central...for all concerned.<br />
<br />
<u>SCENARIO three- PAKISTAN:</u><br />
Lack of faith in government is allowing the Taliban to reemerge, risking the failure of reconstruction—public support is key.<br />
Rubin in ‘7 (Barnett R., ., Director of Studies and a Senior Fellow at New York University's Center on International Cooperation Foreign Affairs, Foreign Affairs, 00157120, Jan/Feb2007, Vol. 86, Issue 1)<br />
Meanwhile, the effectiveness...<br />
ours to lose.&quot;<br />
<br />
a Taliban takeover in Afghanistan will cause separatism in Pakistan, leading to a fundamentalist civil war and coup of Musharraf.<br />
Morgan in ‘7 (Stephen, political psychologist, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.articlesfactory.com/" rel="nofollow">www.articlesfactory.com</a>, better another Taliban Afghanistan, than a Taliban nuclear Pakistan!?)<br />
Musharraf probably hopes...minority Shia populations.<br />
<br />
Pakistan is at a high risk for a coup now.<br />
McClatchy in ‘7 (Lasseter, The News and Observer, few except US back Musharraf, july1, LN)<br />
If [President Perez]...fastest-growing economies.<br />
<br />
A coup on Musharraf ensures an escalating war between India and Pakistan that will result in the use of nuclear weapons—this is probable.<br />
Hindutva News in ‘1 (The Ominous Symptoms of a post-Musharraf Indo-Pak Nuclear War, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hindutva.org/newsanalysis.html" rel="nofollow">http://hindutva.org/newsanalysis.html</a>)<br />
But the greatest...immediately after that.<br />
<br />
Indo-Pak nuclear war will escalate globally and destroy the planet.<br />
CALDICOTT in ‘2 (Helen- Founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility, The New Nuclear Danger: George W. Bush’s Military-Industrial Complex)<br />
<br />
<u>SCENARIO four- NATO:</u><br />
Success in Afghanistan will be the key litmus test for NATO—if the mission fails, the NATO alliance will collapse.<br />
Gallis in ‘7 (Paul, Congressional Research Service, nato in Afghanistan: a test of the transatlantic alliance; north atlantic treaty organization, july 1, LN)<br />
The Afghanistan mission...shape NATO's future.<br />
<br />
NATO IS STILL VITAL TO PREVENT CONFLICT IN AND OUTSIDE OF EUROPE THAT WOULD DRAW IN MAJOR POWERS AND ESCALATE TO NUCLEAR WAR.<br />
Duffield in ’94 (James, assistant professor of government and foreign affairs, political science quarterly, vol 109 no 5, nato’s functions after the cold war, jstor)<br />
<br />
<u>OBSERVATION TWO IS SOLVENCY:</u><br />
first, PRIVATE CONTRACTORS TAKE UP TO 70% OF every PROJECT’S BUDGET—RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS WOULD BE BETTER FUNDED AND MORE EFFICIENT IF AID WAS DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO the AFGHANI government.<br />
HAIDARI IN ‘7 [m. ashraf, political counselor of the embassy of afghanistan in washington dc and advisor for the afghanistan reconstruction dgcommunity, “expert perspective: m. ashraf haidari on the challenges and opportunities of nation building in afghanistan,” 6/26/2007, dgcommunities, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://topics.developmentgateway.org/afghanistan/rc/browsecontent.do~source=rccontentuser~folderid=2669" rel="nofollow">http://topics.developmentgateway.org/afghanistan/rc/browsecontent.do~source=rccontentuser~folderid=2669</a>, accesed 07/23/2007 rs]<br />
Most Afghans are...by Afghans themselves.<br />
<br />
and, AID MUST GO DIRECTLY TO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT—THIS INCREASES GOVERNMENT LEGITIMACY IN THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC AND IS MORE EFFICIENT.<br />
States News Service in ‘6 (aid effectiveness, fiscal outlook in Afghanistan need further attention, warns world bank report, January 23, LN)<br />
A new World Bank...newly elected parliament.<br />
<br />
and, The Afgahni government has improved its fiscal policies—only giving them direct control over aid ensures more efficient use of AID, government credibility, and allows troops to focus on short-term security.<br />
SENGUPTA IN ‘6 (Kim, Belfast Telegraph, world bank accuses west of undermining karzai, January 24, ln)<br />
The system used...transparency and accountability.<br />
<br />
and, NOW IS THE KEY TIME TO HAND THE REIGNS of reconstruction OVER TO THE AFGHANI GOVERNMENT—IT WILL AVOID THE CORRUPTION OF THE AID AGENCIES AND WILL EQUATE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE RECONSTRUCTION.<br />
Anosh IN ‘7 [Faisal, BBC News; “Afghan Daily Calls for Aid Money Through Government to Avoid Embezzlements”; February 15, 2007; lexis]<br />
Our beloved country...aid on reconstruction.
