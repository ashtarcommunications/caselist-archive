 Observation 1: Inherency<br />
<br />
Bush is out of patience with Assad. There’s no engagement coming now.<br />
<br />
Knowlton, December 20, 2007. [Brian, “Bush has harsh words for President Assad of Syria,” IHT, Accessed 1/4/08, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/20/america/prexy.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/20/america/prexy.php</a>]. JLH<br />

President… position is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thus the Plan—<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer to the government of Syria that the United States will back Hezbollah as a political entity in Lebanon in exchange for Syria ending support for militant Hezbollah activities.<br />
<br />
Advantage 1: The Election.<br />
<br />
The Lebanese Presidential election is delayed until January 12.<br />
<br />
Al-Jazeera, December 28, 2007. [“Lebanon election delayed again,” Accessed 1/3/08, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E44A252A-EF0F-4692-B950-8B6FD91B29DD.htm" rel="nofollow">http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E44A252A-EF0F-4692-B950-8B6FD91B29DD.htm</a>].

Lebanon's… Suleiman.<br />

Elections are stalled—neither sides have the 2/3 majority required to elect the president.<br />

JLH<br />
<br />
In… Iraq.<br />
<br />
We are on the brink—engagement is a time-sensitive issue. A legitimate Assad government neutralizes Suleiman’s opposition, while a failure to do so leaves a power vacuum.<br />
<br />
Mroue, December 2, 2007. [Bassem, “Hezbollah Hints at Support for Suleiman,” Guardian, Accessed 12/1/07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-7119768,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-7119768,00.html</a>]. JLH<br />
