AFGHANISTAN AFF<br />
<br />
Plan:<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer a security guarantee to the government of Afghanistan providing that the American military will protect Afghanistan against internal threats to stability and against invasion by outside powers. The United States Federal Government should provide ten billion dollars in reconstruction aid to the government of Afghanistan. Such aid levels should be maintained on an annual basis as long as Afghanistan makes verifiable progress in the areas of good governance and judicial reform. Distribution of aid should occur through provincial reconstruction teams.<br />
<br />
Contention One: Afghan Stability<br />
<br />
Reconstruction in Afghanistan has been drastically underfunded – more troops and aid are essential<br />

Experience has shown that in major combat, it is possible to substitute...organize their operations in Pakistan.<br />
<br />
Breakup of Afghanistan will trigger a coup in Pakistan leading to the takeover of a radical fundamentalist government that will launch nuclear attacks on India and Israel<br />

What would be the...we will all be losers.<br />

If Afghanistan is to succeed...deliver those services is enhanced.<br />

Contention 2: NATO<br />
<br />
Afghanistan is a critical test that will determine NATO’s future – the U.S. must commit additional resources to ensure the transformation of NATO and continued American leadership of the alliance<br />

NATO’s mission in Afghanistan...Afghanistan of two neighboring states, Iran and Pakistan.<br />
<br />
Russian attacks are coming—they are preparing nuclear strikes against the US and are counting on American complacency<br />
Nyquist, Jeff, 8-24-07 RUSSIA'S UNDENIABLE WAR PREPARATIONS, Geopolitical Global Analysis, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/geo/pastanalysis/2007/0824.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/geo/pastanalysis/2007/0824.html</a><br />
Since 1998 I have publicly warned of Russia’s war preparations…optimism is about to be shattered. The Russians know this is going to happen, and they are preparing even as we fail to prepare.<br />
<br />
Strong NATO is key to preventing nuclear conflict with Russia<br />
John O'Sullivan, editor of the National Review and founder of the New Atlantic, 6-1998 [American Spectator] <br />
Some of those ideas--notably, dissolution…sudden absence of the main guarantor of European stability.<br />

But now, without that unifying force…years yield new challenges in the years ahead.<br />
<br />
Contention 3: Power Projection<br />
<br />
Perception that the U.S. is abandoning Afghanistan will create a power vacuum in the region that risks instability and conflict. The belief that the U.S. is leaving emboldens aggression by Russia and other powers.<br />
Starr 5 – Chair of Central Asia-Caucasus Institute and Research Professor in School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University<br />

If Afghanistan faces dangers from its neighbors…Afghanistan’s viability as a developing economy and relatively open society.<br />
<br />
Central Asian instability will trigger security competition that risks nuclear war<br />

However, this does not mean that US actions…depend for its security on any one of them without imperiling the security of all the others.<br />
<br />
The declining military and financial commitments to Afghanistan have created the international perception that the U.S. has begun pulling out of Central Asia. The perception that the U.S. has lost interest in the region will cause us to lose basing rights.<br />

Central Asia has been transformed…so-called 'New Great Game.'<br />
<br />
U.S. air power in Asia is vital to deter conflict in Korea, South Asia, the Persian Gulf, and the South China Sea – any of these conflicts could go nuclear<br />

The first key implication derived from the analysis…previously attainable by lethal means alone. <br />
<br />
Negotiating a long-term security arrangement with Afghanistan will give the U.S. credibility to negotiate analogous agreements with Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan that facilitate maintenance of U.S. military presence in Central Asia<br />
Starr 5 – Chair of Central Asia-Caucasus Institute and Research Professor in School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University<br />
[S.
