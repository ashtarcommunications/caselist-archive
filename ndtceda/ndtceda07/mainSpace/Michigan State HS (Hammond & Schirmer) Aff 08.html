<strong>PLAN:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The United States Federal Government should offer the government of Iran a comprehensive settlement of diplomatic issues. This offer should include –</strong> <br />
<br />
- <strong>A security guarantee which commits to not preemptively use force to change the borders or form of government of Iran;</strong> <br />
- <strong>A commitment to end unilateral sanctions against Iran;</strong> <br />
- <strong>The reestablishment of diplomatic relations;</strong> <br />
- <strong>A commitment to support Iran’s application for accession to the World Trade Organization;</strong>  <br />
- <strong>A commitment to terminate Iran’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism; and</strong> <br />
- <strong>An agreement to the commencement of an ongoing strategic dialogue with Iran as a forum for assessing each side’s implementation of its commitments.</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>The United States Federal Government will make clear that its implementation of this offer is dependent on Iran’s acceptance of the following conditions:</strong> <br />
<br />
- <strong>Iran should agree to limit its fuel cycle activities to a delayed limited enrichment program. This should include full transparency, agreement to intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and a commitment to ratify and implement the Additional Protocol to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty;</strong> <br />
- <strong>Iran should issue a statement expressing support for a just and lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict;</strong> <br />
- <strong>Iran should commit to work for Hezbollah’s transformation into an exclusively political and social organization and to press Palestinian opposition groups to stop violent action;</strong> <br />
- <strong>Iran should commit to an ongoing human rights dialogue with the United States;</strong> <br />
- <strong>Iran should commit to stopping the provision of training, supplies, and funds to organizations designated as terrorist organizations by the United States; and</strong> <br />
- <strong>Iran should commit to work with the United States to ensure the emergence of a stable, unitary, and democratic political order in Iraq.</strong> <br />
