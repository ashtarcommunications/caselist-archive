<u>PALESTINE AFF</u><br />
<br />
Contention 1: Refugee<br />
The world is witnessing the unstoppable decline of the nation-state. This process is bringing into crisis the fundamental categories that undergird western politics. The structures which previously guarantee the human rights of the citizen are dissolving as a growing sections of humanity are no longer representable within the nation-state. The figure that perfectly embodies this process is that of the refugee. The only way to construct a new political community that can stop the reemergence of genocidal violence is to place the figure of the refugee at the center of a new political philosophy.<br />
<strong>Agamben 2000 [Giorgio, Means without ends,. P. 16-23]<br />
It is also the case…no longer be delayed</strong><br />
<br />
The modern nation-state was founded upon the link binding birth to citizenship- this link has entered into a lasting crisis, which ensure that a new and even more violent methods will appease to inscribe life within political order. The ethnic rape camps in the former Yugoslavia are an example of this form of violence.<br />
<strong>Agamben 1995 [Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, p. 174-6]<br />
In this light, the birth…nomos of the planet</strong><br />
<br />
Thus we demand that:<br />
The United States Federal Government should constructively engage the Palestinian Authority and provide a security guarantee if they pursue a policy establishing Jerusalem as the reciprocally extraterritorial capital of both Israel and Palestine.<br />
Contention 2: The Ballot<br />
Reciprocal extraterritoriality challenges the very principle by which nativity is inscribed as the basis for political citizenship- only in a world in which the spaces of states have been topologically perforated is the political survival of humankind thinkable<br />
<strong>Agamben 00 [Means Without Ends p. 34-5]<br />
Before extermination camps…humankind today thinkable</strong><br />
<br />
Use the ballot to affirm a commitment to the refugee as a new political universal. This is a paradoxical empty universal that indentifies the entire social order with the part of the social body that is constitutively excluded- the part that has no part. This metaphoric condensation of this universal demand is essential for challenging our current political coordinates.<br />
<strong>Zizek 99 [The Ticklish Subject, p. 187-8, 207,8, 223-5]<br />
What, for Ranciere…party nomenklatura)….in short, the communists…within the social structure…or-to put it another…this community…).</strong><br />
<br />
This demand challenges the underpinnings of our current political order but refuses to institute a new totalizing identity in its place. The figure of the refugee provides an alternative metaphoric vision for envisioning politics. This is critical to open up space for emancipator political action.<br />
<strong>Husanovic 04 [Sovereign Lives: Power in Global Politics, p. 216-7]<br />
It is the limits of…exercise of political practice.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
It is necessary to crystallize the demand in the form of a concrete political prescription. It is only with prescriptive mobilization combative to particular policies that one can gain a foothold in the political situation. Abstract rejections of the “nation-state” or “globalization” are doomed to failure<br />
<strong>Hallward, 05 [“The Politics of Prescription” South Atlantic Quarterly 104(4)]<br />
A consequential prescription…of the middle east.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 3: The Framework<br />
We can no longer view politics exclusively within the existing framework. Instead of relying on present understanding of political possibilities, we must insist on our own ethical responsibility for the way we construct the realm of politics.<br />
<strong>Daly 04 [Conversations with Zizek, p. 8-9]<br />
For Zizek, a confrontation…to risk the impossible</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
We must make time for true disagreement, which involves making time to count those who are excluded, those who have “no part.” Unless the “non-part” is given a space for consideration, debate becomes anti-political, nothing more than a police-order in the interests of efficient governance.<br />
<strong>Manning 04 [Sovereign Lives: Power in Global Politics, p.61-2]<br />
For, when politics overlaps…in Ranciere’s terms.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
We must rupture the naturalized assumptions undergirding common debate practice. The traditional policy framework of debate only serves to inscribe us more deeply within the discourse of the University, or biopolitical administration. We must not presume the neutrality of knowledge and instead politicize our very participation by identifying with the excluded non=part of the political situation<br />
<strong>Zizek 04 [Iraq: The Borrowed Kettle, p.131-57]<br />
Instead of one symbolic…term for a fake master…The University discourse is…factual state of things…as for the political reading…lives is life itself…the modern master…expertise of qualified bureaucrats.</strong><br />

 The 2AC says that they will defend links to Constructive engagement however in the 2AC they actually spike out of off case and case args by saying that the evidence does not assume their type of engagement. They also use the we demand as a way to claim indivisual action external from federal government action.<br />
