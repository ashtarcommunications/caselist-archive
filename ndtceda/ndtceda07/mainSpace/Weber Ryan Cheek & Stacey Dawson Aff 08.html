 Observation One:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The current State<br />
<br />
First, the Us is at fault for the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>current 41 billion dollar debt in Lebanon, making it the most in debt country in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>the world<br />
<br />
Mekay in 2006<br />
(Emad, Vt Critics Decry “Destroy and Lend’ Policy in Lebanon, September 2, 2006, http:..www.atimes.com.atimes.Middle_Estat/H102Ak02.html <br />
Washington – Lebanon is firmly … the Imf said.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, America is responsible for its “creative destruction” to build the “new middle East” in attempt to control the creation and destruction of the world and extort it for God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We must ask to be forgiven of our debt, Justas we forgive those who are in debt to us.<br />
<br />
Nazemroaya in 2006<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Our Penance<br />
<br />
First, the US must repent for its blasphemy and reject security.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It needs to admit that it doesn’t control the Middle East or history or creation itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Only a total submission to utter helplessness over the power of death can free us to discover the hope that lies after.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Without this confession the US will continue to be a demonic state that consumes anything it wants, that fosters injustice, hunger, inequality, and hatred everywhere it goes.<br />
Stringfellow in 1984 (William, “The Politics of Spirituality, p. 60-65<br />
Are human beings,…repentance can bring<br />
<br />
And, America’s ob session with security and survival is the elevation of death to the sovereign<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Lord. Instead of continuing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>our fixation on the glorious altar of safety, the US needs to admit that it is powerless over death, and that it will die, be judged, and rise again.<br />
Stringfellow the same as above pg. 38-39<br />
Another startling omission in … possessed and the homeless<br />
<br />
<br />
Debt will be the cause that discontinues humanity’s survival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Through its inception of fear and exploitation nuclear arms is what cause causes the theft.<br />
Moltmann in 96 (Jurgen, “The Kingdom of God: Christian Eschatology”)<br />
A nuclear war would,.. confidences through democratization.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, America is the country that knows no other but wealth and is ignorant of the pain it creates for its neighbors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It produces the most determined killers in the name of shopping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We must realize there are worse things that dying and that is dying for the wrong thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>America, too, will die and we must be prepared by refusing to kill in the name of survival.<br />
Hauerwas in 2002 (Stanley “Christian Nonviolence” Strike Terror No more, p 246-247)<br />
I am not only a … will be judged accordingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, Constructive engagement is the only way to come to terms with our extremism and alarmism that history has created.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The US has paralyzed its citizens to idea dying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We are responsible for our own deaths, no matter what<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>the cause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Hope and faith in God’s Creative world is the only thing that can comfort us in recognizing our mortality<br />
Moltmann in 96 (same as above)<br />
Having looked at millenarian… to be taken seriously<br />
<br />
<br />
And, it is America’s<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>secular character that limits our time here on earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We are always in a state of constant conflict in a fight for time, to stave the world’s end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Human beings need to leave their lives up to nature determine when our time is up.<br />
Moltmann(same as above)<br />
Hiroshima 1945 fundamentally… for all human beings<br />
<br />
<br />
And, it is America, the Beast that allows the suicidal sacrifice of people to the system in cry for prosperity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It is heavily alarmed with nuclear bombs, tanks and an infallible arsenal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Through all this ammunition and weaponry there is still a glimpse of hope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The trust in God, to walk in the path of the Lamb and free us of our sins.<br />
Moltmann (same same same)<br />
Like a huge idol,… sin and death.<br />
<br />
<br />
The disadvantage is the triumph of instrumental reason that seeks to dissolve human subjectivity and create a hopeless, changeless world driven by the need for security.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This justifies all atrocity and eliminates all possibility of human hope for change or a better world.<br />
Moltmann (blah blah blah) pg. 220-222<br />
The idea of the … than human beings themselves!<br />

 JP, the case is the same as the wikispaces aff. Here are the advatges we've read<br />
<br />
Nuclear Politics<br />
First, predictions that the Iranian nuclear program will bring about an apocalyptic wave of terrorism and nuclear war are not objective, but instead created and manipulated by the state apparatus to maintain an atmosphere of constant fear that blocks mass popular action to create alternatives to the sovereign state. The power of modern nuclear states doesn’t arise from democratic processes, but instead the possession of nukes that serve as constant reminder of the states ability to deploy catastrophic violence against any opposition.<br />
Davis in 2002 (Creston C., &quot;Subversion, Biopolitics, Scripture&quot; <em>Strike Terror No More</em><br />
<br />
And, nuclear weapons are the organizing principle of the US and the natural conclusion of the liberal secular state which justifies itself without reference to the transcendent. Post 9/11 the mobilization of society around war has increased threatening the final slide into nuclear fascism. However, the confrontation with terror also provides a unique opportunity for Christianity to serve as a countercite to the state, revealing its limits and lack of justification<br />
Davis in 2002 (Creston C., &quot;Subversion, Biopolitics, Scripture&quot; <em>Strike Terror No More</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, the revival of the Christian just war tradition serves to invigorate American Churches as an opposition to the state by creating a new movement of discipleship.<br />
Davis in 2002 (Creston C., &quot;Subversion, Biopolitics, Scripture&quot; <em>Strike Terror No More</em><br />
<br />
<br />
And, only such a transcendent approach can solve for impending human extinction. Our immanent relationship with nuclear weapons is deeply idolatrous admitting them as the only final or absolute power on earth. Political systems like realism guarantee their use because the sovereign state can only establish its own ultimacy through nuclear use. A transcendent Christian approach would destroy these models and replace them with wholistic and ultimate groundings.<br />
Chapman in 86, (G. Clarke, <em>Facing the Nuclear Heresy,</em> 1986)<br />
The Nextb impact is atrocity. The constant deployment of global terror and war serves to prop up liberal sovereignty enabling the US to wage unending wars on the third world and control civil society. The sovereign is predicated only on raw force and can have no transcendent purpose. The result of worshiping the false god of the state are the creation of entirely new categories of inhuman populations through the legal sanction of the state. This killed 100s of millions in the 20th century in the Holocaust and Gulags<br />
Milbank in 2002 (John, &quot;Terror, Sovreignty, Empire, in &quot;<em>Strike Terror No More</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We also sometimes read a nuclera advatntage that is just chapman cards.<br />

Aff: Iran Christian Methodology Aff<br />
Advantage: Bush neoconservative war machine/strikes bad + disciples/us exceptionalism<br />

1NC:<br />
T – QPQ<br />
Constructive Disengagement K<br />
A couple radical orthodoxy bad card<br />
<br />
2NR: Disengagement<br />
<br />
2AR: Perm + disciple advantage o/w<br />
<br />
RFD: Neg<br />
<br />
Alt solves all or most of the aff --- no net benefit to the perm<br />
No piece of 1AC ev that defends constructive engagement with Iran --- neg ev on iran better –- entanglement<br />
Some risk that escatological crisis is more likely --- risk of a case turn --- aff 1ac ev says crisis is fueled by desire to reshape the middle east<br />
<br />
“there has to be a net benefit to the perm that isn’t impact turned”<br />
“chapman ev isn’t good --- just says we have to talk about nuclear issues with religion as a basis – alt probably solves it b/c its not specific to middle east and the alt’s brace of religion does that as well by infusing religion into our discussions”<br />
“neg ev is in context of iran at least --- engagement is what fuels the nuclear conflict”<br />
<br />
Phrase role of the ballot arg as an impact argument instead --- prior question/prereq to determing the efficacy of the aff – not how we engage but if we engage<br />
“not sure if this even gets you anything – just a rhetorical card really…like a debate trick?”<br />
<br />
<strong>Need an external impact to extend in the 2NR --- tiebreaker</strong><br />
Need to talk about the aff more specifically --- “with me, its better to have less evidence and more intuitive arguments --- this is their description of the sq – we explain it better – this is what drives this estological policy in the middle east --- lay off the blocks a little bit”<br />

 <br />
PLAN – The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Iran by offering to participate in direct communications and discussion about its nuclear program. The offer would include a binding promise by the United States that it will not take any military action against Iran unless such action is first ruled as meeting the requirements of the just war doctrine by the Holy See. Funding and enforcement guaranteed.<br />
<br />
Adv 1: Last things<br />
First, a war that threatens extinction between the US and Iran is inevitable now, not because of strategic concerns, but because of Bush’s conviction that such a war would trigger the end times and the second coming of Jesus. Apocalyptic Christians advise our government at the highest level on end-time prophecy further entrenching Bush’s belief that he has a holy mission to fulfill God’s end-times plan.<br />
Abaya in 2006 (Antonio C., The Manila Standard, July 12th 2007)<br />
The Christian fundamentalists actually want......Christian soldiers! Onward to Armageddon!<br />
<br />
<br />
And, the end is near, the organization strength of Christian Conservatives pushing for a war to end all wars with Iran is nearing critical mass. We need to act now.<br />
Berkowitz in 2007 (Bill, Inter-Press Service March 15th 2007)<br />
Last Sunday, Pastor John Hagee....specializing on religion and politics, told IPS.<br />
<br />
And, this doomsday approach is a heretical perversion of true Christian eschatology that will annihilate not just all life, but the history and memory of life itself, leaving only the void that God spoke into. No matter how much Bush and his millennial advisors want to believe it, you cannot extort a new creation from God. Only voting aff can solve God’s plenitude.<br />
Moltmann in 2002 (Jurgen, “Hope in a Time of Arrogance and Power” Strike Terror No More, p. 177-179)<br />
In Christian theology, questions about “the end”.....this is the fatal error of terrorists.<br />
<br />
And, Bush’s deluded sense of divine mission is especially dangerous because it doesn’t operate alone. It is accompanied by realists who respond to terror and insecurity by waging a new crusade on behalf of America’s religion. However, the use of the blunt instrument of military force ironically increases the risk of terrorism both by increasing recruitment among Arabs who feel physically threatened and by confirming for the Bin Laden’s of the world that violence is redemptive medium and that their belief that they represent good and America is evil is correct. We must conceptualize constructive non-violence responses to the threat of insecurity.<br />
Marshall 2007 (Christopher D., “For God’s Sake!” micahchallenge.ord/au/resource/ReligViolence&amp;PeaceofChrist2.pdf<br />
Since 9/11, the international response to terrorism.....as ripe for conquest rather than ripe for redemption.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the result of this is a symmetrical apocalyptic terrorism that both seeks and threatens to end the world. Like Christian dispensationalists, apocalyptic terrorism sees new hope in destruction ultimately justifying all the worse forms of atrocity.<br />
<br />
Moltmann in 2002 (Jurgen, “Hope in a Time of Arrogance and Power” Strike Terror No More, p. 183)<br />
In distinction from the Bible’s apocalyptic traditions....be called to the final apocalyptic battle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Adv 2: American Exceptionalism<br />
<br />
First, the Church must not abdicate the decision to determine what is a just war to the President. This is the most crucical issue facing all of us.<br />
Cavanauh in 2005 (William, December 13 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.relgion-onlie.org/showarticle.asp?tittle=3380" rel="nofollow">http://www.relgion-onlie.org/showarticle.asp?tittle=3380</a>)<br />
It would be presumptuous of me....just war decisions to the state.<br />
<br />
Current foreign policy is driven by a heretical Gnosticism that sees enemies of the US as pure and America as the exception to all rules of the international community and God because of our exceptional goodness. This dualism will be as disastrous now as when it was implemented by Hitler, Stalin, and Pol Pot. We need to reign in this idolatrous state that has replaced God as the source of good in the world.<br />
Manion in 2007 (Christopher, “Bush versus Benedict: Delusion Confronts Reality” April 9, 2007”<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/manion/manion75.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lewrockwell.com/manion/manion75.html</a>.)<br />
Last week, President Bush remarked....things will indeed get worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, the dualism of our liberal democracy demarcates between human and inhuman, allowing all violence to be unleashed. Only Christianity can treat all humans as part of the same category of being and effectively limit violence.<br />
Rasch in 2003 (William, “Human Rights as Geopolitics:” Cultural Critique 54 120-147 p.Muse)<br />
Yes, this passage attests to the antiliberal....benefits of the liberal order.<br />
<br />
Last, the impact to this exceptionalism is short-term nuclear, chemical and biological extinction.<br />
Valenduela in 2003 (Manuel, November 27th 2003, “Perpetual War, Perpetual Terror <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pipeline.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pipeline.com</a> /~rougeforum/Newpaper/Summer2004/PerpetualWar.htm<br />
Yet the Department of War, ever....and automation-like acqueiescence.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Solvency:<br />
First, allowing the president to decide when war is just calls for a presumption of integrity that doesn’t exist. Only the Church can make a competent and moral decision.<br />
Cavanaugh in 2003 (William, “At odds with the Pope: Legitimate authority &amp; Just Wars Commonweal, May 23 2003)<br />
At a recent campus discussion....or the salvation of souls.”<br />
<br />
And, decisions of when to wage war should be left to the Pope, it is the only way to make those decisions in good conscience to limit violence.<br />
Cavanaugh in 2003 (William, “At odds with the Pope: Legitimate authority &amp; Just Wars Commonweal, May 23 2003)<br />
To say that Catholics in good....violence rather than justify it.<br />
<br />
And, the Pope will always say no to war and any military force unless it is an act of self-defense.<br />
McElhinney in 2006 (I. Shawn, May 18th 2006 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://catholicjustwar.blogspot.com)/" rel="nofollow">http://catholicjustwar.blogspot.com)</a><br />
Before and during the 1991 Gulf War,....reorient their discussion about war.<br />
<br />
And, we have to free the Church from its prison as an irrelevant booster of nationalist politics. Doing so will allow us to reject the fear that drives US militarism as well as terrorism and reclaim our own deaths as unavoidable. University level discussion of just war theory are critical to this process along with helping to free the academy.<br />
Hauerwas in 2002 (Stanley, “Christian nonviolence” Strike Terror No More p. 246-247)<br />
I am not only a representative....the university be judged accordingly.<br />
<br />
Finally, we must have a security guarantee to not attack Iran.<br />
Lueders in 2006 (Michael, January 15th A Decisive Step on the Way to Escalation, Frankfurt Rundschau 1/5/2006 translated from German <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.friedenskooperative.de.)/" rel="nofollow">http://www.friedenskooperative.de.)</a><br />
The fact is that for a long time.....direction of “preventative military strike”<br />
<br />
US/Iran bilaterial dialogue allows Iran to air its grieveances and reach agreement with the US on regional issues which eliminates their nuclear ambitions.<br />
Takeyh in 2006 (Ray, Financial Times April 4th 2006”<br />
A more tactically nuanced US diplomacy....the theocracy’s nuclear appetite.
