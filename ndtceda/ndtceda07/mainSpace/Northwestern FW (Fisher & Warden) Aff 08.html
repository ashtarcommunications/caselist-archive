Provoking internal debate is critical --- a decision on the nuclear issue means a <u>clear-cut</u> victory for one faction of the Iranian polity --- pragmatists will end up in <u>full control</u> over all aspects of foreign policy<br />
Pollack 06 (Kenneth M.

The nuclear issue lies at the intersection of all of these differences and is of such importance that a clear policy choice by Tehran will only be possible if there is a clear-cut victory by one or another of these groups over its rivals. Moreover, the corollary is also true: <u>A clear decision by Iran</u><br />

The United States Federal Government should offer to not promote forcible regime change in Iran if Iran agrees to negotiate over its nuclear program and offer iran economic incentives in exchange for a verifiable nuclear nonproliferation pledge.<br />
<br />
America’s foreign policy towards Iran’s the subject of an immense internal power struggle – shakiness of neoconservative influence has created a window for condoleeza to produce a meaningful deal on Iranian nuclearization. Instead, reliance on hollow diplomacy and threats in place of a comprehensive quid pro quo’s ensuring the failure of this diplomatic window and ensuring a shooting war with iran<br />

Steven Clemons, Salon, 9-19-2007, www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/09/19/iran/print.html<br />
In other words, the task was to ponder and there will be war<br />
<br />
Israeli strikes – politicians are lobbying for war, public wants a win on security, accept plan ONLY because it gets them not to proliferate, plan is cover, that’s Karon<br />
<br />
Israel won’t accept nuclear Iran – even if CP = denuclearization, not fast enough<br />

Olmert would be under intense pressure to strike sooner rather than later, he’s already taking heat from the right and window for strikes is closing<br />
