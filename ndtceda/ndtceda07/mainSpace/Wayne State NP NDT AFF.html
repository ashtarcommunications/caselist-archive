Plan Text<br />
<br />
Thus we offer the following plan:<br />
<br />
<br />
Through all necessary means the United States Federal Government should constructively engage the Government of Iran by offering: to lift United States domestic restrictions on and opposition to any investment in Iran’s gasoline refinery sector, a promise not to engage in, support, provoke, nor encourage pre-emptive strikes or forcible regime change; and all necessary funding the establishment of an international nuclear fuel bank which would include Iran; In exchange for: Iranian commitment to use enriched uranium only from the international nuclear fuel bank;to return spent fuel rods to the fuel bank after use; and to commit to suspend its own uranium enrichment program. Funding and Enforcement Guaranteed. We Can Clarify.<br />
