<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Plan Text:</em></strong><br />
<br />
The United States federal government (U.S.) Should adopt a policy that offers Iran: an end to U.S. pressure, including the use or support of force against Iran; the normalization of diplomatic and economic relations wit Iran; the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Iran; and the removal of Iran from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. This offer will be conditioned on Iran’s acceptance to: support a two state solution in the conflict between Israel and Palestine; end all support for terrorist groups; and Iran’s diplomatic recognition of Israel and that country’s right to exist. We’ll clarify.<br />

“In invading Iraq, the U.S. unintentionally threw open the door to”<br />
Iranian profil is inevitable, the question is not a how we can avoid it – it’s what we can get out of it. The plan gives iran a stake in regional stability and gives arab states comfort in nuclear dettenece as Israel nuclear monopoly will be balanced~ Barnett in 2006<br />
“ Like the late Soviet Union, Iran does not wield”<br />
the balence of power has shifted in the middle east. The United States containment startegy against Iran has become self-alienating and destabilizes the middle East. Including Iran creates a regional framework to address flashpoints for conflict. Nasr and Takeyn in 2008<br />

1ac w/ cites<br />
<br />
As a community, debaters have become accustomed to telling fictional stories constructed in the form of a nine-minute 1ac’s. our research is assimilated with rhetoric to form plots that we call advantages. Climaxes frequently revolve around the prospect of a looming nuclear war that can only be averted by our resolution’s protagonist – the US. The moral of each round is that america’s influence, resources and military might are synonymous with happily ever after<br />
<br />
Our community often sites the empirical support this logic. The mere capacity to debate is seen as proof that American statecraft prevents nuclear winter. So common is this story-line that in our community khalilzad in 95 has become more than a source. It has become a belief which unequivocally implies that the alternative to US hegemony is chaos<br />
<br />
When we forget that our speeches are fictional stories, this belief is dangerous, for the game of debate is rigged in two ways that taint our worldview<br />
<br />
First, the nature of the topic posits the United States as our community’s protagonist. Successful affirmation of the resolution necessitates that debaters convince their audience that the world will end if the US does not engage the violent characters of the Middle East that are our topics “antagonists”<br />
<br />
Second, our discussions are inherently limited by time. To present a captivating short story in nine minutes, plots almost always begin with the squo. The problem with this starting point is that we often fail to realize that our current state of affairs is nothing more than a page, of a chapter, of the larger book that is contemporary American foreign policy.<br />
<br />
The protagonist of our tragedy was conceived when japanese naval forces penetrated a US military base in 1941. That day, has since become known as pearl harbor and can be understood as the catalyst for the United States engagement in WWII<br />
<br />
In an effort to avenge forced conception and impress the world before giving birth the US committed to developing the atomic bomb. Nearly four years later, in the summer if 1945 america emerged from the US womb in fury, bringing with it the death of 200k Japanese civilians in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br />
<br />
The unprecedented death that America brought into the world was immediately repressed. Instead of confronting the traumatic and violent experience of birth, America has attempted to guarantee survival by avoiding karma, fearing that the destruction it brought into the world would also result in its demise.<br />
<br />
The subsequent chapters of our analysis cannot be divorced from this starting point. For the pages of the middle east in the chapter of the squo began on 9/11 when america’s omnipotence was shattered with vulnerability. We isolate two consequences<br />
<br />
First – pre-emptive unilateralism guarantees extinction. America’s decision to lash out in both Iraq and Afghanistan can be understood as an attempt to secure a system of guarantees. This system is premised on america’s sincere intention to better the world; believing that if the characters of the middle east were more subordinate to, or like America, omnipotence could be postponed indefinetly. Consequently, a cycle is created in which countries proliferate and America responds with war<br />
<br />
Second a false perception of threats is used to construct a misleading reality. Similarly to how the debate community’s worldview is tainted by the setting of the rez, Americas repressed anxity causes it to misrepresent events. Hyper-reality justifies error replication in the middle east and the forceful punishment for those who do not see the light of US influence.<br />

<br />
The function of guarantees is to enable human beings….einstein said<br />
<br />
The implication is that our form of storytelling is structured in such a way that leads us to believe that America is the worlds champion of peace. The belief that the absence of US hegemony would result in WWIII conveniently omits our heros dark side; that since 1945, in an attempt to bring peace the US has engaged in over 40 attempts at forceful regime change, causing millions of deaths<br />
