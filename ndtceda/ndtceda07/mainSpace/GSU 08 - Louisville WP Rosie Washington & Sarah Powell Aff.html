<span style="font-family: Calibri">For the profession that produces such beauty and literally life Its time to for true reconstruction a true analysis of past actions and the impacts of such actions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In the history of this country we find a very sordid story in relation to African Americans and the system of farming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Since the abolishment of slavery<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>the African Americans have since struggled with the accumulation of land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>From the era of reconstruction blacks were able to secure 15 million acres of land with over 200,000 farms on that land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>As a result of this white resentment grew and the acceptance and increase of Jim Crow laws began a slew of injustices and inditements to the black farmer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Among these being the promise of the new deal to farmers of about 500 million dollars in relief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The preferential treatment of white farmers over that of black farmers became apparent thought the disproportionate allocation of relief funds to black farmers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">For example, in June of 1934 there were 84 applications from blacks and 49 from whites. The FERA accepted 24, all from white farmers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Through these manifestations of racism and discrimination there seems to be inherent in farming a sentiment of inequality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Subsidies in any format only heighten that disparity for black farmers.  </span><br />
<ul><li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Trebuchet MS'">Black beneficiaries of federal farm subsidy programs averaged $7,363 each in subsidy payments between 2003 and 2005 according to the latest USDA data, an average of $2,454 per beneficiary per year. This is one-third the amount received on average by all other beneficiaries--$22,506 over the 3 program years, or about $7,502 per beneficiary per year.  </span></li><li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Trebuchet MS'">All but a few black farm program beneficiaries fall in the bottom rung of farm subsidy payments nationally. Eighty (80) percent of black beneficiaries during the years 2003-2005 (7,680 individuals) shared less than $6 million, which amounted to less than $260 per person per year. By comparison, the bottom 80 percent of all other beneficiaries collected six times that amount, an average of $1,628 per year.  </span></li></ul><span style="color: #3366ff"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span style="mso-list: Ignore">·<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><span style="font-family: Tahoma">EWG News release 08 </span></span></span><br />
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%"><span style="font-family: Calibri">In light of this there is a need for a revisiting of the fundamental purposes of subsidies especially in the realm of cotton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>If the truth behind them is to supply farmers with relief and help for troubling commodities and to provide some stability in the instability of the farming industry then the way that subsidies exist in the status quo must be evaluated and analyzed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>With the gap growing larger and larger with the small percentage of black farmers on the bottom they only have the option of being even more so negatively impacted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The evaluation of the system of subsidies must begin with an understanding of what is ethical and just for not just black farmer but for all farmers.  </span></span><br />
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Ethical System – <em>A system of morals and principles used to maintain a purpose</em> </span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In order to have an ethical system in the realm of farming subsidies first we must identify their purpose and decide whether or not they are an integral part of farming for all farmers in general. Because right now </span>Direct payments to black beneficiaries averaged $3,206 on average between 2003 and 2005, just over $1,000 per year. Direct payments to all other beneficiaries were over three times higher--$10,346 over the period. <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Trebuchet MS'"> </span><br />
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Trebuchet MS'">Most of the subsidies that will be paid under the House Agriculture Committee’s proposed farm bill would be direct payments. As a result, the black-white inequity will be locked in for five more years. </span><br />
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Trebuchet MS'">Review of agriculture census data indicates that <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Trebuchet MS'">disparities in subsidy assistance between black and white farm operators cannot be fully explained by the fact that blacks operate smaller farms or tend to grow ‘non-program’ crops. More important is the question of the degree to which discrimination against black farmers by local USDA offices has been a long-term factor in limiting the ability of black farmers to expand their operations or discouraging them from growing subsidized program crops.</span> </span><br />

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A 1964 study exposed how the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) actively worked against the economic interests of black farmers. The USDA's loan agencies, such as the Farmer's Home Administration (FHA), denied black farmers ownership and operating loans, disaster relief and other aid. One practice was to deny credit to any black farmer who assisted civil rights activists, joined the NAACP, registered to vote, or simply signed a petition. The study further revealed that there had never been an African-American elected to a county agricultural committee - a structure established by the USDA. </span><br />

What proves it is a good idea?</em></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> In this policy creation there is a clear starting point of hatred and discrimination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was based out of a system of slavery and that reality does not shift just because we choose to ignore those implications david hall</span><span style="COLOR: #333333; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"> </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">in 2006 states</span><span style="COLOR: yellow; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"> Regardless of the degree, invisibility creates a social reality where we can touch people but not feel their pain. We can listen to their cries for help, but not really hear in a way that would lead us to act, empathize and transform the underlying conditions. Their legal rights are considered and defended but never fully enforced or realized. </span><span style="COLOR: #333333; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Veiled or invisible, the pattern of social and emotional minimization [*11] leaves an indelible mark upon those who are trapped in this one-way mirror.</span><span style="COLOR: yellow; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Invisibility is not just a consequence of racism; it can be born through any systemic act of neglect, fear, indifference and denial. In this society, gender, poverty, disabilities, sexuality, geography and language have all served as sources for making others invisible. Therefore, all of us are subject both to being made invisible and to being the force that makes others invisible.</span><span style="COLOR: #333333; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"> Yet certain forms of invisibility have been more dominant, systematic and ingrained than others. </span><br />
