 <h2 id="toc6"><a name="x-Towson CL Neg Round # 4 Vs Team: Missouri State MM Judge: Farmer, Grove, Roberts Case Args: N/A Off Case Args: “Six Off… Nah, it’s just one” Begins with a recording of a freestyle rap. Then the 1N gives a rap about debate is their space to make change, they are tired of being invisible. White supremacy still exists. Debate is their “pain on paper.” Want everyone to participate in debate with a black aesthetic. We become victims of the white aesthetic: makes the white individual white and ideal. Mills 97 Their 1AC makes white supremacy normative, and white supremacy has made the modern world as it is today Mills 97 The aff wont work unless it works to solve white supremacy. We have to address the root cause. Don’t look at good/bad dichotomies but rather white supremacy, it is where these dichotomies come from. White 06? 1AC is only proof of a larger problem. They need to change epistemology. Links: No focus on white supremacy Traditional discourse puts a focus on academic knowledge, not experiential. Don’t define personal relation to the ethos. Aff doesn’t change fundamental structure. Managerial approach Hooks 2004 explores middle east relations We need a global system to discuss and change racist system Mills 97 Our framework is to look at whichever mode will challenge the dominant system. We don’t engage in a universal aesthetic: the black aesthetic. It means to destroy the white ways of looking at the world. Our aesthetic is a way for people to self-determine identity. We don’t say that everyone should embrace it. We embrace it from our location. Look at things through the revolutionary approach. Hooks 04. Our education will be about how to destroy white supremacy. Impacts Epistemological – changes the way that whites walk around and look at the world Agency – we can change the system. Wiggam? Framework: If the judges vote for us it sends a signal that we must evaluate and challenge white supremacy in all instances. Block Strategy: 2NC Framework is who engages in the best advocacy to free the oppress. White supremacy affects people’s lives, we put that at the top of the 1NC. These are the types of experiences that we need to challenge it- have to put a face on it. Have to take away the invisibility of white supremacy. It orders the way that the world exists. Binaries are created on the absis of white people making the dichotomies of others. The evidence of the 1NC says that ordering happens based on race. Have to understand white supremacy. AT: Mills stuff Not offense about why it is totally flawed. Sure, there are small problems. Mills is not saying root cause- just how it has shaped the world for the past few years. You can look at history: colonial powers divided up Africa. The US can shape and change political dynamics. White supremacy orders the world and changes the means that people get to and access power. Have to understand how it exists. Mills criticizes liberalism: social contract just takes us back to white supremacy. Experiences of people of color take into consideration passions and suffering to create the world tat is created. White folks cant understand the world they have created from the consensual hallucination. Concede Niel: nothing meaningful can come out of the white aesthetic. Reject them, nothing meaningful can come out of it. Group the permutations: the links that we specifyin the 1NC are things that still link.. They are managerial in dealing with racism. Perpetuates the very system that allows white order. The perm would maintain forms of white supremacy. The reliance on tradition, the reliance on academic perspectives, that’s bad. Relying only on traditional authors is a link to the white aeshetic. Still try to sanitize imperialism without changing the basic structure. Allows us to look at one good thing we’ve done while ignoring imperialism in other instance.s Alternative: critique of the structures of white supremacy. Breaks down the dichotomies. The very rhetoric they use comes out of white supremacy. We can change the practices of this activity and then we can change the rhetoric of the bush administration because this is where they learn to talk. Revolutionary aesthetic allows people to determine their own position: we don’t speak for everyone. Our argument is that it is worth trying to achieve a new community to challenge the domination that exists in society. Das to the perm: Creates bad debate, makes it not strategic to engage in critiques. Allows ppl to read the smallest racism challenging aff and then claim our project is not competitive. This will make it disadvantageous to have these structural critiques. Perm will be co-opted: if we’re really interested in getting alt. solv, we need a consistent advocacy to challenge white supremacy in every debate. Racism will probably continue but we can’t be complicit- we have to challenge the system. We are not just indignation, we have to engage in specific critiques of the methodology that creates and maintains the white aesthetic. White people can speak from any location as long as they can justify that their rhetoric will challenge the dominant western aesthetic that exists right now. If we don’t do that, we can’t challenge society. The rev. aesthetic allows us to change the very types of opposition that exist by understanding the world. 1NR The evidence from the aff is not written with a recognition of the centrality of whiteness- we have to question the motive of their authors, the epistemology of their writing. This whitewashed look means we can’t solve, is an independent reason to reject, and re-entrenches the 1AC harms. As a community we must promote anti white-supremacist scholarship. We are beginning to take responsibility for white supremacist. The idea of sameness is what allows white identity to be a somatic norm. We aren’t questioning their author’s backgrounds, just their focus on academia. They focus on an analytical view of society. Their own white privilege is caught up in the mindset. White people only see the world and would be surprised to learn of how it pervades everything. We must engage the heart and the mind. The revolutionary aspect lets us remove the denials and then begin the healing process. Capitalism is a way to tell people to shut up and learn their place. We have to challenge that. We don’t preclude talking about other oppression- instead, you can choose your own point and discuss from there, that’s the revolutionary aesthetic. Different peoples tell their stories differently, that’s important to understand. People can self-identify. Our aesthetic allows that. The aff is the only one to tell people to shut up. And their claim to solve is grounded in whiteness so we can’t actually discuss things, so this is another DA to the perm. 2nr Strategy:"></a>Towson CL Neg Round # 4 Vs Team: Missouri State MM Judge: Farmer, Grove, Roberts Case Args: N/A Off Case Args: “Six Off… Nah, it’s just one” Begins with a recording of a freestyle rap.
