<br />
1ac w/ cites<br />
<br />
<br />
Obs 1 Regarding Death and slaughter<br />
<br />
US airstrikes continue unabated despite Karzai’s pleas<br />
<br />
The Sydney Morning Hearld March 17, 2008<br />
<br />
“In iraq and Afghanistan…inaccurate bombing.”<br />
<br />
Last week US killed lots of civilians<br />
<br />
Xinhua General News Service 3/20/08<br />
<br />
“A U.S.-led Coaltion…harming non-combatants.”<br />
<br />
Those being killed and maimed in afghanistan are human beings who have names and feelings have families etc. We are murdering afghanis daily but don’t talk about it.<br />
<br />
Marc W. Herold 2002 “A Dossier on Civilian Victims United States’ Aerial Bombing in Afghanistan: A Comprehensive Accounting”<br />
<br />
“Feriba, a young Afghan girl…is that so many bombs hit their targets”.22”<br />
<br />
No explanation for our bombing—we seek out non-military targets<br />
<br />
Herold cite above<br />
<br />
“The third cause requires some…sickened Noor.53”<br />
<br />
We hunt those fleeing violence and kill them too—nobody is safe<br />
<br />
Herold cite above<br />
<br />
“Fleeing refugees have become…Osama bin Laden.”<br />
<br />
Our attacks are our own Sept 11th immoral slaughter that makes sense of just vengeance. Creates a war without a witness.<br />
Herold cite above<br />
<br />
“Little mention made in the U.S. mainstream…a threat to the Bush war.”<br />
<br />
US air war reveals a differential moral calculus for American and Afghani lives—USFG treats them as costs<br />
<br />
Herold cite above<br />
<br />
“This dossier makes six major points. First, the…as well as upon the Taliban and Al Qaeda.”<br />
<br />
Obs. II regarding debate<br />
<br />
Debate matters—lack of public debate about civilian casualties allows bombing to continue.<br />
<br />
Kevin J. Ayotte and Mary E. Husain “Securing Afghan Women: Neocolonialism, Epistemic Violence, and the Rhetoric of the Veil.”<br />
<br />
“The failure of military intervention…on the bodies of Afghan women as well.”<br />
<br />
The US is increasing its level of violence—US will kill thousands of Afghanis as long as we are unaware of the war.<br />
<br />
Herold cite above<br />
<br />
“The strategic U.S. bombing of Afghanistan…about civilian ‘collateral damage.’”<br />
<br />
We have a responsibility acknowledge the lives of those who have died we are to blame and must do something.<br />
<br />
Herold cite above<br />
<br />
“Natasha Walter86 has eloquently state our…as the people who died in the Twin Towers.””<br />
<br />
PLAN the USFG should immediately cease all US air strikes in Afghanistan and withdraw All US support for allied air strikes in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Our 1AC represents a pedagogy of the oppressed. To build a critical discourse for change we must not become mired in our oppressions but also see how we can relate to the oppression of others. We must take leadership in creating an ethical responsibility to end the silence that surrounds the oppressed and the forgotten dead.<br />
<br />
Henry A. Giroux 1992<br />
<br />
“Leadership poses the issue of responsibility as a … in the realms of values and politics.”<br />
<br />
We must engage in a pedalogical practice which does not assume we are disconnected from policy-making. We must become active citizens and wage a campaing that seeks change in the immediate and prepares us to become ethical leaders in the future.<br />
<br />
Giroux 1992 “Educational Leadership and the Crisis of Democratic Government” Educational Research 21:4 May<br />
<br />
“Fourth, educational leaders need a language of…from the policy-shaping process.” (P. 11)<br />
<br />
Not just any type of debate will do—Point by point refutation of conservative positions is critical to stand up and debunk arguments and prevent a neocon take-over of education and politics.<br />
<br />
Donald Lazere 2006 Winter<br />
<br />
“Well, maybe it is time to think the unthinkable about some…all backgrounds to meet them.”<br />

<br />
Debating about the state does not mean capitulating to it—discussing government policy creates critical understanding that facilitates resistance against its worst abuses<br />
<br />
Clair Donovan and Phil Larkin 2006 Politics Vol 26 No. 1<br />
<br />
“We do not suggest that political science…within the institutions they study.”<br />
<br />
Oppression is fundamentally interlocking. Promoting our own oppressions in a “race to innocence” undermines our ability to see ways that we have privilege and benefit from the oppression of others. The perm solves.<br />
<br />
Mary Louise Fellows and Sherene Razack “the Race to Innocence: Hierarchal Relations among Women” 1997<br />
<br />
“We came to write this Article after…sexism heterosexism, and so on.1 Because”<br />
<br />
Sovereignty must be used strategically to resolve real world suffering. K should be simultaneous, not exclusive<br />
<br />
Mark O. Lombardi 1996 “Perspectives on Third-World Sovereignty” p 61<br />
<br />
“Sovereignty is in our collective…of life for the human race.”<br />
<br />
We can criticize homogenizing capital-S sovereignty without rejecting it. This strategy is more effective and respects the perspectives of marginalized communities<br />
<br />
Anna M. Agathangelou and L.H.M. Ling Fall 1997 Studies in Political Economy p 32<br />
<br />
“Equally significant, postcolonial IR…within dissident IR.”<br />
<br />
AT: Impose Techne<br />
<br />
Peter J. Caulfield 1991 “From Brazil to Buncombe County.” Educational Forum<br />
<br />
“”I question Freire on one very important…of the dominant class.””<br />
<br />
Your competition and link arguments are opposite of what is effective—your totalizing interpretation of the world’s problems crush democratic potential of educational reform.<br />
<br />
Giroux 1994 “Teachers, Public Life, and Curriculum Reform” Spring 1994 p 35-47<br />
<br />
“If the language of curriculum theory is to work…things appear natural and given” (Crowley, 1989 p. 5).”<br />
<br />
Lots of talk about Giroux evidence and another card.<br />
