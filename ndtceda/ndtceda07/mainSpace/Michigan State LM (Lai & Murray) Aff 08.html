PLAN:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer the government of<br />
Iran a comprehensive settlement of diplomatic issues. This offer<br />
should include –<br />
<br />
- A security guarantee which commits to not preventatively use force<br />
to change the borders or form of government of Iran;<br />
- A commitment to end unilateral sanctions against Iran;<br />
- The reestablishment of diplomatic relations;<br />
- A commitment to support Iran's application for accession to the<br />
World Trade Organization;<br />
- A commitment to terminate Iran's designation as a state sponsor of<br />
terrorism; and<br />
- An agreement to the commencement of an ongoing strategic dialogue<br />
with Iran as a forum for assessing each side's implementation of its<br />
commitments.<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government will make clear that its<br />
implementation of this offer is dependent on Iran's acceptance of the<br />
following conditions:<br />
<br />
- Iran should agree to limit its fuel cycle activities to a delayed<br />
limited enrichment program. This should include full transparency,<br />
agreement to intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy<br />
Agency, and a commitment to ratify and implement the Additional<br />
Protocol to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty;<br />
- Iran should issue a statement expressing support for a just and<br />
lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict;<br />
- Iran should commit to work for Hezbollah's transformation into an<br />
exclusively political and social organization and to press Palestinian<br />
opposition groups to stop violent action;<br />
- Iran should commit to an ongoing human rights dialogue with the United States;<br />
- Iran should commit to stopping the provision of training, supplies,<br />
and funds to organizations designated as terrorist organizations by<br />
the United States; and<br />
- Iran should commit to work with the United States to ensure the<br />
emergence of a stable, unitary, and democratic political order in<br />
Iraq.<br />

PLAN:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer the government of Iran a comprehensive settlement of diplomatic issues. This offer should include –<br />
<br />
<strong>-</strong> A security guarantee which commits to not preemptively use force to change the borders or form of government of Iran;<br />
<strong>-</strong> A commitment to end unilateral sanctions against Iran;<br />
<strong>-</strong> The reestablishment of diplomatic relations;<br />
<strong>-</strong> A commitment to support Iran’s application for accession to the World Trade Organization;<br />
<strong>-</strong> A commitment to terminate Iran’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism; and<br />
<strong>-</strong> An agreement to the commencement of an ongoing strategic dialogue with Iran as a forum for assessing each side’s implementation of its commitments.<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government will make clear that its implementation of this offer is dependent on Iran’s acceptance of the following conditions:<br />
<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should agree to limit its fuel cycle activities to a delayed limited enrichment program. This should include full transparency, agreement to intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and a commitment to ratify and implement the Additional Protocol to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty;<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should issue a statement expressing support for a just and lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict;<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should commit to work for Hezbollah’s transformation into an exclusively political and social organization and to press Palestinian opposition groups to stop violent action;<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should commit to an ongoing human rights dialogue with the United States;<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should commit to stopping the provision of training, supplies, and funds to organizations designated as terrorist organizations by the United States; and<br />
<strong>-</strong> Iran should commit to work with the United States to ensure the emergence of a stable, unitary, and democratic political order in Iraq.<br />
<br />
Funding and enforcement guaranteed. We’ll clarify intent.<br />

Solvency:<br />
