The Affirmative is a band-aid on a bullet wound, reforming an agricultural system that is fundamentally broken.  Agriculture is the greatest mistake humanity ever made, and it demands both radical critique and people brave enough to stand up to make a call for primitivism.  A vote against primitivism is a vote for extinction.  It’s try or die for us.<br />

<br />
The alternative is to reject the affirmative and their defense of agriculture and civilization.  We must endorse an alternative ideology that recognizes that we can escape the traps of cultivation.  The 2AC will say “perm,” but attempts to work within the system of civilization not only fails, but will suck our vision into a system of totality where the universal can compensate.  This ensures extinction.  We must have a whole-scale rejection and abandonment of the modern world.<br />
