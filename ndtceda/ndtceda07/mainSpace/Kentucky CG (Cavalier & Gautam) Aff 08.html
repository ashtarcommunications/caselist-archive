 <strong>contention one is the status quo:</strong><br />

&lt; For Washington, rapprochement… Syrian-Israeli peace settlement&gt;<br />

<br />
&lt; That deceptively simple… its outer limit&gt;<br />
<br />
PLAN: The united states federal government should increase its constructive engagement with syria by returning the united states ambassador to syria to the united states embassy in syria and increase its foreign assistance by removing syria from the export administration act, if syria ceases all ties with hizbullah.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>contention two is sovlency:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>us reinstatement of the ambassador to syria is necessary to revitalize us-syria cooperation by signaling the end of us hostility and creating the framework for syrian-israeli cooperation</strong><br />
