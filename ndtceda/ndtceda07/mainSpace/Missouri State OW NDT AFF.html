<br />
plan: The United States federal government should not attack Iran<br />
<br />
abandoning system doesn’t solve rearticulating it is good<br />
<br />
direct education about possibilities solve<br />
<br />
focusing on legislative solutions can teach us and create change<br />
<br />
citizens role-playing as government is good and allows us to create social peace<br />
<br />
this is particularly true in competitive formats<br />
<br />
<br />
2AC<br />
<br />
<br />
They concede that we will attack Iran now and this will cause extinction<br />
<br />
Status quo is bad and extinction is a disad to the alternative<br />
<br />
This prevents discussion<br />
<br />
Government can assist to alleviate oppression<br />
<br />
They create double standards—they follow some rules but like to breakdown others<br />
<br />
Please make them explain the details of the black aesthetic<br />
<br />
White supremacy exists in a lot of ways but only by learning about the state can we solve<br />
<br />
Implementation is difficult and it’s the negs job to tell the judges what to be done<br />
<br />
Aff leads to good discussion. Lewis means we can create change<br />
<br />
Education about political change is good<br />
<br />
Role-playing is good because we learn ways to create peace and social change<br />
<br />
They do not disprove our argument<br />
<br />
Mills confuses white supremacy with reality<br />
<br />
Do not let the neg claim that our authors are racist<br />
<br />
We are key to solve for oppression<br />
<br />
White supremacy exists in other areas like latinos<br />
<br />
It is the states role in racism and they can solve it<br />
<br />
State has a crucial role in solving for meaning<br />
<br />
No explination why focus on policy is bad<br />
<br />
Research is good<br />
<br />
Link of omissions are bad<br />
<br />
Excludes future participants<br />
<br />
Roleplaying should come first<br />
<br />
Roleplaying is key to activism<br />
<br />
No neg evidence that their framework is best for solving rights<br />
<br />
Perm<br />
<br />
We should use the government as an analysist like a bridge<br />
<br />
All research is good. Aff doesn’t prevent their research claims<br />
<br />
This claim is not falsifilable<br />
<br />
We need a revolution to solve for problems of government<br />
<br />
Research is inevitable<br />
<br />
Alternative doesn’t solve iran<br />
