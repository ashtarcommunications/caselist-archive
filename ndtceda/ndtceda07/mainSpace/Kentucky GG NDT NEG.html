<strong><em>Round # 5</em></strong> <br />
<br />
<strong><em>Vs Team:</em></strong> <br />
<br />
<strong><em>Judge: Gordon</em>/</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Case Args:</em></strong><br />
<br />
a. violence will inevitably breakout– post plan Luttwak, 2007<br />
“what actually happens at each of these”<br />
b. Domestic politics Khtib in 2007<br />
“it’s not unusal to see a state”<br />
c. Mutual distrust US lacks diplomatic credibility Flounders in 2008<br />
“ yet both the Palestinian and”<br />
d. US lacks diplomatic credibility in flounders in 2008<br />
“ Bush’s visits to the Israeli apartheid”<br />
thus the plan is insufficient<br />
a. fatah corruption Oren in 2007<br />
“to avert this catastrophe, the US, has joined”<br />
b. Economic reform key Heumann in 2008<br />
“the isolation of the Gaza strip has not”<br />
c. Safe passage key Wiener &amp; Morrison in 2007<br />
d. hard bargaining strat Korobkin in 2005 <br />
“If both parties adopt hard bargaining strategies”<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Off Case Args:</em></strong><br />
<br />
First off was A-spec<br />
typical standards ground/aff condo/makes them not topical/ voter.<br />
Second was: interp c/e = unconditional <br />
vio: the plan is not conditional engagement <br />
voters on moots constructive and stable neg ground.<br />
Third<br />
Ptxs:<br />
a mccain is ahead with independents scheiber 4-9-08<br />
“the problem is that each day clinton and obama spend”<br />
b. link is that plan would highlight mccains far right stance on middle east policy<br />
c. mccain must walk a tightrope between independents and conservatives to win the election <br />
the international herald tri in 2/18<br />
“but even as the”<br />
impact is democrats would pullout- iraq spiral into an escalatory war “mccain in 2007<br />
“defeating radical Islamist extremists is the national”<br />
this escalates to WW3<br />
Corsi in 2007<br />
“if a broader war breaks out in Iraq”<br />
4th was Consult the J “japan”<br />
pt: the USFG will enter prior binding consultation with J over the mandates of the aff plan and the results of the consultation.<br />
Plank 2 topicality<br />
observation 2 net benefit binding consult is critical<br />
b us and japan alliance is critical to deter multiple scenarios for nuclear war INSS in 2000<br />
lastly is the cruising for arab allies <br />
The middle east is in disequilibrium now – the sq is a competition between American and Iranian regional influence<br />
the impact is middle east profil.<br />
Fear of Iran puts Sunni arab in the gulf on the brink of profil.<br />
Also link is Iran is challenging us heg throughout the middle east– bush is lobbying arab states constantly in order to shore up support for containment<br />
the plan alienates the gulf states and the concessions required by the plan confirm the perception that they are disempowered and manipulated by the US policy<br />
Profiler leads to rapid nuclear wars this is Utgoff in 2002<br />
\<br />

<strong><em>2nr Strategy:</em></strong><br />

<strong>Colonialism 1NC</strong><br />
<br />
US Foreign policy towards the Middle East is trapped in the lens of orientalism- their two-faced engagemtn creates cycles of violence and wars in the name of aid and democracy<br />
Sedeghi 2007 “US policy in the middle east taking a turn for the worse; the catastrophic human consequences,” Jan, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.payvand.com/news/07/jan/1148.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.payvand.com/news/07/jan/1148.html</a><br />
<br />
This makes war inevitable as it becomes the west’s way to constantly define itself against “the orient”<br />

1NR evidence<br />
<br />
US assistance to “The Orient” as necessary is the covert attempt to re-educate and re-colonize the default “all others” by prescribing Western solutions which further divides us from our constructed opposites preventing solidarity<br />
