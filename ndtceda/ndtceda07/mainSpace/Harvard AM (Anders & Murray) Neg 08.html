<br />
Thesis – the outcome of interactions between states is determined by the assumptions each side brings – a context emerges because how each side interprets the rules<br />
Rational choice approaches which assume non cooperation and divergent interests will create conflict, instrumental rationality requires states to treat each other as enemies<br />
The most important question is how the assumptions of plan generate a conflictual interaction out of which a certain context is guaranteed to emerge<br />
Wendt, social theory of international politics, p 331.332 “power relations play” “shared knowledge that they are enemies”<br />
<br />
Plan’s mechanism of diplomacy negotiation and conditioning relies on the assumption that the international arena is constituted by actors with divergent interestw who naturally do not want to cooperate. Not only is this assumption a construction but it ensures conflict between states even to the point where nuclear conflict becomes thinkable<br />

The plan—through its conditional bargaining—assumes the logic of consequentially and strategic rationality<br />
Thomas Risse 2000, International Organization 54(1):1-39<br />
&quot;I start with the distinction introduced….influence the strategic interactions themselves&quot;<br />
<br />
this alternative is mutually exclusive with the plan, unconditional engagement is exclusive with conditional engagement<br />
haas and Sullivan, Survival, ’00, p. 113-135<br />
“different types of engagement strategies” “reciprocal act will follow”<br />
<br />
ontology of self interest and non cooperation are mutually exclusive<br />
wendt, same cite, p. 36-37 “ontological issue” “ontologies are incommensurable”<br />
<br />
Conflicts are constructed through communication practices. The affirmative's discourse locks in antagonistic conflict and identity scripts which subsumes positive representations of interaction, making contingent conflicts inevitable<br />
Stephan Stetter et al 03, &quot;The European Union and the Transformation of Border Conflict&quot; June 03, online<br />
&quot;This shift by Galtung towards a stronger focus….very subject positions are re-defined&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking differently about rationality changes the rules of the game—actors can change how they interact with each other by changing their assumptions. This is empirically proven by the largest change in the history of international politics—the cold war ended because Reagan and Gorbachev decided to see the other actor as cooperative, and not conflictual<br />

<strong><u>Counterplan</u></strong><br />
<br />
1NC<br />
Text: The USFG should offer to the government of Iran that, if Iran agrees to demilitarize its islands in the Persian Gulf and to refrain from militarily interfering with shipping of petroleum or gas In the Persian Gulf or the Straits of Hormuz, the United States will engage in an incidents at sea agreement with Iran that includes a pledge not initiate military conflict against Iranian petroleum or gas facilities or Iranian shipping of petroleum or gas in the Persian Gulf or the Straits of Hormuz.<br />
<br />
AND, the CP is competitive ad solves best. Their plan only does one of the two things their solvency author demands, which is an incidents at sea agreement to change the TEACTICS that navies use. Our counterplan asks for MORE, since we also ask them to demilitarize their islands in the straights and guarantee free passage of ships. That is key to prevent straights shutdown and prevent cheating. Their 1AC solvency author concludes this bargain, not just unconditional US guarantees is key<br />

Streusand<br />
“Any such diplomatic initiative…separate diplomatic track”<br />
<br />
<strong><u>AT: Say No</u></strong><br />
1. If Iran says no to the CP, that means they would obviously say no to the plan as well. IF they would not agree to demilitarize or refrain from cutting Hormuz shipments as part of a quid pro quo, they would have LESS incentive to do so for no tangible benefit.<br />
<br />
2. They’d say yes—1AC and 1NC Sokolski cards say it’d be in their interest<br />
<br />
3. Streusand ev says energy resources are most important consideration<br />
<br />
4. Quid pro quo is key to getting Iran to agree to demilitarize the straights—plan gives up only leverage<br />

<u>Don’t Condition CP</u><br />
<br />
Thesis – the outcome of interactions between states is determined by the assumptions each side brings – a context emerges because how each side interprets the rules<br />
Rational choice approaches which assume non cooperation and divergent interests will create conflict, instrumental rationality requires states to treat each other as enemies<br />
The most important question is how the assumptions of plan generate a conflictual interaction out of which a certain context is guaranteed to emerge<br />
Wendt, social theory of international politics, p 331.332 “power relations play” “shared knowledge that they are enemies”<br />
<br />
Plan’s mechanism of diplomacy negotiation and conditioning relies on the assumption that the international arena is constituted by actors with divergent interestw who naturally do not want to cooperate. Not only is this assumption a construction but it ensures conflict between states even to the point where nuclear conflict becomes thinkable<br />
Fierke ’98 changing games, p. 135-138 “dialogue are distinct forms” “division was exposed”<br />
<br />
This guarantees war and institutionalizes violence<br />
Bagshaw, ’01 “challenging discourse on violence”, www.conferences.unimmelb.edu.au/flagship/Abstracts/Bagshaw.pdf<br />
“product of social interaction” “hierarchichal construction”<br />
<br />
this alternative is mutually exclusive with the plan, unconditional engagement is exclusive with conditional engagement<br />
haas and Sullivan, Survival, ’00, p. 113-135<br />
“different types of engagement strategies” “reciprocal act will follow”<br />
<br />
ontology of self interest and non cooperation are mutually exclusive<br />

Conflicts are constructed through communication practices. The affirmative's discourse locks in antagonistic conflict and identity scripts which subsumes positive representations of interaction, making contingent conflicts inevitable<br />

Thinking differently about rationality changes the rules of the game—actors can change how they interact with each other by changing their assumptions. This is empirically proven by the largest change in the history of international politics—the cold war ended because Reagan and Gorbachev decided to see the other actor as cooperative, and not conflictual<br />
