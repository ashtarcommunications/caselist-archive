<br />
Civilization BAD<br />
1.    Totalitarian, agriculture results in uncontrollable famine and disease spread, tyranny, industrialization, and inevitable economic instability<br />
a.    Daniel Quinn 96, “The Story of B”<br />
-    “This isn’t to say that native peoples…..distress of the age.”<br />
<br />
2.    The permanent state of low level conglict occurring in tribal society is key to maintaining cultural diversity and worked for millions of years. Our single culture based on totalitarian agriculture makes catastrophe inevitable<br />
a.    Daniel Quinn 96, “The Story of B”<br />
-    “I asked myself what I knew about warfare….. perhaps even millions.”<br />
3.    Our world is a frog being boiled alive; totalitarian agriculture is the fire heating the water. IT violates every basic natural ethics designed to keep the planet from destruction<br />
a.    Daniel Quinn 96, “The Story of B”<br />
-    Systems thinkers have given us a useful metaphor….for ten thousand years.”<br />

4.    Rejection is the only hope- if we continue to pretend that civilization is repairable, extinction is inevitable. Actions like the affirmative which attempt to repair civilization will make the collapse fatal. We must abandon ship now<br />
a.    John Zerzan 06, <br />
b.    “questions and ideas can only become currents in the world insofar  as reality, external and internal….before destruction and domestication inundate everything”<br />
5.    We do not advocate an alternative because because our role as intellectuals is only to pose the questions- offering a solution would be playing into the very power we critique. However, this does not exclude little actions from being taken in the future by those who hear our questions<br />
a.    Foucault 78, “”the essential works of Michael Foucault volume 3: power”<br />
b.    That’s also an observation people have often made to me: “you never say what the concrete….creative action can also apprear”<br />
6.    Eliminating agricultural subsidies increases the food supply and ultimately supports farming<br />
a.    Lieberman Schaefer 08 “addressing the global food crisis”<br />
-    These subsidies and mandates distort markets and impede…. Situations like the current food crisis.”<br />
