The affirmative falls victim to the fantasy of security as provided by the big other, this creates a vicious cycle in which subjects begin to cede more and more of their freedoms in the name of security until ultimately it culminates in the creation of a fascist state<br />
Todd Mcgowan, 2007, The Real Gaze,: Film Theory After Lacan, p. 110-112<br />
Roma, cittd aperata consistutes…cinema of integration.”<br />
It is only through confronting the horror of catastrophe that we can break free from symbolic authority. So long as we constantly defer our confrontation with catastrophe we are forced to live within the shackled confines of the permanent threat of catastrophe. Zizek points out that living under such a threat is not a life worth living.<br />
Zizek, 2003, February, 28th, in these times, catastrophes real and imaged. P. online<br />
In the war on terror, imminent catastrophe…our happiness.<br />
We’ll concede the impacts to the 1ac, it is only through our acceptance of catastrophe as inevitable that we are able to adopt ourselves to that standpoint, and retroactively insert ourselves into the past. Such anact opens the space for counterfactual possibilites making real political engagement possible.<br />
Zizek, 2003, the puppet and the dwarf, p. 163-166<br />
One should thus invert the existentialist…in our present.<br />
The alternative is to give up all hope and adopt the role of the analyst – instead of asking what the negative should do instead, you should limit your decision to what the affirmative should do differently. Voting negative is not a matter of saying yes or no to the affirmative’s plan but a matter of analyzing the psychological investment that the affirmative has in the politics of the status quo, an their attendant structures of exclusion and depoliticization. Only by analyzing these structures do we clear the way for authentic political acts that can transform the entire ideological system<br />
Zizek, 2000, Contingency, hegemony, universality, p. 124-127<br />
Now I can also answer the obvious…the figure of the Jew.<br />
Only by refusing to participate within the ideological coordinates of the statusq quo can we achieve an authentic political act. This impossible gesture explodes the dominant ideology at its most vulnerable point, that of opting for poltical action outside the meaning that ideology can provide.<br />
Mcgowan, 2007, the real gaze, p. 175-178<br />
The alliance between the theorist…symbolic identity.<br />
To wake up is to traverse the fantasy of stability. By realizing the fantasy directly through the imaginative function of fiat, we short-circuit its operation. Traversing the fantasy is key to political engagement as no authentic politics can exist without it<br />
Mcggowan, 2004, lacan and contemporary film, fighting our fantasies, p. 160-169<br />
Because symbolic authority is lacking…authors a radical break<br />

Failure to challenge ideology, or the underlying socio-political order directly results in a prohibition of thought making the questioning of the existing order impossible<br />
Zizek, 2001, repeating Lenin, p.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/replenin" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/replenin</a> .htm<br />
What are we to say to this…means nothing.<br />
Realism is inherently utopian. By assuming that their exists some global mechanism which can isolate and prevent or solve every problem within it, the aff is assuming that there exists some global wholeness that we could achive only if we address this other. However, our K critiques these assumptions while establishing that it is the very lack of wholeness in ideology which allows us to deconstruct it, making individual political agency possible<br />
Zizek, 2000, Contingency, hegemony, universality, “holding the place”, p. 324-325<br />
The first thing to note about this neoliberal…the content to fill it in.<br />
The only way to break free is to maintain distance from fantasmic politics<br />
Stavrakakis, 1999, lacan and the political, p. 118-119<br />
In fact, articulating, lacanian theory…of political reality<br />
