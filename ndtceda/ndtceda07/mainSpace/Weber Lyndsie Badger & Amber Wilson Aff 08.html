Presi. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called…. You will see for yourself what will the next stage,” Ahmadinemjad added. <br />
<br />
Isolation offers, opening authoritarian regimes to the outside world is key to achieving change Bremmer 2007 <br />
“ US policies toward Iran and N. Korea…. We know this approach won’t work”<br />
<br />
Additionally, the threat of sanctions only accelerate the timetable for development of nuclear weapons: Guardian newspaper Limited 2007 <br />
“iran warned yesterday…told a group of western journalists”<br />
<br />
And American militarism I stalling Iranian internal reform it grants political cover and props up the failed theocratic system: Saunders 2007 <br />
“We have had this revolutions for 28 years… this unfolding metamorphosis”<br />
<br />
Plan text: The US FG should increase it constructive engagement by restoring full diplomatic ties with the government of Iran and increase foreign assistance by releasing Iranian assets. <br />
<br />
Advantage : is Saudi Arabian Prolifer. <br />
Iranian development of nuclear capabilities will lead to quick proliferation throughout Sunni countries, specifically Saudi Arabia. McFaul, Milani, Diamond, 2007 <br />
“At the same time, our public diplomacy….just as Pakistan did with India” <br />
<br />
And Saudi proliferation will spiral into widespread proliferation: MuInis 2005 <br />
“the emergence of a nuclear….. to thwart this dangerous trajectory” <br />
<br />
Additionally, Saudi proliferation will aprak wild fire vertical and horizontal proliferation internationally Blank 2003 <br />
“Obviously, that kind of transformation….. becomes that much more real” <br />
<br />

MfFaul, Milani, and Diamond, 2007 “A win-win U.S. Strategy with Iran” the Washington Quarterly<br />
<br />
Given Past and present failures…<br />
…testify to the real feelings of the Iranian people<br />
<br />
<br />
And, Iran is willing ot make concession on the nuclear program if US is willing ot compromise<br />
Hamilton 07 (The Independent, London)<br />
But it is also true that Iran has a perfectly good case<br />
Iran far more than Iraq that he should set out his stall<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, Iran is committed to constructive engagement approaches<br />
Movahedian, 2007 (The Guardian 2007)<br />
Iran, by contrast, has demonstrated throughout….<br />
