<strong>CP: Lift the Tariff</strong><br />
Text: The United States executive should lift all import tariffs on ethanol.<br />
<br />
Bush can do the counterplan unilaterally and it will immediately decrease food prices<br />
American Meat Institute 2008 [AMI, Other Groups, Urge President To Immediately Suspend Import Tariff on Ethanol”, 6/2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.meatami.com/ht/display/ArticleDetails/i/39583" rel="nofollow">http://www.meatami.com/ht/display/ArticleDetails/i/39583</a>]<br />
The American Meat Institute, joined by more ... food as fuel,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
The CP solves - the import tariff has a larger effect on U.S. ethanol markets than other biofuel subsidies<br />
PR Newswire 2008 [“Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Supports EPA Decision But Urges U.S. Congress to Do Its Part on Ethanol Import Tariff”, 8/7, lexis]<br />
The 2008 U.S. Farm Bill reduced subsidies ... down the road could be quite high.&quot;<br />
<br />
The counterplan is comparatively better than the plan and the permutation – cutting corn ethanol immediately guts the infrastructure investments necessary for cellulosic ethanol.  Lifting the import tariff solves but doesn’t immediately hurt corn.  The plan will immediately increase oil prices – increasing food prices and destroying U.S. foreign policy<br />
Lugar 2008 – U.S. Senator (Richard, CQ Congressional Testimony, “Global Food Crisis”, 5/14, lexis)<br />
While we should understand the impact ... disease eradication, and nutrition.<br />
<br />
Cutting subsidies and removing the tariff will lower overall ethanol production – this will increase the retail price of ethanol and undermine investments in the infrastructure for E85 ethanol <br />
Kruse et al, 07 - Global Insight (John, “Economic Impacts of Not Extending Biofuel Subsidies”, AgBioForum, Volume 10 // Number 2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.agbioforum.org/v10n2/v10n2a04-kruse.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.agbioforum.org/v10n2/v10n2a04-kruse.htm</a>)<br />
The impact of the loss of biofuel’s tax ... continued to cover operating costs.<br />
<br />
E85 is the vital internal link to ending oil dependence<br />
Hendricks et al, 07 - Senior Fellow with the Center for American Progress where he works on issues of climate change and energy independence (Bracken, Apollo’s Fire, p. 56)<br />
When these steps are implemented together ... improve our carbon footprint.<br />
<br />
Lifting the import tariff and modifying the tax credit to be based on the energy content per gallon of biofuel will cause a shift away from corn to advanced biofuels – this is key to reducing warming and providing energy security<br />
Babcock, 07 - director of the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University (Bruce, “High Crop Prices, Ethanol Mandates, and the Public Good: Do They Coexist?” Spring, Iowa Ag Review,<br />

The fact that current policy increases ... less tilted toward corn-based ethanol.<br />
<br />
<strong>DA - Cellulosic Ethanol</strong> <br />
Cellulosic ethanol is just beginning to become commercially available due to greater investment<br />
UPI Energy, 08 (“Analysis: New crops alter food, fuel fight”, 5/2, lexis)<br />
<br />
As oil prices rise and food-based ... called cellulosic ethanol.<br />
Eliminating any biofuel subsidies will devastate cellulosic ethanol investment<br />
Karsner, 08 – Department of Energy (“RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN U.S. RENEWABLE FUELS POLICY AND FOOD PRICES”, Federal News Service, Senate Hearing, 6/12, lexis)<br />
SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman ... would see capital drive to a trickle.<br />
<br />
Cellulosic ethanol is vital to reducing oil dependence – preventing Middle East conflict<br />
Lugar and Woolsey, 99 – Chair of the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee AND Director of Central Intelligence from 1993 to 1995 (Richard and James, Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb, “The New Petroleum”, proquest)<br />
OIL IS a magnet for conflict. The problem ... sophisticated armament programs.<br />
<br />
Oil dependence risks extintion<br />

Apparently an imminent peak ... in a nuclear apocalypse.<br />
<br />
<strong>DA - Gas Prices</strong><br />
Gas prices are high but decreasing<br />
CNN, 08 (“Gas prices fall for sixth straight day”, 9/6, <br />

Gasoline prices eased for the sixth ... last year's Sept. 4 prices.<br />
<br />
Cutting ethanol subsidies increases gas prices, this will destroy the U.S. economy<br />
Dineen, 08 - President &amp; CEO Renewable Fuels Association (Bob, CQ Congressional Testimony, 5/15, lexis)<br />
Governor Perry's request acknowledges that reducing ... impact on the U.S. economy.<br />
<br />
U.S. economic contraction would cause collapse, mass starvation, totalitarianism, and nuclear war<br />
Nyquist 05 - expert in geopolitics and international relations, WorldNetDaily contributing editor (J.R, “The Political Consequences of a Financial Crash,” 2-4-05, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/geo/pastanalysis/2005/0204.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/geo/pastanalysis/2005/0204.html</a>)<br />
Should the United States experience a ... and now we must die.”<br />
<br />
It turns the case - corn prices won’t effect food prices overall but gas prices could will double them<br />
Khosla, 07 – CEO of Khosla Ventures and ethanol investor (Vinod, “Food vs. Fuel”,<br />
