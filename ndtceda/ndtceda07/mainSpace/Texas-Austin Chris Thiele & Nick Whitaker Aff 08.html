</strong><u>Contention Three – How to Judge</u><strong><br />
We offer a unique method of judging that deals with a major problem in debate – most of what is said in debate has nothing to do with reality<br />
Subpoint A – policy debaters read disads with ridiculous internal links that laughably suppose every action ends the world. The result is that everyday inequities suffered by marginalized populations gets ignore in favor of a myopic focus on nuclear war <br />

Subpoint B – critique debaters replace instrumentally effective action with ideological mystifications when they race to “it’s all because of capital-race-sex-neoliberal -age-nuclear-oriental – or fill-in-the-blank-ism”.

Our evaluative framework has two components <br />
First – data <br />
You should evaluate competing predictions under the following probability hierarchies:<br />
A claim plus a warrant with even weak data to support should be given near zero probability <br />
Only a claim plus warrant with strong data should be given a default near-100% probability<br />
Strong data requires the following:<br />
1) A sample size greater than casual analysis<br />
2) Explicit citation of where the data set comes from and who conducted the research <br />
3) Models – regressions for Bayesian statistics, strong surveys, or similar theory which makes testable predictions<br />
Absent strong data, arguments should be assigned near zero probability <br />
