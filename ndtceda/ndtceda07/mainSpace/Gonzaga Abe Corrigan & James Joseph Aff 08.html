 <span style="font-size: 10pt">IN THE FIRST EVER BOOK ON THE TOPIC, HERODOTUS DESCRIBES THE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GREEKS AND PERSIANS THAT LED TO THE BREAKDOWN OF CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT CALLED THE PERSIAN WARS. PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE WAS MADE DIFFICULT BY THE ZOROASTRIAN SENSE OF ABSOLUTE MORALITY THAT VIEWED THE WORLD AS A CONFLICT BETWEEN AHURA-MAZDA, THE FORCE OF ABSOLUTE GOOD, AND AHRIMAN, THE FORCE FOR ABSOLUTE EVIL. THIS BINARY UNDERSTANDING CONTINUES TO MAKE PEACEFUL RELATIONS BETWEEN IRAN AND THE WEST, BUT NOW IT IS THE US THAT PRACTICES THE ZOROASTRIAN DUALISM. THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE AHRIMAN INTO AHMADINEJAD, AND AHURA-MAZDA INTO AMERICA. </span><br />

CURRENT SYSTEMS OF POLICY MAKING AND DEBATE REPRESS THESE MYTHS UNDER A GUISE OF FALSE OBJECTIVITY, BUT SUCH AN ACT MERELY RENDERS ARMAGEDDON DESIRABLE. </span><br />

Contention One: Inherency<br />
<br />
The new National Security Strategy document proves that the Bush Doctrine is as strong as ever – threatening Iran with pre-emptive strikes the epitome of this policy<br />
North 2k6 [David North, the leader (national secretary) of the Socialist Equality Party in the United States, “Bush administration renews “preemptive war” strategy”, 17 March 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/mar2006/nsec-m17.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/mar2006/nsec-m17.shtml</a>]<br />

Iran will retaliate if the US attacks – this comes directly from the senior military advisor to Khamenei<br />

<br />
Competent US military commanders …. the very midsummer of madness, and it must be stopped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our nuclear war outweighs yours – war with Russia is the only war scenario that ensures planetary extinction.<br />
Caldicott 2k2 [(Helen- Founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility, The new nuclear danger, p. 7-12)]<br />
<br />
If launched from Russia …… satellite could actually trigger annihilation of the planet.<br />
<br />
Additionally, a US attack would lead to Iran closing the Straits of Hormuz<br />
Miles 2k7 [Jack Miles is a senior fellow for religious affairs with the Pacific Council on International Policy and a professor of English and religious studies at the University of California, Irvine., “IRAQ AND INTERNATIONAL LAW: Occupational hazard”, Published: August 29, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/08/29/opinion/edmiles.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/08/29/opinion/edmiles.php</a>]<br />
<br />
But the most obvious …..without haste but with all deliberate speed.<br />
<a name="_Toc176335010"></a><br />
<br />
This isn’t just political theorizing or rumors. Iran already has military plans to shut down the strait when the US attacks<br />
Timmerman 2k6 [Nobel Peace Prize Nominee for his writing on Iran, 2006 (Kenneth, “Iran Readies Plan to Close Strait of Hormuz” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/2/28/181730.shtml%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/2/28/181730.shtml)</a>]<br />
<br />
Iran's Revolutionary Guards are …….with information contained in the NDAJA plan.<br />
<br />
Even if Iran couldn’t completely shut down the Strait of Hormuz, it still will do enough damage to severely dispute oil<br />
Cordesmand and Al-Rodhan 2006 [Anthony H., Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy and Khalid R., Visiting Fellow, Center for Strategic and International Studies, “Iranian NuclearWeapons? Options for Sanctions and Military Strikes”, August 30, 2006]<br />
<br />
In any case, Iran could ….. and use Hezbollah and Syria to threaten Israel.<br />
<br />
The US would be affected – Iran can still upset oil markets even though we don’t buy any oil from them<br />
Sandalow 2007 [David Sandalow, Energy and Environment Scholar at The Brookings Institution, 1-22-07. Ending Oil Independence. Brookings Institution. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:4lxAo0otrlsJ:www.brookings.edu/views/papers/fellows/sandalow20070122.pdf+oil+shock+dependency&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6&amp;gl=us" rel="nofollow">http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:4lxAo0otrlsJ:www.brookings.edu/views/papers/fellows/sandalow20070122.pdf+oil+shock+dependency&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6&amp;gl=us</a>]<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, many national security vulnerabilities …. fleets run almost entirely on oil<br />
<br />
This outweighs any other economic collapse scenario – closing the strait would cause unthinkable harms to the economy.<br />
Palmer 80 [Times Magazine, “The Threat to the Oil Flow” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954565-2,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954565-2,00.html</a>]<br />
<br />
The late Shah once called … an atom bomb fell on New York.&quot;<br />
<br />
The final impact is extinction<br />
Bearden 2k [Tom Bearden, Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army, 6-24-00, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3aaf97f22e23.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3aaf97f22e23.htm</a>, ACC: 9.11.03, p. online]<br />
<br />
History bears out that desperate …..at least for many decades.<br />
<br />
<br />
Strikes make all your impacts inevitable – an attack would cause untold damage to US perception, ensure attacks against US cities, and instantly kill millions<br />
Lendman 2k7 [LENDMAN, contributor to Global Research, March 2K7 Stephen, If the US attacks Iran....: George Bush's &quot;Samson Option&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=5008" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=5008</a>]<br />
<br />
If the US attacks Iran, all … with the US having the biggest barrels and largest shoe sizes.<br />
<br />
Contention Three: The Precedent<br />
<br />
Attacking Iran gives the Bush Doctrine a new storyline that justifies its future use<br />
Amuzegar 2k6 [Jahangir, finance minister and economic ambassador in Iran’s pre-1979 government, MIDDLE EAST POLICY, VOL. XIII, NO. 2, SUMMER 2006, The Author Journal Compilation, Middle East Policy Council “NUCLEAR IRAN: PERILS AND PROSPECTS”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-4967.2006.00252.x" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackwell-synergy.com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-4967.2006.00252.x</a>]<br />
<br />
To paraphrase a celebrated dictum, ….. that this can be done in a single night.87<br />
<br />
The Bush Doctrine allows Russia to justify genocide against the Chechen people<br />
Durkay 2k2 [Columbia Daily Spectator, 2K2, University Wire October 31, L/N]<br />
<br />
The United States government has …. and human lives always come last.<br />
<br />
We must each take a stance to end the Chechen genocide – silence is complicity<br />
Lam Center 2k [Stop genocide in Chechnya, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.idee.org/genocideappeal.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.idee.org/genocideappeal.htm</a> ]<br />
<br />
Today, at the beginning of ….. make Russia stop the genocide.<br />
<br />
Genocide outweighs omnicide<br />
Lang 90 [Professor of Humanities @ Trinity college, 1990 Act and Idea in the Nazi Genocide, pg13]<br />
<br />
When the push of a …. acting both collectively and individually.<br />
<br />
A public declaration against the Bush Doctrine is key – only then can we end the precedent<br />
Bacevich 2k7 [Andrew J. Bacevich, a professor of international relations at Boston University, former director of its Center for International Relations, March 1, 2007, “Rescinding the Bush Doctrine”, Boston.com news, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/03/01/rescinding_the_bush_doctrine/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/03/01/rescinding_the_bush_doctrine/</a>]<br />
<br />
RATHER THAN vainly sniping at …. standing in the eyes of the American people.<br />
<br />
Hence the Plan:<br />
The United States Federal Government should normalize diplomatic relations with the government of Iran and offer them a security guarantee that the United States Federal Government will not preemptively attack Iran or support any other entity attempting to do the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Four: Solvency<br />
<br />
Iran wants the plan – informal negotiations prove.<br />
Amuzegar 2k6 [Jahangir, finance minister and economic ambassador in Iran’s pre-1979 government, MIDDLE EAST POLICY, VOL. XIII, NO. 2, SUMMER 2006, The Author Journal Compilation, Middle East Policy Council “NUCLEAR IRAN: PERILS AND PROSPECTS”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-4967.2006.00252.x" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackwell-synergy.com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-4967.2006.00252.x</a>]<br />
<br />
Acutely aware of the fact that, …. the expense of Iran’s national interest.<br />
<br />
Iran strikes bad – we can’t find the reactors<br />

<br />
There are no risk-free military options …. and other hardened facilities.<br />
<br />
Iran’s facilities are super strong and are designed to stop bunker busters.<br />
Cordesmand and Al-Rodhan 2k6 [Anthony H., Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy and Khalid R., Visiting Fellow, Center for Strategic and International Studies, “Iranian NuclearWeapons? Options for Sanctions and Military Strikes”, August 30, 2006]<br />
<br />
It is not clear such weapons …. or report far higher construction standards than are actually executed<br />
<br />
The US is the only country able to give Iran a security guarantee that will mean anything<br />
Layne 2k7 [Christopher Layne, associate professor of International Affairs at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&amp;M University, 2007, American Empire: A Debate, p. 79]<br />
<br />
The United States’ experience with China …. drives its quest to obtain nuclear weapons.
