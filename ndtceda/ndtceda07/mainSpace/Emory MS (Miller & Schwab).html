Contention One—Defining the terrorists<br />
Condileeza Rice once said:<br />
“When are we going to stop making excuses for the terrorists and saying that somebody is making them do it? No, these are simply evil people who want to kill . . . .This isn’t about some kind of grievance.”<br />
This quote is illustrative of the dangerous trend now driving US foreign policy. The United States harbors an essentialist view of Islamists—We see them all as backwards terrorists who hate our freedoms and seek to destroy the west. This ignorant and totalizing view ignores the real causes of violence and is hell bent on creating a clash of civilizations<br />
Eliott 07 [Nicolas Elliott, The Future Geopolitical Legitimacy of Islamism: The Case of Hamas, HONORS THESIS Presented to the Honors Committee of Texas State University-San Marcos In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For Graduation in the Mitte Honors Program, May 2007]<br />
<br />
The emergence of <u>academic …dangerous by making “Islam” into an object. (2003: 59-60)</u><br />
<br />
Moreover, this essentialized view of Islam degrades an entire society and recalls the logic of colonization<br />

<br />
TERRORISM, ORIENTALISM, AND THE ADVENT OF OSAMA BIN LADEN……crucial to the neocolonial effort.<br />
<br />
Nowhere is this essentialism more apparent than the struggle for palestinian liberation. Palestinian organisations are treated as though they are identical to Al quaeda, despite the fact that they are ideological opposites. This view is propaganda that only serves to encourage violence.<br />

<br />
The Palestinian liberation, “you see, we said so all along. They really do hate us for our values. . .”<br />
<br />
This failure to discriminate between palestinian liberation groups and terrorists like al quaeda has disastrous consequences. FIRST, It leads to genocidal violence as bush and sharon purge all those they determine to be “terrorists,” SECOND, it serves the interests of Al Quaeda by failing to understand the struggles of other groups, and, THIRD, it creates a state of emergency that violates civil liberties and treats the whole world as nothing more than potential terrorists to be destroyed<br />
gregory 2004 [derek, Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East 24.1 (2004)]<br />
<u>It is hard to… we are all potentially Palestinians too</u>.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, This amorphous, panicked, broad-brushed definition of terrorism necessitates an escalating cycle of apocolyptic wars in the name of assuaging our fears<br />

CONTENTION TWO—(Re)Definition<br />
<br />

<br />
Contention Three--Framing<br />
<br />
The primary question in this debate should be how policymakers ought to represent the middle east. The question of representation is not an abstract one—the way we represent the middle east privileges certain practices while marginalizing others. Our role as students of middle eastern security is to put these questions of theory first<br />
Pinar Bilgin, PhD International Politics, University of Wales, Aberystwyth, Department of International Relations Bilkent Univ., <u>Regional Security in the Middle East</u> 2005<br />
<br />
<br />
Any policy which fails to tackle the problem of representations is destined to be counterproductive—the way the US represents the middle east is the ROOT of policy failure in the region<br />

<br />
Uncritically adopting existing methods of representing the Middle East contributes to regional instability and threatens life on earth. Reflection upon these representations MUST be our primary concern<br />
