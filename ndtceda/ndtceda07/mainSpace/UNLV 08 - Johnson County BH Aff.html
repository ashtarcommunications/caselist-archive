Advantage I: Brazil – 2 Scenarios<br />
<br />
Scenario 1– Trade Wars<br />

Thus we offer the following Plan:<br />
<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies for cotton. <br />

The plan saves a million children a year  and pulls millions more people out of poverty<br />
