<strong>SAME SECURITIZATION K AS LISTED UNDER GEORGIA STATE GL BUT WITH THESE ADDITIONS:</strong><br />
Our ideological investment with Iran and its dangerous nuclear program creates a binary narrative which reveals the truth about Iran, yet banishes as irrational anything which contests our preconceived understanding of the situation. This narrative merely serves to produce knowledge of the other as the archrival enemy of the West and a source of instability in need of management and salvation<br />
Izadi and Saghaye-Biria 2007<br />
“The case of Iran’s nuclear program” Journal of Communication Inquiry v31 n2<br />
Using critical discourse analysis, this study … ideologies are often articulated on the basis of the ideological square.<br />
<br />
Our hysteria over Iran’s nuclear program is produced through an orientalist discourse which equates Islam with irrationality and untrustworthiness, trying to maintain the bomb as privilege that can only be granted to those who actively support the expansion of American power<br />

 Security Kritik<br />
Some of the Counterplan<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Securitization Kritik</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The affirmative’s attempts to stabilize the Middle East are framed in the context of the administration’s rhetoric of global security—this frames Middle Eastern Conflict as a threat to the survival of the global order and places the US outside that order as an external moderator that is fighting a moral war against fear</strong><br />
<strong>Noorani 05— Yaseen is Assistant Professor in Near Eastern Studies at the University of Arizona. Previously Lecturer in Arabic Literature at the University of Edinburgh. CR: The New Centennial Review 5.1 (2005) 13-41 “The Rhetoric of Security” project muse</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The Bush administration perpetually affirms that the war against</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The world is inherently relativistic—competing value systems guarantee wars between states. When the mission of statehood goes beyond protection of the state to protection of civilization it escalates warfare by framing others as outside the liberal order</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>William Rasch, Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana University, 2003 “Human Rights as Geopolitics,” Cultural Critique 54, 120-147.</strong><br />
<strong>In the past, we/they, neighbor/foreigner, friend/enemy polarities were inside/outside</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Disorder and insecurity are inevitable but efforts to control this fear have resulted in the deaths of millions the possibility of our utter annhiliation. Instead seeking this impossible fantasy where we are able to suppress and control conflict—the alternative is to affirm difference. This will allow us the break out of the infinite cycle of violence that created their harms in the first place</strong><br />
<strong>Der Derian 98— Political Science Professor, University of Massachusetts. [James, On Security, ed: Lipschitz, The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard, Decentering Security.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>No other concept in international relations packs the metaphysical punch.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Middle Eastern is portrayed as a threat to the stability of the liberal global order. US attempts to stabilize the region are examples of ideological warfare aimed at reshaping the Middle East in our own image. This war can never been won and guarantees perpetual conflict. The rhetoric that shapes this global war against fear is more important than the actual policies we implement—only challenging the rhetorical underpinnings of US security policy can we prevent infinite violence</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>The relationship between the United States and the world order, then, is similar to the relationship in Hobbes between the Leviathan and the civil society that it embodies and represents. The individual members of this civil society are collectively the author of all of the acts of the Leviathan. Yet they have no authority to influence or oppose the actions of the Leviathan, because they have contracted with each other to give over all of their powers to it. The Leviathan itself remains outside their social contract. Similarly, insofar as the United States embodies the normativity</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Any revolutionary change must begin with a systemic critique of the assumptions of the current system— operating in the realm of ideas de-colonies the mind and allows for new politics</strong><br />
<strong>Reinsborough, (Organizer, Rainforest Action Network and Wake Up America Campaign), 2003 Goumal of Aesthetics and Protest, August 2003, Volume 1, Issue 2).</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Direct action— actions that either symbolically or directly shift power relations</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Unconditional Counterplan</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The text changes every round but it reads something like unconditionally stop fucking with the Islamic Republic of Iran.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>T Quid Pro Quo</strong><br />
<strong>A— Interpretation</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>“constructive engagement” is by definition conditional and requires a quid pro quo change in behavior from the target state</strong><br />
<strong>Crocker, 89- Former Assistant Secretary for African Affairs at the Department of State, and the person who coined the term “constructive engagement” (Chester, Fall, foreign affairs, p. 144,. Southern Africa: Eight Years Later.)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Regarding South Africa, constructive engagement was by definition a conditional concept</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>“offer” means the target country must have the option to reject</strong><br />
<strong>Webster’s Online [<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/offer" rel="nofollow">http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/offer</a>]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Offer 2 a : to present for acceptance or rejection</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>b—violation—making an unconditional offer where the only expected change is their acceptance isn’t topical</strong><br />
<strong>Chan, 96, works for The Peace Way Foundation, Established to help secure a resolution to the Burmease conflict, (N., Burma Issues Vol. 6, #3,</strong><br />
<strong>By definition, a policy of &quot;constructive engagement&quot; used by one country</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>c—voter</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1—limits—their interpretation allows the affirmative to increase any amount of foreign assistance to one of the 5 countries or a variety of positive or negative security guarantees like providing troops, confidence building measures or no-attack pledges. This is hundreds of cases and requires a smaller body of solvency literature to reasonably prepare for it—forcing the aff to defend a change in behavior is a vital way to limit the topic</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2—ground—they make it impossible to be neg—under their interpretation it’s topical to tell someone we won’t attack them and they forced the neg into defending “war is good”. All our neg arguments are based on the conditional nature of engagement and why it’s bad to force change within countries</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>d—topicality outweigh the affirmative on magnitude, timeframe and probability</strong>
