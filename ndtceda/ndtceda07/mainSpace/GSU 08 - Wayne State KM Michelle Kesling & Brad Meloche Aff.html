<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Contention One: The Status Quo </span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1906, Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle highlighted how the American meatpacking industry was structured as an amoral jungle where a highly exploitive and dangerous capital rationality rules. However, Upton could not know that what he discovered in the Chicago meatpacking district was just the beginning of what would become the modern atrocity known as Concentrated Animal Feed Operations.

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">CAFOs have emerged as the most significant type of animal farm and have wiped out small local farms. Like Walmart, these operations are fixated on cost efficiency and profit above all other values. The result is massive escalation of suffering and oppression of animals in the name of capital rationality. </span></strong><br />

Within this context, 300 animals are slaughtered every second as animals are transformed into unfeeling machines through the logic of capitalist rationality. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">This system of animal subjugation encourages other nations to create conditions of explotation, despair and poverty within their nations in order to supply cheap feed and meat for US CAFOs.
