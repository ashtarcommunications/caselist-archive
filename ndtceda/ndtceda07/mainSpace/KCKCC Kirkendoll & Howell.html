Plan<br />
THEREFORE WE STAND RESOLVED THAT THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BREAK WITH ITS CURRENT ANTI-MIDDLE EASTERN DOMINATED POLITICS AND ENGAGE IN CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN ENEMY IMAGE WITH AFGHANISTAN, IRAN, LEBANON, THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND SYRIA.<br />
<br />
Observation 1<br />
US claims about ME are mirrors in which we reflect our own thoughts<br />
Ali Khan, 2006. “The Essentialist Terrorist”<br />
P 82 “In addition…and manipulation”<br />
<br />
Our own threat based politics create the threat and result in a self fulfilling prophecy.<br />
P 77 “US lethality…obligatory”<br />
<br />
Enemy image is deeply rooted in policy, laws regarding Muslims civil rights have been effected<br />
P 50<br />
<br />
Reps create us/them dichotomy and demonize the ME, perceived threat<br />
P 67-68 “The Muslim … of violence”<br />
<br />
Hostile reps shape policy, demonization<br />
P 68-69<br />
<br />
US oversimplifies middle easterners- create enemy image<br />
P 62-63<br />
<br />
Overinclusiveness is a mirror<br />
P 62 “despite…prone to violence”<br />
<br />
Enemy image shapes and justifies middle east policy<br />
P 48. “Was written…William Kristed”<br />
<br />
Use enemy image to make more just action<br />
P 48-49 “Spritiual love…propaganda”<br />
<br />
US enemy image creates a threat image based of post 9/11 assumptions.<br />
P 53 “to the contrary…Muslims to embrace”<br />
<br />
Enemy image is equivalent to genocide<br />
P 50 “The hitlist…in their being”<br />
<br />
Frame work<br />
<br />
Debate is based around the speech act. The round should be evaluated on our language.<br />
Alvin Saperstein, 1997. “Complexity, Global Politics and National Security”
