de facto consentrations of socio-economic class segregation in public<br />

Global nuclear war<br />
Mead ’92 (Walter Russell, Senior Fellow – Council on Foreign Relations, New Perspectives Quarterly, Summer, p. 30)<br />
The failure to develop an international system to hedge against the possibility of worldwide depression- will open their eyes to their folly. Hundreds of millions-billions-of people around the world have pinned their hopes on the international market economy. They and their leaders have embraced market principles-and drawn closer to the West-because they believe that our system can work for them. But what if it can't? What if the global economy stagnates, or even shrinks? In that case, we will face a new period of international conflict: South against North, rich against poor. Russia. China. India-these countries with their billions of people and their nuclear weapons will pose a much greater danger to world order than Germany and Japan did in the 1930's.<br />

C. Superior Interpretation<br />
Core negative ground is <em>the original holdings are good</em>. They eviscerate that ground by leaving the precedent intact.<br />
Predictable limits:Lurking questions abound, but none are decisions:<br />
Examples:<br />
Quirin: International Human Rights<br />
Casey: Equal Protection<br />
Milliken: Housing and employment discrimination<br />
Morrison: International Law<br />
We need a stable solvency mechanism for productive clash. The range of new grounds is infinite<br />
D. Voting Issue. Topicality is a game of competing interpretations. Its what you justify. Vote negative for limited predictable topic or the affirmative will win every debate with a new unbeatable case<br />

1. Core topic knowledge: Fiat is limited to the court acting in accord with its institutional nature – the court is institutionally constrained from ruling without one. Utopian fiat is antithetical to the unique knowledge of how the courts and the law work.<br />
2. Predictability: There are two sides to every case. We need to know which they rule on so we can research the merits of the other side. They artificially prevent indepth policy analysis.<br />
3. Ground: A specific test case is critical to all core negative link ground. Some cases are more controversial than others &amp; there is in depth literature about every pending case before the court because it sits atop a pyramid of lower court argument.<br />
4. If they “fiat” a test case its illegitimate &amp; a voting issue—it fiats that a private citizen file the suit &amp; that the Supreme Court act. Private actor fiat is an extra-topical voting issue because it prove the resolution is insufficient to solve the harm
