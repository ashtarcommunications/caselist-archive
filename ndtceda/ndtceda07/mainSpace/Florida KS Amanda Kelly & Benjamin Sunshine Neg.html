 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span>Executive Impoundment CP<br />
<br />
Observation One: The counterplan is non-topical and not an agent counterplan.<br />
<br />
Impoundment doesn't eliminate the subsidy – it just removes its legal effect<br />
Brownell 1 – Attorney at Muldoon Murphy &amp; Faucette LLP and Former<br />
Editor-in-Chief of American University Law Review<br />
[Roy E., II, &quot;THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATUS OF THE PRESIDENT'S IMPOUNDMENT<br />
OF NATIONAL SECURITY FUNDS,&quot; Seton Hall Constitutional Journal, Fall,<br />
12 Seton Hall Const. L.J. 1, Lexis]<br />
Unlike with enhanced rescission…law is being implemented, just not at<br />
the pace intended by Congress.<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Solvency<br />
<br />
Impoundment solves the case – it allows the president to unilaterally<br />
refuse to spend appropriated funds<br />
Wiesner 90 – Practicing Attorney in New York<br />
[Michael J., &quot;BEYOND BOWSHER: A SEPARATION OF POWERS APPROACH TO THE<br />
DELEGATION OF BUDGETARY AUTHORITY,&quot; Brooklyn Law Review, Winter, 55<br />
Brooklyn L. Rev. 1405, Lexis]<br />
Executive impoundment may be defined…was never strongly objected to by<br />
the Congress. n159<br />
<br />
Observation Three: Fiscal Discipline<br />
<br />
Mass impoundment by the president will create a policy showdown with<br />
Congress that is vital to restore a culture of fiscal discipline and<br />
check runaway deficits<br />
Schmitt 00 – Practicing Attorney in Missouri and Candidate for<br />
Missouri State Senate<br />
[Eric Stephen, &quot;THERE IS NO JOY IN D.C., THE MIGHTY COURT STRUCK OUT:<br />
AN ANALYSIS OF CLINTON V. CITY OF NEW YORK, THE LINE ITEM VETO ACT AND<br />
THE COURT'S FAILURE TO UPHOLD CONSTITUTIONALLY LEGITIMATE MEANS TO A<br />
VIABLE END,&quot; Saint Louis University Law Journal, Winter, 44 St. Louis<br />
L.J. 167, Lexis]<br />
The line item veto is a vital piece of the long-term budget…get the<br />
issue back on the legislative table and to the forefront of American<br />
politics.<br />
n247. It should be noted that the Train…and hogtie pork barrel spending.<br />
<br />
Unchecked budget deficits will tank the global economy<br />
Martin 8 – Retired U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander and Former Officer<br />
in the Office of Naval Intelligence<br />
[Al, &quot;Protocols For Economic Collapse In America,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://rense.com" rel="nofollow">rense.com</a>, February<br />
23, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rense.com/general80/protc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rense.com/ general80/protc.htm</a>]<br />
The day of reckoning is now coming…that is effectively what<br />
Comptroller General David Walker is saying.<br />
<br />
Economic collapse will trigger nuclear war<br />
Mead 92 – Senior Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy at Council on Foreign Relations<br />
[Walter Russell, &quot;Depending on the kindness of strangers,&quot; New<br />
Perspectives Quarterly, Summer, p. 28, Academic Search Elite]<br />
If so, this new failure…Germany and Japan did in the '30s.<span style="font-family: Arial"> </span>
