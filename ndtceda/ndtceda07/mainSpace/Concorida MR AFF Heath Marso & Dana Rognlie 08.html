 PLAN: We advocate that the United States Federal Government should constructively engage the government of Afghanistan and offer them foreign assistance by opening its borders to Afghani refugees. <br />
We have arrived at an age of technological prowess. Current logics of neo-liberalism and capitalism have made it seem as though we have reached a homogenous society that knows what the final solutions to our problems are. However, the past century has shown us that this mode of thinking is ethically deficient leading us to the edge of nuclear annihilation. Our task here and now to find a new ethical system – one of hospitality. Fasching explains in 1993  <br />

First, The barring of Afghan refugee’s has become the new utilitarian exceptionalist policy.  <br />

Second, The current logics of consumerism and authoritarianism by the Bush administration have produced social resentment and the view of the disposable refugee <br />

<br />
The governing principles of this order assume an ethic of tolerance not hospitality. Tolerance is a limited hospitality, anti-hospitality <br />
Derrida 2003 ed. Giovanna Borradori (associate prof of phil at Vassar) Philosophy in a Time of Terror: Dialogues with Jurgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida p 127-128 <br />
<br />
Derrida: No. Tolerance is actually…careful hospitality. <br />

Ultimately, these calculative frameworks lead to eugenics and extermination of the Other <br />

Part 2: Our Ethic  <br />
Our advocacy rejects status quo utilitarian frameworks to avoid authoritarianism and extinction-only then can we approach a new ethics  <br />

We call upon the cities to radically reorient rights protections and reject and move to dislodge privileged positions through a new geopolitical solidarity  <br />

<br />
By this second paragraph … undergoing some political plight. <br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, our advocacy embodies our embrace of the ethics of hospitality in our local day to day actions to approach our political vision  <br />

<br />
As the question of the …possibility of friendship <br />
<br />
<br />
And, our advocacy demands recognition of the faces of the refugees –those who are hidden from our view. This is necessary to overcome the ethics of the squo and instill a value to their lives <br />
<br />
Butler in 2k4 (Judith, Prof of Rhetoric @ U of Berkeley, “Precarious Life” p. xvii-xix, hcm) <br />
<br />
The Levinasian face … lead to that conclusion. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, despite the shortcomings of our actions, the practical actions of the state is constantly in conflict with the absolute demands for a new ethic. The only way we can ever approach the effectively political and ethical action is by negotiating between these extremes <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Part 3: Cosmo-politics  <br />
<br />
Our advocacy demands cosmo-political justice that transcends and re-orients politics of rights and systems of sovereignty. Our unconditional ethic allows us to combat the violence of neo-liberalism <br />
<br />
Derrida in 2k1(Jacques, On Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness, p. 3-10)  <br />
<br />
Where have we received … the beginning of the 1990s. <br />

The Refugee does not fall within this order of human rights and challenges the foundations of the current politics based within sovereignty and opens up a possibility of a new politics <br />

<br />
If the refugee…humankind today thinkable. <br />
<br />
And, although we can’t go back and change the past, we can try to make things better. Our advocacy of  <br />
allowing refugees to be admitted to the U.S. would serve has an apology for its hubristic quagmire in Afghanistan <br />
