1. Engagement with Iran fails – multiple reasons<br />

When devising a foreign policy toward Iran, two main challenges exist. First, Iran’s leaders themselves… feared Washington might set its sights on Tehran after Baghdad.<br />
<br />
<br />
This argument is offense: Diplomatic engagement decreases legitimacy of efforts to contain the regime while at the same time being counterproductive<br />

The damage, however, had already … sort of normalization with the United States.26<br />
