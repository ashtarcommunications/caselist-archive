<strong>Plan (Subject to modification to avoid the dumb and trivial PIC of the week): T</strong><strong>he United States Federal Government should offer, through direct negotiation through necessary diplomatic channels, to normalize economic and diplomatic relations with the government of Iran if the government of Iran agrees to normalize relations with the United States. The United States Federal Government should offer a legally binding agreement to the government of Iran that the United States will immediately refrain from engaging in or promoting the first use of military force against Iran if but not necessarily only if Iran agrees to then refrain from producing nuclear explosive devices and allows verifiable multilateral inspections of all Iranian nuclear facilities at standards equivalent to those set by the Additional Protocol of the treaty commonly known as the non-proliferation treaty.</strong><br />
