 <br />
We being with a narrative.<br />
<br />
Jooma Khan, an Afghani man in the Laghman province, watched his entire village shrivel into a wasteland after the United States struck his home with missiles encased and ballasted with depleted uranium:<br />
<br />
&quot;After the Americans destroyed our village and killed many of us, we…lost our houses and have nothing to eat. However, we would have endured these miseries and even accepted them, if the Americans had not sentenced us all to death. When I saw my deformed grandson, I realized that my hopes of the future have vanished for good…I know we are part of the invisible genocide brought on us by America, a silence death from which I know we will not escape.&quot; (Jooma Khan of Laghman province, March 2003)<br />
<br />
Despite numerous case studies and scientific reports, our government refuses to recognize its use of depleted uranium in air strikes in Afghanistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This ongoing nuclear omnicide against the Afghani people indiscriminately kills, diseases, and maims everything, including the future generations of Afghanistan.<br />
Clarke 2006 (Michael<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>“Doing the Wrong Thing in Afghanistan: Depleted<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Uranium: The Definitive Moral Paradox,” July) <br />
<br />
But, they are not telling… the same devastating consequences.<br />
<br />
And, don’t be fooled by benevolent claims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Current laws, which prohibit the use of such weapons, go unheeded. Depleted Uranium isn’t just a weapon of mass destruction; it commits nuclear omnicide and genocide.<br />
Clarke 2006 (Michael<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>“Doing the Wrong Thing in Afghanistan: Depleted<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Uranium: The Definitive Moral Paradox,” July)<br />
<br />
However, the laws of war prohibit….<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"> believes Western countries is immoral. </span><br />
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"> </span><br />
These preemptive unilateralist air strikes are a psychological necessity to maintain the fantastic hyperreal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In this world, we can no longer objectively discern threats as a nation as they are constructed by a capital induced techno strategic ideology that constantly leads to a failed political strategy.<br />
Davis 2006 (Walter A., Professor Emeritus, Ohio State University, Death Dreams Kingdom: The American Psyche since 9-11, pg. 56-59) <br />
<br />
Here is one way to describe… in order to deliver themselves from themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, we cannot afford to subordinate such systemic destruction in the face of a fantastical nuclear lie. The aim of the fantastic is not to avert nuclear war but to prevent the acceptance that such a nuclear war exists.<br />
Kato 1993 (Masahide [ ] Alternatives 18, “Nuclear Globalism: Traversing Rockets, Satellites, and Nuclear War via the Strategic Gaze.”)<br />
<br />
The vigorous invasion of the logic… into battle against nature itself<br />
<br />
Rather, we should abide by an ethical framework of holding responsibility to the Other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Only by affirming our infinite responsibility can we prevent the oppression, maiming, starvation and exclusion of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>those in Afghanistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><br />
Campbell 99.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>(Michael J., professor of political science at the University of Hawaii, Moral Spaces, pg. 33)<br />
<br />
Responsibility understood as such refigures… in contrast to autonomous freedom.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus our affirmation: The United States Federal Government should offer the Government of Afghanistan that it will discontinue its use of depleted uranium in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Zar Ghoon, a man from Kundoz, Afghanistan relays the birth of his baby to a survey team in Kabul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>His village, too, was hit by one of the 2,000 air strikes of depleted uranium that year: <br />
<br />
&quot;My wife was pregnant and we were happily waiting for the moment to see our second child. On the day of the delivery, my wife…had [a] pain in her abdomen. When the baby was born, it was hardly a human. It looked as if some one had beaten a baby and then covered its body with floors. My poor child looked like someone has rolled it in a basket of floors. When my wife saw the baby, she went into shock and died after 5 hours.&quot; (Zar Ghoon, 2002)<br />
<br />
<br />
The sovereign censors such images in order to distance ourselves from the culpability of this ongoing nuclear war in Afghanistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Our affirmation is necessary to comprehend this violence and rupture the sovereign’s false reality by emboldening the image of the child maimed by depleted uranium. <br />
Davis 2006 (Walter A. Death Dreams Kingdom: The American Psyche since 9-11) <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything more evil than shooting… praxis is deprived of its guarantee.<br />
<br />
Emboldening the image of the Other is critical to acknowledge the impossibility of entirely knowing who the Other is, and yet still act unconditionally ethical toward it.<br />
Taylor 6. (Chloe, Department of Philosophy at the University of Toronto, “Hard, Dry Eyes and Eyes That Weep: Vision and Ethics in Levinas and Derrida,” Postmodern Culture, Volume 16, Number 2, January 2006)<br />

Contention 1: Inherency<br />
<br />
Despite criticism from the International Community, the United States<br />
is still maintaining excessive use of air strikes in the helmand -<br />
alienating the population<br />
<br />
The New York Times 2007 (&quot;U.S. Bomb Dropped; 3 British Soldiers Die&quot;<br />
8/25)<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/25/world/asia/25afghan.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/B/Bowley,%20Graham" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08 /25/world/asia/25afghan.html?n =Top/Reference/Times%20Topics /People/B/Bowley,%20Graham</a><br />
&quot;hree British soldiers died in southern Afghanistan&quot; &quot;we wish those<br />
who were injured a speedy recovery.&quot; &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the plan: The United States federal government should offer the<br />
government of Afghanistan a security guarantee that it will<br />
discontinue its Air Strikes and Air Raids in the Hemland Province in<br />
Afghanistan, continuation of this security guarantee will be<br />
contingent upon the Government of Afghanistan allowing leaders of the<br />
hemland province including, Mullah Omar, full governmental roles.<br />
<br />
We will clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 2: Kajaki Dam<br />
<br />
The US is bombing the region surrounding the Kajaki Dam. Errant bombs<br />
risk a complete collapse of the dam.<br />

race.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 3: U.S.-UK Military cohesion<br />
<br />
Due to the nature of the dam, friendly fire incidents are occurring<br />
between the U.S. and Britain- this is fueling discontent as Britain is<br />
calling for a barring of U.S. strikes in the area<br />
<br />
The Herald 2007 (&quot;Tragedy that reopens old wounds over deaths at the<br />

(C. Tang)<br />
IT was, sadly, only...minds campaign in the province.<br />
<br />
<br />
Air raids in the kajaki province is the root cause of the resurgence<br />
in the hemland province- continued strikes only splits current U.S-UK<br />
efforts creating massive instability<br />

The number of civilian deaths...welcoming smile at the British in Helmand.<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, this strategic partnership is on the brink of collapse,<br />
this will cause a U.S. and UK withdraw from Afghanistan and Iraq and<br />
America's failure to leadership on a global stage and an isolationist<br />
approach to politics<br />

 Contention 1: Failed Reforms<br />
Despite attempted reforms, the police force is still unable to carry out the rule-of-law killing the government’s legitimacy- corruption is the cause<br />
BBC 2007 (Replacing Police Chiefs Not The Same as reform – Afghan TV” January 10 l/n)<br />
The police force…in the country.<br />
And, The U.S. has abandoned efforts in police training in Afghanistan, Karzari is pleading for more foreign assistance- this is the worst security situation we have seen in the last 5 years<br />
Stone 2006 (Peter H. “Iraq’s Latest Casualty” National Journal December 11 l/n)<br />
The report drew…its security situation.<br />
Contention 2: Poppy Corruption<br />
Note, lack of an effectively Afghan Police force is allowing the poppy trade to run rampant in Afghanistan – creating more instability<br />
Baldauf 2005 (Scott, staff writer of the Christian science monitor ”Afghanistan's new jihad targets poppy production” CSM May 16)<br />
Over the past…very long time.<br />
This explosive growth of poppy is fueling corruption – this is the underlying cause of instability<br />
Reuters, 2006 (AlertNet, “AFGHANISTAN: Battle against poppy cultivation deepens,” August 24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/30e99078d06edc0a70428d66dc9cbb7e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.alertnet.org /thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/30e99078 d06edc0a70428d66dc9cbb7e.htm</a><br />

Afghanistan remains critical…security at risk.<br />
However this instability won’t be contained just to the Caucasus rather it will draw in the E.U., Iran, China, Turkey, Russia and U.S. and will escalate globally<br />

Contention 3: Kashmir<br />
Rooting out corruption in Afghanistan’s police force is necessary for development in Afghanistan<br />
International Crisis Group 2007 (“Reforming Afghanistan’s Police” August 30)<br />
Rooting out corruption…be addressed urgently.<br />
Furthermore, this development is necessary to combat poverty\<br />
Beehner 2006 (Lionel, recipient of a German Marshall Fund journalism fellowship for a research project on post-Soviet youth movements in Ukraine and Belaru, “Deconstructing Afghanistan “ Council on Foreign Relations August 24) <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/11314/deconstructing_afghanistan.html?breadcrumb=%2Fbios%2F11107%2Flionel_beehner%3Fpage%3D8" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication /11314/deconstructing_afghanist an.html?breadcrumb=%2Fbios %2F11107%2Flionel_beehner %3Fpage%3D8</a><br />

Contention 3: INL<br />
The INL’s credibility is currently shot- lack of personnel and oversight of resources- this is killing interagency cooperation within the state department<br />
U.S. Department of State 2005 (“Inspection of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs”, July 25) <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://oig.state.gov/oig/lbry/50175.htm" rel="nofollow">http://oig.state.gov/oig/lbry /50175.htm</a><br />

Explanation: it is…efficiencies are achieved.<br />
Interagency Cooperation is key to all bilateral assistance programs and anti-money laundering programs that fund terrorist orginizations- the INL is key<br />
State News Service 2006 (The State Department Role In Combating financing of Terrorism)<br />
To help build…financing of terrorism.<br />
Thus the Plan: The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs should substantially increase foreign assistance to the government of Afghanistan by providing necessary amounts of military personnel and training resources to provide consistent training of the Afghan National Police Force in return for a quid pro quo of interior reforms comprised of replacing corrupt officials which reside in the afghan government.<br />
We will clarify<br />
Contention 3: Solvency<br />
The United States should pressure Afghanistan to crack down on internal corruption dealing with opium while at the same time providing foreign assistance to anti-opium projects<br />
Zunes 2006 (Stephen, Middle East editor for the Foreign Policy In Focus Project. He is a professor of politics and the author of Tinderbox: U.S. Middle East Policy and the Roots of Terrorism “Afghanistan: Five Years Later” FPIF Policy Report)<br />
Despite these manifold…path as Iraq.<br />
U.S. is key- quid pro quo vis-a-vi police assistance for interior reforms is necessary for any governmental legitimacy and stability in Afghanistan<br />
LISD 2007 (Liechtenstein Institute on Self Determination, internationally renounded think tank at Princeton University “Creating Stability and Prosperity in Afghanistan and the Region”) <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~lisd/publications/AfghSummary_2006.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.princeton.edu/~lisd /publications/AfghSummary_2006 .pdf</a><br />
Trepidations about possible…within the government.<br />
Additionally more Mentors are key; they provide training necessary to enforce the rule of law- Our plan would be considered a significant increase.<br />
Krongard and Gimble 2006 (Howard J., Inspector General of the Dept. of State, Thomas F.
