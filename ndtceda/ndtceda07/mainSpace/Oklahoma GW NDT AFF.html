 <strong>Traditional modes of understanding the middle east through scientific, calculable modes of knowing are not inefficient in achieving their goals of revealing the world in a particular manner – they simply forget those modes of knowing that their enframing have concealed. Specifically, intellectual attempts at describing the middle east enframe it through a neurotic, xenophobic ontology from which the multitude of beings described can CAN ONLY reveal themselves through discussions and actions aimed at controlling the irrational terrorist. Constructive engagement can only manifest itself in a form of colonial violence within this more of revealing</strong><br />
<br />
Strindberg and Ward 2005 { Realities of Resistance: Hizballah, the Palestinian Rejectionists, and al-Qa’ida Compared Journal of Palestine Studies Issue 135 (Spring 2005)<br />
<br />
The U.S. designation of the Palestinian rejectionists and Hizballah as enemies of the United States… The image of a monolithic and culturally conditioned terrorist enemy is crucial to a neocolonial effort.<br />
<br />
<strong>This mode of revealing the middle east thought its war of terror is founded upon a metaphysical will which attempts to reshapre the world over in our own image reducing out capital B being and beings alike to mere objects to be manipulated by the sovereign self. No longer a neutral will that shapes modern politics, this will is a drive to control merely for the sake of controlling</strong><br />
<br />
Andrew J. Mitchell Standford Univeristy Heidegger and Terrorism Research in Phenomenology 35 2005<br />
<br />
In preparing a definition of war, Clausewitz claims…. Terrorism follows from the transformation is being indictive of the technological age.<br />
<br />
<strong>This will reduces the world to a stable and predictable standing reserve to be called upon as it benefits the self and refuse to value the world as anything else. This ontology represents a constant consumption which renders being objects- setting the tone for global warfare in the work of rejection of the planet.</strong><br />
<br />
Michael Zimmerman, Eclipse of the Self pp220-224 1981<br />
<br />
Although technological culture is supposedly our desiny… But even the devestation of the wars did not essentially change the situation in the modern world.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rather than abandon the resolution in steadfast rejection we release ourselves towards the topic allowing it to reveal itself to us in a multitude of alternative ways by resolving: that the United States federal government should substantially increase its constructive engagement with the governments of one or more of the following countries: Iran, Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, or Afghanistan, and that should include offering them a security guarantee and or/foreign assistance.</strong><br />

<br />
What is of concern is whether… by the optics of coexistence in chapter 3.<br />
<br />
<strong>This gesture is one which invites rather than extripates the terror of being. This is not a final solution or a promise to quell the dangers of the world but affirms them as part of that which makes existence worthwhile, to be terrorized.</strong><br />
Andrew Mitchell Heidegger and Terrorism Research in Phenomeology 35 2005<br />
<br />
The terror experienced today is a clue to the withdrawl of being… we do not too obstinately squelch them.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our mode of thought calls into question the binary between action and inaction revealing how simply being itself is a mode of politics which shatters egotistical managerialism.</strong><br />
Michael Zimmerman Eclipse of the Self pp 245-248 1981<br />
<br />
Under the domination of egoism and self-will… Thinking as thanking means being “poor in spririt”<br />
<br />
<strong>The refusal to allow for the revelation in our method of understanding would be to technologically enframe debate to ensure its infinite reproduction of conservation and serve only to quell critical thinking. Do not misunderstand our argument- we are NOT a new debate dogma but simply openness to alternative forms of debate</strong><br />
William Shanahan and Heiddeger “Kritik of thinking” Debater’s research guide 1993<br />
<br />
Policy has a stanglehold on debate worthy of a NYC transit Cop… the possibility that new perspectives will open remain above.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our releasement reconceptualizes our very understanding of the political- which cannot be viewed as an instrument for mastering the world. Rather than attempt to renegotiate specific political procedures. We question the foundation of what is means to be political in favor of infinite potentiality.</strong><br />
Clare Pearson Geiman 2001 pp 178-180<br />
<br />
With the move to poetic thinking… Poetic thinking points to such a move<br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, our response to this exceptionalism narrative is not shackled to a forced choice between ontology or politics but represents a withdrawl fom the entire spectrum of this domination.</strong><br />

If this is, as I think, what said ultimately means by “humanism”… the Orientalist interpretation of the global occasion is utterly dependent.<br />

 <strong><em>AT: Framework</em></strong><br />
<br />
we should allow the resolution to speak to us<br />
they pick apart the resolution It is a link turn<br />
as conceeded on the T debate<br />
resolved we have to let the resl speak to us<br />
<br />
they frame the world in one way<br />
being is only valuable if<br />
impact turn, foundation of the war on terror<br />
<br />
that the ballot changes anything<br />
<br />
grammar link because they only frame it one way<br />
<br />
we always have a relationship to the resolution<br />
<br />
shanahhan card proves they destroys critical thinking<br />
<br />
limits- heigegger is an impact turn, we get to k your assumptions<br />
<br />
we join debate, why should delibearation only apply to aff<br />
<br />
inevitable<br />
<br />
prove a link to separate ourself to our alt.<br />
<br />
education is the terminal impact to ground<br />
<br />
it divorices us from responsibtity thought action debate<br />
<br />
<strong><em>AT Orientialsim K</em></strong><br />
<br />
this is exactly what the 1ac is<br />
<br />
open up the world to a new mode of world<br />
<br />
perm do the plan and release towards the middle east and the assumptions of the status quo<br />
<br />
WOT does this in the SQ<br />
<br />
thinking it can be solved means there will only be more violence<br />
<br />
this argument links to the CP more<br />
<br />
this links to the K because it makes predications<br />
<br />
<strong><em>AT Constructive Disengagement CP</em></strong><br />
<br />
CP solves none of the aff<br />
<br />
and it links to the K<br />
<br />
it is still a political stratedy and it relies on the technological ontology of the SQ<br />
<br />
they don't solve any political argments<br />
<br />
they still frame constructive engagements<br />
<br />
if ontology shapes politics, then all the assumptions that the CP makes<br />
<br />
CP still treats the world as it needs to be &quot;treated&quot;<br />
