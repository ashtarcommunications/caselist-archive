Plan makes Iran feel encircled – Hamas is a critical proxy<br />
Cook, 2007 (Jonahton, Counterpunch, 7-22, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/saker07212007.html" rel="nofollow">www.counterpunch.org/saker07212 007.html</a><br />
By the Palestinian response … leadership around Abbas.<br />
Appeasement<br />
T- Can’t be QPQ<br />
CP<br />
The United States federal government will lift all economic sanctions on the Gaza and West Bank Governments of Palestine. The United States should inform the government of Egypt that it will no longer provide aid to Egypt unless the Egyptian government allows the Muslim Brotherhood to participate in the Egyptian government and Egypt stops all crackdowns on the Muslim Brotherhood. The United States federal government should declare an end to its regime change activities targeted at the elected Palestinian Legislative Council.<br />
Sanctions have strengthened Hamas’s support<br />
Taylor 2007 (FRIDE Comment, April, Mark B.,<br />
Yet the U.S. and EU positions amount … and increasingly relevant.<br />
Economically shunning Hama s makes them stronger – they could takeover the West Bank<br />
Freedland 2007 (the Guardian,m 6/20) Jonathon<br />
The dangers are multiple … powerful than ever<br />
Sanctions are making the PA irrelevant – the blockade is an admission that the Palestinian state building has failed<br />
Taylor 2007, above<br />
IF before the PA was viewed … Palestinian political transition.<br />

Israel Strikes Disad<br />

A. Israel is concerned with re-establishing the credibility of its deterrent. Its recent strike against Syria was a signal to Syria, Iran and the US that it will protect its own security – especially if the US won’t.<br />

<br />
For now, matters stand in …. this delicate balance.<br />
<br />
This has two impacts.<br />
<br />
C1. Israeli First Strike<br />
<br />
The circumstances surrounding the US effort to denuclearize Iran are the key barrier preventing an Israeli strike. Israeli must be confident that their security interests are preserved by the plan or they will attack.<br />

C. Impact<br />
1. Pay-Go key to restore perception of fiscal responsibility<br />

A more credible military …. acquiring nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
C. Impact<br />
<br />
1. International balancing against Iran is necessary to prevent the development of Iranian oil fields; which would collapse U.S hegemony and make economic collapse inevitable<br />

B. Vote Negative because the state is the root cause of everything bad.<br />

<br />
Conflict Resolution Critique<br />
<br />
A. ELITE PEACE: THE AFF’S GENERIC CONFLICT RESOLUTION DEVALUES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBALTERN - ALLOWING THOSE WHO ARE OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED TO SPEAK FOR A VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE<br />
<br />
Robert C. SCHEHR, Asst Prof Criminal Justice, U of Illinois-Springfield and Dragan MILOVANOVIC, Prof Criminal Justice, Sociology, &amp; Social Work, Northeastern Illinois U, 1999, “Conflict mediation and the postmodern,” Social Justice, Spring, p. 208+<br />
<br />
The second tension …. interest to the subaltern.<br />
<br />
B. EXPORTING ORDER:<br />
<br />
THE NOTION OF ENDING CONFLICT DEPENDS ON A CERTAIN UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH ORDER AND PEACE. MAKE NO MISTAKE, WHAT WE HERE IN AMERICA UNDERSTAND AS ORDER AND PEACEFUL IS RADICALLY HEGEMONIC TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. THE AFF IS TRYING TO PROVIDE CONTINUITY FOR A VERY PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. IT IS HIDING ITS VIOLENCE IN THE WILL TO DO GOOD. WE NEED TO CRITIQUE THE UNDERLYING EPISTEMOLOGY OF EXPORTING ORDER.<br />
<br />
Richmond, Pf of Intl Relations, U of St. Andrews, 2001 (Oliver P., Alternatives, July-Sept, v 26, i3)<br />
<br />
Ending conflict …. claims, and human-security issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
C. VOTE AGAINST THE AFF’S NEGOTIATION BECAUSE PEACE BETWEEN ELITES AIN’T PEACE ON THE STREETS. THE AFF DEVALUES THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BEAR THE BRUNT OF ANY STATE NEGOTIATIONS<br />
<br />
Robert C. SCHEHR, Asst Prof Criminal Justice, U of Illinois-Springfield and Dragan MILOVANOVIC, Prof Criminal Justice, Sociology, &amp; Social Work, Northeastern Illinois U, 1999, Social Justice, Spring, p. 208+<br />
<br />
Overreliance on master ….solve the conflict comprehensively&quot; (p. 313).<br />
<br />
OUR ALTERNATIVE IS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE.<br />
IF WE WANT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THEORY TO REMAIN TRUE TO ITS MORAL COMMITMENT, WE NEED TO BRING THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS OF PEACEBUILDING TO ITS REVOLUTIONARY CONCLUSION. WE NEED THE ELEVATION OF NORMATIVE ISSUES WITHIN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CONFLICT AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES AS NON-PASSIVE PART OF THE DEFINITION OF PEACE BUILDING.<br />
Richmond, Pf of Intl Relations, U of St. Andrews, 2001 (Oliver P., Alternatives, July-Sept, v 26, i3)<br />
<br />
One strong contender …. the threat of dominance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Topicality<br />
<br />
Constructive engagement is incentives/ not quid pro quo<br />
<br />
Interpretation<br />
<br />
In order to be topical, the affirmative must unconditionally provide an incentive to governments with the hope that they will accede to American interests. This does not include a quid pro quo.<br />
Gary C. Gambill. April 2003. The American-Syrian Crisis and the End of Constructive engagement.<br />
“Until last month, the parameters…..Egypt’s treaty with Israel.”<br />

2. Iran DA<br />

Unchecked proliferation causes nuclear war and extinction<br />
“Victor Utgoff. 2002. “Proliferation, Missile Defence and American Ambitions” p. 87-90.<br />
<br />
3. Oil DA<br />
<br />
Engagement in relation to the Middle East is the sure fire way to decrease global oil prices<br />

High oil prices are key to the Russian economy<br />
The National Interest, Summer 2003.<br />

Efforts to foster peace in the Middle East will immediately drive down oil prices<br />

Uniqueness: AIPAC has been unsuccessful in convincing America to invade Iran<br />
Gary Leupp. 2/24/07. “An American Strike on Iran is Essential for Our Existence,”<br />
“Now, as Israeli calls for…..must be shaken awake.”<br />
<br />
When politicians make Anti-Israeli policies, they rock the boat to get back on AIPACS good side<br />

AIPAC is trying to convince Congress to invade Iran; it is an obvious concession that Congress would give in on<br />
Gary Leupp. 2/24/07. “An American Strike on Iran is Essential for Our Existence.”<br />
“We are perhaps arriving at….waters have already been tested.”<br />
<br />
The impact is nuclear terrorism, shutdown of the gulf of Hormuz, and global anti-americanism; regardless of whether or not Iranian air strikes debilitate the nuclear program<br />
Mark Fitzpatrick. March 07. “Can Iran’s Nuclear Capability Be Kept Latent?”<br />
“Assuming that air strikes…..additional set of enemies.”<br />
<br />
These new waves of terrorism would result in global nuclear war<br />

Bush will hold off an Iraq withdrawal now<br />

6. EU CP<br />
<br />
Text: The European Union will sign the Association Agreement with Syria in exchange for cooperation with Syria on problems of Syrian-Iraqi border security and Syria’s agreement to cut all financial assistance to Al Qa’ida. If Syria does not accept or comply with this condition, the EU will cut off all trade with Syria. The European Union should provide troops on the Iraq-Syria border to stem possible arms provisions to Al-Qa’ida. The EU will also help provide disarmament efforts, help strengthen the local representative bodies, develop social market structures, and build national civic organizations in Iraq. The United States will make an internal political decision to never pursue a regime change in Syria.<br />
<br />
1. EU can use the association agreement as leverage when bargaining with Syria.<br />
AFP. “EU waiting for right political climate to seal Syria accord” 9-13-07<br />
“A senior European Parliament…..blamed on Damascus.”<br />
<br />
