MSU CP 1NC<br />
The Executive Branch of the United States Federal Government should make a classified, internal decision not to: --attack Iran –escalate military conflict with Iran in response to a Naval incident, or use of force in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria or Lebanon –engage in first use of weapons of mass destruction against Iran, including bunker busters –make public statements threatening regime change, use of military force or labeling Iran as part of the axis of evil. The United States Federal Government will offer to transfer responsibility for Camp Ashraf to the international committee of the Red Cross. The United States Federal Government will ban funding for Iranian groups that is aimed at changing the regime. The United States Federal Government should propose a regional peace conference on Iraq. The United States Federal Government should announce that it will withdraw from Iraq unless all relevant parties come to the table and agree to an enforceable peace settlement.<br />
