 <br />
Advantage One: Instability <br />
The war in Afghanistan is a disaster: The Taliban are projecting power while the US and Nato allies barely control any of the Southern part of the country. This has allowed for the planning of new attacks outside Afghanistan, caused Pakistan instability and negotiations with the so called moderate Taliban.  <br />
Investor’s Business Daily 10/08/2007 &lt; U.S. Commanders in Afghanistan . . . shelter in Southern Afghanistan.&gt; <br />
<br />
We isolate Three Scenarios: <br />
<br />
Scenario A: China  <br />
Negotiating with the Taliban will result in more extremism and look like a defeat for Karzai and Bush.  <br />
Riedel 08/29/07 &lt;President Karzai’s government . . . repressed its own peoples. &gt; <br />
<br />
The Reconstituted Taliban leadership will make China’s concern over an independent Uighur state pale in comparison to the coming Uighur Caliphate.  <br />
Lamullin July 2006 &lt;the SCO’s activities . . . stable at all costs.&gt; <br />
<br />
The CCP will perceive the resulting Uighur Caliphate as a major attack on the internal stability of the state causing leadership to suppress and further exacerbate tensions. <br />
Cookman 2004 &lt;the threat against the Uyghurs . . . further exacerbate the situation.&gt; <br />
<br />
The Impact is extinction <br />
Renxing 2005 &lt;In a show of strength to save… the world will be finished.&gt; <br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario B: Terrorism  <br />
A failure to stop terrorism in Afghanistan will lead to another attack in the US, this time with WMD <br />
Riedel 2007 &lt; it is now fashionable. . . the U.S. homeland again.&gt;  <br />
<br />
A terrorist attack in the United States with a nuclear weapon will trigger a full scale nuclear war <br />
Speice 2006 &lt;a terrorist attack . . . full-scale nuclear conflict.&gt; <br />
<br />
Scenario C: India/Pakistan <br />
The overthrow of Musharraf results in a nuclear war against India over Kashmir <br />
Brookes 2007 &lt;the fall of Musharraf’s government . . . including the United States.&gt; <br />
<br />
A war between India and Pakistan will escalate into a global conflict <br />
Gutman 2002 &lt;Although the American government . . . and the necessity of dialogue.&gt; <br />
<br />
Adavantage Two: Red Dawn  <br />
The US is competing with Russia and China for energy resources in central Asia. Stabilizing Afghanistan is a pre-requisite to getting TAP built which is necessary to break Russia’s stranglehold over natural gas in the region. <br />
Blank 2006 &lt;the release of new estimates. . . Afghanistan into Central Asia.&gt; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And a lack of a credible commitment for the US and skittish NATO forces to counter increasing levels of insurgent violence have forced Karzai into the arms of Russia. <br />
Shlapenktoh 2007 &lt; Background: The major reason for Karzai . . .Middle East and Surrounding areas.&gt; <br />
<br />
This will prevent cooperation over the region <br />
Shlapenktoh 2007 &lt;Conclusions: the impending American withdrawal . . . mutual rapprochement indicates.&gt; <br />
<br />
Furthermore, energy revenues allow Russia to accelerate its expansionist, global power pursuit by employing divide and conquer tactics in the EU. <br />
Bugjaski 2007 &lt;In his landmark speech. . . a European hub for Caspian gas.&gt; <br />
<br />
Russia’s increasing influence over EU policy will undercut American Unipolarity, inviting conflict between the US and Russia. <br />
Bugjaski 2003/2004 &lt;Having invested enormous political . . . the United States will as well.&gt; <br />
<br />
War between the US and Russia goes nuclear resulting in extinction <br />
Dyer 2005 &lt; When I wrote the first edition of this book. . . “nuclear winter” that closes the account.&gt; <br />
<br />
Thus the plan: <br />
The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by offering to increase its troop commitment and foreign assistance to the US led mission in Afghanistan, specifically increasing the number of troops within the Provincial Reconstruction Teams and the overall number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams serving in Afghanistan. <br />
<br />
Solvency Contention: <br />
<br />
Increasing the number of troops within the PRT’s and the number of PRT’s is key to stabilize Afghanistan. <br />
Akin 2007 &lt;Also, we must keep in mind. . . when a PRT’s work is done.&gt; <br />
<br />
Increasing PRT’s is critical to solve the economic reasons for the Taliban’s appeal <br />
Curtis and Phillips 2007&lt;U.S. aid programs in Afghanistan . . . on battlefields or in poppy fields.&gt; <br />
<br />
Increasing the number of troops is key to effective counterinsurgency and a victory at the southern border <br />
Royle 2007 &lt;Gordon also acknowledged that point . . . That’s the way forward.”&gt; <br />
<br />
At most 20,000 troops are key to fight the insurgency <br />
Wadhams&amp;Korb 2007 &lt;Sunday, October 7, 2007, marks . . . equipment and airlift.&gt; <br />
<br />
A conclusive Routing of the Taliban is critical for the US to open up energy access in Central Asia and break Russian dominance over the region.  <br />
Blank 2007 &lt;Since September 11, 2001 . . .prospects for secure development.&gt; <br />
