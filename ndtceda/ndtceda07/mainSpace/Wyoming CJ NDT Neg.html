Off Case Args:<br />
T can’t be QPQ<br />
CE = series of concessions without QPQ<br />
Davies 2007 Constructive engage? Chester crocker &amp; American policy in south Africa, nambia &amp; Angola<br />
“although constructive engage was frequently criticized… met by any tangible negative alternative”<br />

Violation case = QPQ<br />
First, context – multiple uses of the term bear out the unconditional nature of the CE<br />
Forcese<br />
<br />
Second, predictable limits – conditional fiat incentivizes say no affs and bidirectionality, there are infinite conditions that can be speced<br />

<br />
CP: Israel strategy<br />
Text: The government of Israel should unambiguously declare an end to its policy of strategic nuclear ambiguity. It should clarify that its nuclear use posture will rely on both counter-target and counter-value attacks and not be limited to scenarios involving non-conventional weapons attacks. The Government of Israel should declare an end to diplomatic and military opposition to Iran’s nuclear program.<br />
<br />
“that solves the advantages – disclosing capabilities key to deterrence and stopping war<br />

“the rationale for Israeli nuclear disclosure does not lie… indicates that such declarations may not be far off.”<br />
