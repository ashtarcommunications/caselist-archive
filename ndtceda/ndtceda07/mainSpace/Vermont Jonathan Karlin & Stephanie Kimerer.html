 Contention One – Economic Conditionality –<br />
<br />
Initially note - following the Paris III donor conference the U.S. pledged a massive aid package to relieve Lebanese debts – this aid program, however, is contingent on economic reforms in Lebanon<br />
The Daily State ‘7 [“US says aid will flow as long as Lebanon implements reforms”; September 15; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidDS150907_dsart19" rel="nofollow">http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm /sidDS150907_dsart19</a><br />
<br />
And absent the conditions, the relief would have been enough - Lebanon only needed about 5.1 billion for reconstruction<br />
Pascual ‘6 [Carlos (Vice President @ Brookings Institution); “Restoring Confidence in Lebanon’s Future); Senate Foreign Relations Committee ; September 13; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.senate.gov/%7Eforeign/testimony/2006/PascualTestimony060913.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.senate.gov/~foreign /testimony/2006/PascualTestimon y060913.pdf</a> <em>nick]<br />
<br />
These aid conditionalities are always political – attempts to condition debt relief on developmental reform is part of a hidden agenda of control that creates a global apartheid and leads to human rights violations<br />
Mutasa ‘4 [Charles (Research and Policy Analyst at the African Forum and Network on Debt and Development); “Global Apartheid Continues to Haunt Global Democracy”; Global Policy Forum; September 9; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/develop/debt/2004/0909globalapartheid.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalpolicy.org /socecon/develop/debt/2004 /0909globalapartheid.htm</a><br />
<br />
And this global system of apartheid legitimizes a global economy of death – the development model by the IMF and World Bank in which economic systems are a mandate of debt relief is a form of slavery in which global divides culminate in politics of death<br />
Shiva ‘5 [Dr. Vandana, Alternative Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader in the International Forum on Globalization and one of India’s leading and groundbreaking Theoretical Physicists, 2005, Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace, pg 13-14 </em>nick]<br />
<br />
And these politics of death, individuals left abandoned to globalization and debt, cause a death-world where the conditions of life conferred upon them is the status of living dead – it’s the worst possible existence<br />
Mbembe ‘3 [Achille (senior researcher at the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of the Witwatersrand); “Necropolitics”; Public Culture 15.1]<br />
<br />
And this commitment to a global economic regime based on death culminates in extinction – absent a shift in form from life-annihilation and corporate globalization to life-preserving, genocide, ecocide, and violent wars result<br />
Shiva ‘5 [Dr. Vandana, Alternative Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader in the International Forum on Globalization and one of India’s leading and groundbreaking Theoretical Physicists, 2005, Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace, pg 111-113/120 <em>nick]<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two – Refugee Politics –<br />
<br />
Refugees in Lebanon are systematically marginalized and excluded – failure of the Lebanese government and international community to extend human rights has led to massive ghettoization of refugee camps characterized by a lack of infrastructure, overcrowding, unemployment, abject poverty, and decay – a whole population is cemented in limbo status, risking their survival<br />
Amnesty International ‘7 [“Exiled and suffering: Palestinian refugees in Lebanon”; October 17; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE180102007" rel="nofollow">http://web.amnesty.org/library /Index/ENGMDE180102007</a><br />
<br />
And this systematic exclusion of Palestinian refugees from citizenship is a form of war waged on an entire population’s ability to survive<br />
Christoff ‘4 [Stefan (member of the International Solidarity Movement); “Living War: Palestinian Refugees in Lebanon”; January 14; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=4837" rel="nofollow">http://www.zmag.org/content /showarticle.cfm?ItemID=4837</a><br />
<br />
And this is war by other means – conceptualizing it as day-to-day violence is critical to challenge global systems of exclusion - evaluate these impacts before their disadvantages – conceiving war solely as an event neglects the reasons by violence persists in the everyday – crisis based politics distract from on-going violence<br />
Cuomo ’96 [Chris; “War Is Not Just an Event: Reflections on the Significance of Everyday Violence”; Hypatia; 11.4<br />
<br />
Plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should condition the cancellation of all bilateral debt the government of Lebanon owes to the United States exclusively on the granting of refugees living in Lebanon citizenship.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Three – Solvency –<br />
<br />
Conditioning U.S. aid on human rights in Lebanon for refugees rather than economic interests causes a dramatic paradigm shift through a reversal of prioritization that is key to curbing U.S. violent foreign policy towards Lebanon<br />
AbuKhalil ’00 [As`ad (an associate professor of political science at California State University, Stanislaus, and a research fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of California, Berkeley); “Lebanon: Key Battleground for Middle East Policy”; Foreign Policy in Focus; Volume 5, Number 2; February; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.irc-online.org/fpif/briefs/vol5/v5n02leb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irc-online.org/fpif /briefs/vol5/v5n02leb.html</a>]<br />
<br />
And approaching debt relief from a rights-based approach by conditioning relief on human rights rather than narrow financial lines reverses the current paradigm that leads to human rights violations<br />
Mandel ‘6 [Stephen (Senior Researcher for the New Economics Foundation); “Debt Relief As if People Mattered: A Rights-Based Approach to Debt Sustainability; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jubileeresearch.org/news/debt_relief_final.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jubileeresearch.org /news/debt_relief_final.pdf</a><br />
<br />
<br />
And only placing human rights at the center of economic thought as a political response to globalization can prevent vicious cycles of violence – human rights are the key alternative to globalization<br />
Shiva ‘5 [Dr. Vandana, Alternative Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader in the International Forum on Globalization and one of India’s leading and groundbreaking Theoretical Physicists, 2005, Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace, pg 106-7 </em>nick]<br />
<br />
<br />
And the U.S. should condition aid on explicitly normative political goals – this politicization of conditionality in humanitarian terms reveals the current criteria that secretly conditions aid on development ideology – such a politicization is key to avoid the neutral framing that inadvertently gives way to ethnic cleansing<br />
Bellamy ‘2 [Alex J. (Professor at the University of Queensland); “What’s So Wrong with Human Rights?”; The International Journal of Human Rights, Vol.6, No.4; Winter<br />
<br />
<br />
None of their conditionality bad arguments apply – collapsing the gap between humanitarian aid and politics creates a radical break with the current ideological uses of conditionality for development – this radical shift of conditionality is empowering and undermines the colonial relationship their evidence describes<br />
Santiso ‘2 [Carlos (Paul H Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University); “Governance Conditionality and the Reform of Multilateral Development Finance: The Role of the Group of Eight”<br />
<br />
And the U.S. is key – it’s the single largest shareholder in the IMF and World Bank, holds primary influence, and empirically has used its sway when cancelling debt Iraq owed –<br />
AfricaAction.org ‘5 [Washington, D.C.-based organization that “works for political, economic, and social justice in Africa”, No date given, “Campaign to Cancel Africa's Debt”,<br />
<br />
And the plan causes a massive transformation in the global economic system –<br />
<br />
First, this particular instance of debt cancellation based on justice is a crucial lens in analyzing global financial relations that enable oppression. Our plan is a starting point towards radical transformation by activating the space for millions of people subjected to debt to have their voices heard<br />
Keet ’00 [Dot (Senior Researcher at the Centre for Southern African Studies in the School of Government, University of the Western Cape); “The international anti-debt campaign: a Southern activist view for activists in 'the North'...and 'the South'”; Development in Practice; Volume 10, Issue 3 &amp; 4<br />
<br />
Second, this universalization of a particular debt cancellation is critical - it functions as a point to challenge larger relations of power through a specific issue<br />
Zizek ’99 [Slavoj Zizek, professor of philosophy at the university of Ljubljana, The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology, 1999, pg. 204-205]<br />
<br />
Finally, this universalization restructures the entirety of social interaction<br />

 The AFF disclosure is correct.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At West Point they read a Hard and Negri version of their Lebanon Debt Cancellation AFF with a resist Empire advantage and an empowerment of the multitude advantage. They read citizenship eviedence as well as claiming that they break down the international debt system. The read evidence from the H and N 2000 Empire book and claim to cancel all Lebanese debt, including that which is held by the IMF and World Bank by claiming that because the US is such a big influence in these organizations and holds portions of the debt.<br />
<br />
Answers to the Venezuela/Bank of the South CP<br />
1. Doesn’t solve the AFF- BofS only has 7billion not the over 40 billion that would be needed to pay off the debt<br />
2. Chavez over fishing turns<br />
3. Vulcher loans turns<br />

Contention One – War Debt<br />
<br />
Following the 2006 Israeli war against Lebanon, the U.S. pledged billions of dollars for reconstruction at the Paris Club summit. Regretfully this foreign capital will only come in the form of loans that will inflate a huge debt which is already $41 billion – domination will only continue for the time being<br />
Committee for the A bolition of Third W orld Debt '7 [&quot;Lebanon: the Committee for the Abolition of Third World Debt (CADTM) opposes the false solutions proposed by the Paris Conference&quot;; February 5; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cadtm.org/article.php3?id_article=2430" rel="nofollow">http://www.cadtm.org/article .php3?id_article=2430</a><br />
<br />
And while the war with Israel is over, war wages on in Lebanon and across the globe – debt is war – it's an attempt to conquer resources, control politics, and destroy lives<br />
Scholl and Arrizabalaga '4 [Ann (Argentinean Social Anthropologist )and Facundo (Argentinean Lawyer ); &quot;The Human Face of Economics&quot;; February 27; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticlecfm?itemid=5048" rel="nofollow">www.zmag.org/content/showarticl ecfm?itemid=5048</a> ]<br />
Evaluate these impacts before their disadvantages – conceiving war solely as an event neglects the reasons by violence persists in the everyday – crisis based politics distract from on-going violence by hegemonic institutions – their scenarios are merely over-determined escalations of pre-existing procedures from debt<br />
Cuomo '96 [Chris; &quot;War Is Not Just an Event: Reflections on the Significance of Everyday Violence&quot;; Hypatia; 11.4]<br />
The impact is the extermination of humanity – more suffering takes place now in this war of debt than has ever taken place in the history of humanity – it's the root behind violence, inequality, exclusion, famine and oppression –<br />
Derrida '94 [Jacques (Director of Studies at the Ecole Des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales); Specters of Marx; p. 84-86]<br />
Contention Two – Neoliberal Assistance<br />
<br />
The Bush administration is keen on cancellation for Iraq – it recently cancelled all of Iraq's debt and encouraged others to do the same in order to rebuild the countries infrastructure<br />
Labott '4 [Elise (CNN Correspondent); &quot;U.S. cancels Iraq's $4.1 billion debt&quot;; CNN Online; December 17; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/12/17/iraq.main/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD /meast/12/17/iraq.main/ </a><br />
Yet debt cancellation for Iraq is largely a political to move to secure oil contracts – it's a mere example of neoliberal efficiency and contradictions whereby political elites secure selective debt cancellation with gain in mind rather than justice.<br />
Dixon '4 [Robyn (Staff Writer); &quot;Cancel Iraqi Debt? What About Africa?&quot;; LA Times; January 26; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://why-war.com/news/2004/01/26/cancelir.html" rel="nofollow">http://why-war.com/news/2004 /01/26/cancelir.html </a><br />
This contradiction is obvious in the context of Lebanon - debt cancellation isn't even on the table – top governmental officials agree<br />
UPI '5 [&quot;Lebanon doesn't expect waiver of debts&quot;; September 16; l/n<br />
<em>And without cancellation of Lebanese debt, new waves of borrowing will just reinforce neoliberal politics, favoring the wealthy and foreign corporations – dooming the people of Lebanon<br />
<strong>Toussaint and Millet '6</strong> [Éric and Damien (CADTM); &quot;Lebanon en route to an illegitimate debt&quot;; August 29; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cadtm.org/article.php3?id_article=2016&amp;var_recherche=Lebanon" rel="nofollow">http://www.cadtm.org/article .php3?id_article=2016&amp;var _recherche=Lebanon </a>]<br />
<br />
And debt is the chief mechanism maintaining global neoliberalism by binding countries like Lebanon to Northern creditors through virtual forced borrowing based on colonial history and international economic conditions<br />

Neoliberal politics make extinction inevitable – sacrificial genocide arises out of the market outcomes of development politics – this annihilation of the periphery under the illusion of saving it has been behind all genocides and enables collective suicide<br />
<strong>Santos '3</strong> [Boaventura de Sousa (Director of the Center for Social Studies at the University of Coimbra); &quot;Collective Suicide?&quot;; March; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ces.fe.uc.pt/opiniao/bss/072en.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ces.fe.uc.pt /opiniao/bss/072en.php</a></em><br />
<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
The United States Federal Government, through the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Lebanon by offering Lebanon foreign assistance in the form of unconditional cancellation of all debt owed by Lebanon.<br />
Contention 3 – A New Politics<br />
<br />
Debt cancellation is critical to prevent future Lebanese suffering – US cancellation and funding to pay off loans is critical to preserve justice<br />
<strong>Toussaint and Millet '6</strong> [Éric and Damien (CADTM); &quot;Lebanon en route to an illegitimate debt&quot;; August 29; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cadtm.org/article.php3?id_article=2016&amp;var_recherche=Lebanon" rel="nofollow">http://www.cadtm.org/article .php3?id_article=2016&amp;var _recherche=Lebanon </a>//<br />
<br />
U.S. can cancel debt through the IMF and World Bank – it's the single largest shareholder, holds primary influence, and empirically has used its sway when cancelling debt Iraq owed – action is key to end poverty<br />

<br />
<br />
Debt cancellation for a Middle Eastern nation signals a broad challenge to the global role of the IMF and World Bank – it would create movement to break the bondage of debt over all impoverished nations<br />
Naiman '99 [Robert; &quot;No Jubilee for the Middle East?&quot; in Millennial Middle East: Changing Orders, Shifting Borders; Middle East Report 213; Winter; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.merip.org/mer/mer213/213_naiman.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.merip.org/mer /mer213/213_naiman.html</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
U.S. leadership on debt relief is key – it's the premier player capable of cancelling IMF and World Bank debts and its critical to mobilize a serious anti-debt movement internationally – absent U.S. action the whole movement fails<br />

<br />
<br />
Inserting demands for debt cancellation into debates is crucial to providing a lens to analyze global financial relations that enable oppression. Our plan is a starting point towards radical transformation by activating the space for millions of people subjected to debt to have their voices heard<br />
