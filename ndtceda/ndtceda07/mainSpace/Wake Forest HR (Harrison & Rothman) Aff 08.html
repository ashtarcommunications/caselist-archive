Syria Refugees Aff<br />
<br />
Advantage 1- Iraqi Refugees.<br />
<br />
<br />
Syria is increasing restrictions on Iraqi refugees- they are moving to seal off the border.<br />
Reuters 10-1-07 Syria shuts border to Iraqi refugees- UNHCR<br />
“Syria reimposed rules… Iraqi official told Reuters.”<br />
<br />
<br />
And, Lack of US support is the reason why Syria is cracking down on refugees now. <br />
Frelick, bill september 20th 2007 (Human Rights Watch, Refugee Policy Director <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/09/25/iraq16948.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/09/25/iraq16948.htm</a>) <br />
“Our immediate concern… allowing refugees in. “<br />
<br />
And, current international funding for Iraqi refugees is insufficient.<br />
<br />
Amnesty International July 2007 (The Situation of Iraq Refugees in Syria, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE140362007" rel="nofollow">http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE140362007</a>) <br />
“An international conference … in bilateral agreements.”<br />
<br />
<br />
And, US financial assistance is key to ensure that Syrian programs can manage the refugee situation.  <br />
Limon 07 (Lavinia, President of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Director of the Center for the New American Community, Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, “The Silent Surge”, www.refugees.org/uploadedFiles/Investigate/Publications_&amp;_Archives/WRS_Archives/2007/SilentSurge.pdf)<br />
“3. The United States must ensure … hosting these refugees.”<br />
<br />
<br />
And, failing to help the Iraqi refugees makes regional instability inevitable.<br />
Radio Free Europe 07 (Iraq: Refugee Crisis Could Become Regional Security Threat, July 19, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/07/125F9BB7-46A1-4C2C-904A-F250A09C3393.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/07/125F9BB7-46A1-4C2C-904A-F250A09C3393.html</a>)<br />
“While Iraq's neighbors struggle … of terrorists,&quot; he warned.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Middle East instability causes global crises and nuclear war.<br />

“Meanwhile, the existence … world conflagration.” (44)”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 2- US Refugee leadership-<br />
<br />
Lack of support for Iraqi refugees threatens US refugee leadership- new commitments from the US are key.<br />
Taft 07 (Julia, director of the Interagency Task Force for Indochinese Refugee Resettlement in the Ford administration and assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration from 1997 to 2001, June 27, 2007, “Ignoring the Iraqi refugee crisis,” The Star-Ledger Newark, New Jersey, lexis)<br />
“I found myself thinking … the right thing to do.”<br />
<br />
<br />
And, helping Iraqi refugees is uniquely key- it’s a problem we started, so our inaction looks particularly bad.<br />
Limon 07 (Lavinia, President of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Director of the Center for the New American Community, Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, “The Silent Surge”, www.refugees.org/uploadedFiles/Investigate/Publications_&amp;_Archives/WRS_Archives/2007/SilentSurge.pdf)<br />
“The United States must     … blocks of a stable society.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Increasing funding for refugee protections boosts US refugee leadership.<br />
Carlin 00 (Francis, Deputy Executive Director of Catholic Relief Services, Federal News Service, 3/30, lexis)<br />
“The U.S. Catholic bishops … refugee protection worldwide.”<br />
<br />
<br />
US refugee leadership is key to solve global refugee flows. <br />

“Notwithstanding our nation's historic … asylum seekers around the world.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Refugee crises erupt into violent ethnic conflict. <br />
Nana-Sinkam 00 (Professor Samuel C., Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations in Guinea Bissau, October 20, The Sources of Conflict, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.clubofrome.org/archive/publications/nana%20sources%20of%20" rel="nofollow">http://www.clubofrome.org/archive/publications/nana%20sources%20of%20</a> conflict%2011.12.00.pdf)<br />
“The African state system … . armed hostilities have erupted.”<br />
<br />
<br />
And, ethnic conflict is rapidly spreading. <br />
Conversi 05  (Daniele, Senior Lecturer  European Policy Research Centre  Department of Policy Studies at the University of Lincoln, &quot;Workshop4 Detention: Suspect Communities: The Real 'War on Terror' in Europe - Conference 21 May 2005&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.muslimparliament.org.uk/Workshop6.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.muslimparliament.org.uk/Workshop6.pdf</a> )<br />
“The literature on ethnic conflict … necessary legitimacy quorum.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Ethnic conflicts could go nuclear.<br />
Dean 95 (Jonathon, advisor on International Security Issues for the Union of Concerned Scientists, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, No. 2, Vol. 51, p. 45, March, lexis)<br />
“Experts throughout the world …. to direct attack.“<br />
<br />
<br />
And, Boosting refugee leadership increases the overall credibility of our soft power. <br />
DiMarzio 99 (Nicholas, Bishop of Camden, Bishop's Testimony Before Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Immigration, Aug 4, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usccb.org/comm/archives/1999/99-185a.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/comm/archives/1999/99-185a.shtml</a>)<br />
“I am pleased, therefore… U.S. foreign policy interests. “<br />
<br />
<br />
Soft power is key to solve disease.<br />

HIV is a pandemic … use of weapons of mass destruction.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 3- Assad credibility<br />
<br />
Assad’s credibility is collapsing now- lack of cooperation with the United States over internal stability issues like refugees makes the regime a ticking time bomb.<br />
Byman 10-9-07 (Daniel, Senior Fellow, Foreign Policy Studies, Saban Center for Middle East Policy, What is Syrian President Bashar Assad up to?, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2007/1009syria.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2007/1009syria.aspx</a>)<br />
“Ironically, Assad is rolling … regime to the detriment of both.<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan boosts Assad’s credibility with everyone- local ethnic groups, regional players, and the United States. <br />
Oxford Analytica 07 (International Iraqi Refugees Place Huge Burden On Syria Oxford Analytica 05.11.07)<br />
“The number of Iraqi refugees … the refugee card strongly.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Collapse of Assad credibility causes civil war, radical backlash, and Hezbollah strikes.<br />
Colonel Robert W. Meeks, U.S. Army, March 15, 2006 (Syria: Reassessing U.S. Approach and Option, USAWC Strategy Research Project, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil425.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil425.pdf</a>)<br />
Similar to Iraq, a sudden power … affected by instability in Syria.<br />
<br />
<br />
Continued Hezbollah attacks cause nuclear war and extinction.<br />
Joel Leyden, Israel News Agency, August 5, 2006 (Hezbollah Iran Missiles Slam Hadera Israel - Nuclear War Approaching?, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.israelnewsagency.com/haderaisraeliranrocketsnuclearwar4848070805.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.israelnewsagency.com/haderaisraeliranrocketsnuclearwar4848070805.html</a>)<br />
“Tel Aviv----August 5......The only good thing about the terror group …. vaporize those who threaten our children.”<br />
<br />
<br />
And, Iraqi refugees are the vital internal link for Syrian stability.<br />
Yacoubian 07 (Mona, director of the Institute's Syria Working Group, Syria's Relations with Iraq, April, US Institute of Peace, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usip.org/pubs/usipeace_briefings/2007/0403_syria_iraq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usip.org/pubs/usipeace_briefings/2007/0403_syria_iraq.html</a>)<br />
Although the insurgent issue has ..  breaking point and lead to public unrest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the plan, <br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer to Syria a substantial increase in financial assistance for dealing with the Iraqi refugee crisis if Syria agrees to cooperation, including but not limited to, an agreement to ease restrictions on the entrance of Iraqi refugees into Syria. <br />
<br />
<br />
Next, Solvency…<br />
<br />
<br />
The US should increase aid to Syria for Iraqi refugees and engage Syria over closing its border.<br />
Frelick, bill september 20th 2007 (Human Rights Watch, Refugee Policy Director <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/09/25/iraq16948.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/09/25/iraq16948.htm</a>)<br />
We would like to recommend several steps  …. welcome the refugees.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Syria will say yes to diplomacy and financial assistance to cooperate over refugees. <br />
<br />
Yacoubian 07 (Mona, director of the Institute's Syria Working Group, Syria's Relations with Iraq, April, US Institute of Peace, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usip.org/pubs/usipeace_briefings/2007/0403_syria_iraq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usip.org/pubs/usipeace_briefings/2007/0403_syria_iraq.html</a>)<br />
Syria will likely continue … Damascus takes hold in Iraq.<br />
<br />
<br />
The US is key.<br />
Loescher and Loescher 94  (Gil and Ann, Senior fellow for Forced Displacement and International Security for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, The Global Refugee Crisis, p. 24-6)<br />
