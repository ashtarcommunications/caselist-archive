 <strong><u>Observation 1: Mounting Death Tolls</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world; new landmines planted by the Taliban have claimed nearly a thousand lives since January</strong><br />
<strong>Moahid 9/7/2007</strong> (Ahmad Khalid, reporter for Pajhwok Afghan News, “AFGHANISTAN: Taliban Mines Take Toll on Civilian, Coalition Lives”)<br />
<u>New landmines planted since the Taliban returned…</u> by rival mujahiddin factions in the 1990s.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Afghanistan remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world with thousands dying annually</strong><br />
<strong>US Foreign Policy Agenda 2004</strong> (January, “Afghanistan: A Model  for Humanitarian Mine Action”)<br />
<u>Afghanistan remains one of the most heavily… <strong>landmines are estimated at 150 per month.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>And, Landmines kill 12 people a day in Afghanistan</strong><br />
<strong>Afghan Network 2006</strong> (“Afghanistan: Landmine Fact Sheet” Oct 12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/)</a><br />
Afghanistan has suffered greatly from war… of landmine victims die due to lack of medical facilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The problem will only get worse—landmines promise continued instability the persistent risk of death for civilians. Landmine clearance is the most pressing priority</strong><br />
<strong>Tayler, Newsday Reporter, 2002</strong> (Letta, January, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.banminesusa.org/news/983_afghan/983_1_16_02d.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.banminesusa.org/news/983_afghan/983_1_16_02d.html)</a><br />
<br />
The strange toy Rahmatullah's brother…. programs back in full swing by mid-January.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Observation Two: Beyond Death Tolls</u></strong><br />
<strong>Thinking of landmine casualties in purely statistical terms is misleading: the mere threat of landmines makes daily life an exercise in paralyzing fear. It renders land, roads, and public buildings useless.</strong><br />
<strong>Njeri, PHD University of Bradford, 2003</strong> (Sarah, “The Impact of Explosive Remnants of War (ERW): Especially Landmines on Post-Conflict Reconstruction” google it)<br />
<u>The actual number of mines in the ground… <strong>And yet what a wealth of misery it can cover.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Our affirmative is a conduit to finally confront the reality of the landmine and clusterbomb crisis in Afghanistan and particularly our own complicity in perpetuating it. Coming to terms with the devastating effects on people’s daily lives can challenge brutal colonialism and indiscriminate killing that will spiral into extinction.</strong><br />
<strong>Jensen, Professor of Journalism at University of Texas, 2002</strong> (March 21, Robert, “The Future of Empathy,” google it)<br />
I<u>n most situations, people tend to seek pleasure… we will choose to know, to feel, and to act.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Plan:</u></strong><br />
<strong>The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan by offering a substantial increase in foreign assistance in the form of AN/PSS 14 Handheld Standoff Mine Detection Systems.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Observation 3: Solvency</u></strong><br />
<strong>The United States Army has the best and most highly tested GPR mine detectors</strong><br />
<strong>United States Department of Defense 2007</strong> (Humanitariandemining.org, Humanitarian Demining R &amp; D Program)<br />
<u>The U.S. Army’s HSTAMIDS</u> AN/PSS-<u>14 is a… changing the future of humanitarian demining.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>In field tests in Afghanistan, US technology increased productivity by 645%</strong><br />
<strong>Doheny 2006</strong> (Robert, Deputy of US Humantiarian Mine Action Program, August 29)<br />
<u>HSTAMIDS performed equally well in Afghanistan… which projects <strong>to a 645% increase in productivity</strong></u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Only the US army has the HSTAMIDS system; it has not been permanently shared with civilian deminers who do the brunt of the work in Afghanistan</strong><br />
<strong>Skillings, Staff Writer for CNET, 2006</strong> (Jonathan, “High Tech’s Slow march in Landmine Campaign,” google it)<br />
One tool that is helping to distinguish mines… metal for each mine he clears,&quot; the U.N.'s Mulliner said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>And no other country has a chance of getting HSTAMIDS: its classified</strong><br />
<strong>Smith, Mine-Action Specialist, 2004</strong> (Andy, “Comment: HSTAMIDS,” google it)<br />
<u>HSTAMIDS is a combined metal-detector… <strong>technology</strong> designed primarily for military use.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The US has pledged lots of money for demining for fiscal year 2008</strong><br />
<strong>FCNL 2007</strong> (6/25, “Humanitarian Demining Budget memo for FY 2008&lt; google it)<br />
The United States leads the world in… 2008 of $66.5 million is just under that pledge.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>US engagement with Afghanistan high and inevitable, even in non-military aspects</strong><br />
<strong>Barnicle 2004</strong> (Jeremy, program officer at the Century Foundation, specialist in international affairs, The Century Foundation, 11/22/2004 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tcf.org/list.asp?type=NC&amp;pubid=1368%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.tcf.org/list.asp?type=NC&amp;pubid=1368)</a><br />
<u>U.S. engagement will remain high. The…</u> fanning criticism that Karzai is their puppet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>And don’t be seduced by the negative’s shock and awe impacts: predictive scenario planning is a crapshoot and almost always wrong. Default to our specific and empirically observable impacts</strong><br />
Louis <strong>Menand 2005</strong> (The New Yorker, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newyorker.com/printables/critics/051205crbo_books1%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.newyorker.com/printables/critics/051205crbo_books1)</a><br />
It is the somewhat gratifying lesson of Philip Tetlock’s… <strong><u>They were seduced by the detail.</u></strong><br />
