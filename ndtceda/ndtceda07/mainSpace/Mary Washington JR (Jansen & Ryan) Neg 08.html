Thus, at the outset, the United States<br />
different targets and using different policy instruments.<br />
B. Violation: the plan is not unconditional engagement- conditioned<br />
C. Reasons to vote negative-<br />
1. Limits-<br />
2. Stable neg ground-<br />
the terms of the deal in the plan aren’t topical under any part of the resolution- their interpretation allows an infinite number of quid pro quos that would infinitely multiply affirmative mechanism ground<br />
conditional engagement lets the aff spike out of engagement disads like appeasement<br />
or relations<br />
this destroys stable neg ground<br />
3. Moots constructive- their interpretation moots the word constructive- it avoids the core question of the resolution- this would allow the aff to do everything but shun or attack the recipient which destroys neg counterplan ground<br />

CONSULT INDIA<br />
Text: The United States federal government should enter into prior binding consultation with the government of India over whether “the United States Federal Government should increase constructive engagement with the government of Lebanon. The negotiations will include an offer for a substantial increase in economic assistance for reconstruction and security assistance for the maintenance of the Lebanese Army. In exchange, the government of Lebanon must commit to equitable distribution of reconstruction aid throughout the country and meaningful inclusion of Shi’ia and Palestinian communities in the political process.” The United States federal government should abide by the results of the consultation and support its proposal during consultation.<br />
Observation 1 – Counterplan is theoretically legitimate.<br />
It’s not topical – it test the world “resolved,” which means “to make a firm decision about,” and the word “should,” which “expresses obligation or duty.” Counterplans that test the resolution are key to predictable negative ground.<br />
Consultation counterplans are legitimate – conditioning the plan is reciprocal on this resolution – and the education and policy anlaysis skills provided by consultation are essential on a foreign policy topic. Structural advantages to being affirmative further minimize any abuse claims.<br />
Observation 2- Net benefits.<br />
Consultation is key to cooperation – process is key.<br />
Schaffer, 2002 (Building a new partnership with India, the Washington Quarterly, Spring)<br />
In some ways, the key … expanding agenda.<br />
Strong US-Indian relations key to solve nuclear war.<br />

<strong>Demonization of</strong> <strong>Iran</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>US</strong> <strong>politics guarantees huge backlash against the plan- no matter how politically feasible engaging</strong> <strong>Iran</strong> <strong>sounds on paper it will still be labeled as appeasing Islamo-fascism</strong><br />

<strong>The counterplan solves-</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Financial pressure and travel bans isolate</strong> <strong>Iran</strong> <strong>and manipulate economic vulnerabilities- produces policy change without usurping European and Japanese leadership or triggering backlash- recent history proves</strong><br />

In this sense, the <u>consequences</u><br />
<strong><u>politically easier for the Europeans.</u></strong><br />

<strong>Financial pressure is crucial to change- all we need is to press for the enforcement of already existing rules</strong><br />

<strong>B. Violation: the plan is not unconditional engagement-</strong><br />
<strong>C. Reasons to vote negative-</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1. Limits-</strong><br />
<strong>2. Stable neg ground-</strong><br />
<strong>the terms of the deal in the plan aren’t topical under any part of the resolution- their interpretation allows an infinite number of quid pro quos that would infinitely multiply affirmative mechanism ground</strong><br />
<strong>conditional engagement lets the aff spike out of engagement disads like appeasement</strong><br />
<strong>or relations</strong><br />
<strong>this destroys stable neg ground</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>3. Moots constructive- their interpretation moots the word constructive- it avoids the core question of the resolution- this would allow the aff to do everything but shun or attack the recipient which destroys neg counterplan ground</strong><br />

<strong>A: Interpretation- constructive engagement in the</strong> <strong>Middle East</strong> <strong>requires a quid-pro-quo</strong><br />
<strong><u>Gambill, Middle East Intelligence Bulletin editor</u></strong>, April <strong><u>03</u></strong><br />

<br />
Until last month, the parameters<br />
and historical reasons.<br />
<br />
<strong>B. Violation- the plan isn’t a quid pro quo- the engagement isn’t conditioned on a change in the targeted state’s behavior</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>C. Reasons to vote neg-</strong><br />
<strong>1. Stable ground- foreign assistance allows the aff to fund or assist any program in the Middle East- its too broad for the negative to ever be prepared without common ground- requiring a quid pro quo ensures the neg has disad links, case arguments, and kritiks based on attaching strings.</strong><br />
<strong>2. Education</strong>- <strong>debating quid pro quos allows plans with more nuance</strong> <strong>than just increasing US contact or interaction- it better reflects the proposals in the literature like a grand bargain with Iran or offers to Syria regarding Israel and the Golan</strong><br />
<strong>3. Their interpretation moots security guarantees- there’s no advocates for unconditional security guarantees- especially with nations that we have no relations with like</strong> <strong>Iran</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Syria.</strong><br />

Syria won’t engage—laundry list of reasons, totalitarianism, sense of victory and invulnerability, they’ll lie and cheat in negotiations, they profit from instability, and will milk the process for time and more bribes<br />
