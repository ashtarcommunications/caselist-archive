Rejection of racism is a precondition fo human and moral order which outweighs utility – injustice causes violence<br />

“However, it remains true that…engenders violence and death.<br />

New Advantage – the Forgotten War<br />
The administration declines to take action on opium in Afghanistan because of a deliberate project of forgetting. The critical political strategy is one of dismissal of the conflict and opium.<br />

Solvency plus:<br />
Our act of remembering the traumatic failer of power is the first necessary step to political action. The ontological function of sovereign time operates at a proper level to the political critique. Memory is the access point to the debate.<br />

Encircling the traumatic failer of the state forces a reformulation of community<br />

“What survivors seek is…a reformulation of community.”<br />
<br />
Politics are evacuated of antagonisms through acts of intentional forgetting – analysis and critique aimed at the temporal assumptions of the status quo are criitical. To use the parlance of our times the uniqueness flows affirmative.<br />

Do nothing is bad personal politics. It hurts movement organization and mobilization, which is the best personal politics because it has a place to interpersonal interact.<br />

“A rejection of the state…dictated by globalization.”<br />
<br />
Wishing the state away fails because it only gets swalled back into the western-cented globalization. Working within the system is the only way to link ethical and human order based on restructuring the state from the inside<br />

Market fill in destroys the environment. Only the state can solve environmental destruction.<br />

Aid conditionality is both inevitable and good. The question is not if there will be conditions attached to aid but what those conditions will be. Calling out when Western neutrality of feigned unconditionality feeds systems of oppression is an important political move.<br />

 The United States federal government should increase its engagement with the government of Afghanistan by offering to support licensing of poppy production in Afghanistan, providing necessary assistance for the creation of a domestic opiate production industry in Afghanistan, if the government of Afghanistan agrees to implement a national scheme of regulation of licit opium production, sales, and distribution.<br />

 Inherency<br />
in August, bush announced a new counter-narcotics policy in Afghanistan which includes the military-led eradication of the vast poppy fields of southern Afghanistan that provide 95% of the world’s heroin<br />
Baltimore Sun 8/10/07 “troops to join opium battle”<br />
“American combat troops…. Afghanistan”<br />
the policy of eradication fails and alienates the population from karzai boosting support for the taliban<br />
Kendall and MacDonald 07 “winning with opium in Afghanistan” japan times<br />
“despite considerable effort… their lives”<br />
Advantage 1 ethics<br />
54% of governments have experienced an opium-based medicines shortage and the global demographic shifts are exacerbating shortages.<br />
Fisher, Rehm and Culbert 05 “feasibility study on opium licensing in Afghanistan for the production of morphine and other essential medicines: opium-based medicines: a mapping of global supply, deman and the pharmaceutical industry” Senlis Council<br />
“the use of opium… over 3.9 tons”<br />
shortage is worse in developing countries<br />

“however, a division.. 2003”<br />
lack of health care is structural violence against the poor<br />
Farmer 03, “pathologies of power: health, human rights,, and the new war on the poor” questia<br />
“’but what… structural violence”<br />
must break the silence<br />
Farmer 03, “pathologies of power: health, human rights,, and the new war on the poor” questia<br />
“today, the.. to show”<br />
criticism of health structures by academics fails<br />
Farmer 03, “pathologies of power: health, human rights,, and the new war on the poor” questia<br />
“exposing such… spots, too”<br />
notion of care is key to ethical action<br />
reich 01, the American journal of bioethics 1.1, 2001,<br />
“the nazi… this sense”<br />
<br />
war on drugs in Afghanistan is racist<br />
verhoff 07, kirwan institute<br />
“the consistent… activities”<br />
reject racism<br />
memmi<br />
advantage 2 pain<br />
millions are in pain because of unfair distribution of meds<br />
spivack 05, senlis council<br />
“in parallel… .deep crisis”<br />
its worse in low income countries<br />
New york times 07, “drugs banned, world’s poor suffer in pain”<br />
“although the… no money”’<br />
systemic pain is worse than death<br />
hogshire 01, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://drugwar.com/" rel="nofollow">drugwar.com</a><br />
“todays visitors…inflict it”<br />
SOLVENCY:<br />
Opium licensing guarantees economic development by providing incentives for Afghan farmers to switch from illegal drug production to manufacture of opiate painkillers like morphine<br />
Senlis Council 07 (“poppy for medicine” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.senliscouncil.net/documents/poppy_medicine_technical_dossier" rel="nofollow">www.senliscouncil.net/documents /poppy_medicine_technical _dossier</a>)<br />
The local production of finished poppy-based medicines…benefit the Afghan government….Poppy for Medicine projects<br />
<br />
<br />
And, we don’t need to win full solvency – even if we stop half the drug trade, we’ll still provide stability<br />
Applebaum 07 (Anne, “legalize it: how to solve Afghanistan’s drug problem” Jan 16, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://slate.com/" rel="nofollow">slate.com</a>)<br />
Why not add Afghanistan to this list…expand poppy eradication further<br />
<br />
<br />
A shortage of painkillers in developing countries ensures a market for Afghan morphine, which can be sold in the short term to provide security and economic development of Afghanistan<br />
Van Ham and Kamminga<br />
Afghanistan should explore other ways to decrease its illicit opium economy…it would be possible to set upa medicine-producing industry in the short term…developing world<br />
<br />
<br />
Afghanistan will say yes – they already have legal mechanisms in place, but need political backing<br />
Van Ham and Kamminga<br />
Afghanistan should be fully responsible for and in control of such a new system…terrorist groups to operate<br />
