They read the same thing from the Wiki:<br />
We do a performance in the 1AC. We start out reading from Barnett Rubin about the current political situation in Afghanistan (cite below), Barnett then says that the reason he knows these things is that he was kidnapped by Taliban soldiers and turned in to their sex slave. We make arguments about queer theory and performance, and say that aesthetic practices are extremely salient in the context of our engagement with the Middle East and the War on Terror. The impact of our argument is heteronormativity. We say that the way that we should confront heteronormativity is through a pedagogy of interruption.<br />
<br />
While we do not explicitly name authors or read cards here are some cites that we use for arguments in our affirmative:<br />
