Round 8<br />
<strong>Team Name Aff USC LS</strong><br />
<strong><em>Round # 8</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>vs Team: Georgetown HK</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Judge: Hall, Kirk, Topp</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>Plan Text</em></strong><br />
The United States federal government should offer to the Palestinian Authority that it will no longer support regime change activities against the Palestinian Legislative Council and that it will support a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel in exchange for a political reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas.<br />
<strong><em>1ac w/ cites</em></strong><br />
<u>Contention 1: Gaza</u><br />
Currently the Egyptian mediated truce between Hamas and Israel is holding-but it could break down at any time. <br />
Al-naami 3/19/08 (Saleh, Al-Ahram Weekly. “An informed Palestinian source…in Israel’s court.”)<br />
Current Israeli Policy is leading toward Gaza reoccupation. <br />
INSS Policy Brief 3/12/08 (“The Real Choice: Ceasefire or Reoccupation of Gaza.” “For now, Israel…acceptable to both sides.”)<br />
And—a new phase of the conflict is underway—Israel’s defense minister has openly promised a holocaust upon the people of Gaza. <br />
Barghouti 3/2/08 (Omar, The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel. “On Friday, 29 February…reaching its logical conclusion.”)<br />
2 Scenarios for escalation<br />
1st- Rocket attacks<br />
Susser 3/31 (Leslie, The Jerusalem Report p10. “Israel is determined to prevent…Olmert announced darkly.”)<br />
Impact is full scale war<br />
Derfner 3/17/08 (Larry, U.S. News &amp; World Report. “But under Hamas’s leadership…Israeli cabinet ministers.”)<br />
We don’t need to win that the invasion happens, Israeli skirmishes will escalate into a full many-fronted war involving Lebanon, Syria and Iran<br />
Economist 3/15/08 (“Bracing for the big one,” Lexis. “Despite a short…Israel out in 2000.”)<br />
2nd – Lebanon<br />
All the conditions exist for escalation—Lebanon, Syria, presence of US warships. The US will invade Lebanon to protect Israel in the event of Israel’s reoccupation of Gaza – impact is a Lebanese civil war. <br />
Amiri 3/2/08 (Rannie, “U.S. Warships Steam Toward Lebanon.” “As the political deadlock…precipitation of civil war.”)<br />
Independently, a civil war in Lebanon obliterates the possibility for the US to sustain partnerships with moderate Iraqi Shiites, ensuring Kurdish secessionism &amp; massive escalation.<br />
Menon ’06 (Rajan, 8/9. LA Times. “As Israel and Hezbollah…tent and go home.”)<br />
A broader regional war starting in Iraq will quickly escalate to WWIII. <br />
Corsi ’07 (Jerome R, “War with Iran is imminent.” “If a broader…and II began.”)<br />
<u>Contention 2- Egypt</u><br />
First—Egyptian opposition to Mubarak is reaching a boiling point—further Israeli skirmishes in the Gaza will force massive Mubarak resistance.<br />
Morrow 3/6/08 (Adam, IPS. “In a subsequent press…will soon begin.”)<br />
Two Impacts<br />
First—Mubarak crackdown à civil unrest and violent extremist<br />
Hamzawy and Bishara ’07 (Amr and Dina, “Burying Democracy Further in Egypt.” The Daily Star 3/16. “The Mubarak regime…of domestic unrest.”)<br />
Second—independently, Egypt-Israeli relations will be decimated<br />
Hanna 2/1/08 (Michael, “Egypt’s Gazan Predicament.” “With the Egyptian… counteracting future breaches.”)<br />
Second—even a potential leadership crisis in Egypt will result in war with Israel<br />
Azarva ’07 (Jeffrey, “From cold peace to cold war?” Middle East Review of International Affairs, March. “That the corridor…just become a cold war.”)<br />
<u>Solvency</u><br />
First—all parties will say yes – they know a ceasefire is a prerequisite to any negotiations, and incremental approaches wont be enough—only a package deal with set trade-offs guarantees a resolution to the conflict<br />
Baskin 3/10/08 (Gershon, J Post, “Encountering Peace; the moral majority for peace.” “Israeli leaders have been…to total bankruptcy.”)<br />
Second—ceasefire sets the stage for future negotiations—it would mark a historic breakthrough, turning your Olmert DA (!!!)<br />
Khouri 3/14 (Rami, BBC Monitoring Middle East. “The Importance of a negotiated…between Palestinians and Israelis.”)<br />
And our aff saves Abbas and Annapolis negotiations.<br />
Levy 3/5/08 (Daniel, “Rice, Gaza and Annapolis: what’s next?” “The lack of movement…then this can be avoided.”)<br />
Israel says yes – it knows a ceasefire is preferable to a full-scale invasion—the only question is whether reconciliation is part of the condition and if Fatah can be included in future negotiations.<br />
Kimche 3/6/08 (David, “How to Engage Hamas,” IPF Focus Vol 6.10. “We, in Israel…a deal with Hamas.”)<br />
US diplomacy is critical to Hamas and Israel<br />
Khouri 3/14/08 (Rami G, BBC Monitoring Middle East. “Rather than just…Americans are doing.”)<br />
Finally—reconciliation is the only way to stabilize the Rafah border<br />
Hanna ’08 (Michael, 2/1, “Egypt’s Gazan Predicament.” “Unmentioned in Rice’s….for the foreseeable future.”)<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>2ac Tricks, Add-Ons,</em></strong> <br />
<u>Syria add-on</u><br />
A war between Syria and Israel will draw in Russia<br />
Simonov ’06 (Pavel, 7/19, “Russia might get involved in the Middle East conflict.” “Not so long ago…Lebanese-Israeli confrontation.”)<br />
This escalates to global nuclear wars and draws in the US<br />
Moore ’07 (Carol, 9/5. “Six escalation scenarios spiraling to nuclear war.” “Israel attacks Iran’s….retaliates against China.”)<br />
US-Russian war causes extinction—most probable.<br />
Bostrom ’02 (Nick, March, “Existential risks: analyzing human extinction scenarios and related hazards.” Journal of Evolution and Technology. “A much greater… encounter in the 21st century.”)<br />

<strong>CONTENTION ONE – THE DEATH OF GAZA</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>THE US HAS ENABLED A HAMAS-FATAH CIVIL WAR BY REJECTING HAMAS’S ABILITY TO GOVERN. AS THE US IS TIGHTENING THE SCREWS ON THE GAZA STRIP, IT IS GIVING ISRAELI AGGRESSION IN GAZA A PASS.</strong><br />

(Karen Koning, Reducing Gazans to Destitution Won’t Bring Peace, Arab News)<br />
<br />
<u>Gaza is on the threshold of becoming… harshly penalized for acts in which they have no part.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>AND – US SANCTIONS ARE KILLING GAZA RESIDENTS. THE REFUSAL TO FINANCE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING FACILITIES IS CAUSING EMBANKMENTS TO COLLAPSE DROWNING RESIDENTS OF GAZA AND DESTROYING HOMES</strong><br />
<strong><u>PETRAS</u>,</strong> Professor of Sociology at Binghamton University, <strong><u>2K7</u></strong><br />
(James, CounterPunch, 4/2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/petras04022007.html%29" rel="nofollow">__http://www.counterpunch.org /petras04022007.html)__</a><br />

OBSERVATION TWO: THE DEMONIZATION OF RESISTANCE<br />
<br />
THE US IS ENCOURAGING SUFFERING IN ORDER TO CONVINCE THE PALESTINIANS THAT HAMAS IS AT FAULT. AS IN IRAQ, WE ARE LITERALLY KILLING OFF A POPULATION TO INSPIRE A REGIME CHANGE. THIS DENIAL OF ENGAGEMENT IS A DEFERRAL OF US RESPONSIBILITY<br />
CHRISTISON, Former CIA analyst, 2K7<br />
(Kathleen, CounterPunch, 7/26, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/christison07262007.html%29" rel="nofollow">__http://www.counterpunch.org /christison07262007.html)__</a><br />
<br />
The Fatah attacks against Hamas in Gaza were initiated at the whim of, and with arms and training provided by, the United States and Israel… most Palestinians have not fallen for these blandishments, which offer nothing in return for their abject surrender to Israel.<br />
<br />
AND - AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY LOVES TO LABEL PALESTINIANS AS TERRORISTS. THE IDEA THAT HAMAS ARE TERRORISTS AUTHORIZES ISRAEL TO ADVANCE A COLONIAL PROJECT OF CRUELTY. THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ARE SEEN AS BIOLOGICALLY PRONE TO VIOLENCE. SUCH SWEEPING ACCUSATIONS DO SERIOUS VIOLENCE TO UNDERSTANDING THE ROOTS OF PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE AS RESISTANCE AGAINST OCCUPATION.<br />
GREGORY 2004 (DEREK – PROFESSOR OF GEOGRAPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA IN VANCOUVER – COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF SOUTH ASIA, AFRICA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST 24.1 – “PALESTINE AND THE WAR ON TERROR” – PG 183-195)<br />
Identities and oppositions<br />
It is hard to imagine how any people can withstand such atrocities… of seeing the face of Evil everywhere except in their own looking-glasses<br />
<br />
BUSH’S STRATEGY TO TURN HAMAS INTO AL-QAEDA IS DESIGNED TO CONVINCE THE WORLD THAT ISLAMIC RESISTANCE SHOULD BE ELIMINATED, BECOMING A CRITICAL LINK IN THE IMPERIALIST AMBITIONS OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR. AT THE SAME TIME, THE BOOGEYMAN OF PALESTINIAN TERRORISM HAS BECOME A PRETEXT FOR THE US’S UNCRITICAL SUPPORT FOR ISRAELI APARTHEID<br />
BENNIS 2007 AUGUST 10 (PHYLLIS – IPS FELLOW AND FELLOW OF THE TRANSNATIONAL INSTITUTE IN AMSTERDAM. WRITER, ANALYST AND ACTIVIST ON MIDDLE EAST AND UN ISSUES – “BUSH LAUNCHES A NEW MIDDLE EAST INITIATIVE. MIDDLE EAST PEACE IS AT HAND. AGAIN” POLITICAL AFFAIRS.

However inevitable the failure of Bush's latest plan,… deemed free and fair by former President Jimmy Carter and a host of U.S. and European monitors).<br />
<br />
THE ABILITY FOR THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL TO DESIGNATE THEIR ENEMIES AS “TERRORISTS” CULMINATES IN A PROCESS OF DEHUMANIZATION THAT MAKES THE LIVES OF PALESTINIANS DEVOID OF VALUE AND WORTHY OF PHYSICAL EXTERMINATION<br />
PETRAS 2006 (JAMES – BARLTE PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT BINGHAMTON UNIVERSITY – THE POWER OF ISRAEL IN THE UNITED STATES – 148-49)<br />
<br />
After reading hundreds of books and articles and listening to scores of speeches and interviews by experts on terrorism… of physical humiliation by the armies and states of the purported &quot;civilizers&quot;. (148-49)<br />
Contention 3 ENDING THE WAR ON GAZA<br />
<br />
RECOGNIZING THE LEGALLY CONSTITUTED GOVERNMENT OF PALESTINE DEMONSTRATES THAT INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CARES ABOUT THE SUICIDAL SPLIT OF THE PALESTINIANS<br />
CHRISTISON, Former CIA analyst, 2007<br />
(Kathleen, CounterPunch, 7/26, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/christison07262007.html%29" rel="nofollow">__http://www.counterpunch.org /christison07262007.html)__</a><br />
Is this abysmal Palestinian situation a harbinger of things to come?... &quot;moderates&quot; do not prevail, mired in continual U.S.-instigated warfare.<br />
<br />
<br />
GAZA WON’T GET ANY BETTER UNTIL THE US ENDS THE WAR AGAINST HAMAS<br />
LENDMAN 2007 (Stephen, BA Harvard, MBA Wharton, CounterPunch, A Deepening Humanitarian Crisis, 7/9)<br />
Ever since, they've paid dearly for their choice… elected Hamas government most Palestinians still strongly support.<br />
<br />
ISOLATING HAMAS DILUTES THE NATIONAL LIBERATION FRAMEWORK. ONLY A UNITY GOVERNMENT CAN RESIST ISRAEL’S FAKE PEACE<br />
KARKAR, president of Women for Palestine, 2K7<br />
(Sonya, CounterPunch, Squirming Under Israel's Security Matrix, 7/2,<br />

<br />
The divisions that have caused so much bitterness internally threaten the national liberation framework. It is not… their occupation and tightened Israel's control<br />
<br />
<br />
PALESTINIANS WANT US INTERNATIONALIZATION OF PEACE – WASHINGTON HAS A MONOPOLY ON ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN STEWARDSHIP<br />
Toensing, editor of Middle East Report, 2K7 (Chris, Bitter Lemons International, 4/19)<br />
<br />
The Palestinians have long sought, and Israel has long resisted… As is obvious to all concerned, the clout in the Quartet resides in Washington.<br />
<br />
The political calculation of “risk” is a form of managerialism employed by the state to subvert resistance movements. Attempting to govern political impacts recreates uncertainty and insecurity-this turns your da.<br />
