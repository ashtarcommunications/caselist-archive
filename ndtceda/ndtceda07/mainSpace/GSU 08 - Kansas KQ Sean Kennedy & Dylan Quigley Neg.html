1NC -<br />
the aff's impact claims are based upon appeals to certainty, as though their impacts had always already been weighed in advance, by god or by history - this makes their action not something they take responsibility for, but instead something that must be done, that is out of their hands - even if they actualized their dream of a world where our decisions are merely spit out by ethical calculators the result would not be peace, but an absolute violence that would preclude any possibility of interpretation<br />
Martin Hagglund 04 - diacritics 34.1, 40-71, The Necessity of Discrimination, MUST<br />
kw - thus, a rigorous deconstructive thinking maintains that we are always already --&gt; idea of absolute violence<br />
the aff's mechanism rule-based ethics cast off responsiblilty - the moment of uncertanty in every decision - have discoverd truth according to which the world operates - these caluclations inevitably have remainders - in a world of their ethics these become invisible - only a form of decision that sees the world as to-come and affirms moments of aporia can have ethical responsibility for the creation of others like the refugee - you should evaluate this first b/c it begs the question of the ethics of thier mpx calculus<br />
Dillon 99 Another Justice &quot;Political Theory&quot; Vol. 27 no. 2 april 1999<br />
kw - in the realm of undecidability, decision is precisely --&gt; that strangeness to the lapse of Time itself.<br />
And, this abandonment of responisbility for moments of interp is not merely an abstract problems w/ their aff but literally sanctions the on-going sacrifice of millions<br />
Derrida 95 - The Gift of Death pgs. 84-87<br />
kw - this applies all the more to political or legal matters -_&gt; nothing more than a murderer?<br />
<br />
ALT TEXT - the judge should affirm the plan as the possibility of the to-come<br />
Rather than passing our decisions off onto metaphysical rules, we should take radical responisbility for the moment of interpretation required in those decisionzillingness to simultaneously realize that justice is not being done and that a perfect justice is always impossible can allow us to probelmatize those others that are excluded by our decisions<br />
Derrid 04 - Rogues, p. 84 - 91<br />
kw - To this I would oppose, in the first place, all the figures --&gt; indeed of substantial or subjective substance.<br />
<br />
Our fwork interp is that the judge should suspend their faith in metaphysical basis for making decisions and take responsibility for the very act of decision itself -<br />
Every aff is simultaneoously a decision and an affirmation of a particular interp of what it means to decide - their attempt to elevate their particular method of decision to the status of metaphysics links to all our offense and begs the question of their justificaiton for exclusion<br />
Michael Dillon 99 - Political Theory Vol 27. no 2, april 1999 &quot;Another Justice&quot; p. 155-175<br />
kw - i wish to argue, in addition, that th econdition of being-in-between --&gt; the ontological in continental thought<br />
<br />
A2 PERMUTATION<br />
perm still links - pluralism establishes plurality itself as a new universal value - the perm is a rehashing of the traditiona liberal state and proves our arguments about how interpretation is constitute<br />
Samuel Chambers &amp; Alan Finlayson 08 - Ann Coulter and the PRoblem of Pluralism: From Values to Politics; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol7no1_2008/chambersfinaly_pluralism.htm" rel="nofollow">www.borderlands.net.au/vol7no1_2008/chambersfinaly_pluralism.htm</a><br />
kw - 2. while comprised of diverse interests, contemporary liberal thought centres --&gt; conform to constitutional expectation.<br />
structuralism DA - the perm solves none of the links to the 1ac - treats the alt as a new set of knowledge to be added to the aff's ethical computer - this strat treats the problem as merely one of finding the right way to make certain decisions and remains unable to question the concept of certainty itself as the basis for deciding<br />
Derrida 78 &quot;Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences&quot; in Writing and Difference. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hydra.umn.edu/derrida/sign-play.html" rel="nofollow">www.hydra.umn.edu/derrida/sign-play.html</a><br />
kw - nevetheless, the center also closes off the freeplay it opens up and makes possible --&gt; God, man, and so forth.<br />
Hailing DA - the perm requires us to hail the ethical structure of the 1ac as a pre=condition for affirming difference - ensures that the to-come becomes subordinated - solves NONE of the links and makes massive violence inevitable.<br />
William V. Spanos Humanism and the Studia Humanitatis After 9/11/01 - symploke vol 13 Nos. 1-2, pgs. 219-262<br />
kw - in 1991, following the disintegration and demise of the Soviet Union --&gt; cultural map of imperialism<br />
<br />
Framework links to the K<br />
the aff assumes they have already won the ethics debate<br />
Chambers &amp; Finlayson - above<br />
kw - 4. as these examples make clear, liberal political theory often casts itself --&gt; critique of liberal theory<br />
<br />

A2 environment o/w<br />
evelevation of enviro into a security lense shows the thesis of our interp argument<br />
Tuathail 96 &quot;at the end of geopolitics? reflectons on a plural problematic at century's end<br />
kw - even within the remarked upon emergence of &quot;environmental security&quot; --&gt; planet earth from destruction<br />
enframing the enviro as a process lies at the root of their dead zone impact<br />
Ronnie Hawkins 06 - Ethics &amp; The Environment 11.2<br />
kw - in &quot;the culture of nature as seen through missisissipan geographies,&quot; Jeff baldwin shows us --&gt; nature that encompasses them.<br />
<br />
A2 reps don't matter<br />
their deistinction is artifica - we approach realtiy through language - so they imply an idealism that despite their wishes they can't discharge<br />
David Ayers Poetics Today 24.4 &quot;materialism and the Book&quot; Projectmuse<br />
kw - this is not to say that we can simply produce --&gt; endless performative, metaphorical play<br />
