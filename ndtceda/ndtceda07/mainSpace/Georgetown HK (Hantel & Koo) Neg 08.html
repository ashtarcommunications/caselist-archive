Zizek K:<br />
Our society lurches forward from crisis to crisis: nuclear, ecological, etc., each time implicitly believing that each crisis is a historically specific situation that requires some minor corrective course of action. This perspective misidentifies the Real as a historically specific situation rather than a feature inherent in the social edifice itself. Lurking beneath every fantasy of peace, sptability and resolution is a threadt of disorder and chaos. Catastrophe always hovers, such is the nature of our being.<br />
Zizek 04 (<u>Conversations with Zizek</u> Slovoj Zizek and Glyn Daly, pg 78-79)<br />
Here I would…self blockade.<br />
In order to protect ourselfves psychollcally we have all acquiesced to the spell of ideology. Ideology works by constructing a fantasy fo reality in which it is possible to overcome the inevidable crises generated by the Real. We wait anxiously until catastrophe confronts us as “on the brink”, and then we take some somall corrective measure thereby deferring our reconciliation with catastrophe. This process on constant deferral prevents us from fever fundamentally reordering the world and instead moves us towards a n NOW which selectively constitutes groups of people to eliminate as barriers and risks rather than recongnizing the intrinsically risky nature of the entire symbolic venture.<br />
Zizek 04 (<u>Conversations with Zizek</u> Slovoj Zizek and Glyn Daly, pg 12-13)<br />
The central issue…in today’s realpolitik.<br />
Vote negative to render the catastrophe of the aff unavoidable: we can learn that the true catastrophe of the status quo is that it comdems us to a life lead under the shadow of the permanent threat of catastrophe. The act of projecting ourselfes into the world of the neg, a post apocalyptic woruld in which we have finally confronted catastrophe dead on, retroactively enables us to think differently about the present. Vote neg as a way to reconfigure the politics of the present by breaking out of the spell of ideology.<br />
Zizek 03 (The Puppet and the Dwarf, pp 159-166)<br />
This perhaps…meant its exact opposite.<br />

We did the whole plan but PIC'd out of all enrichment instead limiting<br />
it to uranium enrichment that can be produced with its original pilot<br />

Plant.<br />

First limiting enrichment to a single cascade checks prolif and<br />

Topicality Including<br />
Definition – “Include” means “consists of,” excluding anything other than security guarantees and foreign assistance<br />
Justice Carley, November 28, 2006, Certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Georgia, 275 Ga. App. 189, Majority Decision in Berryhill v. Georgia Community Support And Solutions, Inc, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gasupreme.us/pdf/s06g0038.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gasupreme.us/pdf/s06g0038.pdf</a><br />
Ms. Berryhill argues that the word…supra (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979)).<br />
<br />
<br />
Including is the only limiting word in the resolution because “Constructive Engagement” could mean anything according to the guy who invented the phrase<br />
New York Times, August 28, 1988, “U.S. Official Nears Elusive Triumph: An Intricate Peace in Southern Africa,” Lexis<br />
The low point for Mr. Crocker came…couldn't take it back.<br />
<br />
Grammar – the use of “including” to modify a more general term indicates it is a definition of that term. Grammar is the only predictable way to read the resolution in context.<br />
