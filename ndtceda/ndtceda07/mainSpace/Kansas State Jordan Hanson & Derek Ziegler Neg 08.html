KSU Negative vs. Iran (Grand Bargain) – MSU AW<br />
Rice – North Korea Disad<br />
<ol><li>Bush is listening to Rice on North Korea – it is producing more peaceful situations a- neocons want a hardline and Rice is barely warding them off – AJC, 10-26-07, “The important exxcepton is North Korea” to “actually accomplishing your goals”</li><li>Moving to soft line diplomacy will only embolden the neo-cons attack on Rice, Sydney Blumenthal, 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://opendemocracy.net/" rel="nofollow">opendemocracy.net</a>, “Despite Rice’s shunning of the advice” to “leave her open to the harshest attacks from neo-conservatives.”</li><li>Breakdown of negotiatiosn spark Korean conflict, Brad Glosserman, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.glocom.org/" rel="nofollow">__www.glocom.org__</a>, “Failure to reach a negotiation solution” “weapons should not oblige South Korea to rethink”</li><li>Nuclear war results – Park Ton-Whan, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://keia.com/" rel="nofollow">keia.com</a>, “The capabilities of the two Koreas” and “resulting in devastation beyond imagination”</li></ol><br />
BMD Bad (Politics)<br />
<ol><li>Uniqueness<ol><li>Democrats successfully blocked Bush’s proposed funding scheme for BMD development in Europe, Liang, 11-7, “lawmakers deny funding for missile” and “not to approve funds to build missile defense”</li><li>However, the measure is not dead – Bush will veto the Senat’s spending bill along with other Democratic packages, ensuring the funding proposal returns within the month – Democrat opposition will remain key to blocking BMD, Cowan, 10-31, Reuters, “are engaged in a high-stakes game with Bush”</li></ol></li><li>Link – There is immense bipartisan diapproval of the plan Congress likes hardline in the Middle East – the plan is overwhelmingly unpopular and there is immense bipartisan stallingother legislation – Hendrickson and Tucker, 06, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.natonalinterest.org/" rel="nofollow">__www.natonalinterest.org__</a>, “As much as a grand bargain would be in the interests” and “frigid peace, at worst, a raging war”</li><li>Winners Win- Getting victores ensures more victories – presidential studies prove – Cohen, 95, American Journal of Political Science, p. 68, “controlling the agenda”</li><li>Bush’s ability to work with his opponents is key to passing missile funding, Sprink 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://heritage.org/" rel="nofollow">heritage.org</a>, “for missile defense must be defined by the willingness to put”</li><li>BMD development isolates Russia, forcing it out of the INF, Samson, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cdi.org/" rel="nofollow">cdi.org</a>, “dismay if Russia were to deploy missile defense sites”</li><li>This creates the precondition for inevitable nuclear holocaust, Ritter, 2007, ALTERNET, “Russian withdrawal from the INF” “once again place the cities of Europe”</li></ol><br />
T – Including means ONLY Aid or Security Guarantee<br />
A. Interpretation – The Supreme Court has ruled that the term Including indicating a finite list<br />
Ken Adams, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://adamsdrafting.com/" rel="nofollow">adamsdrafting.com</a>, “used the list following a given including or includes” and “The aim is to make it clear that the unrestricted meaning applies.”<br />
B. The affirmative does more than just aid or a security guarantee<br />
C. Standards: Limits – the aff could do anything towards a country diplomatically, 2) Stable Ground – they can claim unique link turns off of the non-guarantee or assistance packages<br />
Counterplan – Support the Iranian Revolution<br />
The USFG should publicly support a democratic revolution in Iran and it should include nationally broadcasting iformation provided by Iranian blogges and the President should secretly commit to a policy of no military intervention in Iran.<br />
Solvency – The CP would spur an internal democratic revolution in Iran<br />
Ledeen, 2007, The Iranian Time Bomb, p. 208-210<br />
This would democratiz Iran in less than a year<br />
Ledeen, 226-7<br />
Divisions in the ruling elite make this a unique opportunity to pursue a democratic transition, McFaul,WQ, 121-138, “An additional factor that offers hope” “opening for a new period of political liberalization”<br />
Democratic Iran would abandon weapons program<br />
McFaul, WQ, 2007, “triggered an end to nuclear weapons” “prospects for Iranian democratization are greater than commonly assumed”<br />
End Around Disad<br />
<ol><ol><li>Cheney is currently supporting the President on Iran and will not encourage Israel to Attack now, Haaretz Service, 9-23-07, “Cheney may have consolidated a plan” and “which it said were first published”</li><li>Link and Impact – The threat of regime change is critical to ensure Cheney does not end-around the Bush administration and cause Israel to strike – pursuing diplomacy causes WW3, Steven Clemons, 9-19-07, Why Bush Won’t Attack Iran, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://salon.com/" rel="nofollow">salon.com</a>, “Bush is trying to convince Iran” “We should also worry about the kind of scenario” and “would escalate quickly”</li><li>Israel missile bombing would cause WWIII, Gregor Peter Schmitz, 10-26-07, “But for realists in the corridors of the State Department and the Pentagon”</li></ol></ol><h2 id="toc8"> </h2>

Politics—India Deal<br />
<br />
A. THE BENEFITS TO AMERICA’S ECONOMY PROMOTED BY THE 1/2/3 AGREEMENT WILL ENSURE PASSAGE BY A STRONG MAJORITY OF BOTH HOUSES IN THE STATUS QUO.<br />
Reuters, August 12, 2007. (Y.P. Ajesh, “Congress seen backing India nuclear deal”, Lexis.)<br />
(A landmark…White House.)<br />
<br />
B. LINKS:<br />
a. There is no political opposition to an invasion of Iran—Key democrat frontrunners support a military and sanction option over diplomacy.<br />
Joshua Frank, 2005 (“The Democrats and Iran: Look Who’s Backing Bush’s Next War”, Accessed 8/28/07, Lexis.<br />
(But the…the Iranians.)<br />
b. Democrats are openly defending a unilateral military solution to Iran.<br />
Joshua Frank, 2005 (“The Democrats and Iran: Look Who’s Backing Bush’s Next War”, Accessed 8/28/07, Lexis.<br />
(Foreign Policy…”support for.”)<br />
<br />
C. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE—STALL]ING OF LEGISLATION DURING CHANGING TIMES OF POLITICAL AMBITIONS, LIKE AN ELECTION YEAR, CAN END LEGISLATION.<br />

Brudney, Assistant Professor of Law @ Ohio State University, formerly Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the US Senate Subcommittee on Labor, 1994, “Congressional Commentary on Judicial Interpretations of Statutes: Idle Chatter or Telling Response?”, 93 Mich. L. Rev. 1, October, accessed 7/22, Lexis.<br />
(The difficulty…to anticipate.)<br />
<br />
D. IMPACTS—<br />
a. Nuclear power deal is critical to Indian cooperation in the War on Terror, Asian stability, the spread of democracy and does not increase proliferation, marking a win for US influence in South Asia and the Middle East.<br />

(We believe…for nonproliferation.)<br />
<br />
b. Growing challenges to US supremacy in the Middle East and South Asia necessitate a strategic relationship with India to sustain US hegemony.<br />
Radha Surya, May 22, 2007. (“Indo-US Nuclear Agreement: Refusing to Pay the Price”, Z-NET, accessed online 7/24/07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=12890" rel="nofollow">http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=12890</a><br />

Executive Order Counterplan<br />
<br />
Text: President Bush will issue an executive order to increase constructive engagement with Iran by offering them security guarantees and support for an enrichment facility in Iran under International Atomic Energy Agency control in exchange for assurances that Iran will not pursue nuclear weapons and end its support for terrorist organizations.<br />
<br />
Executive orders have the same power as law while avoiding institutional limitations.<br />
Ken Mayer, 2001. Princeton University Press, “With the Stroke of a Pen), pages 4-5.<br />
(These chronicles…cases disturbing.)<br />
<br />
The executive is the sole organ of foreign policy.<br />
Louis Henkin, Professor Emeritus and Chairman of the Directorate of the Center for the Study of Human Rights @ Columbia Univ., 1996, Foreign Affairs and the United States Constitution, p. 221.<br />
(Agreements related…foreign policy.)<br />
<br />
Case Solvency Args.<br />
<br />
American attempts to stifle Iran’s nuclear capability are perceived as interventionist—they cause a surge in nationalism.<br />
Takeyh, 2006.[Ray, Senior Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations, “Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic”, © 2006, p.149]<br />
(At the…aggrieved nationalists.)<br />
<br />
Support for conservatives is dangerous—Ahmadinejad escalates regional tensions with Israel.<br />
<br />
Fathi, 2005. [Nazila, Staff Writer, International Herald Tribune, “Wipe Israel ‘off the map’ Iranian says—New leader revives an old rhetorical tack”, October 27, 2005, Accessed 8/27/2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/26/news/iran.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/26/news/iran.php</a>]<br />
(Iran's conservative…Islamic world.)<br />
<br />
Additionally, this danger is bidirectional – even if Iran has no grand ambition to strike Israel, its regional posture escalates the likelihood of an Israeli first strike. The Jerusalem Post, 2006. [Yaakov Katz Herb Keinon And Nathan Guttman, 8-25, Pg. 2, l/n]<br />
