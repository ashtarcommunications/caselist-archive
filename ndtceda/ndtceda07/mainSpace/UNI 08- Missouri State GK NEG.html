Framework<br />
The Affirmative must defend a topical plan of action. They defend the resolution but not the implications of plan action and fiat.<br />
This is the most predictable framework.<br />
1.Everything after ; matters<br />
2. Resolved expressed intent to implement<br />
3. Should mean of that<br />
4. USFG<br />
Predictability precedes all other issues. Shively 2000 Political theory and Partisan Politics.<br />
Should defend the implication of plan. They kill ground by linking out of all DA’s and counterplan ground. This is an independent reason to vote negative. Shively 2000.<br />
Topical education- Implementation of policy promotes good education. They are radical education. Shively 2000.<br />
Our Interp. solves education. Shively in 2000.<br />
