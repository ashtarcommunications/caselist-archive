CONTENTION 1:  The capital of hunger <br />
<br />
WHEN SUBSIDIES IN THE US HALF THE MARKET PRICE OF SOY OIL THE INDIAN PRICES FOR MUSTARD SEED OIL PLUMMENTED. SOY  WAS NEVER EATEN OR USED IN INDIAN BEFORE THE AGRIBUSINESS DEVILS IN THE WEST GAINED CONTROL OF HTE INDIAN OIL MARKET AND BANNED NATIVE INDIAN OILS, THEY THEN FLOODED THE INDIAN MARKETS WITH SOY PRODUCTS. APPLYING A METAPHORICAL NOOSE AROUND THE INDIAN PEOPLES NECKS. THIS IS HOW WAR ON THE GLOBAL SOUTH IS FOUGHT TODAY WHEN LOCAL MOVEMENTS TRY TO REINTRODUCE LOCAL PRODUCTS TO THE MARKET THE CAPITALISTIC AGRIBUSINESS IS QUICK TO MAINTAIN ITS INTERESTS AND DESTROY THE LOCAL AGRICULTURE AND CONTINUES AGRIBUSINESS DOMINANCE IN THE SOUTH. <br />

The new globalization effort is based on simple common enclosure, which means there will always be new exclusions that will have to justify violence. The violence is everyday life; scarcity that is caused by corporate self-interest this is the war on the body as people wither away in the global south. Globalization makes every being and resources into a commodity to be bought and sold. the rich privatize stolen ground and destroy the culture of the land. when land becomes a place where the farmer cant grow their own seed and the poor cannot afford essential necessities to there lively hood. the movement of monoculture turns the other into an enemy that must be destroyed this exclusion maintains capital and its must kill its dissenters to sustain itself mentality. <br />

When the suicide of 16000 is caused by economic forces that are defined as genocide, the WTO called this tragedy a heinus form of collective violence a genocide because it target a population. This is how neoliberalism pulls apart populations and renders them useless. The current policies of subsidies are upheld to destroy the body population driving small farmers to the point of extinction. Agribusiness wants the farmers to become slaves to their subsistence farming techniques. THE WTO IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF POVERTY!.<br />

 Tyler and i advocate :the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies, for the production of  all soybean subsidies, to the following argibusiness corporations, cargill, conagra foods, adm, and walmart<br />

No matter how terrible the effects of subsidies are, we are not doomed. Far from a true universal, the horrors perpetuated by corporations are simply one locality among many. Globalization from below rejects the lie of a homogenous world by returning to these diverse localities, reversing the damage.<br />

Against the violence and exploitation of corporate globalization, we join a movement driven by respect for locality and difference. There is no system outside of the practices of each individual in their environment. By changing these practices and embracing new alternatives, this massacre will finally end.<br />
