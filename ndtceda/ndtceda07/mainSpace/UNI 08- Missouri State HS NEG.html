Violation: and/or<br />
T: “and/or”<br />
<br />
Definitions:<br />
“And/or” means both conjunctive &amp; disjunctive, not either conductive OR disjunctive—that just means you have to be net beneficial to PICS as well<br />
Words &amp; Phrases, 2007 vol 3A p. 222 <br />
“the hybrid phrase “and/or” … “alone or jointly with contractor”<br />
<br />
And/or connected to multiple terms means more than one, even if not all<br />
Words &amp; Phrases 2007 vol 3A p. 221<br />
<br />
“charge that care and skill” … “alone would be sufficient”<br />
<br />
b. violation: plan eliminates subs for cotton but that’s only one item in list<br />
<br />
c. VI<br />
1. grammar double “or” is incoherent<br />
Their interpretation falsely excludes parties to a transaction, the phrase is conjuctive<br />
Words &amp; Phrases, 2007, vol 3A p. 222<br />
“the phrase and/or” “son and twin brother”<br />
<br />
And/or meaning either “and” or “or” is misleading—should be excluded<br />
Words &amp; Phrases, 2007, vol 3A p. 221<br />
“the term “and/or” “and” meaning” … “should be left out of instruction”<br />
<br />
2. replacement test: some topics have used the valid wording “one or more of the following” but there’s no evidence that the phrase and/or has this meaning when it conjoins a list longer than two items.<br />
<br />
3. predictable ground: our interp forces the aff to reduce ag support substantially not just in one small area such as fisheries, while enabling testing of single crops through PICS if necessary. This encourages advs that have play with subs generally—where aff can demonstreat solvency deficits to crop pics<br />
<br />
4. jurisdiction: ;case which only prove the or part of the phrase are subtopical and cant justify affirming the resolution<br />
