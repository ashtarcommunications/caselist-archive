 The Plan:<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should lift the direct payment<br />
restriction on planting fruits and vegetables, and eliminate<br />
counter-cyclical payments, export credit guarantees and marketing loan<br />
payments for domestically produced cotton.<br />

Despite rulings against upland cotton subsidies in the WTO, the 2008<br />
farm bill continued to endorse trade distorting subsidies for the US<br />
cotton industry<br />

WHAT'S MORE - Cotton subsidies have become a lightning rod for<br />
anti-Americanism, drastically increasing the risk for terrorism<br />

Impact is global nuclear war<br />

<br />
<br />
Contention 2 is Trade<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FIRST – The WTO is on the brink of collapse. The continual breakdown<br />
of Doha negotiations and lack of judicial legitimacy threaten the<br />
relevance of the WTO.<br />
<br />
Blustein, 8-21 (Paul, Journalist in Residence, Global Economy and<br />
Development at The Brookings Institution, &quot;Doha Trade Talks Collapse:<br />
What's Next for Global Trade?,&quot;<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0820_trade_blustein.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/ opinions/2008/0820_trade_ blustein.aspx</a>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are two internal links to global trade:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First – the Doha Negotiations<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If the Doha round fails, the WTO as an institution won't be far<br />
behind. Absent the stability provided by the WTO, protectionist trade<br />
wars will break out, threatening the viability of the global economy.<br />
<br />
Ikenson, 06 (Daniel, Trade Policy Analyst at Cato, &quot;The WTO After Hong<br />
Kong - Where Do We Go From Here,&quot; February 14<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freetrade.org/node/710" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetrade.org/node/ 710</a>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT – despite the temporary setback at Geneva, there is still hope for<br />
the Doha. A renewed commitment from the US can finish the round before<br />
the end of the year.<br />
<br />
The Economist, 7-19 (&quot;Defrosting Doha,&quot; lexis)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What's more – the Geneva talks collapsed not because of SSM<br />
negotiations, but because the US refused to budge of cotton subsidies.<br />
The US engineered the collapse because it refused to let the cotton<br />
issue come to the table.<br />
<br />
Sharma, 08 (Devinder, food and trade policy analyst, &quot;What Caused WTO<br />
Collapse? It Was Cotton Subsidies, Stupid?&quot; Zmag, August 5,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.countercurrents.org/sharma050808.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.countercurrents. org/sharma050808.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If left unresolved, the most recent cotton dispute at Geneva will end<br />
the Doha round forever.<br />
<br />

five books on the WTO and related issues, 2008 (August 10, &quot;Doha round<br />
of WTO crucified&quot;, The Financial Times,<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
What's more – the cotton dispute is representative for the WTO as a<br />
whole. Unless it gets resolved, the entire WTO system will lose<br />
authority.<br />
<br />
Pfeifer, Alpert, and Kripke, 04 (Kimberly, Gawain, and Emily, policy<br />
analysts for Oxfam and Senior Policy Advisor on international trade<br />
issues with Oxfam America and policy analyst for Oxfam America,<br />
&quot;Finding the Moral Fiber&quot;, Oxfam Briefing Paper 69, October, p.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT – reaching an agreement on cotton would revive the talks:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FIRST: spillover.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
it's the most important impasse and would lay the groundwork for<br />
resolving all of the agricultural disputes.<br />
<br />
Pan et al 2007 (Suwen, Research Scientist, Department of Agricultural<br />
and Applied Economics, Cotton Economics Research Institute, Texas Tech<br />
University, &quot;Cotton in a Free Trade World&quot;, Economic Inquiry Vol. 45<br />
Iss. 1, January, ProQuest)<br />
<br />
SECOND – trade leadership.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cotton is the leading drain on US trade credibility. It must be<br />
resolved before the US can reasonably lead the Doha negotiations.<br />
<br />
Hall 08 (Joshua, Scott Beaulier, Profs at Beloit College Dept of<br />
Economics, Madeline Helling, Beloit College, Wisconsin, USA, and,<br />
&quot;HIGH COTTON: WHY THE USA SHOULD NOT PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO COTTON<br />
FARMERS,&quot; Economic Affairs, Volume 28, Issue 2, Pages 65-66)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What's more – US trade leadership in the WTO is necessary to keep the<br />
world on a multilateral track. Absent US credibility within<br />
multilateral negotiations, bilateral and regional trade agreements are<br />
inevitable and will take down the whole system.<br />
<br />
Even if preferential agreements are inevitable – as long as the US can<br />
support the multilateral regime, they aren't problematic.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Striking a deal on cotton would enable the US to regain its trade<br />
leadership. The world is waiting.<br />
<br />
James, 06 (Sallie, trade policy analyst at CATO, &quot;Agriculture and the<br />
Doha round,&quot; July 14, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freetrade.org/node/249" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetrade.org/node/ 249</a>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THIRD – enabling concessions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A US concession on cotton enable developing countries to make<br />
concessions on tariffs and NAMA. The plan ushers in new agreements in<br />
the Doha round.<br />
<br />
Bhagwati, 07 (Jagdish, Senior Fellow for International Economics, &quot;Why<br />
the Trade Talks Collapsed,&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
What's more – a move of unilateral liberalization by the US would<br />
revive and fix the flawed WTO negotiating framework. It would propel<br />
negotiations forward.<br />

International Political Economy (Trade Policy, New Century: The WTO,<br />
FTAs and Asia Rising p. 90-92)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The SECOND INTERNAL LINK to global trade is COMPLIANCE.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First – the upland cotton case renders the US out of compliance with<br />
WTO obligations<br />
<br />
Randy Schnepf, Specialist in Agricultural Policy Resources, Science<br />
and Industry Division, 2005 (July 11, &quot;Background on the U.S.-Brazil<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Failure to comply with the cotton case threatens the judicial<br />
legitimacy of the WTO as a whole.<br />
<br />
BENICCHIO, 05 (Romain, economist and a political adviser on trade for<br />
Oxfam International, based<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
What's more – compliance with WTO rulings is necessary not just to the<br />
credibility of the DSB, but to the WTO as a whole. The US specifically<br />
must be seen as a compliant member or else the system will break down.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
And – A strong DSU is critical to sustaining norms of international<br />
trade while reviving negotiations<br />
<br />

Trade and Investment at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Compliance with judicial decisions are also necessary for negotiations<br />
to work – Doha can't succeed unless the US starts complying with the<br />
DSB.<br />
<br />
Sumner, 07 (Daniel A., Director, University of California Agricultural<br />
Issues Center; Frank H. Buck, Jr. Professor, Department of<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Next are the impacts to Free Trade.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First - Failure to save the WTO guarantees the world splits into US<br />
and China trade blocs<br />
