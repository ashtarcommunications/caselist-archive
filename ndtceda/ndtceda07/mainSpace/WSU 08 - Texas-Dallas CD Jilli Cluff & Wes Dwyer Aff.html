<strong>Plan: The United States Federal Government should eliminate all domestic subsidies for the production of biofuels.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention I:<br />
ENVIRONMENTAL IMAGINARIES<br />
THE IDEA OF SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENTALISM HAS BEEN PRESENTED BY THOSE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AS OUR SAVING GRACE IN THE FORM OF BIOFUELS. THIS NATIONALIST ENVIRONMENTALISM MASKS MASSIVE OPPRESSION AND LARGE SCALE INEQUALITY BY MASQUERADING AS HUMANITY’S SAVING GRACE<br />
Ziegler 08</strong> (Alexis, Environmental Activist, Author of Culture Change: Civil Liberty, Peak Oil, and the End of Empire, Biofuels and the Rise of Nationalistic Environmentalism, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3992" rel="nofollow">http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3992</a>)<br />
<br />
&quot;As a result of the...particular individual or group.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>IN ACCORDANCE- U.S. BIOFUEL PRACTICES GREENWASH AN INCREASINGLY HORRIFIC VISION OF “GREEN CAPITALISM” – THE RETERRITORIALIZATION OF THE MARKET INTO MORE “ECO-FRIENDLY” FORMS OF EXPLOITATION LEAVE IN THEIR WAKE A TRAIL OF DEAD AS THE GLOBAL UPPER-CLASS LITERALLY BURNS FOOD TO DRIVE THEIR CARS.<br />

<br />
&quot;The rapid expansion of biofuel...skyrocketing food prices.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>AND, THE DISCOURSE OF SUSTAINABILITY THAT DRIVE THE BIOFUEL CRAZE ARE NOT NEUTRAL OR OBJECTIVE BUT RATHER ARE USED PRODUCE IDEALIZED VISIONS OF NATURE AROUND SPECIFIC POLITICAL OBJECTIVES TO ADVANCE CAPITALISM AND SUBJECTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL KNOWLEDGES<br />

<br />
&quot;Environmentalists (whether activist...banned by ‘Nature’ itself&quot;<br />

<strong>AND, CAPITALISM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL MAJOR VIOLENCE IN THE PAST 100 YEARS AND ENSURES PERPETUAL MASS MURDER INTERNATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE ‘00</strong><br />
(“Capitalism and Genocide” Internationalist Perspective #36, Spring)<br />
<br />
&quot;Mass death, and genocide...more frequent recourse to mass murder.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>AND, THE NATURALIZING PROCESS OF CAPITALISM MASKS ITS ROLE IN FORECLOSING OUR POLITICAL IMAGINARY. OUR PRIMARY ETHICO-POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY IS TO CHALLENGE THE FOUNDATION OF THIS SYSTEM Zizek and Daly 04</strong> (Professor of Sociology at Ljubljana univ Slovenia, Senior Lecturer in Politics at University College Northampton, Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek pg. 14-16)<br />
<br />
&quot;For Zizek it is imperative...an otherwise sound matrix.&quot;<br />

<strong>CONTENTION TWO IS REPEATING LENIN THE NEGATIVE GESTURE OF THE PLAN IS THE CRITICAL STEP IN SHORT CIRCUITING CAPITALIST IDEOLOGY – OPENING UP SPACE FOR IMAGING AUTHENTIC POLITICAL ACTIONS. JOHNSTON 2K4</strong> (Interdisciplinary research fellow in psychoanalysis at Emory University, Adrian, Psychoanalysis, Culture &amp; Society, December v9 i3 p259 page infotrac)<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps the absence of a detailed political...truth? I choose fetishism&quot;).&quot;<br />

<br />
<strong>OUR DEMAND DISTURBS THE POLITICAL IMAGINARY THAT SUSTAINS CAPITALISM – FORCING A POLITICAL ACT OF REFUSAL AGAINST THE SYMBOLIC FANTASY THAT SUSTAINS IT ALLOWS US TO REORIENT TRADITIONAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY Zizek 2K</strong> (Slavoj, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, The Ticklish Subject pg. 374-375)<br />
<br />
&quot;This antinomy can...come to terms with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>AND, STICKING THE LAW TO A LITERAL READING OF EGALITARIAN ENVIRONMENTAL IDEOLOGIES RUPTURES THE FANTASY WHICH SUSTAINS IT<br />
Žižek 98</strong> [Slavoj, Institute for Social Sciences at the University of Ljubljana, “Why Does the Law Need An Obscene Supplement?” Law and the Postmodern Mind, p. electronic]<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, the point about inherent...appearance qua appearance was essential.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>AND THIS IS THE FOREMOST POLITICAL ACTION- ALLOWING THE WHOLE OF SOCIAL STRUGGLES TO CONDENSE AROUND THE PLAN AS A METAPHOR FOR LIBERATION.<br />

<br />
&quot;Slavoj Žižek and Chantal Mouffe...as constitutive of the political.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention Three is Framework:<br />
<br />
Interpretation—The plan text remains stable and feasible at the policy level; the functionality of the debate is a criticism of the foreclosed methodology of the state. It is necessary to interrogate these political structures to challenge the education and transferal of this knowledge to the real world. This is true of any affirmative that defends government action.<br />
<br />
a) It’s most predictable—the nuances of the aff are competitive at the policy level<br />
<br />
b) Our interpretation limits debate to promote politically relevant dialogue and structured communication.<br />
Lutz 00</strong> Donald S. Lutz, Professor of Polisci at Houston, 2000 Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 39-40<br />
<br />
&quot;Aristotle notes in the Politics...vision of the non-theorist.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Vision, Social Theory and Political Struggle must necessarily accompany critique.<br />
Cook 1992</strong> Anthony E. Cook, &quot;A Symposium on Feminist Critical Legal Studies and Postmodernism: Part One: A Diversity of Influence: Reflections on Postmodernism&quot; New England Journal of Law, Spring 1992, Lexis-Nexis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moreover, the approach...prestige, wealth and power.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Radical education is distrusting of institutional study and pragmatic reform. Even if their intentions are noble, their message results in fascist totalitarianism.<br />
Martin Lewis,</strong> Assistant Professor at George Washington, <strong>1992</strong> Green Delusions p. 258<br />
<br />
&quot;A majority of those born...become inconvenient niceties.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Debate diminishes partisan lines and has the power to effectuate governmental change from the ground up.<br />
Adolf G. Gundersen,</strong> Assoc Prof Polisci at Texas A&amp;M, <strong>2000</strong> Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 108-9<br />
<br />
&quot;Will deliberation work...allegiance to democratic deliberation.&quot;
