 <span style="text-decoration: none">A) Links<br />
1) </span><strong><u>US identity</u></strong><span style="text-decoration: none"> The Affirmative performance of Danger and security repeats the founding gesture of American identity as the end of history- this lends itself to the construction of those that are inside and outside the world order- this is a precondition for enemy construction </span><br />
<strong><u>Campbell</u></strong><span style="text-decoration: none">- hes a professor- </span><strong><u>1992</u></strong><br />
(Writing Security pg. 132-134)<br />
2) <strong><u>the other securities</u></strong> The framing of the plan as a move towards regional security and fighting terrorism is a specific strategy used to de-legitimize the human concerns that drive insecurity- the plan is simply a move to compartmentalize regional security and uphold the interests of israel <br />
Pinar <strong>Bilgin</strong> Department of International Relations Bilkent University Ankara <strong>2005</strong><br />
<strong><u>Regional Security in the Middle East</u></strong> pg. 150-151<br />
<span style="text-decoration: none">3) </span><strong><u>Conflict</u></strong><span style="text-decoration: none">- the representations of the middle east contribute to ongoing structural violence- the framing of the middle east in the 1AC shapes reality and serves to privilege certain understandings of reality</span><br />
Pinar <strong>Bilgin</strong> Department of International Relations Bilkent University Ankara <strong>2005</strong><br />
<strong><u>Regional Security in the Middle East</u></strong><span style="text-decoration: none"> pg. 193-194</span><br />
<br />
B) Methods<br />
Our framework for the debate is that the affirmative should justify their representations before accessing the material effects of their plan. <br />
<br />
1) The call for engagement is already constituted in a system of representation that makes policy success impossible- here, every failure in us policy has been the result of problematic systems of representation- this is a a crucial question you should ask yourself before voting affirmative, whether or not the discourse of the 1AC is productive? <br />
Pinar <strong>Bilgin</strong> Department of International Relations Bilkent University Ankara <strong>2005</strong><br />
<u>Regional Security in the Middle East</u> pg. 13<br />
<br />
2) The framework for policy making purported by western political science should be held as suspect- the state centric study of the middle east is a western construct used to justify current power differentials<br />

C) Impacts-<br />
1) The benevolent Orientalism of the affirmative is apart of a genocidal eschatology that understands America as the possesor of manifest destiny- this is the logic that justified war abroad and the genocide of native americans; vote negative to prevent the continuation of this unending cycle of violence<br />

</span><br />
2) These logics of empire justify global ordering on a never before seen level- the colonial present of orientalism devalues all life in the name of imperial interests, resulting in never ending massacres of the subaltern populations<br />
<span style="text-decoration: none"><em>Jackie Assayag Professor of Research at the CNRS affiliated at the Maison Française, Oxford (UK</em>  etnográfica • maio de 2007 • 11 (1): 253-269<br />
</span><br />
C) Alternative-  <strong><u>vote negative to reject the representations and methodology of the affirmative and rethink the current approaches to security in the middle east and afghanistan</u></strong><br />
1) Only our alternative opens space for alternative practices that move beyond current approaches to security policy- only our alternative can challenge the mutually constitutive nature of theory and practice<br />
Pinar <strong>Bilgin</strong> Department of International Relations Bilkent University Ankara <strong>2005</strong><br />
<strong><u>Regional Security in the Middle East</u></strong> pg. 6-7<br />
2) Rejecting the affirmative and moving away from orientalist systems of representations are crucial to remedy the regional insecurity of the middle east- our alternative is crucial to question how reality is shaped by their authors.<br />
