OBSERVATION 1 IS INHERENCY-<br />
Diplomatic relations between Syria and Israel are crumbling- the media and public relations have made the possibility of a peace agreement between Israel and Syria without outside aid impossible<br />
Dawson, 2k6<br />
Stacey, policy analyst, “The War of Hearts and Minds”, McKee Daily, Dec 20<br />
<br />
The relationship between the citizens of Damascus and their “neighbors” to the south are rarely called “good”. Since 1967 the view these neighbors have of each other are often told with a harsh negative tone.<br />
<br />
“To the south? There's a country to the south” one local man in Damascus explaimed when asked about Israel. In this case, as is becoming the norm, uttering “Israel” gets little reaction- the locals have taken to completely denying its existence, let alone its right to be there. “If there is a country there, I hope it keeps to itself- we don't want it bothering us!”<br />
<br />
The feeling seems to be mutual. In small Israeli villages the feelings towards Syria are becoming increasingly chilly. “If they want us to go away, they should try” an old man yelled when asked about the relationship between Syria and Israel, “We would push them into the sea!”.<br />
<br />
With the mood in both countries becoming more contentious one would probably be unsurprised to see how deeply the divisions run. The media in each nation, especially local news services, lambaste the policies and people within the others borders. Many visible pundits argue over what many call “lax” policies by their own government, urging more punitive sanctions and harsher language to be volleyed towards the other governments.<br />
<br />
What is most shocking, though, is that the barbs being sent by the media and the citizens seem to be having an effect on policy making, both in Jerusalem and in Damascus. Since last summers skirmish between Israel and Lebanon the Syrian media has been extremely harsh; policy change, however, came slowly as the pressure from the people build up. Assad's regime has also been rather public about the connection between public policy and public outcry, no matter how radical.<br />
<br />
“We must listen to the people in our streets” stated Jal El-Kazzar, one of Assad's closet ministers, “because they are the pulse of the nation. If we don't react to the people, than the people will be forced to react to us”.<br />
<br />
Israel's top generals are worried about this connection. “We will never be popular with the Syrian people” said a general speaking anonymously, “and if the Syrians people are who we have to try to build bridges with, I'm afraid we're not confident”.<br />
<br />
In a period of time when Israel and Syria are being pressured to work together, especially with the Iraq war and possible withdrawal making the co-operation between Syria and Israel vital for stability, the possibility of a peace agreement, or any such agreement, appears to be impossible with an outside force. In order to overcome such barriers to peace at such a critical time it appears some level of neutrality, or a large amount of desire, would be critical.<br />
<br />
“It seems like a powerful nation, with would benefit from a Syrian-Israeli peace accord, could swoop in and bring the discussion out from the public and into the diplomatic” says Henry Bates, specialist on Syria for the Middle East Report. “If a country like the United States were to sit them both down, some traction, and even a full peace accord, might be possible.”<br />
<br />
AND-<br />
Both Israel and Syria have shown a willingness to work through a neutral conduit. Assad's regime is especially interested<br />
<br />
<br />
The Israeli government, finally opening up after a long silence on the issue of middle eastern peace since the war against Lebanon last summer, has hinted at the possibility of long term peace with Syria. “We obviously see the benefit of bilateral and multilateral peace agreements with other nations in the middle east” said a member of the Israeli parliament, “there is a necessity given the slow disintegration of the Middle East into what could be small scale violence and anarchy”.<br />
<br />
This sentiment is only moderately tempered by local policy analysts. “We know that often the rhetoric of policy makers can, in an over the top way, be too optimistic, but in this instance” says a head researcher for the Middle East Research Initiative, “in this case, however, there is a reason to be optimistic. If other nations were to be involved in playing mediator, Israel may actually be willing to make concessions in order to assure peace”.<br />
<br />
To the north of Israel, Syria seems to be even more interested in multilateral talks.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND-<br />
Syrian officials want the United States to be more involved in Middle Eastern policy outside of Iraq- they expect the US to bend to their desires- absent this Syria is more likely to become violent. A cybernetic attack is inevitable in the squo.<br />
Atwood, 2k7<br />
Joseph, prof of political science and international relations, “A power vacuum in a unipolar system?” International Journal of Conflict Resolution, April<br />
<br />
Syrian officials, increasingly angry over the response by the United States to the Iraqi refugee crisis, feel as though they deserve increased flexibility in policy action towards Syria. The relationship between Syria and the United States, and by proxy the relationship between Syria and Iraq, has become increasingly strained. The United States, since 2005, has stepped up its very vocal and publicly visible campaign of diplomatic condemnation towards Syria, specifically over its supposed control of Lebanon. Syria's government has in turn stepped up its vocal defense of its own policies. What has actually happened in reaction to the pressure from the United States has been a series of threats and demands.<br />
<br />
The first step in this set of policy actions taken by Syria was to make demands of the United States. Starting with calls for aid and pullout from Iraq in order to ease the refugee inflow from Iraq Syria has recently begun to make demands outside of the Iraq question. Since Syria has been, in the words of one of the most publicly visible ministers Khile Hassin, “Extremely willing to help the United States create and maintain a safe and secure Iraq... for the whole of the Middle East”, the government has made moves to pressure the United States. Syria wants the United States to attempt to “make Middle East a peaceful” and “stable” region. Syria's major criticism of late is the focus on Iraq in the face of, what one analyst called, “mounting destabilizing factors outside of Iraq”. John Parkview, President of Research for Penseur Foundation, says the lack of awareness to potential areas of strife, such as Lebanon's refugee camps and Jordan's economic inflation because of the constant influx of refugees, has “worried and irked Syrian officials” who want a more “focused”series of policies from the United States.<br />
<br />
Absent a quick response from United States Syria has begun to hint towards military action to fill in the “power vacuum” left by the United States' action. In a recent public statement by the Ministry of Defense, the Syrian government made it clear that “In some cases, in order to keep stability, a military presence is necessary, existing in multiple, powerful realms”, which seems to indicate that in many areas, like Lebanon and cyberspace, Syria will quickly, and without regret, enter into military engagement, possibly over the information super highway. At this time it seems extremely important for the United States to bend, at least slightly, the the desires of Syria's government, if only to avoid having to deal with a military exchange, especially an electronic one that seems to be closer than ever- one might venture to say inevitable.<br />
<br />
PLAN-<br />
The United States Federal Government in order to substantially increase its constructive with the government of Syria, should, as per intent, offer Syria a comprehensive assistance package involving foreign aid directed at reinforcing both humanitarian and security infrastructures. The reception of this aid package will be offered simultaneously with the offer to broker both long and short term peace agreements with Israel. If Israel declines at any point to agree to meet over the details of said peace agreement the United States will guarantee to defend Syria from any Israeli offensives. The defense systems will be funded and enforced through normal means. The Peace Agreement will be monitored by any number diplomatic officials and will have no set or necessarily desired outcomes. The piece of legislation will be passed by the United States Senate and will be signed, without the addition of additional signing statements or attachments. The senators who vote for this piece of legislation will only be democrats and will not effect the passage of any piece of legislation. Any nations that have an articulated interest will be first consulted in a non-binding fashion and those who have not had an articulated interest will also be notified. Any current pieces of legislation that could potentially pressure any other nation would also not be passed. The Congress will also pass a piece of legislation that rejects all capitalist, racist, sexist rhetoric within the piece of legislation, as well as apologizing for all past imperial and colonial actions.<br />

<br />
A peace talk, begun and controlled by the United States, would be perceived by Syria as a guarantee of security. Syria would be more than willing to give up its terror connections for such an agreement<br />
Bellefield, 2007 Andrew, prof of international relations, yeshiva university, &quot;Posturing in the Middle East- Scenarios for Increased Hegemony and Influence&quot;, International Political Science Journal of the Middle East, pg. LN//wpdu-guy<br />
<br />
Syria's heads of state, increasingly aggravated by the foreign policy decisions by the United States, are now coming out of the woodwork and making it clear what they feel they deserve and what they need. Rather than working through a conduit (such as Lebanon or Iran or, even worse, Hisbellah) with actions and posturing rather than formal statements, Syria sees the need now to make demands or agreements with the United States.<br />
The list of issues that Syria has with the United States is growing. The presence of the United States in Iraq, a contentious issue since 2003 that threatened to be the death knell for relations wholesale, has morphed into a multi front <a name="st"></a>war of words that the United States has yet to engage in. Syria, who recently closed its borders to the bulk of Iraqis, wants (they may actually need) aid from the economic hegemons of the world in order to stop their economic bleeding. Their anger on Iraq is only supplemented by the stance of the United States on the Lebanon issue- Syria thinks Lebanon is a failed state and is in need of a protectorate, the United States wants Syria out. The lack of communication has made these issues impossible to flesh out between these nations.<br />
What Syria most wants, now, is a guarantee of security, and the security aid tied to such guarantees. Since the instability in the region that directly effects them (Lebanon, Iraq, Israel) are easily blamed on the United States, Syria views the US as a potential shield, militarily and diplomatically, from these increasing pressure.<br />
This guarantee can take many shapes- the easiest of which is probably an increased presence in peace talks and multi-national peace accords. If Syria were to sit down and speak to another nation, like Lebanon or Israel, and create a peace deal with the help and guidance of the United States (as well as the assurance of support for whatever deal is made), it would probably make large concessions and bend to the will of other nations, now feeling safe in their position vis a vis the United States. Giving up claims to the Golan or to Iran or, most likely, terrorist groups like Hizbellah would be the first actions Syria would be compelled to take.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Syria doesn't even want to Golan Heights, all they want is security from the United States and Israel. A US run peace talk would be this guarantee<br />
Ward and Semple, 2007<br />
Henry and Sarah, prof of economics and prof of international studies (middle east), middle east research institute at California university of pennslyvania, &quot;Land and Sovereignty Claims in the Middle East- A Symposium&quot;, International Journal of Multinational Law, pg. na<br />
So why is there so much hullabaloo over the Golan Heights? Why do both Syria and Israel use this issue in very vocal ways in order to exert pressure on other nations in the global arena? While many observers may see this issue as on of great contention, the truth seems to be that it is little more than a red herring- at least from one perspective.<br />
<br />
Israel's arguments about why they want to keep the Golan Heights are rather persuasive from an American point of view- Syria is a major threat, as shown by last summers <a name="st1"></a>war with Lebanon, as well as their rhetorical posturing, and in order to keep tabs on Syria's military movements, as well as a larger distance between Syria and Israel's core land (specifically the larger populated areas), Israel needs to keep control over the Golan Heights. Syria, on the other hand, has maintained a strict interpretation of the Golan question- its ours and we deserve it. What can one garner from this difference in posturing. One could immediately point to a simple difference in &quot;culture&quot; or &quot;foreign policy norms&quot;, yet neither of those arguments serves to aid US policy makers make decisions on one of the most vocalized issues in the middle east.<br />
<br />
What one can guess at is what Syria actually wants- security. We can know this first by simply following our normal rules of realism- the rulers of nations are in it for themselves. Imagine Assad and his regime sitting around a table talking about their foreign policy position as their regime slowly loses credibility and many secondary groups, like the Muslim Brotherhood, attempt to gain international support for a coup. What would any rational actor want- support and a guarantee from its neighbors that they will do whatever they can to keep the current power structure in tact. As we've talked about at length prior, most powerful nations don't want to disturb power structures that are already there- they just want them to agree with the global order. We can see this process quite clearly here. Syria wants a guarantee from Israel to help keep the current regime in power and Israel wants to current regime to stay in power to avoid local instability. US, a functional neighbor not only because of its large sphere of influence but because of its virtual presence in Iraq, could also be a player in this peace agreement for similar reasons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Israel would also say yes- they are empirically willing to be involved in peace agreements when they don't have to give up anything.<br />
Frazier, 2007<br />
Edith, president for Israelis for Peace, &quot;What a girl really wants&quot;, Program for International Peace- Middle East Divison<br />
Israel is the nation in the Middle East, perhaps in the world, who most wants stability because they have the most to lose. The legality of their existence is questioned, something that most nations don't have to deal with, at least not for more than forty years. The main demographic in the area is hated by the governments and populations of just about all surrounding the nations and the region, they lack a &quot;safety&quot; valve of sorts that many nations have. Israel also is in the difficult spot of constantly making policies that go against the desire and wants of their neighbors (read: enemies), making peace hard to come by. Besides these issues of generic strife, issues that Israel has had to deal with since World <a name="st2"></a>War II, the possibility of instability is especially problematic for Israel because its magnifies already existing problematic.<br />
<br />
What Israel is looking for now is an ability to both flaunt is military and diplomatic prowess in order to best keep order. What Israel has done from time to time is use moments of duress in order to create lasting peace agreements. We've seen that the relationship between Egypt and Israel, while often teetering on the brink of meltdown, has remained strong even through mounting pressure on Egypt. What could happen now is that Israel will jump at just about any chance to enter into a peace agreement with one or more nations in the Middle East. While Iran seems unlikely as a strategic partner many nations, including Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon, are starting to show interest.<br />

Cutting out Syria would be the death-knell for Hizbellah- the Lebanese militia would wipe them out and they would find no other harboring<br />
Halket, 2007<br />
Joncaire, International Peace Center (France), &quot; &quot;Groupes de terroristes- évaluation des menaces&quot; Agence France Press, pg na<br />
Outside of the current political landscape, the possibility of the future of Hizbellah seems to be in doubt. While many may think that Hizbellah's ability to recruit in lieu of the <a name="st3"></a>war in Iraq is through the roof with a large &quot;labor&quot; pool of sorts available there are an increasing series of situations that may put future power and even existence in doubt. The first is that Iraq is losing its ability to really drive home a good recruiting class for Hizbellah. Its not that people are increasingly upset about the presence of the US in Iraq its that as more local groups get power, the less Hizbellah has. Not only do the local movements pull people out of the labor pool, these local groups want Hizbellah out. Hizbellah hasn't made friends with local power structures mostly because of its destabilizing desires.<br />
Another factor that could lead to the demise of Hizbellah is Iran's <a name="st5"></a>nuclear program. While many pundits view Iran's attempted acquisition of <a name="st4"></a>nuclear weapons as a means to get WMD's in the hands of Hizbellah it seems that the opposite may wind up being the case. There are two scenarios for the process of Iranian nuclearization. The first is that Iran gets the bomb. In this scenario Iran will probably have closer ties with nations like Russia and China, and possibly Venezuela and Brazil, meaning the necessity for proxy wars would be eliminated. Multiple nations acting to counter-balance the United States and NATO would make proxy wars, at least for Iran, not only obsolete but probably problematic as there would be potential for a backlash from those powers. The other scenario would be Iran not getting the bomb. This would most likely happen because of massive concession from the United States and Israel, meaning the animosity required for proxy wars will have evaporated.<br />
The last stronghold, then, is Syria. Syria still holds what appears to be the last true refuge for Hizbellah. This, however, also seems a bit tenous. The Syrian government appears to be moving towards making concessions to the normal US-Israel troupe, meaning that Hizbellah may have no where to go and will, most likely, disappear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hizbellah is the largest and most dangerous terrorist organization- it is the only one with connections and a position large enough to start a global <a name="st6"></a>war<br />
Frew, 2007<br />
Hobart, independent researcher, &quot;Hizbellah: The Real Threat #1- At home and Abroad&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://homelandsecurityandsafeness.org/" rel="nofollow">homelandsecurityandsafeness.org</a><br />
Strangely enough Americans seem to lack a concrete understanding of the destructive potential of Hizbollah. Recent interviews by mass media outlets like CNN and Fox News illustrate this point extremely clearly. Individuals interviewed in LA, Boston, and the New York area, areas of the country that are at extreme risk, are under the impression that Hizbollah, because of the <a name="st7"></a>War on Iraq, is far weaker than before and aren't as dangerous as they once were. These sentiments are entirely untrue.<br />
Now, before discussing the reasons why Hizbollah is a strong, growing force, it needs to be clear the power that they wield, and what they could do. It must be known, first of all, that Hizbollah is the most powerful terrorist force in the world. Their position is unique among terror groups- official State Department correspondence notwithstanding. They've illustrated that they can, and have, and will use their influence to start multi-state wars, a feat that has yet to be matched by modern Islamic terror groups. They have connections and support from militarily powerful nations in Syria and Iran, who both have reasons to engage in proxy wars rather than in direct state-to-state conflicts.<br />
These connections are obvious and are not hidden behind the thickest veil of secrecy ever seen on the worlds stage. What is nerve wrecking, especially for Americans, is the possibility of this organization starting large scale wars across the globe. The scenario isn't hard to imagine. A large scale terrorist attack, possibly on US soil, draws the United States and its military machine into Syria or Iran or any other nation in the Middle East not currently occupied (as illustrated on September 11th 2001, US intelligence can quickly discern where an attack originates from). This would force Israel into an offensive posture (when the US invaded Afghanistan this wasn't the case purely due to spatial reasons) which would put the rest of the Middle East on high alert, probably leading to current sleeping military giants like Egypt and Saudi Arabia to pump up the military spending and defensive positioning. Iran, if not the direct target of US action, would be compelled, even pressured, to us its military force to answer back to the US presence. NATO and its functional governmental arm the EU, after getting soft on terror and fighting against the United States on most of the security issues of the past five years, would be forced to put a whole hearted effort into any post-terrorist fight. China and Russia, either independent or in response of each other, it doesn't really make a difference, would be drawn in to either protect their own oil interests or to ensure that when the dust settles their oil is in tact. This scenario for a global <a name="st8"></a>war where Alliances would be tenuous doesn't even include the possibilities of Palestine and India, because of mutual distrust, as well as many other North African and Central Asian nations being drawn in in some respect. The only nations who could possibly be excluded from such a meltdown is the increasingly self-sufficient South American nations.<br />

A <a name="st10"></a>war in the middle east would go <a name="st9"></a>nuclear<br />
Morrison, 2k5<br />
Margaret, prof of international studies and politics, Lycoming College, &quot;Global Hotspots- a Lecture on <a name="st11"></a>War&quot;, available online<br />
The worst case scenario for the world is probably a large scale armed battle in the Middle East. Any time a number of powers fight in the region the potential for <a name="st14"></a>nuclear arms being used increases. Popular opinion indicates there's already popular sentiment for the use of strong force to make Middle Eastern nations easier to deal with. Outside these outlandish claims there are actual reasons the believe that the next multination <a name="st13"></a>war in the Middle East will go <a name="st12"></a>nuclear.<br />
The first reason is that there will be multiple <a name="st18"></a>nuclear powers fighting at once for the first time in history. Even if Iran doesn't have a <a name="st17"></a>nuclear weapon China and Russia will inevitably be directly involved, and who knows what side they'll be on. The inability of the United States to fight in urban areas means that there is an increased incentive to do large scale bombing raids, especially with tactical <a name="st16"></a>nuclear weapons. There is also an incentive to use bunker busting <a name="st15"></a>nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
A Nuclear War would lead to the destruction of all life for eternity.<br />
Allequippa, 2k7<br />
Dawson, Staff Writer, The Lumberjack, Feb. 12,<br />
<br />
While there is a near global awareness of their past destructive force, few are aware of the current destructive capacity of nuclear warheads. A past study, the quite possibly the most proliferated study on the destructive capacity of nuclear weapons, by Jonathan Schell has been revisited by graduate researchers in Alcorn State's Department of Physics. The goal of the study was originally done in order to find the results of the original study when applied to current nuclear technologies. The results were stunning.<br />
<br />
“We were originally attempting to see if current 'safety' precautions added to less deaths in the most likely scenarios for nuclear war or nuclear fallout” said Prof. Darragh, head of the study, “what we found was shocking and disturbing- given current nuclear technology we could cause more damage than just that of the Earth”.<br />
<br />
Prof. Darragh worries are based on current weapon technologies being able to disturb the galactic flow of energy. The thoughts go like this: that since we can still make huge weapons that could potentially cause the planet to explode. If one of these bombs were buried underground deep enough not only would the Earth heat up enough to kill all life on Earth it would blow up it up! That would mean no potential for life ever again. What could be even more destructive would be the chain reaction that followed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, even if the <a name="st19"></a>war remained localized, the structural damage to the middle east would cause huge price spikes in oil- prices well above 150 dollars would be possible, destroying the worlds economy<br />
Orpwood, 2k6<br />
Julius, economic analyst, evaluation economic center for analysis, &quot;Price Shocks- understanding flexibility in prices&quot;, Understanding: Economics Journal Conglomorate, May<br />
<br />
Everyone seems to fear massive instability in the Middle East. While the talking heads in Washington decry the problems of human rights violations that have come to light in the wake of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the death of American lives in a <a name="st20"></a>war that may, in time, be viewed as a massive waste of time, and the creation of even bigger problems (Iran) on the horizon, there is one sector of the nation's fabric that has more to fear than many realize: the economy.<br />
<br />
What is scariest about the potential effect that a large <a name="st22"></a>war in Iraq or any localized <a name="st21"></a>war in the Middle East, specifically multinational wars that draw in other oil producing nations, is the multiple scenarios for not just gradually increases in oil prices but massive spikes. While coups and regime changes, as well as sanctions and anti-US sentiment, have the potential to create small bumps and gradual rises in prices (we see our current $60/barrel prices as an example), the more dangerous scenarios are ones where there is structural damage to the flow of oil out of producing nations. I'm talking about the possibilities of the destruction of pipe lines, the burning of oil fields, and the (potential) impossibility of returning to these sites for any extended period of time because of contamination.<br />
<br />
What would happen in such a world? The first step would be that the prospectors would shoot the price of oil up, probably over $100/barrel. The skyrocketing price would come quickly. In a massive <a name="st23"></a>war that destroyed infrastructure the price would jump multiple times across multiple days. As dust settled, much like when hurricanes effect off-shore rigs, the price would continue to increase as information about the extent of the damage comes in. The initial price jumps would be just the first in a series that would destroy the economy of the globe.<br />
<br />
Price Shocks are the largest Impact one could Imagine- They're Dehumanizing, epistemically and ontologically violent, and create the impetus for genocide.<br />
Bayard,<br />
Warwick, minister, “The Benign Power of Imperialism”, Pastafarians.com<br />
<br />
There is nothing more violent than when the global north, the economic imperialist slave drivers who seem like their only job is to ensure the destruction of all people, places, and things not white, rich, and male, allow for prices of essential resources, like water, oil, or food, to spike. Little spikes in prices, multiplied because of the difference is local economies and monetary exchange rates intentionally inflated by the global north, can cause multiple layers of devastation. Their first impact on the global south is an increase in poverty, the most dehumanizing of processes. Individuals wouldn't get food (no “saviors” to drop bags, and no way to power agricultural machines) which means more and more late term and early childhood deaths. Deaths from starvations are the worst out of any you could imagine- worse than deaths from Ebola because of the drawn out suffering.<br />
<br />
What happens after this? The violence doesn't stop there. Nations have to put in place authoritarian regimes in order to deal with these cataclysmic living conditions. These governments are the largest opponents to a stable human rights campaign. They imprison detractors, destroy all moves in women's rights, and force entire groups to live in the fear of ethnic cleansing and genocide.<br />

Hizbellah's biggest strength is not on the ground- it lies in Cyberspace. There is no greater threat to the nations information security- it risks economic decline, a loss in power projection, and an increase of accidental nuclear launch- which would lead to extinction<br />

Some that not many people know is how wired Hizbellah actually is. While how well funded and founded they are doesn't escape the political pundits, mass media, and the well as both sides of the ideological blogosphere their spending happens seem to.<br />
<br />
On a recent shopping list, found in a leaked CIA memo, included:<br />
server space in Romania<br />
10,000 new Dell computers<br />
over one million dollars in audio equipment<br />
ten million dollars in visual equipment.<br />
<br />
While there are various potential reasons for a terrorist group to purchase these items, there are other bits of evidence, mostly circumstantial, such as an increase in computer science programs in many Middle Eastern nations, like Egypt, and the proliferation of anti-Israeli websites written in Arabic.<br />
<br />
The implications are many. The first is the rapid stealing of economic information- the stealing of credit cards, identities, bank robberies. A large rash of this sort of theft could cause the economy to either buckle for a short time (if there was a large amount stolen over a short time) or lead to a gradual degradation of expendable capital, slowly wearing at the economic machine. Either cause would lead to a depression, probably global. The communications of the United States military, the backbone of their quick strike capabilities and long term stability, could be shut down. Even a five minute loss of communications would allow for multiple, coordinated strikes against the United States which could completely remove the United States as the global police force. The scariest potential is that the cyberterrorists could control any numbers of nuclear arsenals for any moments- moments long enough to cause nuclear fallout.<br />
<br />
While price shocks are bad, cyberterror might be worse:<br />
<br />
“Did you even see Live Free or Die Hard? 'Our nets are down' 'which ones?' 'All of them'” said a university speaker on the subject of cyber-terrorism. Apparently the movie was closer to reality than we originally thought. All IP's can now be hacked, simultaneously, meaning we would lose control of everything- not just our nuclear warheads, or our military communications- our electrical grids, our wireless communications, everything. Everything could stop, and everyone cloud die.
