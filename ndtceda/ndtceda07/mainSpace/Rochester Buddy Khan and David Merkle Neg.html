Attempts at group definition ignore the difference that are excluded for the illusion of sameness – since all these groups depend upon the selection of a specific fiction among others, claims of authenticity are simply used for exclusion and essentialism<br />

Now the K First the links<br />
<ol><li>Form and Content – The affirmative policy contests the content of capitalism aka the advantages but never the form. We must focus on intervening in both which entails a rejection of the liberal parliamentary democratic order through which the plan is advocated. Zizek 2k2</li></ol><br />
<ol><li>Terrorism reveals the super-ego – Our fear of terrorism is part of a hatred of ourselves. The things we hate in religious fundamentalism are more reflective of the things we find deficient in American fundamentalism.</li></ol>Zizek 2k6<br />
<ol><li>Golan Heights – the idea of trading land for political favors is laughably capitalist, assigning static value and then creating the conditions for exchange of values operates within a market foundation.</li></ol><br />
4. normalization of relations – The plan involves decreasing tarrifs, wto help, foreign trade, diplomacy. It’s the belief that the normalization of our trade practices can fix the problems created by our foreign policy, signaling a return to capitalism to solve its excesses. They never go about questioning that it was capitalism itself that set the conditions for the fault to occur in the first place.<br />
5. Syria – that they chose Syria is no mistake, The affirmative plan of foreign assistance and constructive engagement is an attempt to open Syria up to market capitalism.<br />
