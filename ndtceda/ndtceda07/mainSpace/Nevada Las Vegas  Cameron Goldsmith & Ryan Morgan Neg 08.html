The aff’s unique repression of the natural desire for violence, locks them into the language of a sadist. Their attempts to “securitize” the symbolic order fetishize the very violence they wish to control. The symbolic order is inevitable, and cannot be transgressed.<br />
Zizek, 2001. “On Belief” pg. 31-32<br />
“The logic of this succession is thus clear… filled in by hasty pre-theoretical generalizations.”<br />
Representations of catastrophes are reproduced to sustain our own eroticism to control and coincide with the other<br />
Kristeva, 1941. “Power of Horror: An essay on abjection,” pg. 149-155<br />
“That obsession refers back to decay… sexuality and the blunt negation of the sexual.”<br />
Now I know you are asking yourself, why isn’t that non-falsifiable? How do I know that we are all masochistic at heart. Pain and pleasure are interrelated. They are connected in the human psyche. It is the cultivation of what Jung called the “shadow” – the darker mostly unconscious part of the psyche which he regarded as a sickness, but as an essential part of the human psyche. Their heroic attempt to change the symbolic order is an attempt at castrating us all. Pain is <em>joissance</em>. This castration causes a violent fetishization. They are sadist, looking for the quickest way to blow a load.<br />
Thus we advocate embracing an ethic of sadomasochism. We will clarify.<br />
Fink, 1997.<br />
“In every movie in which a sadist is depicted… They get off on the enactment of castration.”<br />
Traditional ethics denies individuals of their jouissance whereas the practice of s and m creates an ethic of love they neighbor that precludes the possibility of calculation and evaluation<br />
Yen Ying Lai, 2007. “The Calyx of Isis.” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/symtom8_articles/lai8.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.lacan.com/symtom8 _articles/lai8.html__</a><br />
“On the economic role that masochism designates…because it is knotted with our own desire, our obscene kernel.”<br />

Off Case Args (Plan Flaw): little f – little g<br />
Off Case Args (T): Sanctions<br />
A) Interpretation: lifting actions is a prerequisite to constructive engagement<br />
Herbst, 1997. “Incentives and Domestic Reform in South Africa,” Ch. 8<br />
“The policy of constructive engagement was in sharp contrast… with the apartheid regime in South Africa proved unsuccessful.”<br />
And, constructive engagement is an ongoing process<br />
Chan, 1996 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.burmaissues.org/En/Newsletter/BINews1996-03.php" rel="nofollow">__http://www.burmaissues.org/En /Newsletter/BINews1996-03.php__</a>)<br />
“By definition, a policy of… meet these conditions by a specific date.”<br />
B) Violation – aff doesn’t lift sanctions prior to constructive engagement meaning no ties are established, they don’t constructively engage ___ and sanctions stay.<br />
C) Prefer our Interpretation<br />
1) Predictability<br />
2) bidirectionality<br />
3) ground<br />
4) limits<br />
D) T is a voter for fairness and education<br />

A uniqueness- assad is barely holding onto power in Syria<br />
Meeks 2006<br />
(Syria: Reassuring US Approach and Other Options, Robert Meeks, March 15, 2006)<br />
“however, Syria now appears to be in its” “internal and external political positions”<br />
<br />
B Link- Assad uses ME instability to justify his regime<br />
Rubin 2007 “The Truth About Syria” interviewed by Michael J Tten<br />
“the list goes on” “regional stability, anti-americanism, and using Israel as a scapegoat”<br />
<br />
C. Assads Vacuum would be filled by radical islamists who would increase support for terrorism, derail the peace process, and ramp up support for the Iraq insurgency<br />
Meeks 2006<br />
<br />
CP Text: the United States will issue an ultimatum to the Iranian government demanding immediate dismantlement of their nuclear program. If Iran does not immediately disarm, the president will deploy the following assets to the Gulf of Oman: minesweepers, a carrier strike group’s guided missile destroyers, an Aegis class cruiser, and anti-submarine assets. The rest of the carrier group will remain in the Indian Ocean. Next, these forces will halt all shipments of Iranian oil and launch a comprehensive air assault aimed at destroying Iran’s air defense system, air force bases, communications systems, missile sites, and finally nuclear facilities. An amphibious force of Marines and special-operations forces will then seize key Iranian oil assets in the Gulf. These oil assets will be held until Iran agrees to show proof of either regime change or a total end to its nuclear program. Any clarifications, refer to our Herman evidence. And the United States Federal Government will subsidize the United States Aerospace industry in order to prevent companies from folding and or not being able to deliver United States Defense needs.<br />

Herman, 2006<br />

“but, as I have tried to show” “be destroyed before leaving port”<br />
