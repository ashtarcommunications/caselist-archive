 <strong>Cap K</strong><br />
Reducing domestic support for commodity crops is only part of a capitalist strategy to increase the exportation of more specialized crops to force the third world into globalization<br />
Maitra, ‘97<br />
[Priyatosh Maitra, Economics Department, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand, “Globalization of capitalism, agriculture and the negation of nation states,” International Journal of Social Economics, 24.1-3, 1997, Emerald]<br />
<br />
The current phase of internationalization...kind of industrial capitalist production in these economies.<br />
<br />
Capitalism extinction – we must embrace the alternative now<br />
Foster, ‘5<br />
[John Bellamy Foster, Prof @ U of Oregon Dept of Sociology, “Naked Imperialism,” The Monthly Review, Volume 57, Number 4, 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.monthlyreview.org/0905jbf.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.monthlyreview.org/0905jbf.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
From the longer view offered...movement against the new naked imperialism.<br />
<br />
Our Alternative is to not do the aff- capitalist relations should be withdrawn from and rejected<br />
Herod, ‘4<br />
[James Herod, “Getting Free, 4th Edition A sketch of an association of democratic, autonomous neighborhoods and how to create it,” January 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/4thEd/4-index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/4thEd/4-index.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
It is time to try to...which I will enumerate shortly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Elections Da</strong><br />
McCain is up in the polls now- Silva 9-15, McCain’s electoral edge: Rove’s maps, “the survey that showed republican john mccain eroding” “lead in several red states”<br />
<br />
Subsidies are popular in farm states- Mccain gets the blame<br />
Register-guard 08 (“editorials: farm business as usual; congress perpetuates a wasteful subsidy system” may 23)<br />
<br />
Red state support is key to McCain victory<br />
Halperin 9-10 (mark, “cnn election center”) “brown: so we just told you…. that’s a big advantage for McCain.”<br />
<br />
Key to US-India Relations- Obama<br />
Aiyar 08 (Swaminathan, “India nees McCain as US president”) “in this regard McCain beats Clinton and Obama hollow” “personal likeability is irrelevant”<br />
<br />
Key to avoid India-Pakistan war that escalates to extinction<br />
Dugger 02 (Celia, “wider military ties with India offer U.S. Diplomatic Leverage”) “military cooperation between India and the United States” “could lead to a nuclear holocaust”<br />
<br />
Turns the aff- McCain would remove subsidies<br />
Burns 8-19 (Douglas, Harkin: McCain is hostile to farm country) “mccain opposes virtually all farm subsidies”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>GMO DA</strong><br />
Biotech strong now- Globe and Mail 6/28 “they have ever so quietly” “the two have been called the next Microsoft”<br />
<br />
Subsidy system is key to the entire GMO industry Allen 04 (Will, “the war on bugs”, jan) “billions of dollars in corporate welfare” “a serious and fatal blow”<br />
<br />
Biofuels are key- demand is key to convincing the pubic that GM crops are safe Marrero 08 (Carmelo Ruiz, “biotech bets on Agrofuels”) “biotechnology companies have become some of the main movers”<br />
<br />
Public support of GMOs is key to the survival of the industry Helgren et al 00 (Karin, “genetically modified foods: consumer views and regulations around the world”) “the security of knowing that Biotech is safe”<br />
<br />
GMOs are our buffer from annihilation from a super volcano that would cause extinction Trewavas 00 (Anthony, “GM is the best option we have”) “in 535 A.D. a volcano near the present Krakatoa” “the only buffer between us and annihilation”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Environmental Managerialism K</strong><br />
<br />
The politics of the 1AC rely on expert knowledge that presupposes an objective and quantifiable understanding of the environment. Scientific and technocratic ecological disciplines however, are a product of a specific sociopolitical location whose ultimate goal is the complete mastery of nature. This expert knowledge legitimates and expands capitalist and biopolitical control of the environment, turning the case.<br />
<br />
Luke 03  <br />
(Timothy W., University Distinguished Professor of Political Science at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Ph.D. in political science from Washington University, St. Louis, ECO-MANAGERIALISM: ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AS A POWER/KNOWLEDGE FORMATION, REPUBLISHED IN AURORA<em>WesD)<br />
Before scientific disciplines and industrial technologies turn its' matter ...course caused wide-spread ecological degradation, which leads to the project of rehabilitation managerialism. <br />
<br />
This power/knowledge nexus inherent in the politics of the 1AC removes all ethico-political considerations necessary to solve the impacts of the case. Even if they win solvency in the short term, the plan justifies continued technomanagement of the environment and life that makes genocide and ecological destruction inevitable.<br />
<br />
Smith ’05 <br />
(Mick, Journal for the Study of Radicalism 2.1 (2008) 1-25, Suspended Animation: Radical Ecology, Sovereign Powers, and Saving the (Natural) World</em>WesD)<br />
<br />
In a world where a technological enframing predominates, the place for ethics and politics is ...more rigorous bureaucratic control and police powers, on an ever increasing scale. <br />
<br />
<br />
Our Alternative is a genealogy of environmental technoscience. Rather than move forward in a system of biopolitical management, we should instead create a counter-memory that challenges the objectivity of knowledge presented by the affirmative. In this way we can establish new avenues of thought that can better solve the politics of the 1AC.<br />
<br />
Colwell ‘97<br />
( C. Visiting Assistant Professor at Villanova University, Deleuze and Foucault: Series, Event, Genealogy//WesD)<br />
<br />
What genealogy does then, the difference it makes, is that it returns to the virtual structure of the event by ...of mutating the material structures of that memory -- our values, discourses, practices, institutions and our selves.
