kritk of framework<br />
<br />
Framework is a selfserving apologia not only for debate as it is but the world as it is. They not only structurally constrain what is acceptable, they create the conditions for a dead culture that ocan only serve to dominate those who it does not include, vfote negative to disrupt this deeply authoritarian conservative fantasy<br />
<br />
Armstrong “the radical aesthetic” 2000 p. 9-10<br />
<br />
“communality looks attractive, unfortunately…an ungenerous formalism”<br />
<br />
Their vision of debate is fundamentally exclusionary, stratifying debate along the axes of domination that already exist in society such as race and gender. Their well-intentioned framework only serves to mask disciplinary power structures under the mask of an impossible neutrality<br />
<br />
Kulynych 1997 “performing politics” p. 315-330<br />
<br />
“political scientists have… contemporary political action”<br />
<br />
Their hypocrisy on the negative when they run framework is a voting issue – hypocrisy is just another strategy in the war on terror. Not only does it prevent us form questioning the underlying politics of today’s global violence, but it serves as a benign mask for the noble justifications of war<br />
<br />
Nasser-Eddine 2002 “the raging beast within us all”<br />
<br />
“as a concerned Australian…such as Australia”<br />
<br />
in a world of endless warfare, drawing arbitrary lines about what kinds of argument should and should not count is simply a tactic for disciplining dissent. There is no rule book – saying that we can ply, but only if we play by their rules is worse than not playing at all. This self serving limitation is the gesture of benevolence that papers over their will to violence against other ways of knowing and being in the world<br />
<br />
not only does this exercise a personal violence of exclusion, but the elimination of critique from policy debates creates the very climate of fear and ignorance that produces warfare. Our model of includsion without constraint is not a condeition of democratic politics, but is itself the very essence and practice of democracy<br />
<br />
Butler 2004 “precarious life The power of mourning and violence” p.IX-XXI<br />
<br />
“dissent and debate depend upon…effects of war”<br />
<br />
our interpretation of debate is debate<br />
<br />
no argument should be categorically excluded from the activity, and ignorance should not be the excuse of a willfully limited knowledge. Yes, we can argue what the resolution does or doest not mea, but no what forms of argumentation or types of knowledge are permissibl.<br />
<br />
Our vision of debate allows for creativity within negotiated, contestable constraints, not the arbitrary constraint of creativity and knowledge. Resolves: comes before the colon, and you should keep it that way because only our vision od debate as something that can allow us to become different can truly test all knowledge and power, obliterating the distinction between action and criticism<br />
<br />
Kulynych 1997 again<br />
<br />
“V. Performative action…diverse and participatory democracy”<br />
<br />
<br />
Block Strategy:<br />
<br />
Pretending to be the government masks our personal complicity with and relation to global violence. You should reject their form of mental deputy politics because this has real world impacts<br />

A) Fear = contagious<br />
<br />
1AC attempt to deal with fear through fantasy isn’t new – playing out of fantasy is aconstant elemnt of American entertainment.<br />
<br />
But we remain wedded to a fear of catastrophe.<br />
<br />
Fear is affective, it operates on a pre-thought level to delimit possibilities of thought.<br />
<br />
The 1AC attempt to deal with fear through the fantasy of war is a vicious cycle. Instead of rejecting the affective quality of fear – they wed us to the process tranfsofrming it into a way of life<br />
<br />
Brian Massumi 2k5 (“Fear (The Spectrum Said)” Positions, 13.1, Project Muse)<br />
<br />
B) Affect of fear determines reception of the fantasy<br />
<br />
It’s not our refusal to engage the fantasies of destruction that is the problem, BUT our refusal to think there might be fantasies outside of destruction.<br />
<br />
Their attempt to utilze nuclear imagery to ‘work thorugh’ fear fetishizes nuclear weapons it can’t escape the affective frame it seeks to avoid.<br />
<br />
Ira Chernus, 91 (Nuclear Madness, p.186-188)<br />
<br />
The aff has release dht eaffect of fear and thereat into the emotional economy of IR – the war must happen somewhere. And traversing the fantasy cannot change that<br />
<br />
Massumi 2K7 (“Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption”, 10:2 Project Muse)<br />
<br />
Prediction of future rthreates results in permanent state of emergency. The racist notion of the middle east is dogmatic and irrational. Thos e who desire war make it.<br />

Alt: Reject the threat of the Affirmative<br />
<br />
The way the aff has produced their 1AC through an affect of fear holds us all at gun-point, our leap of faith creates a radical openesss that allows us to HOPE for something better.<br />

Anderson 2K6 (“Becoming and being hopeful: towards a theory of affect”, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, Vol. 24)<br />
<br />
And radical openness of hoep allows for a creation of a new affect that solves<br />
