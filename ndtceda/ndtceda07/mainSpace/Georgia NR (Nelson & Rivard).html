ADVANTAGE 1 - PROLIFERATION <br />
<br />
A nuclear Iran is becoming a real probability; even conservative estimates say they’re only three years away. <br />
Economist 07 (July 19, “The Riddle of Iran” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9514293" rel="nofollow">http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9514293</a>) <br />
“THE Iranian regime is basically a messianic …one within three to eight years. <br />
<br />
If Iran goes nuclear, it would cause regional proliferation, and thereby increase the risk of nuclear terrorism, accidental use, and create the most likely scenario for nuclear war. <br />
Rosen 06 (Stephen Peter - Beton Michael Kaneb Professor of National Security and Military Affairs and Director of the John M. Olin Institute for Strategic Studies at Harvard University, “After Proliferation” Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct2006, Vol. 85 Issue 5, p9-14, 6p EBSCO) <br />
Actually, however, a postproliferation future … plausible candidates for such a nightmare. <br />
<br />
The longer that Iran continues to pursue weapons, the more other nations in the region make their own plans for nuclear programs - unless stopped, it would engulf the entire region. <br />
Pedatzur 07 (Reuven, “Danger for the entire world,” Haaretz, 8/22, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/896178.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/896178.html</a>) <br />
The renewed focus on nuclear programs by … agreement with Russia on nuclear technology. <br />
<br />
And, this proliferation would culminate in preemptive nuclear strikes causing worldwide nuclear war. <br />
Utgoff 02 (Victor A. - Deputy Director of Strategy, Forces, and Resources Division of Institute for Defense Analysis, “Proliferation, Missile Defence and American Ambitions,” Survival, Summer, p. 87-90) <br />
Further, the large number of states …of a sheriff’s posse, even in the face of nuclear threats. <br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE 2 - LEADERSHIP <br />
<br />
Iran is the test case for US international and regional influence - effective US diplomatic engagement is key to US leadership. <br />
Leverett 06 (Flynt - senior fellow and director of the Geopolitics of Energy Initiative in the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation &amp; visiting professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, “Dealing with Tehran:Assessing U.S. Diplomatic Options toward Iran” A Century Foundation Report, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tcf.org/publications/internationalaffairs/leverett_diplomatic.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tcf.org/publications/internationalaffairs/leverett_diplomatic.pdf</a>) <br />
Regional and Great Power Politics It is necessary to take a comprehensive …Israel’s long-term security and standing.  <br />
<br />
Finally, US leadership stops global nuclear war <br />
Khalilzad 95 (Zalmay, Washington Quarterly, Spring, lexis) <br />
Under the third option, the United States …a multipolar balance of power system. <br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE 3 - STRIKES <br />
<br />
Bush has been making preparations for an air strike that will start World War Three and destroy the world economy. <br />
Street 8/11/07 (Paul, “They wouldn't really attack Iran, would they?” Arab-American News, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.arabamericannews.com/newsarticle.php?articleid=9498" rel="nofollow">http://www.arabamericannews.com/newsarticle.php?articleid=9498</a>) <br />
Remember the old … has helped make up the difference. <br />
<br />
And, strikes would fail and cause Iran to accelerate their drive for nuclear weapons while subjecting the US to international isolation - only a security guarantee solves.  <br />
Larrabee 06 (F. Stephen - holds the Corporate Chair in European Security at the RAND Corporation, 3/9, “Defusing the Iranian Crisis,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rand.org/commentary/030906OCR.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rand.org/commentary/030906OCR.html</a>) <br />
Iran's decision to resume efforts … return for a ban on uranium enrichment.  <br />
<br />
And, don’t be fooled by Bush’s current commitment to the UN and diplomacy, his plans are clear - we will strike Iran, causing a worldwide recession.  <br />
Krauthammer 06 (Charles, Sept 15th, Washington Post, “The Tehran Calculus” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/14/AR2006091401413_pf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/14/AR2006091401413_pf.html</a>) <br />
In his televised Sept. 11 ..economy will be in a deep spiral. <br />
<br />
And, the impact is nuclear war. <br />
Mead 92 (Walter Russell - Fellow, Council of Foreign Relations, New Perspectives Quarterly, Summer, p.28) <br />
But what if it can’t? …and Japan did in the ‘30’s.  <br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Federal Government should offer the government of Iran economic incentives and a non-aggression pact in exchange for a verifiable agreement by Iran to limit their nuclear facilities to civilian use. <br />
<br />
SOLVENCY:  <br />
<br />
US should offer Iran a security guarantee and stop working for regime change - Iran would give up its program for these concessions. <br />
Etzioni 06 (Amitai - professor of international affairs at George Washington “Time to make a deal with Iran; A non-aggression treaty would give the U.S. the best chance to keep nuclear weapons out of reach” May 3rd, Pg 11A, lexis) <br />
Iran has had its say over the past few months,…mullahs might well find a non-aggression treaty quite appealing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Specifically, economic incentives are a necessary prerequisite for Iranian acceptance. <br />
Pollack and Takeyh 05 (Kenneth - Director of Research, Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and Ray - Senior Fellow in Middle East Studies, Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Affairs, “Taking on Tehran,” Mar/Apr2005, Vol. 84 Issue 2, p20-34, 15p, EBSCO) <br />
IN AN IDEAL WORLD, the Iranians …security and foreign policy aspirations. <br />
<br />
In addition to economic incentives, the US needs to remove the threat of regime change and offer Iran a security guarantee to get Iran to end their nuclear program and submit to inspections. <br />
Sagan 06 (Scott D. - professor of political science and director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, Newsweek, “How to Make Tehran Blink” Sept 4th, lexis)<br />
Given Tehran's defiant response … good deal for the West as well.
