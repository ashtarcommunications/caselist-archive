A Guinean told IRIN...of global capitalism.<br />
<br />
The drive for hegemonic imperialism is inevitable according to the logic of capitalism--only the alternative avoids multiple scenarios for inevitable extinction.<br />
Foster 2005 (John Bellamy, Monthly Review, September, Vol 57, Iss 4, &quot;Naked Imperialism&quot;)<br />
From the longer view...the new naked imperialism.<br />
<br />
Out alternative is to not do the aff--capitalist relations should be withdrawn from and rejected, we must stop participating in rescue operations for capital<br />

THE NAZIS<br />
A. They have a plan<br />
B) voter<br />
