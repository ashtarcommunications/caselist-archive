1ac w/ cites<br />
Same as casebook – mimicking aff<br />
<br />
2ac Tricks, Add-Ons,<br />
The affirmatives 2AC was based on reacting to a very specific negative strategy and they “will probably never do it again.” The aff cites are already on the casebook. The negative reads a story about alienation and the affirmative mimics it. It’s like a giant permutation. The judges all had no idea what was going on. It was hard to tell.<br />

1ar Strategy Notes<br />
<br />
<br />
F/W: Goes for discussion of images good, line-by-line bad, and intellectual terrorism<br />
<br />
CP: Goes for a solvency deficit argument<br />
<br />
K: Decontextualizing history bad because it whitewashes over our complicity, videos key to narrative spaces and we should evaluate based on hermeneutics.<br />
<br />
2ar Strategy Notes<br />

<br />
Goes for Butler evidence about hermeneutics/language.<br />

Round 2- Pitt KR [Aff] vs. UNT CE [Neg], Schroeder, Short, Odekirk [3-0 for the negative from UNT]<br />
<br />
Pitt 1AC from the case book- its a clearly mocking version of Syria aff with an Israel-Syria war scenario and a Hezbollah advantage with a long plan text that includes provisions for things like consultation and passing legislation to remove all racist, sexist, capitalist, colonialist, etc rhetoric in the plan and also mimics people who read cards that are too short, and impacts that are really outrageous<br />
<br />
2AC is a discussion of how mimicry is good and transforms the rhetorical frames that we use to engage in debate- criticizes the way that we understand education now, claims that things like disads don’t spill over and its only a question of the way that we constitute ourselves- also believes that their explanation of language and engaging the resolution is a pre-requisite to liberatory political agency- impact is micro-fascism<br />
<br />
All of the aff should be on the casebook
