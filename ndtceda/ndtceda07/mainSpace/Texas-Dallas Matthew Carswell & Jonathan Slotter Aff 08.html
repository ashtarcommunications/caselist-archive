<br />
Second in the SQ the afghan state will collapse destroying US credibility and leading to violence the US must act now to prevent this collapse <br />
<br />
LA TIMES 2007 www.latimes.com/news/opinion/lad-ed-afghanistan27aug27,0,3029831.story?coll=la-opinion-center <br />
<br />
The United States is... effort, be salvaged. <br />
<br />
The root cause of this impending collapse is failing counter narcotics policies. <br />

<br />
The opium crisis lies… commitments to Afghanistan. <br />
<br />
Plan: the United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan by issuing a security guarantee that United States forces in Afghanistan will not participate in eradication of opium poppies. <br />
<br />
ADV ONE- NATO <br />
<br />
First, eradication props up terrorists and undermines the Afghani government <br />
Carpenter 2004 www.cato.org/pubs/fpbriefs/fpb84.pdf <br />
<br />
There is a growing tension… anti-drug measures. <br />
<br />
And, NATO is getting full blame of failure in Afghanistan.  <br />
NY TIMES 2007 “NATO didn’t lose Afghanistan” www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/opinion/10chayes.html?ex=1341720000&amp;en=0cfae1f45ce41eaf&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss <br />
When things go wrong… American predecessors.  <br />
<br />
Credibility of Afghanistan’s government is key to the NATO alliance.  <br />

Our first, and immediate… now beginning to take root. <br />
<br />
And, collapse of NATO causes multiple escalatory nuclear wars <br />
Duffield 1994 John, Political Science Quarterly 109, p 766-7 <br />
<br />
Initial analyses of NATO’s future… existence of nuclear weapons. <br />
<br />
ADV 2- Pakistan <br />
<br />
First, eradication fuels the insurgency <br />
<br />
Eradication switches allegiance of warlords towards the insurgents and eradication guts intelligence against the insurgency by turning spies against the US <br />
Carpenter 2004 www.cato.org/pubs/fpbriefs/fpb84.pdf <br />
<br />
In any case, the United States… sources of information. <br />
<br />
And the forced migration caused by eradication strengthens the insurgency <br />

<br />
A coup in Pakistan will immediately lead to nuclear first strike against India which will escalate  <br />
Hindutva Times 2001 hindutva.org/indopakwar.html <br />
<br />
But the greatest danger posed… immediately after that.  <br />
<br />
Impact is extinction. <br />
Caldicott 2002 New Nuclear Danger: George W Bush’s Military-Industrial Complex, p X <br />
<br />
The use of Pakistan…. Most life on earth.  <br />

<br />
Eradication fails- three reasons <br />
Senlis Council 2006 same as above <br />
<br />
As a drug-supply reduction… farmers’ behaviour.  <br />
<br />
Opium production is inevitable localizing it Afghanistan allows for regulatory policies <br />
Nadelmann 2007 www.alternet.org/story/61144/ <br />
<br />
Or, given that farmers… the illicit trade. <br />
<br />
Fourth, even if we destroyed all of Afghanistan’s opium the problem can only get worse <br />
Nadelmann 2007 same as above <br />
<br />
But imagine if the entire… is commonly assumed.  <br />
<br />
Finally there are 11,000 US troops in Afghanistan under exclusively US command, further a US general commands NATO forces and is responsible for their actions on the ground <br />

Turn, ontology <br />
<br />
Alternative abandons ontology <br />
Stambaugh 94 (The Other Neitzche, SUNY Press, p 2-3) <br />
<br />
To turn to the german tradition… substate of being. <br />
<br />
Loss of ontology obliterates meaning and leads to extinction <br />
<br />
Zimmerman 94 Contesting Earth’s Future, p 119-120 <br />
<br />
Heidegger asserted that human… were never “disclosed” by humanity. <br />
