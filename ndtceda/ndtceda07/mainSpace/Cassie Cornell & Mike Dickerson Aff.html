Wake Forest, Aff:<br />

1AC:<br />
Vassar- Bard Industries is here with the newest technology in<br />
debate-related products: The Perfect Aff! We can't, obviously, tell<br />
you what it does until you've made your purchase, but we can assure<br />
you that it solves every impact, is perfectly topical, entirely<br />
frameworkable, and very much not the Nazis. (we have no plan text; we<br />
affirm the perfect affirmative, which does not exist. We will<br />
subsequently affirm the death of the 1ac, as it is a parody of all<br />
debate.)<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for our 9 minute spot, coming to a debate round near you!<br />

All debate is an advertisement, makes it impossible for us to tell<br />
what is true and what is merely being sold to our desires. Sanes 00'<br />

Aff is a self-voiding text. We affirm the death of the 1AC because<br />
this is the only possible act that does not further the discurve<br />
economy. Mann 91' (The Theory-Death of the Avaat Garde, 42+45)<br />
<br />
The problem-solution economy makes us slaves, every attempt to solve<br />
this and other problems links us back into this economy. Deleuze 68'<br />
(Difference and Repetition, 158)<br />
<br />
Searching for the stable meaning leads us in a downward spiral that<br />
strives for stasis. Stasis is the ultimate nihilism, we have to<br />
believe we can move forward.<br />

Observation 1 is the Zero-Death System</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Existing power structures rely on the creation of an outside other against whom we must be protected – in the war on terror, this security takes the form of preemptive warfare, the constant actualization of measures against a threat that will never take place.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Zizek, 05</strong> (Slavoj, Fucking Badass, Aug. 11, <em>In These Times</em>)<br />
<br />
<strong>In the War on Terror, this friend-enemy structure takes the form of Western Powers defending democracy and globalization against the evil terrorists. This logic ignores the way that pervasive world power foments its own destruction – the apparatus of globalization fuels the energy of terrorism designed to destroy it.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Baudrillard, 02</strong> (Jean, <em>The Spirit of Terrorism</em>, 8-12)<br />
<br />
<strong>The war on terror acts as a prohibition against and exclusion of death, which hides under the guise of good and evil. In the narrative of the war on terror, counter-terror acts as the good that attempts to triumph over evil. In reality, good and evil are co-productive forces, moving together. This exclusion of death fundamentally misunderstands the nature of terrorism, ensuring its continuation and making collapse of the system inevitable.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>This systematic prevention of death results in the systematic production of organized death. The government’s stance against terror takes the form of a state terror that takes us hostage, makes us all part of the stakes of the battle between good and evil. This cycle of hostage taking is the logic of systematic extermination.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The extermination of populations we describe is already occurring in the war on terror – in the face of a system incapable of death, anyone can use their death as a terrorist weapon, and thus must be systematically liquidated. This can already be seen in the spectral wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – the culmination of this logic is a coalition of all governments against all populations</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The United States Federal Government should enter into negotiations with the governments of Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan, and the Palestinian Authority, and offer the security guarantee of killing all the Muslims in exchange for the governments of Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan, and the Palestinian Authority killing all the Jews.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Observation 2 is Hyperlogic</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The plan text is an act of pushing the hyperreal into hyperlogic – by taking the logic of security in the Middle East to its endpoint of total extermination, our affirmative forces the system into perfect reversibility. By placing the zero-death system alongside its logic of systematic liquidation, we force the collapse of the system of terror and counter-terror.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>We obviously don’t think that the plan should literally happen, but that does not mean that we don’t defend the consequences of the plan. Our point is that we live in a system that is simultaneously devoted to excluding death while simultaneously exercising it at its discretion. Because this system has no fundamental reality that it references, it demands a new type of theory, one which does not merely challenge, but one which takes up the language of the dominant system and diverts it. Our aff functions on the same level of politics by producing fictions of danger from which all truth has been withdrawn.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Our argument is not some whine about excluded voices or colonization of the mind – our point is that the conception of politics taken up by traditional debate is an inaccurate model for the political sphere of the present. Rather than search for meanings and causality in politics, we must remain always on the level of appearances – in a political sphere designed to short-circuit all true events, are only hope is to produce false ones. The affirmative is fundamentally a more accurate depiction of political reality than the negative.</strong>
