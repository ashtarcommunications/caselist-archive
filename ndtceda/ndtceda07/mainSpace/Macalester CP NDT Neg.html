Lacan Kritik<br />
<br />
First the Affirmative’s gift of nuclear weapons is fundamentally no different than the gift of democracy-we provide this technology so they can save the world-this is an even better link than typical since the aff literally figures as promoting the gift of salvation<br />
<br />
Zizek 2004 [Slavoj “Iraq’s False Promise” Foreign Affairs, Januar/February, foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2442 Acc. 8-7-200]<br />
<br />
“Americans have historically…God to humanity”<br />
<br />
The aff defers the question of capitalism and American hegemony away from the self, onto the possibility of Iranian resistance-the structure of ethics depends upon us taking responsibility for the shift of the world, rather than externalizing the question and resistance to iran-the affirmative structure precludes the alternative and means they can’t solve.<br />
<br />
Slavoj Zizek, “Robespierre or the ‘Divine Violence’ of Terror” Lacan.com, 2007 (www.lacan.com/zizrobes.htm)<br />
<br />
We’ll turn your superego claims-the affirmative’s participation in the structure of reciprocity is precisely the superegoic commandment to “Enjoy!” Iran must conform with our understanding of the world, ultimately confirming the world<br />
<br />
Eric Santner 2000 (“Freud’s Moses and the Ethics of Nomotropic Desire” in Sexuation ed Renata Salecl, p 84-5)<br />
<br />
“It is important…be finished off.”<br />
<br />
The Affirmative’s logic assigns to the other something we cannot access or understand, something in them “More than themselves”-this is the basis for racism and hatred, a structure that inevitably results in the violence of annihilation and holocaust-the continued existence of global capital post the plan becomes Iran’s fault-Why didn’t you fuckers resist our global imperialism?!?<br />
