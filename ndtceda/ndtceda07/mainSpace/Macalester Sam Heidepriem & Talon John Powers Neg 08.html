<u>QPQ T</u><br />
<br />
A. Interpretation-<br />
Engagement is the use of diplomatic tools to elicit co-operative behavior<br />
Victor D. <u>Cha</u>, Gov’t Prof. @ Georgetown, Engaging China: The Management of an Emerging Power, edited by A. Johnston and R. Ross, pg. 36, 19<u>99</u><br />
<br />
Constructive supports this<br />
<u>Merriam Webster</u> Dictionary, Online <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/constructive" rel="nofollow">http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/constructive</a><br />
<br />
Main Entry: <u>con·struc·tive</u><br />
3 : <u>promoting improvement or development</u> &lt;constructive criticism&gt;<br />
<br />
B. Violation:<br />
The affirmative team hands incentives over to (insert country) but does nothing to elicit co-operative behavior. The country doesn’t have to do anything in return for the incentives.<br />
C. STANDARDS:<br />
1. GROUND: IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ALL OF OUR SAY NO GROUND AS WELL AS OUR GROUND TO CP OUT OF EFFORTS TO ELICIT CO-OPERATION<br />
2. PREDICTABILITY- ENGAGEMENT IS MORE PREDICTABLE WHEN IT MEANS TO ACTUALLY TRY TO GAIN CO-OPERATION WITH A COUNTRY RATHER THAN JUST GIVE THEM ASSISTANCE OR SECURITY<br />
3. EACH WORD HAS MEANING- BOTH CONSTRUCTIVE AND ENGAGEMENT HAVE MEANING IN THE RESOLUTION AND IF THEY COMBINE TO FORM THE BEST INTERPRETATION YOU MUST ACCEPT IT<br />
4. COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS BEST—GUARANTEES THE DEBATE FOCUSES ON CLASH, AND PROVIDES THE BEST EDUCATION AND FAIRNESS.<br />
D. TOPICALITY IS A VOTING ISSUE FOR REASONS OF JURISDICTION, EDUCATION, AND COMPETITIVE EQUITY.<br />
<br />
<u>Timetable T</u><br />
<br />
A. INTERPRETATION—CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT MUST BE LONG-TERM, STRENGTHEN TIES, AND SET CONDITIONS ON A SPECIFIED TIMEFRAME.<br />
<br />
N. <u>Chan</u>, “Gentle and Slow Persuasion,” <u>Burma Issues Newsletter</u>, v. 6 n. 3, March 19<u>96</u>.<br />
<br />
B. VIOLATION—THE AFFIRMATIVE FAILS TO CREATE A LONG-TERM, VERIFIABLE STRUCTURE FOR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH CLEAR DEADLINES.<br />
<br />
C. REASONS TO PREFER –<br />
<br />
1. GROUND – HAVING A SET TIMEFRAME AND VERIFICATION PROCESS IS ESSENTIAL TO UNIQUENESS, BECAUSE THE AFF CAN ARGUE ENGAGEMENT HAPPENS AFTER OUR SCENARIO.<br />
2. INCLUSIVE AND EXCLUSIVE – OUR DEFINITION ESTABLISHES POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CONDITIONS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT, WHICH ESTABLISHES THE MOST TRANSPARENT LIMITS.<br />
3. PREDICTABILITY– ESTABLISHING A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP BASED ON A VERIFIABLE STRUCTURE GUARANTEES PREDICTABILITY WITHIN THIS ROUND.<br />
4. COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS BEST—GUARANTEES THE DEBATE FOCUSES ON CLASH, AND PROVIDES THE BEST EDUCATION AND FAIRNESS.<br />
<br />
D. TOPICALITY IS A VOTING ISSUE FOR REASONS OF JURISDICTION, AND COMPETITIVE EQUITY.<br />

Doha Has Been Revived From the Dead, But Threatens to Collapse Now—Bush Needs To Pass Subsidy Cuts in The Farm Bill To Sustain it But in the Status Quo He Lacks the Political Capital to Make it Happen<br />

The Doha Round Would Encourage Poverty, Hurt The Poorest of the Poor and Expand Dangerous Bilateral Trade Pacts—Rejecting the Doha Round Provides An Opporunity To Embrace New Visions For International Economic Justice<br />
John Hilary, director of campaigns and policy at War on Want, No tears for Doha, The World Trade Organisation is unfit to address the needs of the world's poor. There should be no attempt to resuscitate the current global trade talks, July 25th, 2006<br />

<u>Turkey Diplomatic Capital DA</u><br />
<br />
American Diplomacy is Currently in a Full Court Press to Support Turkey and Prevent an Incursion Into Iraq—While Diplomatic Efforts Will Succeed Now, The Genocide Resolution has Pushed Relations to the Brink<br />

American Policy in the Middle East Requires Tremendous Expenditures of Diplomatic Capital to Be Successful—The Aff’s Strong Arm Tactix Will Trade-Off With Turkey<br />

<u>Psychoanalysis K</u><br />
<br />
American Foreign Policy is Based On the Idea that Deep Down, Everyone in the World is an American Begging For American Style Democracy—Ultimately This Logic Justifies the Demonization of Opposition and Undermines the Viability of any Internal “Capitalist Revolution”<br />
Zizek 2004 [Slavoj “Iraq's False Promise,” Foreign Affairs, January/February, www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2442 Acc. 8-7-2004]<br />
<br />
The Affirmative’s Logic Assigns to the Other Something We Cannot Access or Understand, Something in Them “More than Themselves”—This is the Basis for Racism and Hatred, a Structure That Inevitably Results in the Violence Of Annihlation and Holocaust<br />
Zizek '95 [Slavoj , “Ideology between Fiction and Fantasy,” 16 Cardozo Law Review 1511, 1995, LN]<br />
<br />
Our Alternative is To Reject the Idea Implicit in the Affirmative that One Must Identify Within the Boundaries of the System, Instead We Make the Impossible Choice of the Act, Which Recognizes the Lack Inherent In the False Choice of Our Subjectivityand Re-organizes the Co-ordinates of the World—Only this Impossibility Can Deal With The Fact that Within The Current Structure Revolution Will Never Occur<br />
Zizek 2000 [Slavoj, Rather Prolific Author, “Class Struggle or Postmodernism? Yes, please!” Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Contemporary Dialogues on the Left, New York City: Verso, 2000<em>]</em><br />
<br />
The Alternative Solves—While Your Indictments of the Indeterminate World “After” the Act Assume a Causal Series, The True Act is Its Own Immediate Realization, Not a Process Which Reaches a Distant Goal—Only Radical Criticism, Which Cares Not For Success By the Standards of the System, Can Reach Outside the Boundaries it Already Accomadates<br />
Slavoj Žižek, Critical Inquiry, Winter 2002 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/zizek/zizek-a-plea-for-leninist-intolerance.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.egs.edu/faculty/zizek/zizek-a-plea-for-leninist-intolerance.html)</a><br />

China DA<br />
<br />
A. Uniqueness—China spreading influence throughout Middle East with trade and oil.<br />
<br />
Jeffrey A. Bader and Flynt L. Leverett, director of the China Initiative and Senior fellow at the Saban Institute for Middle East Policy, “Oil, the Middle East, and the Middle Kingdom,” Brookings Institute, 2005.<br />
<br />
China is already the…with China and India.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Link—Plan acts as an encroachment on China’s sphere of influence.<br />
<br />
Carl S. Murphy, Lieutenant Commander, United States Navy, “The Next Superpower,” GlobalSecurity.org, 1997.<br />
<br />
China’s overriding priorities for…that is going on.<br />
<br />
<br />
C. Internal Link—Perception of containment gives nationalists enough clout to invade Taiwan.<br />
<br />
Erich Marquardt, “China’s Distant Threat to U.S. dominance in Asia,” Power and Interest News, 9/8/2003.<br />
<br />
Besides, America desperately needs…China’s military even more.<br />
<br />
<br />
D. Impact—First, conflict over Taiwan escalates uncontrollably to US-China nuclear war.<br />
<br />
Richard K. Betts and Thomas J. Christensen, “China: getting the questions right,” National Interest, Winter 2000/2001.<br />
<br />
The possibility of war…U.S. commander-in-chief should run.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, US-China nuclear war destroys the planet<br />
<br />
Straits Times, “Regional Fallout,” June 25, 2000.<br />
<br />
THE high-intensity scenario postulates…sovereignty above everything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Consult Russia CP</strong><br />
<br />
Text: The United States Federal Government should enter into binding consultation with Russia over the plan. The United States will adopt Russia’s recommendations. We reserve the right to clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 1: Competition<br />
<br />
CP is mutually exclusive because you cannot guarantee the passage of plan and consult simultaneously.<br />
<br />
CP competes through net benefits.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Solvency<br />
<br />
<br />
First, the US is a critical ally for Russia—declining relations with Russia will lead to overextension of resources and global disaster. Russia is the only country willing of assisting in security measures in the Middle East—short and long-term cooperation with Russia over the Middle East is critical to regional stability.<br />
<br />
Dmitry Suslov, “US-Russia relations saved for now,” Yale Center for the Study of Globalization, 2005.<br />
<br />
Russia’s modernization is impossible…like occupation and state-building.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, Syrian and Iranian integration into the Iraq debate has spurred further possibilities for Russian involvement in the Middle East.<br />
<br />
Executive Intelligence Review, “Putin Defies Britain,” August 3, 2007.<br />
<br />
On crisis after crisis…overcoming the Iraqi crisis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, to repair our relations with Russia, we need transparency on political issues—consultation key.<br />
<br />
Stephen Sestanovich, “Russian-American Relations: Problems and Prospects,” Testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, May 17, 2007.<br />
<br />
In addressing those issues…once tried to build.<br />

<strong>Foucault K</strong><br />
<br />
A. The problem-solution framework of the 1AC expedites biopolitical domination of populations and guarantees perpetual policy failure.<br />
<br />
Michael Dillon and Julian Reid, “Global Governance, Liberal Peace, and Complex Emergency,” Alternatives, January/March 2000.<br />
<br />
As a precursor to…as Foucauldian “biopower” ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. The impact is extinction.<br />
<br />
Mitchell Dean, States of Imagination: Ethnographic Explorations of the Postcolonial State, 2001, p. 53-54.<br />
<br />
Consider again the contrastive…notice: “massacres become vital.”<br />
<br />
<br />
C. Alternative<br />
<br />
<br />
Vote negative to endorse imminent criticism of the logics founding the 1AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, criticism is necessary to reveal power’s true operations and prevent perpetual replication of biopolitical governance.<br />
