Observation One: The Status Quo.<br />
<br />
THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA IS NO LONGER THE PLAYGROUND OF THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT, BUT RATHER IT IS POPULATED BY COMPETING DISCOURSES WHICH LIE AT THE ROOT OF CONFLICT, ELEVATING STATE INTERACTION ABOVE DISCURSIVE INTERPLAY BACKFIRES, PRODUCING CHAOS AND WAR<br />
Dryzek 06. Deliberative Global Politics: Discourse and Democracy in a Divided World. Page 3.<br />
“discourses construct meaning….or even terrorists.”<br />
<br />
AND ISRAEL CONTINUES TO PLAY A DANGEROUS GAME – ON ONE HAND PROJECTING THE IMAGE THAT IT IS WILLING TO NEGOTIATE WHILE USING THE OTHER HAND TO CRUSH THE TWO-STATE SOLUTION AS SETTLEMENTS AND THE WALL HAVE HSATTERED PARTITION AS AN OPTION<br />
Abunimah 06. One country pages 51-54.<br />
“At the heart of the rarely….partition is unachievable.”<br />
<br />
AND, DELIBERATION ABOUT THE ISRAEL PALESTINE CONFLICT WILL CONTINUE TO SLIP OUT OF OUR GRASP AS LONG AS ISRAEL SETS THE TERMS OF THE DEBATE<br />
Mearsheimer and Walt 06. “The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy.”<br />
“Moreover, the Lobby’s campaign….important public issues.”<br />
<br />
AND THE SINGLE STATE SOLUTION IS ANATHEMA TO SUPPORTERS OF ISRAEL IN THE UNITED STATES<br />
Mearsheimer and Walt 07. “The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy.”<br />
Second, instead of separate….appropriate solution ourselves.”<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should extend an offer of conflict mediation to the Palestinian Authority by proposing to withdraw its support for the two state solution to the Israel Palestine conflict.<br />
<br />
Observation Two: The Advantage.<br />
<br />
A SINGLE STATE WILL INEVITABLY EMERGE – ATTEMPTTING TO DELAY THAT TRANSITION WILL RESULT IN A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO OF BLOODSHED AND GENOCIDE, OUR AFFIRMATIVE IS A NECESSARY FIRST STEP IN ISRAELI ACCEPTANCE OF THIS STARK RELATION<br />
Abunimah 06. One Country. Pages 171-73.<br />
“Any serious argument….Palestinian citizens within Israel.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AND SEVERING TIES WITH ISRAEL IS NECESSARY TO DEMOCRATIZE US FOREIGN POLICY AND BREAK THE INTELLECUTAL HEEGEMONY THAT WILL CAUSE ENDLESS IMPERIAL WARS AND THE EVENTUAL EXTERMINATION OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE<br />
Petras 06. The Power of Israel in the United States. Pages 14-15<br />
“The issues raised by….American well being.”<br />
<br />
AND, US CONDITIONS ON THE PALESTININAN AUTHORITY ARE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE THE TWO STATE SOLUTION AS A CHIMERA TO MAKS THE SYSTEMATIC EXTERMINATION OF THE PALESTIANINA PEOPLE, MEANINFUL DEBATE REQUIRES MOVING BEYOND BLAMING THE PALESTIANINS FOR THE ESCALTING VIOLENCE AND EXPOSING THE SUPPRESSION OF KNOWLEDGE THAT ISRAEL USES TO KEEP THE WORLD FROM INTERVENING<br />
Christison 07. Thoughts on the Attempted murder of Palestine.”<br />
“The Israeli-U.S. strategy…that Illan Pappe advocates.<br />
<br />
AND THAT EXTERMINATION IS PROGRESSING WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A WHIMPER FROM THE UNITED STAETS AS ISRAEL ENGAGES IN THE ELIMINATION OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE VIA A POLICY OF CONSCIOUS ECOLOGICAL DETERIORATION DESTROYING THE ENVIROMENT OF ALL OF ISRAEL IN THE PROCESS<br />
Kovel 07. Overcoming Zionism: Creating a Single Democratic State in Israel/Palestine. Pages 116-117.<br />
“Why an accelerant?....breakdown of Israel itself.”<br />
<br />
Observation Three: The Third Observation<br />
<br />
THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY IS FORCED TO PLAY THE US AND ISRAEL’S GAME – ENDLESSLY NEGOTIATING FROM AN INFERIOR POSSITION DESPITE A LACK OF INTENT ON THE PART OF THE ISRAELIS TO SETTLE THE CONFLICT, PALESTININANS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED WITH THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS AND ARE PUSHING FOR A ONE-STATE SOLUTION<br />
Christison 07. “Thoughts on the Attempted Murder of Palestine.”<br />
“When at the Camp David….clearly getting nowhere.”<br />
<br />
AND OUR AFFIRMATIVE SERVES AS A CRITICAL STARTING POINT TO DIALOGUE ABOUT THE ISRAEL-PALESTINE PROCESS, CASTING ASIDE THE TWO-STATE SOLUTION IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE CONFLICTS INEVITABLE ESCALATION AND KICKSTART THE DELIBERATIVE PROCESS<br />
Abunimah 06. One Country. Pages 183-184.<br />
“With the failure…change the landscape.”<br />
<br />
AND, WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS – AS OLD META-NARRATIVES DISSOLVE THERE IS DANGER AND OPPORTUNITY – DOMINANT ACTORS ARE SEEKIGN TO IMPOSE AUTHORITARIANISM IN THE NAME OF SECURITY BUT THE DISCURSIVE FIELD HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED, OUR AFFIRMATIVE INFUSES DELIBERATIVE ETHICS INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE ISRAEL-PALESTINE CONFLICT<br />
Dryzek 06. Deliberative Global Politics” Discourse and Democracy in a Divided World. Pages 22-25.<br />
“Constructivists are correct…name of global security.<br />
<br />
AND, EVERY ACT IN THE IR INCLUDES A DISCURSIVE COMPONENT, OUR AFFIRMATIVE EPITOMIZES THE DELIBERATIVE APPROACH, OPENING PATHWAYS FOR CHANGE<br />
Dryzek 06. Deliberative Global Politics”  Discourse and Democracy in a Divided World. Page 5.<br />
“Whether looking at negotiations….interests are embedded.”
