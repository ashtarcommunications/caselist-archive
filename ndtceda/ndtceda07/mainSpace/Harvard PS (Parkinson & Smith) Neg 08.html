Text: The United States federal government should initiate negotiations with Syria. In the negotiations, the initial move of the United States federal government’s negotiating strategy should be to offer to support and advocate for Israeli return of the Golan Heights to Syria if Syria engages in border cooperation. If Syria reciprocates and cooperates the United States federal government should further offer that it will assist the Syrian government with military to military contacts if Syria pledges to end its political logistical support of Hezbollah.<br />
