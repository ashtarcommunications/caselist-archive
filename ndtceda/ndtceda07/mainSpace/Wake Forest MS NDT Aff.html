1. Adding a condition is a voting issue<br />
A. aff ground- potential conditions are infinite and unrelated to the plan. they could pick anything and read an advantage about it . It’s artificially copemtitive and impossible to predict.<br />
B. Education- legitimizes any condition CP, including Greenland icebergs and Russian sales to Iran, detracting from topic education<br />
2. Afghanistan will say no – the Plan is already extremely controversial- adding conditions makes it politically unacceptable.<br />
Ron Synovitz, “strategic partnership seen as move toward de facto rights for U.S. Bases,” May 25, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2005/l05/mil-050525-rfer102.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.globalsecurity.org /military/library/news/2005 /l05/mil-050525-rfer102.htm__</a><br />

5.perm – do the plan but tell Afghanistan the condtions include</u> <u>.<br />
it’s a double bind:<br />
a. cp requires that Afghanistan is informed of the additional conditions, meaning it isn’t intrinsic<br />
