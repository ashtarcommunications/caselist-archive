<strong><u>Contention One—Defining the terrorists</u></strong><br />
<strong>Condileeza Rice once said:<br />
“When are we going to stop making excuses for the terrorists and saying that somebody is making them do it? No, these are simply evil people who want to kill . . . .This isn’t about some kind of grievance.”<br />
This quote is illustrative of the dangerous trend now driving US foreign policy. The United States harbors an essentialist view of Islamists—We see them all as backwards terrorists who hate our freedoms and seek to destroy the west. This ignorant and totalizing view ignores the real causes of violence and is hell bent on creating a clash of civilizations</strong><br />
Eliott 07 [Nicolas Elliott, The Future Geopolitical Legitimacy of Islamism: The Case of Hamas, HONORS THESIS Presented to the Honors Committee of Texas State University-San Marcos In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For Graduation in the Mitte Honors Program, May 2007]<br />
The emergence of <u>academic …dangerous by making “Islam” into an object. (2003: 59-60)</u><br />
<br />
<strong>Moreover, this essentialized view of Islam degrades an entire society and recalls the logic of colonization</strong><br />

TERRORISM, ORIENTALISM, AND THE ADVENT OF OSAMA BIN LADEN……crucial to the neocolonial effort.<br />
<br />
<strong>Nowhere is this essentialism more apparent than the struggle for palestinian liberation. Palestinian organisations are treated as though they are identical to Al quaeda, despite the fact that they are ideological opposites. This view is propaganda that only serves to encourage violence.</strong><br />

The Palestinian liberation, “you see, we said so all along. They really do hate us for our values. . .”<br />
<br />
<strong>More than just a massive policy failure, this response toward palestinian resistance is nothing short of genocidal</strong><br />
Falk, Professor of International alw and practice, Princeton University 2007 (Richard, Slouching towards a Palestinian Holeocaust, google it)<br />
One june 25, 2007 leaders… pledge of ‘never again’<br />
<br />
<strong>This failure to discriminate between palestinian liberation groups and terrorists like al quaeda has disastrous consequences. FIRST, It leads to genocidal violence as bush and sharon purge all those they determine to be “terrorists,” SECOND, it serves the interests of Al Quaeda by failing to understand the struggles of other groups, and, THIRD, it creates a state of emergency that violates civil liberties and treats the whole world as nothing more than potential terrorists to be destroyed</strong><br />
gregory 2004 [derek, Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East 24.1 (2004)]<br />
<u>It is hard to… we are all potentially Palestinians too</u>.<br />
<br />
<strong>It is foolish to think we can do away with a friend/enemy distinction, binary thinking, or the words that result from it</strong><br />
Rasch, 2005 (lines in the sand: enmity as a structuring principle’, south atlantic quarterly)<br />
Those deliberations centered on a…twentieth-century past.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Contention two-Israel</u></strong><br />
<strong>The US’s penchant for lumping Palestinians and Al Quaeda together destroys the israelie political left</strong><br />
Steinberg and Rynhold 04, (prof in political studies at Bar-Ilan university, “the peace process and the Israeli Elections” Israel affairs)<br />
Although the time-frame… in the peace process<br />
<strong>This has empowered Israeli Hardliners, who are encouraging virulent racism towards Palestinians</strong><br />
Barghouti 2006 (omar, doctoral student at tel aviv university. “the Israeli elections: a decisive vote for apartheid, april 03, znet)<br />
In sharp contrast to the… rise of Lieberman.<br />
<br />
<strong>Moreover, there can be no winner—this cycle of violent policy and violent reaction produces escalation that will eventually destroy Israel and Palestine</strong><br />
Carey, 2003 (roane, the south atlantic quarterly, fall 2003 “Palestine besieged: the threat of annihilation”)<br />
but the goal of defensive shield… of the entire region<br />
<br />
<strong>The U.S. has massive influence over Israeli politics—recognizing hamas makes hardliner politically unviable</strong><br />
Steinberg and Rynhold 04, (prof in political studies at Bar-Ilan university, “the peace process and the Israeli Elections” Israel affairs)<br />
The relationship between Jerusalem… in fact took place<br />
<br />
<strong>Plan:</strong><br />
<strong>The United states Federal Government should offer to recognize the elected Palestinian Legislative Council ( the government of Ismail Haniya) as the legitimate government of the Palestinian Authority and offer to declare an end to all regime change activities against the elected Palestinian Legislative Council.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>CONTENTION THREE—(Re)Definition</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Differentiating between territorial limited movments like Palestinian Liberation and the general “terrorist enemy” shatters the essentialism of the status quo</strong><br />
Eliott 07 [Nicolas Elliott, The Future Geopolitical Legitimacy of Islamism: The Case of Hamas, HONORS THESIS Presented to the Honors Committee of Texas State University-San Marcos In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For Graduation in the Mitte Honors Program, May 2007]<br />
Third Worldism versus Neo-Third Worldism <strong>…</strong>it can be brought to an end. (Strindberg and Warn 2005: 33)<br />
<strong>And, The US can solve—It shapes public awareness about terrorism<br />
Falk,</strong> Professor of International Law and Practise, Princeton University <strong>2002</strong><br />
