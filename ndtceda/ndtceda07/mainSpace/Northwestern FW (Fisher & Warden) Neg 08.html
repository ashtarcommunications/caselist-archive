Preventive War CP/Kritik:<br />
<br />
the crisis describe dhte by aff is a rehotrical crisis at its root. the manipulation of word choice is the crucial tactic for the triumph of bush’s delusional millennial ideology.<br />
<br />
specifically , we can’t legitime the term preventive war and accept eh neocon definiton of the terms of the debate – instead, it must be exposed as a war of aggression. accepting bush’s contrived terms cedes the broader ideological struggle, even as it engages the battle.<br />
Tom engelhardt, 10/9/2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://tomdispatch.com/index.mhtml?pid=128588" rel="nofollow">http://tomdispatch.com/index.mhtml?pid=128588</a><br />
&lt;George bush’s war of the words… category with preventive medicine.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
accepting the term “preventive war” buys into linguistic manipulation – it’s an attempt to hide the true nature of the wars of aggression. this obfuscation is crucial to the realization of administrations apocalyptic fantasy<br />
engelhardt, 7/16/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/101850" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/101850</a> <br />
&lt;the bush administaration… it was theirs alone?&gt;<br />

katamba  5 (francis, “English words: structure, history, usage, p. 190-1<br />
&lt; there is a particular … rather not confront&gt;<br />

&lt;our nation has... people act without moral compunction.&gt;<br />
<br />
Cp: The United States federal government should offer the government of Iran an agreement that the United State federal government will not engage in a strike of aggression against iran or engage in forcible regime change in exchange for a verifiable commitment from iran to only purse a civilian nuclear program.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
use of term preventive war is a self-fulfilling prophecy. it’s a semantic null set. its meaning negates itself but we’re deceived into think that the doctrine is acceptable doctrine to reconcile the cognitive dissonance created by the words themselves. we accept the reality of preventive war, surguical strikes or war <br />
This specific term impacts in fascism through the manipulation of language, the acceptability of global violence, and the nepoint impact of censorship through the evisceration of meaningful dialogue. <br />
<br />
each individual use of this term has genuine import<br />
<br />
the alt – of rejecting euphemistic term and substitution in the brutish or nake version –the cacophonism is the necessary semantic and political corrective.<br />
Attac France 3,  ATCK Weekly Newsletter – Wednesday newsletter – 05/03/03<br />
&lt;Are we talking about oxymora… is enough.&gt;<br />

Keller and MITchell 6 (William W. Keller, Gordon Mitchell, “Preventive Froce: Untangling the Discourse&gt;<br />
&lt;two words are sufficient…failure of comprehension.&gt;<br />

<br />
&lt;political rhetoric is not inherently.. difficult to define precisely&gt;<br />
<br />
confronting military euphemism is essential to accurate policy evaluation and the cultivation of appropriate military policy – voting negative does not abandon military force, it enables a more nuanced cost-benefit analysi<br />

COUNTERPLAN<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer the government of<br />
Iran a comprehensive settlement of diplomatic issues. The United<br />
States will offer<br />
- a security guarantee that commits to initiate or support the initiation of military force if and only if Iran attacks Israel<br />
- a commitment to end unilateral sanctions against Iran,<br />
- normalization of diplomatic relations,<br />
- a commitment to support Iran's application for accession to the<br />
World Trade Organization;<br />
- a commitment to terminate Iran's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism,<br />
- an agreement to the commencement of an ongoing strategic dialogue<br />
with Iran as a forum for assessing each side's implementation of its<br />
commitments<br />
in exchange for Iran's agreement to:<br />
- limit its nuclear fuel cycle activities to a delayed limited<br />
enrichment program. This should include inspections by the<br />
International Atomic Energy Agency, and a commitment to ratify and<br />
implement the Additional Protocol to the Nuclear Nonproliferation<br />
Treaty;<br />
- issue a statement expressing support for a just and lasting<br />
settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict;<br />
- work for Hezbollah's transformation into an exclusively political<br />
and social organization and to press Palestinian opposition groups to<br />
stop violent action;<br />
- an ongoing human rights dialogue with the United States;<br />
- stopping its provision of training, supplies, and funds to terrorist<br />
organizations as designated by the United States and supporting<br />
violence against the US and its allies; and<br />
- work with the United States to ensure the emergence of a stable,<br />
unitary, and democratic political order in Iraq.<br />
We solve the case much better: an Israeli security guarantee is the only way to renounce air strikes without an Israeli freakout destroying our diplomatic roomf for maneuver<br />

A. The Iranian-Us crisis is a rhetorical or representative problem at its root. Methodological prioritization of representations over supposedly objective facts is uniquely necessary in the context of Iranian policy. Attempts to engage Iran according to the terms of a neutral objectivity that discounts representations simply cedes the political field to neocon propaganda<br />

First, there is the reversal of the traditional …control, and engage the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
IMPACT CONSTRUCTION: Independent of plan mechanics, the absolute factual claims of their impact and timeframe create the emergency mentality they denounce – we simply don’t know the status of Iranian nuclear programs, but their assertions of CERTAINTY and ABSOLUTE PROBABILITY based on facts misrepresent the world to create the fear that upholds nuclear apartheid<br />

Jihad al binaa efforts in Lebanon are the crucial test case for the success of Islamic political movements for compassion globally—this transformation is the only lasting and effective alternative to cycles of American global annilihation and atrocity and this strategy’s success depends on explicitly disconnecting American influence on the transition here is the kicker – it is unique<br />

<u>Representations K</u><br />
<br />
Iranian-US crisis is a rhetorical or representative problem at its root. Methodological prioritization of representations over supposedly objective facts is uniquely necessary in the context of Iranian policy. Attempts to engage Iran according to the terms of a neutral objectivity that discounts representations simply cedes the political field to neocon propaganda<br />
Adib-Moghaddam, April 07, Third World Quarterly, v. 28, iss 3, 635-53<br />

Turns the case – Orientalist mystique of nuclear weapons drives Mideast prolif, regional states absorb and internalize Western nuclear hierarchies, driving their desire to move on up<br />
Hill, 8-30-7, dialogue.globalmajority.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=57&amp;amp;Itemid=99<br />
The debate about weapons of mass and presupposes legitimate possessors<br />
<br />
Independent of plan mechanisms – absolute factual claims of their impact and timeframe create the emergency mentality they denounce. We simply don’t know the status of Iranian nuclear programs, but their assertion of certainty and absolute probability based on facts misrepresent the world to create the fear that upholds nuclear aparatheid<br />
Izadi, April 07, J. of Comm Inquiry, v. 31, no. 2<br />
Despite the certainty with which and an event in the near future<br />
<br />
Demonization of Iran through neoconservative prolif rhetoric justifies the logic of endless interventions and a Fourth World War. This outweighs the case by ensuring the continual replication of multiple structurally parallel scenarios<br />
Adib-Moghaddam, same<br />
But the empirical evidence suggests that and liberation of mankind<br />
<br />
Alternative – we can reject the pressure on Iran as the root cause of prolif, as delineated by their case, without embracing the violent managerialism or the encoded racial hierarchy of their nuclear emergency representation. This strategy would denounce the dangers of nuclear weapons universally, without assuming the arrogant and Orientalist position of making differential determinations of responsibility for mass destruction<br />

An offer is a commitment that’s conditioned upon a specific behavioral change or pledge by the receiver – there must be an option to accept or reject<br />

Precision – constructive as conditioned’s the crucial meaning maker for every key resolutional term – alternative interpretations consign us to shallow debates about the general elements of engagement while sacrificing the core question of constructive engagement’s desirability, precision’s uniquely key in this instance to avoid the traditional confusion that plagues engagement scholarship<br />
Capie and Evans, 02, Asia-Pacific Security Lexicon, 113-4<br />
Third, engagement increasingly appears in the literature and often blurred in practice<br />
<br />
Predictable ground – unconditional engagement allows any policy of non-isolation to substitute as constructive. Incetivizes tiny assistance swaps with no unifying US requirement. Conditioned is key to neg tests of core engagement mechanisms and privilege neg ground claims early in the year, generics are key<br />
<br />
This interpretation’s crucial to give both constructive and government to government meaning – allowing unconditional engagement shreds grammatical precision and allows any modicum of non-isolation to substitute for constructive engagement<br />
