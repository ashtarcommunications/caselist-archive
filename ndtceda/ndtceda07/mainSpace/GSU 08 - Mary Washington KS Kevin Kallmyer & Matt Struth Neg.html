Round # 5<br />

Judge: Rachel Saloom<br />

Case Args:<br />
No solvency – the US will just shift its subsidies to new forms of ag support – empirically proven<br />
Oxfam, 11/22/2005<br />
(“Oxfam: US farm subsidies offer ‘smoke and mirrors’”)<br />
<br />
Turn: AFF causes TNC shift, triggering poverty and environmental destruction<br />
Gonzalez, Seattle University Law Professor, 2004<br />
(Carmen G. “Symposium: Whither goes Cuba? Prospects for Economic and Social Development Part II of II: Trade Liberalization, Food Security, and the Environment: The Neoliberal Threat to Sustainable Rural Development, Transnational Law &amp; contemporary Problems, 14 Transnat’l Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 419, lexis)<br />
“The elimination of U.S. and EU…case necessary for sustainable agricultural production.”<br />
<br />
Turn – Expanding animal protection fails to lead to animal rights – more animals will be killed in other ways and plan leads to expanding opposition<br />
Joseph Lubinski, University of Colorado School of Law JD candidate, Summer 03, University of Colorado Law Review, “THE COW SAYS MOO, THE DUCK SAYS QUACK, AND THE DOG SAYS VOTE”, 74, U. Colorado Law Review, 1109, lexis)<br />
“In addition to these structural limits….the ear of the legislature.”<br />
<br />
Can’t solve animal rights – rollback<br />

Kritik fails – Suppressing language does not suppress concepts – other words will develop that mirror these abuses<br />
Timothy Bewes, Liverpool John Moores University Post doctoral Fellow in Literature and Cultural History, 1997, “Cynicism and Postmodernity”, p. 48)<br />
“In this light, to begin….exactly the same catachrestic abuses.”<br />
<br />
Turn – The kritik fails and drives discourse underground – censorship does not change attitudes, causing a shift to the private sphere where linguistic and physical violence become inevitable<br />
Gay, UNCC Philosophy Professor, 1998<br />
(William “The practice of linguistic nonviolence”, www.philosophy.uncc.edu/wcgay/publingnonvio.htm)<br />
“The pacific discourse that is ….outburts of linguistic violence and physical violence.”<br />

Politics 1NC<br />
Obama will win – Palin’s momentum is over, McCain needs to rejuvenate his previous momentum<br />
CNN, 9/18/2008<br />
(“Palin excitement levels off as Democrats regain lead”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/18/palin.appeal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/18/palin.appeal/</a>)<br />
“Is Amerca’s honeymoon with Sarah….McCain could still recapture it.”<br />

Link – Cutting farm subsidies is critical to conservative turnout – renews the image of small government<br />
Tanner, CATO Welfare Studies Director, 11/20/1007<br />
(Michael, “What if economic conservatives stay home on Election Day?”, http:www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8806)<br />
“There is no doubt that….start talking to them today.”<br />
<br />
This will be a turnout election – McCain’s appeal to economic conservatives is key<br />
Henninger, WSJ staff writer, 7/31/2008<br />
(Daniel, “Is John McCain stupid?”)<br />
“Yesterday he was in Aurora, Colo….the fall. He will lose”<br />
<br />
I – Obama win key to US leadership – only a complete repudiation of the Bush politics revives international credibility and commitments<br />
Heinbecker, CIGI Distinguished Fellow, 8/23/2008<br />
(Paul, “Election of Obama would signal serious change for US.; Most of the world prefers someone who represents a clear break from the Bush years”)<br />
“On the eve of the Democratic….are right to prefer him.”<br />
<br />
CP<br />
The United States federal government should &lt;insert plan mandates&gt;, while maintaining agricultural support for individual recipients of subsidies whom earn less than $250,000 annual income per year, and end the “three entity” rule.<br />
<br />
Observation 1: Competition<br />
The plan and counterplan are mutually exclusive, any permutation would sever out of the plan’s complete removal of subsidies<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Solvency<br />
An effective payment cap on subsidies solves the case and leads to a broader ag reform – resolves US trade commitments, dumping, and family farm collapse<br />
Perera, Oxfam America, 2/15/2005<br />
(Andrea, “Rural America Preservation Act Helps Farmers Here and Abroad”)<br />
“Oxfam America and a diverse….compliance problems with world trade rules.”<br />
<br />
Ending the three entity rule solves loopholes<br />
Thomisee, NPCA Campaign Coordinator, Fall 2005<br />
(Jayne, “The Cotton Debate”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldviewimagemagazine.com/issues/article.cfm?id=163&amp;issue=39" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldviewimagemagazine.com/issues/article.cfm?id=163&amp;issue=39</a>)<br />
