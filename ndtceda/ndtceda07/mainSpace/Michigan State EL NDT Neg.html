Conditions CP – condition that government of Afghanistan agrees to a more ambitious medium – term fiscal framework, including a commitment to increase domestic revenue mobilization targets.<br />
It competes- offers aid in less instances than the aff – any permutation severs the certainty of the plan’s offer<br />
World Bank Report ’05 [ Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Sector Unit, “Afghanistan: Managing Public Finances for Development – Vol. One: Main Report” Dec. 22]<br />
Afghanistan is at risk of becoming perpetually dependent on a foreign aid tap that will eventually turn off – the counterplan’s condition puts US aid to better use by ensuring that implementation will build government fiscal capacity<br />

“Sustainability of expenditures…or detracting from it”<br />
Increased foreign aid widens the GDP to revenue rato – reducing this ratio is key<br />
Same source<br />
“extremely low domestic revenue…ratio are imperative”<br />
Absent the counterplan’s condition, the plan wrecks Afghan progress towards fiscal sustainability<br />

B) Violation: the plan does not place conditions on Afghanistan<br />
<br />
C) Reasons to Prefer<br />
<br />
Predictable Ground—the affirmative fiats out of our best case arguments which center on the response of the recipient country—without yes/no we cannot debate the desirability of the plan in relation to topic countries- they also exclude the CP to just increase foreign assistance without any constructive engagement – which is core negative ground on the topicality<br />
Topic education- the term constructive engagement was added for a reason- ignoring the criteria for constructive engagement moots the root of the topic which destroys specific education<br />
<br />
D) voting issue- competitive equity and jurisdiction<br />

 Capitalism Kritik<br />
Pedagogy-extend the Smith ev-their pedagogy of the oppressed represents the most dangerous form of identity politics because it assumes that only individual oppressed groups can know the best method of resisting oppression-this ideology creates a direct tradeoff with the struggle of capitalism<br />
Fragmentation-politics of the oppressed cannot effectively counter oppression-the only lead to disintegration this ideology makes those outside their notion of oppression enemies<br />
Smith, leading member of the US int’l Socialist Org, 1994, Sharon, International Socialism 62 Spring<br />
“The politics of…Culture, Social Movements”<br />
Scapegoat-Competition amongst groups creates a false consciousness which allows violence against the other and prevents struggle against capital<br />
Smith, leading member of the US int’l Socialist Org, 1994, Sharon, International Socialism 62 Spring<br />
“Without the counterweight…stronger, firmer, mightier”<br />
Divisions-their pedagogy of the oppressed leads to bitter divisions<br />
Smith, leading member of the US int’l Socialist Org, 1994, Sharon, International Socialism 62 Spring<br />
“The underlying assumption…into organizational splits”<br />
Pedagogy: The affirmative is the most dangerous form of identity politics-their argument that we must engage only pedagogies of the oppressed assumes that only the oppressed can define their oppression-this is disastrous because it denies the possibility of coalition building which is essential to any progressive struggle against capitalism<br />
Smith, leading member of the US int’l Socialist Org, 1994, Sharon, International Socialism 62 Spring<br />
“Among many people…a common struggle”<br />
Capitalism is the root cause of all oppression-only our criticism can solve for broader forms of oppression<br />

The European Union will offer any necessary mediation services to facilitate these talks, including facilitation to establish a new unity government for the Palestinian Authority. The European Union will formally announce that they recognize a significant difference between the Hamas organization and its representatives in the elected Palestinian Legislative Council (the government of Ismail Haniya) and AlQaeda. The announcement will include a recognition that the European Union is willing to work with a Palestinian government that includes representatives of Hamas.<br />
