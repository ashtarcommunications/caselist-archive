Consult Saudi CP<br />
We offer the following counterplan: <br />
Prior to adoption of the plan, the United States will initiate a process of binding consultation with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and will propose that: <br />
(insert plan) <br />
During consultation, the U.S. will advocate the adoption of this proposal, but will allow the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to propose modifications and alternate solutions. The U.S. will adopt and implement per the results of consultation. Funding and enforcement are provided. We reserve the right to clarify. <br />
<strong>Observation One: Theory</strong> <br />
A. Consultation is legitimate.  <br />
Consultation counterplans are necessary to focus debate and make the affirmative justify the entirety of the plan. Specific literature, grounding in the real world of diplomatic policy options, and the clear net benefit warrant the legitimacy of the counterplan.<br />
B. Affirmative conditionality is illegitimate.  <br />
The Affirmative is bound to the immediacy, permanence, and unalterability of the plan established in the 1AC and the cross examination. If the plan is a conditional moving target it distorts competitive equity in the aff’s favor by mking it impossible to win disad links and counterplan competition. All severance and intrinsicness permutations should be rejected.<br />
<strong>Observation Two: Not topical</strong> <br />
The word resolved means “to make a firm decision.” The counterplan allows for policy changes to occur.  <br />
<strong>Observation Three: Competition.</strong> <br />
A. Mutually exclusive. The 1AC established the immediate and unconditional implementation of the plan. Any permutation that solves our net benefit is a severance permutation and is a voting issue to preserve stable and predictable negative ground established by the 1AC.<br />
<strong>B. Net Benefits</strong> <br />
<strong>First—Lack of prior consultation hurts bilateral relations</strong>  <br />
<strong>Financial Times</strong>, 3-13-<strong>04</strong> (“US scraps Middle East reform initiative,” p. lexis)<br />
<strong><u>Under pressure from Arab</u></strong> and European<u><strong>...</strong></u> <strong><u>wanting to impose reforms without <a name="ORIGHIT_4"></a><a name="HIT_4"></a>consultation</u>.</strong> <br />

The second matter, and far more grave in ...dollar collapse, and this is not a minor, minor matter. <br />
<br />
<strong>Third—Economic collapse causes nuclear war and extinction</strong><br />

US-EU Relations BAD DA<br />
A. Uniqueness and Internal Link: Disagreement in Middle East policy is a prime cause of bad US-EU relations, and these relations spill over into other areas.<br />
Kupchan, 2007 <br />

<strong><u>The</u></strong> <strong><u>Middle East</u></strong> <strong><u>has long been a potent source ..</u></strong><strong><u>. a major role in the erosion of transatlantic amity in the post–cold war era.</u></strong><br />
<br />
B. Impact: 1. Low U.S.-EU relations drive the strengthening of ESDP.<br />
Brenner, ’02<br />
[Michael, Pittsburgh international relations professor<strong>,</strong> Europe’s New Security Vocation, McNair Paper 66, CIAO]<br />
<strong><u>The more upset allied governments are by ...</u></strong> points of view. ESDP could make a difference. <br />
<br />
2. ESDP solves for multiple global problems and wars—and alleviates specific instances of proliferation and terrorism. <br />

<strong>B) Links—</strong> <br />
<strong>First—the plan is politically popular and builds political momentum for Bush</strong> <br />
<strong>Bush endorsing constructive engagement in the</strong> <strong>Middle East</strong> <strong>is politically popular and brings bipartisan support in congress</strong> <br />
<strong>Rubin</strong>, 7-20- <strong>07</strong> (Trudy, &quot;Up to GOP to show Bush the way out,&quot; The Philadelphia Inquirer, p. lexis) <br />
&quot;So if Iraqis can't help themselves, you <u><strong>...</strong></u> <strong><u>take a wholehearted and public commitment by you.&quot;</u></strong> <br />
<strong>Second—Bush needs political momentum to pass LOST through congress</strong>  <br />
