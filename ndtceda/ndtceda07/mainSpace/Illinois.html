<strong><u>Syria Aff</u></strong><br />
<strong>Proclamation one: The story so far</strong><br />
<strong>Bush policy toward Syria is isolationist now</strong><br />
<strong><u>Hassan 2007</u></strong><br />
(Farrah, The Washington Post, “How to Deal With Syria”, 8/1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR2007073101771.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com /wp-dyn/content/article/2007 /07/31/AR2007073101771.html</a>)<br />
&lt; President <u>Bush has not formulated a coherent Syria policy</u> that has short-, medium- and long-term objectives. <u>Instability in Iraq, political tensions in Lebanon and occupied Palestine, and the dispute over the Golan Heights represent not just arenas of conflict but areas of potential U.S.-Syrian cooperation. Instead of discussing these concerns with Syria, the Bush administration has sought to isolate the Assad regime</u>, which raises a larger question worth the attention of Americans: How has isolating Syria enhanced U.S. interests in the Middle East? Without addressing this, the question of whether or not to engage with Syria loses meaning.<br />
<br />
<strong>Proclamation two: The obvious solution</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Plan: The United States Federal Government will increase its constructive engagement with the government of Syria by offering a security guarantee including a guarantee not to initiate or support a regime change in Syria and a promise of diplomatic cooperation on Syrian national security issues. We reserve the right to clarify.</strong><br />

<strong>Proclamation three: The benefits are endless</strong><br />
<strong>Part I: Preventing a nuclear war between Israel and Hamas</strong><br />
<strong>War between Hamas and Israel is imminent</strong><br />
<strong>YANIV</strong> ZOHAR, <strong>2007</strong><br />
Associated Press Writer<br />
<strong>A Palestinian rocket exploded Monday next to a day care center crowded with toddlers in southern Israel, sparking anger and panic</strong> in the frequently targeted town of Sderot <strong>and bringing warnings of retribution from Israeli leaders</strong>. No one was hurt, but the blast and <strong>the panic underlined Israel's ineffectiveness in the face of the primitive rockets, which fall daily</strong> despite frequent Israeli airstrikes and occasional ground offensives. Terrified mothers rushed to comfort their screaming babies, schoolchildren ran for cover, and angry parents said they wouldn't send their children back to school until they get classrooms outside town. <strong>Prime Minister</strong> Ehud <strong>Olmert pledged to provide &quot;better security for the residents</strong>,&quot; indicating he would step up the Israeli offensive against Palestinian militants. &quot;We will not limit ourselves in regards to targeting the rocket launchers and those who dispatch them,&quot; Olmert said at a news conference in Jerusalem. &quot;<strong>The instruction given to the army is to destroy every 'Qassam' rocket launcher and anyone who is involved in their launching against the residents of Israel</strong>.&quot; <strong>Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for launching seven rockets</strong> at Sderot. <strong>Hamas,</strong> the larger Islamic group that rules Gaza, <strong>was bracing for retaliation</strong>. <strong>&quot;We are taking this new threat by Olmert seriously,&quot; Hamas spokesman</strong> Taher Nunu <strong>said</strong>. &quot;<strong>We are warning of coming massacres against the people in Gaza.</strong> &quot;Hamas overran Gaza in June, vanquishing forces loyal to moderate President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah. <strong>Hamas</strong>, which does not recognize Israel and has sent dozens of suicide bombers into the Jewish state, <strong>has made no effort to stop the rocket barrages, instead joining in with its own rocket squads</strong>. Sderot, a working-class town of 22,000, has been battered by thousands of the crude projectiles launched in recent years from the Gaza Strip, just a mile away. The unguided rockets rarely cause serious injuries or damage, but they sow panic. On Monday, rockets exploded near several schools in town, just a day after the school year began. Images of students ducking into shelters, young schoolchildren wailing uncontrollably, and teachers shielding terrified toddlers with their own bodies outraged parents… Katar said.<strong>Mayor</strong> Eli <strong>Moyal has long called for a full scale ground invasion of Gaza to root out the rocket launchers. On Monday, he got some support</strong> from Tzachi Hanegbi, <strong>chairman of</strong> parliament's powerful <strong>Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee, who said Israel had to seriously consider the option. &quot;At some stage, decided by Israel, there will be no choice but to wage a campaign in the Gaza Strip,&quot;</strong> he told Army Radio.<br />
<br />
<strong>Syria key to hamas military operations</strong><br />
<strong>CNSNews, 07</strong><br />
<strong>Israeli officials blamed Syria for the Beersheva attack</strong>, in which 16 Israelis were murdered. They said the Hamas leadership in <strong>Damascus had orchestrated that attack</strong> and press reports named Khalil as the director of that attack. Israel has targeted various terrorists and Hamas leaders in air strikes in the Gaza Strip and West Bank -- including Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and his successor Abdel Aziz Rantisi earlier this year -- but this is the first such hit inside Syria. Deputy Defense Minister Ze'ev <strong>Boim described Syria on Monday as the &quot;central intersection&quot; for terrorism. He compared Assad to the &quot;traffic officer&quot; who was directing the operations and giving refuge to terror groups. &quot;Syria is responsible for directing terrorism against us</strong>, and therefore it is not immune from our operations to prevent terrorism,&quot; Boim said in a radio interview. &quot;This is a central thing that needs to be said. The principle should be clear: Anyone who strikes at Israel, any partner to terrorism that sows murder and death of Israelis here, his blood be on his own head, and it will be the same whether he is operating in Israel or abroad,&quot; said Boim. After the double bus bombing, there were indications that Israel would strike in Syria. Some analysts said that Assad apparently had not gotten the message when Israeli jets buzzed his palace last year and later bombed what Israel described as a terrorist training field outside Damascus. Dr. Ely Karmon, from the International Policy Institute on Counter Terrorism at the Interdisciplinary Center near Tel Aviv, said that killing Khalil was intended as a &quot;double message&quot; both to Damascus and to Hamas. &quot;The message to Syria is more important than the message to Hamas,&quot; Karmon said. &quot;Syria is the main threat on the terrorist front against Israel in the international arena,&quot; Karmon said. Damascus gives a &quot;strategic umbrella&quot; to the Iranian-backed Hizballah, which has started giving logistical and operational help to Palestinian terror groups and increasingly is involved in keeping Hamas and Fatah cells &quot;on a level contrary to Israeli interests,&quot; Karmon said…The U.S. has been pressing Syria for more than a year to close down the 10 or so offices of Palestinian terrorist organizations, including Hamas, based in the Syrian capital. After Israeli threats against the Hamas leadership after the August terror attack, the two most senior Hamas officials Khaled Mashaal - who himself survived an Israeli assassination attempt on his life in Jordan several years ago -- and his deputy Musa Abu Marzuk left the country. They are believed to be in Tehran.Syria is under pressure for allegedly opening its borders to ease the movement of militants into Iraq to fight against U.S.-led forces there.According to Karmon, the U.S. and Europeans are also worried about Syrian weapons of mass destruction projects, including work on a nuclear project.<br />

<strong>Syria only supports Hamas because of American isolationist policies</strong><br />
Julie <strong>Stahl, 2007</strong><br />
Jerusalem Bureau Chief, CNSN News<br />
<strong>Increasingly isolated by the international community, Iran, Syria and Hamas are strengthening ties with each other in order to challenge the West</strong>, said Israeli prime ministerial spokesman Dr. Ra'anan Gissin. The Palestinian Authority is now dominated by Hamas, which has direct ties to Tehran, Gissin noted. Following a conference last week in Tehran, Iran's Islamic regime pledged $50 million to the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority. Iran has ties to more than 40 terrorist organizations around the world, including the Hizballah in Lebanon and Islamic Jihad, which is the proxy of Iran in the Palestinian territories, said Gissin.<strong>Terror activities in the Palestinian territories go through Damascus, said Gissin, while &quot;Iran continues to call the shots.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>The next attack on Israel will lead to global nuclear war.</strong><br />
<strong>Steinbach 2002</strong><br />
(John, Hiroshima/Nagasaki Peace Committee, March, “Israel Weapons of Mass Destruction: A Threat to Peace”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.global/" rel="nofollow">http://www.global</a> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://research.ca/articles/STE203A.html" rel="nofollow">research.ca/articles/STE203A .html</a>)<br />
Meanwhile, the existence of an arsenal of mass destruction in such an unstable region in turn has serious implications for future arms control and disarmament negotiations, and even the threat of nuclear war. Seymour Hersh warns, “<strong><u>Should</u></strong> war break out in the Middle East again … or <u>should any Arab nation fire missiles against Israel</u>, as the Iraqis did, <u>a nuclear escalation</u>, once unthinkable except as a last resort, <u>would now be a strong possibility</u>,” (41) and Ezar Weissman, Israel’s current President said “The nuclear issue is gaining momentum (and the) next war will not be conventional.”(42) Russia and before it the Soviet Union has long been a major (if not the major) target of Israeli nukes. It is widely reported that the principle purpose of Jonathan Pollard’s spying for Israel was to furnish satellite images of Soviet targets and other super sensitive data relating to U.S. nuclear targeting strategy.(43) (Since launching its own satellite in 1988, Israel no longer needs U.S. spy secrets.) <u>Israel nukes aimed at the Russian heartland seriously complicate disarmament and arms control negotiations and, at the very least, the unilateral possession of nuclear weapons by Israelis enormously destabilizing, and dramatically lowers the threshold for their actual use, if not all out nuclear war</u>. In the words of Mark Gaffney, “…if the familiar pattern (Israel refining its weapons of mass destruction with U.S. complicity) is not reversed soon – for whatever reason – <u>the deepening Middle Eastern conflict could trigger a world conflagration</u>.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Part II: Breaking the Syrian-Iranian Axis</strong><br />
<strong>Syria and Iran are tied together in a dangerous alliance which funds and supports terrorism, including Hezbollah, and the development of Iranian nukes</strong><br />
<strong><u>Molin, 05</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>(Carol Devine; February 23; “The Unholy Alliance Between Iran and Syria”; GOPUSA; htt<a name="0.1_01000001"></a>p:<em>www.gopusa.com/commentary /cmolin/2005/cdm_02231.shtml;</u></strong> BA in psychology from McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and an MA in forensic psychology (social psychology) from John Jay College of Criminal Justice (CUNY) in New York City.)<br />
<strong><u>But, Iraq aside, these</u></strong> <u>outlaw regimes are destabilizing the entire region in pivotal ways: Iran is developing nuclear weaponry, systematically gaming and refusing to halt its program; and as the premier terror state of the Middle East -- the most prolific supporter of terrorism -- it also lends a helping-hand to Hezbollah and a variety of other terror groups in the region. As for Syria,</u> it has ensconced its troops in Lebanon for the past fifteen years, creating a suffocating occupation that is now being diligently protested by the Lebanese; and it <u>provides funding, training and safe haven for Hamas and Hezbollah (and other) terrorists, which utilize southern Lebanon as a launching pad for attacks upon Israel.</u> <strong><u>Recently, Iran and Syria have vowed a &quot;united front&quot; against the political and economic</u></strong> <u>pressures being brought to bear by the United States and other western nations. As noted by the Associated Press, &quot;'In view of the special conditions faced by Syria, Iran will transfer its experience, especially concerning sanctions, to Syria'</u><strong><u>, Mohammad Reza Aref, Iran's first vice president, was quoted as saying after meeting Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Naji Otari&quot;. Collusion between these two terror states is nothing new.</u> Iran and Syria have had a close cooperative relationship dating back more than twenty years with the advent of Iranian rule by fanatical cleric Ayatollah Khomeini and his establishment of the Hezbollah terror organization. Sure, Hezbollah has political and social service components operating in Syria, which are always underscored by European appeasers and Leftists. But</strong> Hezbollah clearly engages in vile terror activities as well. <strong>As scholar Michael Ledeen indicated in his book &quot;The War Against the Terror Masters</strong> &quot;Khomeini created one of the most dangerous international terrorist groups, Hezbollah, and Assad (Hafez al-Assad of Syria) supported it with many of the same favors&quot;<u>. Both Iran and Syria continue to back Hezbollah terrorists that are surrogates for these rogue regimes.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Engaging Syria is all we need to break the Iran-Syria alliance</strong><br />
<strong>Koogler 2007</strong><br />
(Jebediah, journalist, Brown Daily Herald, “U.S. should negotiate with Syria”, 3/7, p. LN)<br />
<u>Talking with Syria is long overdue. In the face of the escalating violence in Iraq, an increasingly unstable Lebanon and the rise of Hezbollah and Iran as formidable regional actors, the fact that the Bush administration has refused to seriously engage with the Syrian government is a strategic blunder of monumental proportions</u>. Therefore, the recent decision by the Bush administration to participate in talks with the Syrian government, albeit indirectly, is a decision that should be applauded. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who made the announcement last week, indicated that the United States would sit down at the same table with Syrian officials during a regional conference scheduled for March 10. The conference, which is being organized by the Iraqi government, will not involve any one-on-one discussion between the United States and Syria, but hopefully it might lead to such an outcome. The issues at hand are complicated and numerous but, if done correctly, <u>the possibility of successful negotiations with Syria is high</u>. <br />
First, <u>the United States needs to convince the government of</u> Bashar <u>al-Assad to give up its partnership with Tehran. This is a lot easier than one might imagine. Here's why: The alliance between Syria and Iran is an uneasy one that was forged primarily out of necessity. Both governments have dramatically different goals, and their association seems primarily to be an attempt to counter the threat of increased American influence in the region</u>. Many Middle Eastern experts argue that <u>pulling Syria away from Iran and enticing it into a closer, more cooperative relationship with the United States</u> would not be impossible if Syria were presented with the right incentives. <u>With a serious discussion about its security concerns</u> and offers of economic aid, <u>Damascus might</u>, the theory goes, <u>be willing to turn its back on Tehran.</u> Second, the Bush administration must urge Assad's government to forgo its strategic alliance with Hezbollah. While Hezbollah is useful to Damascus in the short term, the goals of the Shiite group are quite different than those of the secular government of Syria. Despite Syria's ties to Hezbollah, its involvement with the organization is primarily a way of exerting pressure on the Israeli government. With the right incentives -- negotiations about the future of the Golan Heights, for example, <strong>a</strong>nd security guarantees from Israel and the United States -- Syria might be enticed to drop its support for Hezbollah.<br />
<br />
<strong>A nuclear Iran will lead to a nuclear war between Israel and Iran</strong><br />
Peter <strong>Brooks</strong>. The Heritage Foundation, <strong>2004</strong><br />
<strong>To many nations</strong>, especially Israel, <strong>it seems only a matter of time before Iran breaks out as a nuclear power, ratcheting up tension across the Middle East. An Israel-Iran showdown over Tehran's outlaw nuclear-weapons program now seems increasingly imminent</strong>. Last week, for example, <strong>Israel</strong> charged that Iran was merely &quot;buying time&quot; and will never abandon plans to develop nuclear weapons. It <strong>called for the U.N. Security Council &quot;to put an end to this nightmare</strong>.&quot; Addressing reporters at the U.N., Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom kept all options on the table by avoiding answering whether Israel would take military action against Iran if it continued to pursue nuclear weapons. Also <strong>last week, the administration informed Congress that it was selling Israel 5,000 precision-guided &quot;smart bombs</strong>,&quot; including 500 satellite-guided, one-ton JDAM &quot;bunker busters&quot; of Baghdad fame. (JDAMs are capable of penetrating six feet of concrete.) In response to the arms sale, <strong>Iran warned Israel</strong> against attacking its nuclear facilities, <strong>saying it would react &quot;most severely&quot; to any Israeli military action against Iran</strong>. Then, over the weekend, Iran pointedly announced that its Shahab-3 ballistic missile was now operational. The missile can reach Israel, and Iran has 25 to 100 of them. Defense Minister Ali Shamkhrani crowed that Iran was now &quot;ready to confront all regional [read: Israeli] and extra-regional [read: American] threats.&quot; So what would happen if Israel decided to conduct a pre-emptive surgical strike on Iran's nuclear facilities? Some say that an Israeli attack on a Muslim country would set the Middle East ablaze in an anti-Jewish frenzy. Possible, but not likely. No Arab country would strike back at Israel, but Iran's Lebanese terrorist proxy, Hezbollah, would almost certainly target Israeli (and perhaps U.S.) interests in the region. <strong>Iran itself could decide to retaliate on Israeli cities with missile strikes. And while Israel has a limited missile defense system, missiles raining in on Tel Aviv, a city of 3 million, could be devastating. But Israel could threaten to respond to Iranian strikes on Israeli civilian targets with nuclear weapons.</strong> Tehran might, as well, put Damascus under its new nuclear umbrella or, worse yet, give Syria the bomb. (Happily, even Iran's likely to see giving a nuke to Hezbollah as way too risky.)<br />
<br />
<strong>Part III: Ensuring peace in Iraq</strong><br />
<strong>A security guarantee would end Syrian militant presence in Iraq</strong><br />
<strong>Koogler 2007</strong> <br />
(Jebediah, journalist, Brown Daily Herald, “U.S. should negotiate with Syria”, 3/7, p. LN)<br />
&lt; Finally, <u>Syria's role in the Iraqi insurgency is of much concern to Washington and could also be dealt with diplomatically. While the Syrian government allegedly allows militants to enter into Iraq across the country's eastern border, any involvement that it might have in its neighbor's civil war comes from the fear that if American troops are not bogged down in Iraq</u>, the <u>Bush</u> administration <u>might turn to Syria as its next target for regime change. A U.S. guarantee not to threaten Syria could go a long way in convincing Assad's government to take a more positive role in Iraq's reconstruction</u>. &gt;<br />
<strong>Syrian backed insurgents are the driving force behind the war in Iraq</strong><br />
Zalmay <strong>Khalilzad, 05</strong><br />
U.S. Ambassador to Iraq<br />
<strong>One key</strong> other <strong>factor that links to the initial point that I made with regard to security is the role of external players, particularly Syria. People are coming out from Syria to Iraq. People are coming from other parts of the region to Syria, whether it's to Damascus</strong> or whether it's to Latakia, whether it's to Aleppo, <strong>and then from there, they come to Iraq to kill Iraqis</strong>. The vision of these people, the Zarqawi people, for Iraq is not a democratic, unified, self-reliant, successful Iraq. It's an Iraq that's very much what we saw in Afghanistan under the Taliban -- an Islamic caliphate with a dark vision to take the region back, where women will not have the right to vote, where there will be no democracy, where there will be a center of international terror in a rich, powerful country. That's their vision. And <strong>Syria is allowing forces to advocate that, who</strong> want to <strong>prevent Iraq from succeeding to come across</strong>. Our patience is running out with Syria. They need to decide: <strong>Are they going to be with a successful Iraq or are they going to be an obstacle to the success of Iraq</strong>? Iraq will succeed. Iraq will succeed. Syria has to decide what price it's willing to pay in making Iraq success difficult. And time is running out for Damascus to decide on this issue…Well, I would not like to elaborate any more than that. I think they'll -- they should understand what I mean. It simply is not tolerable that <strong>they,</strong> with impunity, can <strong>allow terrorists to come from other countries in the region, get training or just either pass through</strong> -- or Baathists want to have the old order returned, get trained in places like Latakia or Aleppo or near Damascus <strong>and then come across the border, kill Iraqis and pursue policies or actions that are unhelpful to the success of Iraq</strong>. As I said, our patience is running out; the patience of Iraqis are running out. The time for decision is arriving -- has arrived for Damascus. It simply must close the training camps. It should not allow youngsters, misguided by al-Qaida, from Saudi Arabia, from Yemen, from North Africa, to fly into Damascus International Airport. It shouldn't be that hard, if you see young men between the ages of 18 and 28, who are coming without a return ticket, landing in Damascus Airport, to control that. If they cannot control that, if they need help to control inflow and processing of people, well, they should ask for help. I'm sure help can be provided. But it's gone on for too long and it simply needs to be dealt with.<br />

[The tragedy is that even this marginal sort of outcome seems nearly unachievable now.

<br />
<strong>The collapse of Iraq</strong> into all-out civil war <strong>would</strong> mean more than just a humanitarian tragedy that could <strong>easily claim hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives and produce millions of refugees. Such a conflict is unlikely to contain itself</strong>. In other similar cases of all-out civil war <strong>the resulting spillover has fostered terrorism, created refugee flows that can destabilize the entire neighborhood, radicalized the populations of surrounding states and even sparked civil wars</strong> in other, neighboring states or transformed domestic strife into regional war. Terrorists <strong>frequently find a home in states in civil war</strong>, as Al-Qaeda did in Afghanistan. <strong>However, civil wars just as often breed new terrorist groups</strong>-<strong>Hizballah, the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat of Algeria, and the Tamil Tigers were all born of civil wars. Many such groups start by focusing on local targets but then shift to international attacks</strong>-starting with those they believe are aiding their enemies in the civil war. This process is already underway in Iraq; the 2005 hotel bombings in Amman, Jordan were organized from Iraqi territory. Iraq-based groups are also inspiring others to emulate their targets and tactics. As they regularly do in Iraq, jihadist terrorists have tried to strike Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure, a switch from the jihadists' past avoidance of oil targets. Moreover, their Improvised Explosive Device technologies are showing up in Afghanistan.1 Suicide bombing, heretofore largely unknown in Afghanistan, is also now a regular occurrence, with the Iraq struggle providing a model to jihadists in Al-Qaeda's former home. In turn, an ongoing civil war can contribute to the radicalization of populations in neighboring countries. Already, the war has heightened Shi'a-Sunni tension throughout the Middle East. In March 2006, after Sunni jihadists bombed the Shi'i Askariya Shrine in the northern Iraqi city of Samarra, over 100,000 Bahraini Shi'a took to the streets in anger. Bahraini Shi'a are simultaneously horrified at the suffering of their co-religionists in Iraq and emboldened by their political successes. As one Bahraini Shi'a politician noted, &quot;Whenever things in Iraq go haywire, it reflects here.&quot;2 And as Iraq descends into further violence, the numbers of refugees will likely increase exponentially. Iraq has already generated roughly two million refugees with another one million internally displaced. These represent large groupings of embittered people who can serve as a ready recruiting pool for armed groups still waging the civil war. And as the wars in Africa's Great Lakes region show, foreign countries where refugees find shelter can become caught up in the civil war. At times, the refugees simply bring the war with them: The fighters mingle with non-combatant refugees and launch attacks back in their home countries, while those who drove them out continue the fight against the refugees in their new bases. Neighboring governments may try to defend refugees on their soil from attacks by their enemies or at times exploit the refugees as a proxy for the governments' own ambitions. Moreover, large refugee flows can overstrain the economies and even change the demographic balances of small or weak neighboring states, upsetting what is often a delicate political balance. Then there is the &quot;demonstration effect&quot; caused when a civil war involves one group seeking separation or independence as the solution to its problems. Sometimes, other groups in similar circumstances (either in the state in civil war or in neighboring countries) follow suit if the first group appears to have achieved some degree of success. Thus Slovenia's secession from Yugoslavia started the first of those civil wars, but it also provoked Croatia to declare its independence, which forced Bosnia to follow suit-and in both of the latter cases Serb enclaves within both countries sought to secede from the seceding state and join with Serbia. All the problems created by these and other forms of spillover often provoke neighboring states to intervene-to stop terrorism as Israel tried repeatedly in Lebanon, to halt the flow of refugees as the Europeans tried in Yugoslavia and the Iranians in Afghanistan, or to end (or respond to) the radicalization of its own population as Syria did in Lebanon. These interventions usually turn out badly for all involved. Iraq is already seeing both actual intervention and threats of intervention. Iran has hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of intelligence and paramilitary personnel in Iraq and is arming an array of Iraqi groups. Leaders of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Jordan have all threatened interventions of their own, both to mollify domestic sentiment and to counter what they see as unchecked Iranian gains from Tehran's intervention.<br />

We affirm that the movement toward democracy is a process which a large number of countries are part of, and which no one country has completely achieved or applied consistently to itself or to others.</u> While holding that the forms of democratic governance are plural (there being no single model of democracy to be followed), <u>we have been inspired by the experiences of those who have been in the forefront of democracy movements in countries that have taken the democratic path in recent years</u>. <u>Developing a movement of democrats from all regions of the world has become feasible</u> today owing to the dramatic expansion of democracy during the past 25 years.<br />

<strong>Democracy prevents global genocide</strong><br />

[Power kills, absolute Power kills absolutely. This new Power Principle is the message emerging from my previous work on the causes of war and this book on genocide and government mass murder--what I call democide--in this century. <u>The more power a government has, the more it can act arbitrarily according to the whims and desires of the elite, the more it will make war</u> on others <u>and murder its</u> foreign and domestic <u>subjects</u>. <u>The more constrained the power of governments, the more it is</u> diffused, <u>checked and balanced, the less it will aggress on others and commit democide</u>. At the extremes of Power2, <u>totalitarian</u> communist <u>governments slaughter their people by the</u> <strong><u>tens of millions</u></strong>, while many democracies can barely bring themselves to execute even serial murderers. &lt;continued…&gt; Consider also that library stacks have been written on the possible nature and consequences of nuclear war and how it might be avoided. Yet, <u>in the life of some still living we have experienced in the toll from democide</u> (and related destruction and misery among the survivors) <u>the equivalent of a nuclear war</u>, especially at the high <u>near 360,000,000</u> end of the estimates. It is as though one had already occurred! Yet to my knowledge, there is only one book dealing with the overall human cost of this &quot;nuclear war&quot;--Gil Elliot's Twentieth Century Book of the Dead.]<br />

<strong>Proclamation five: The evaluation of this round.</strong><br />
<strong>1) PLAN DISCOURSE SOLVES IN K WORLD</strong><br />
<strong>In-depth analysis and education about policymaking involving Syria is key to our individual understanding of the situation and establishing solutions in the pre-fiat world.</strong> <br />
<strong>Phares 2005</strong> <br />
(Walid, Senior fellow with the foundation for defense of democracies and professor of Middle Eastern studies at Florida Atlantic University, <u>Syria, the United States, and the War on Terror in the Middle East</u>)<br />
&lt; <u>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, U.S.-Syrian relations went through different stages and underwent sharply edged changes, in an amazing race between cold but stable relations and rapidly deteriorating ties</u>. The Washington-Damascus web of diplomacy, public policy, and intelligence changes crossed deserts and jungles: <u>At times, American foreign policy and Syria’s strategies overlapped; at other times, especially since 9/11, they diverged radically</u>. Since September 2004, the day a U.S.-French sponsored U.N. Security Council resolution was voted as UNSCR 1559, calling for Syria’s withdrawal from Lebanon and the disarming of its local allies in its neighbor, a new cold war started between the two parties: <u>Washington is tightening the pressures in Syria’s Ba’th, while Damascus is playing its powerful cards on all available battlefields, from Iraq to Lebanon.</u> The questions at hand in 2006 are these: <u>Are we witnessing a renewal of a cold war between a U.S.-led coalition and a Syrian-led axis in the region? How far can the United States go in pressuring the Syrian regime and its allies into submitting to a reform in its policies and domestic institutions? And</u>, on the other hand, <u>how far can the Syrian regime go in its regional and international involvements, putting itself in the face of U.S.-led policies</u> toward democracy and political change? <u>Which capital will let go of its ongoing agendas and policies first? Is there any chance for a return to the years of accommodations? These and other questions are and will be affecting the present and futures of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and the Israeli-Palestine peace process, as well as America’s foreign policy in the region, let alone the Arab world. To address these challenging issues, The Middle East studies community in America and the West should must its resources in a serious effort to accurately describe, project, and prescribe the various parameters of this complex relationship</u>. For it has been established <u>in the past two decades that the expert community in Syrian-American ties</u>, and particular in the field of Ba’thist strategic thinking, <u>has unfortunately failed in providing an accurate analysis on the subject both in the classroom and to the government</u> over the past few decades. This is why I believe that <u>a new generation of academics and researchers is needed</u>, or, to be fairer, new paradigms are warranted, regardless of their mode of adoption. <u>This new school of Middle East studies</u> in general and Levantine politics in particular <u>is surging with the works of solid scholars</u> in the field. Robert Rabil is one of them and is one of the few academics <u>who has been successful in approaching the subject thoroughly and producing a powerful study of its complex and multidimensional aspects</u>. &gt;<br />
<strong>2) If we can prove that the advantages of the affirmative outweigh the negative’s impacts, you should vote affirmative. The following are all reasons why the round should be won or lost on policy issues alone.</strong><br />
<strong>A) Education: The 1AC acts as a policy document to be evaluated on real-world terms. As potential future policy makers, learning and practicing policy is a much better investment than debating discursive nuances.</strong><br />
<strong>B) Pragmatism: The plan acts as an immediate change to the status quo that reaps tangible benefits. Unless proven otherwise, you should vote as if an affirmative ballot would put the plan into action. We won’t change the words people use or eliminate prejudice today in this room.</strong><br />
<strong>C) Unconditionality: In the 2AR we will still be telling you to vote for the plan. Conditionally natured arguments destroy debate because they are unfair and distract attention from the substance of the arguments.</strong><br />
<strong>3) Fiat: The negative can argue whatever they want to argue, but must also understand that the 1AC and plan should be evaluated comparatively in the name of fairness and clash. There are venues for people interested in discussing purely philosophical and theoretical questions; debate is a venue for evaluating and arguing over policy options. My partner and I invite the Negative team to stay after this round ends to discuss any non-policy objections they have to our affirmative or anything else they'd like.</strong>
