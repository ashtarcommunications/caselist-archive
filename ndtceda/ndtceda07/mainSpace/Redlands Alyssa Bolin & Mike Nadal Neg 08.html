Topicality Arguments<br />
<br />
Interp=Constructive Engagement=Three Parts<br />
<br />
1. Opening Up-Creating space for economic investment and political pluralism in the target state<br />
2. Tying Down-Encouraging that state to get involved in international organizations with set standards of behavior, and<br />
3. Binding together-Establishing a security component that reduces incentives for competition between the U.S. and the target state<br />
The Gazette 98 (G. John Ikenberry, &quot;The grand strategy': At last, the U.S. has found itself a post-Cold War foreign policy,&quot;, 7-15-98, lexis) &quot;The strategy is sometimes called constructive engagement...and its fullest expression in the Franco-German relationship&quot;<br />
<br />
T-Constructive Engagement Requires Conditions<br />
<br />
A topical affirmative must offer to provide a security guarantee or financial assistance if __ meets certain conditions within a specified time<br />
<br />
An offer requires the other party to perform a certain act<br />
Ronayne, no date cited (Debbi, Realtor at Keller-Williams Realty, www.ronayneteam.com/pages/Real_Estate_Glossary.asp#o )<br />
&quot;Offer-A promise made by one party...&quot;<br />
<br />
Constructive engagement requires that good relations be conditioned<br />
Burma Issues Newsletter 96 (N. Chan, &quot;Gentle and Slow Persuasion,&quot; March 1996, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.burmaissues.org/En/Newsletter/BINews1996-03.php#_Gentle_and_Slow_Persusasion" rel="nofollow">http://www.burmaissues.org/En/Newsletter/BINews1996-03.php#_Gentle_and_Slow_Persusasion</a>?, v. 6, n.3 accessed 8-24-07) &quot;By definition, a policy of constructive engagement.....you meet these specific conditions by a specific date&quot;<br />
<br />
T-Constructive Engagement=Unconditional<br />
A topical affirmative must mandate a constructive engagement policy that offers unconditional incentives that attempt to encourage cooperation without pressure<br />

“The political context….in electoral democracy”<br />
<br />
Democracy prevents several scenarios for extinction<br />
Diamond, 96 (Larry, Promoting Democracy in the 1990s, “1. Why Promote Democracy”, wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm)<br />
“This hardly exhausts…can be built”<br />
<br />
Synoptic Delusion K<br />
<br />
Subpoint A is the Synoptic Delusion<br />
<br />
Knowledge is fragmented and therefore attempts to use centralized planning rely on a synoptic delusion – the oversimplification of a vast and unknowable body of information. The plan is akin to a two-dimensional map for our three-dimensional world – its beauty and simplicity is possible only by stripping the world of its messy complexity and distorting its real shape to fit on a piece of paper.<br />
Crowley, 1 (Brian, Montreal Economic Institute, Montreal Economic Institute Paper, “The Man Who Changed Everyone’s Life: The Ubiquitous Ideas of F. A. Hayek (Conclusion),” 4-16-2001, www.iedm.org/library/crowlerB_en.html, JMP)<br />
“The synoptic delusion… as the study of a massive coordination challenge.”<br />
<br />
The affirmative relies on many problematic synoptic tools –<br />
<br />
Most fundamental is their scenario writing – the assumption that most factors are knowable and hence predictable establishes the legitimacy of using political and military intervention to manage international politics<br />
Dalby, 3 (Simon, professor of geography at the University of Carleton, Critical Security Studies: Concepts and Cases, ed. by Keith Krause &amp; Michael Williams p.24)<br />
“Finally, possibly the most important reason… deserve to be taken more seriously”<br />
<br />
Additionally, ignorance of events and crises in other countries forces individuals to rely on limited and dangerous knowledge produced by elitist opinion makers who represent the world in biased and self serving ways.<br />
Davidson, 6 (Lawrence, professor of Middle East history at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, Middle East Policy, “Privatizing Foreign Policy,” Summer, vol. 13, no. 2, p.134, Proquest, JMP)<br />
“In the last 60 years, it has only been … edited news and &quot;establishment&quot; experts.”<br />
<br />
Reliance on experts is also bad because it excludes the voices of the people with lived experiences thereby missing the root causes of conflict<br />
Milovanovic &amp; Schehr, 99 (Dragon Milovanovic – Assistant Professor in the Criminal Justice Program at the University of Illinois Springfield &amp; Robert C. Schehr – Professor in the Department of Criminal Justice, Sociology and Social Work at Northeastern Illinois University, Social Justice, “Conflict mediation and the postmodern: Chaos, catastrophe, and psychoanalytic semiotics,” Spring, vol. 26, no. 1, Proquest)<br />
<br />
“RECENT INDICATIONS OF RENEWED… dangerous, as history seems to bare out.”<br />
<br />
Subpoint B is the Reformer<br />
<br />
The affirmative is a modern day reformer that turns to government to implement its vision of collective responsibility – this only papers over the inherent problems of government<br />
Dr. Carson, 81 (Clarence B., specializes in American Intellectual History, The Freeman, “Reformer Watching,” vol. 31, no. 4, April, 1981, www.libertyhaven.com/politicsandcurrentevents/governmentreformitsrealrole/reformerwatching.html, JMP)<br />
“Reformer watching will probably never catch on… at large, even for those who may derive pleasure from it.”<br />
<br />
Subpoint C is the Alternative<br />
<br />
In lieu of the affirmative, we should instead reject the assumption that the government has the knowledge and power to effectively organize and manage societal affairs.<br />
<br />
Failure to adopt the alternative will result in extinction<br />
Rockwell, 3 (Llewellyn H. Jr., president of the Mises Institute, The Free Market, The Mises Institute Monthly, “The Hayek Moment,” May 2003, vol. 21, no.5, www.mises.org/freemarket_detail.asp?control=439&amp;sortorder=articledate, JMP)<br />
“The relevance of… striving to control society.&quot;<br />
<br />
The true solution is to recognize the scope of our own ignorance and endorse a process of constant experimentation that draws on the views and actions of millions of people – this is preferable to centralized political approaches.<br />
Emmott, 3 (Bill, independent writer, speaker and consultant on international affairs, 20:21 Vision: Twentieth-Century Lessons for the Twenty-first Century, JMP)<br />
“Those points about science and religion are… The hunt must go on.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Only society based on a decentralized, spontaneous order can achieve the necessary coordination and overcome the problems presented by the fragmentation of knowledge. It will always outperform centralized planning.<br />
Crowley, 1 (Brian, Montreal Economic Institute, Montreal Economic Institute Paper, “The Man Who Changed Everyone’s Life: The Ubiquitous Ideas of F. A. Hayek (Conclusion),” 4-16-2001, www.iedm.org/library/crowlerB_en.html, JMP)<br />
“The abstract order … our self-interest coincided.”<br />
<br />
Additionally, rejecting centralized and coercive solutions allows us to accept our responsibility for problems – spurring global peace and prosperity<br />
Dr. Ruwart, 93 (Dr. Mary J. Ruwart, Senior Scientist at a major pharmaceutical firm and a former Assistant Professor of Surgery at St. Louis University Medical School,Healing Our World: The Other Piece of the Puzzle, p.1-3, JMP)<br />
“Humankind is poised on… we can manifest our dream.”<br />
<br />
Rejecting the monopoly on aggression will transform global society and foster peace<br />

Ruwart, Senior Scientist at a major pharmaceutical firm and a former Assistant Professor of Surgery at St. Louis University Medical School, Healing Our World: The Other Piece of the Puzzle, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ruwart.com/Healing/ruwart_all.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ruwart.com/Healing/ruwart_all.html</a>, JMP)<br />

<br />
CP Text –<br />
The United States federal government should appoint a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction to oversee an economic aid package of $1.6 billion per year over the next three years to the government of Afghanistan.<br />
