<strong>HAMAS IS THE LEGITIMATE ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND ARE WILLING TO BRING PEACE TO THE WAR-TORN GAZA STRIP. THEY ARE CURRENTLY SEEKING ENGAGEMENT AS A POLITICAL ENTITY.</strong><br />

<u>THE events in Gaza...true intentions</u><br />
<br />
RESOLVED: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROVIDE A SECURITY GUARANTEE TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY ENDING ALL U.S. AID TO ISRAELI MILITARY CAMPAIGNS AGAINST PALESTINE WHILE DEMANDING THAT THEY RESPECT ISRAEL WITHIN ITS PRE-1967 BORDERS.<br />
<br />
ISRAELI POLICIES TARGET GAZA FOR EXTINCTION AS ISRAEL ATTEMPTS TO CREATE BORDERS OF LAND AND MAPS IN THEIR OWN IMAGE. ISRAEL’S GOAL IS TO DESTROY THE URBAN CENTERS OF PALESTINE <strong>TO ANNIHILATE URBAN GROUPS.</strong><br />

<strong>UNITED STATES FUNDING HAS DONE NOTHING BUT PURCHASE TRAGEDY IN GAZA. ENDING U.S. COMPLICITY WITH THE ETHNIC CLEANSING OF POPULATION TRANSFER IS KEY.</strong><br />

<strong>HAMAS PROVIDES THE NECESSARY STRUCTURES TO BRING CHANGE TO THE URBAN SLUM AND END URBICIDE IN PALESTINE. ENGAGING HAMAS AND RECOGNIZING THEIR POWER AS AN ACTOR CAN BREAK DOWN CURRENT GEOPOLITICAL FRAMEWORKS THROUGH DISCUSSION AND THE OPENING OF POLITICAL SPACE.</strong><br />
