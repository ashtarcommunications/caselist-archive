THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ELIMINATE THE VOLUMETRIC ETHANOL EXCISE TAX CREDIT FOR CONVENTIONAL BIOFUELS AND SHOULD NO LONGER REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH MANDATES THAT CAN BE MET WITH CONVENTIONAL BIOFUEL. THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROPOSE AND ENTER INTO MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH GOVERNMENTS OF ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT NATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS OF DEVELOPING NATIONS, IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES SHOULD PROPOSE THE FIFTY-FOUR CENT IMPORT TARIFF FOR ETHANOL ONLY AGAINST BIOFUEL THAT IS NOT PRODUCED ACCORDING TO STANDARDS FOR ENVIRONEMTNAL SUSTAINABILITY. THE USFG SHOULD IMPLEMENT THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS INCLUDING REQUIRING THAT BIOFUEL PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES COMPLY WITH SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS AGREED TO IN THE NEGOTIATIONS. <br />

Some NU Cotton neg stuff:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should comply with World Trade Organization limits on amber box subsidies for cotton by reducing total cotton subsidies by one third including a reduction in direct payments for cotton production. The United States Federal Government should condition the provision of remaining counter-cyclical payments, loan-deficiency payments, marketing assistance loans, and export credit guarantees for cotton on targeted conservations, sustainable land use, and decreased production<br />
<br />
The counterplan is competitive – the us can choose to comply be either eliminating or reducing subsidies<br />

As soon as an operation… … regulation as a CAFO.<br />
<br />
( ) <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Subsidies to corn and soybeans are the REAL CAFO subsidies – the cost of feed grain is the majority of a CAFO’s operating cost</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"> </span><br />

<strong>Subsidies for grain are NOT CAFO subsidies – they only indirectly benefit CAFOs</strong><br />

<strong>( ) Eliminating grain subsidies would just cause CAFOs to switch to less expensive alternative feeds like DDGS</strong><br />

<span class="underline"><strong><u>Another consideration….</u></strong></span> fiber digestibility is increased, compensating in part for lost starch.<br />

Contrary to what many….<span class="underline"> <strong><u>higher profit than CAFOs</u></strong></span>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Raising the cost of meat consumption causes animals to be shifted into other, MORE exploitative industries like laboratory research</strong><br />

To give one example, policy….. harm animal welfare.<br />
<br />
<strong>( ) This turn outweighs the case – laboratory testing is worse for animal welfare than factory farms and harder to combat because it’s shielded from public scrutiny</strong><br />

If tax policy is not…..<span class="underline"> <strong><u>increase in meat eating</u></strong></span>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Reducing meat consumption causes a shift of cows into the dairy sector, which is overall far worse for animal welfare</strong><br />

This point bears on….<span class="underline"> <strong><u>longrun number of cows in each sector will adjust</u></strong></span>.<br />
<br />
<strong>An end to factory farming would collapse the global economy – and you should evaluate this arg from a utilitarian perspective, because elevating animal interests over everyone else just flips the hierarchy of the status quo</strong><br />
