<u>QPQ T</u><br />
<br />
A. Interpretation-<br />
Engagement is the use of diplomatic tools to elicit co-operative behavior<br />
Victor D. <u>Cha</u>, Gov’t Prof. @ Georgetown, Engaging China: The Management of an Emerging Power, edited by A. Johnston and R. Ross, pg. 36, 19<u>99</u><br />
<br />
Constructive supports this<br />
<u>Merriam Webster</u> Dictionary, Online <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/constructive" rel="nofollow">http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/constructive</a><br />
<br />
Main Entry: <u>con·struc·tive</u><br />
3 : <u>promoting improvement or development</u> &lt;constructive criticism&gt;<br />
<br />
B. Violation:<br />
The affirmative team hands incentives over to (insert country) but does nothing to elicit co-operative behavior. The country doesn’t have to do anything in return for the incentives.<br />
C. STANDARDS:<br />
1. GROUND: IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ALL OF OUR SAY NO GROUND AS WELL AS OUR GROUND TO CP OUT OF EFFORTS TO ELICIT CO-OPERATION<br />
2. PREDICTABILITY- ENGAGEMENT IS MORE PREDICTABLE WHEN IT MEANS TO ACTUALLY TRY TO GAIN CO-OPERATION WITH A COUNTRY RATHER THAN JUST GIVE THEM ASSISTANCE OR SECURITY<br />
3. EACH WORD HAS MEANING- BOTH CONSTRUCTIVE AND ENGAGEMENT HAVE MEANING IN THE RESOLUTION AND IF THEY COMBINE TO FORM THE BEST INTERPRETATION YOU MUST ACCEPT IT<br />
4. COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS BEST—GUARANTEES THE DEBATE FOCUSES ON CLASH, AND PROVIDES THE BEST EDUCATION AND FAIRNESS.<br />
D. TOPICALITY IS A VOTING ISSUE FOR REASONS OF JURISDICTION, EDUCATION, AND COMPETITIVE EQUITY.<br />
<br />
<u>Timetable T</u><br />
<br />
A. INTERPRETATION—CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT MUST BE LONG-TERM, STRENGTHEN TIES, AND SET CONDITIONS ON A SPECIFIED TIMEFRAME.<br />
<br />
N. <u>Chan</u>, “Gentle and Slow Persuasion,” <u>Burma Issues Newsletter</u>, v. 6 n. 3, March 19<u>96</u>.<br />
<br />
B. VIOLATION—THE AFFIRMATIVE FAILS TO CREATE A LONG-TERM, VERIFIABLE STRUCTURE FOR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH CLEAR DEADLINES.<br />
<br />
C. REASONS TO PREFER –<br />
<br />
1. GROUND – HAVING A SET TIMEFRAME AND VERIFICATION PROCESS IS ESSENTIAL TO UNIQUENESS, BECAUSE THE AFF CAN ARGUE ENGAGEMENT HAPPENS AFTER OUR SCENARIO.<br />
2. INCLUSIVE AND EXCLUSIVE – OUR DEFINITION ESTABLISHES POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CONDITIONS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT, WHICH ESTABLISHES THE MOST TRANSPARENT LIMITS.<br />
3. PREDICTABILITY– ESTABLISHING A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP BASED ON A VERIFIABLE STRUCTURE GUARANTEES PREDICTABILITY WITHIN THIS ROUND.<br />
4. COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS BEST—GUARANTEES THE DEBATE FOCUSES ON CLASH, AND PROVIDES THE BEST EDUCATION AND FAIRNESS.<br />
<br />
D. TOPICALITY IS A VOTING ISSUE FOR REASONS OF JURISDICTION, AND COMPETITIVE EQUITY.<br />

Capitalism<br />
Kritik – must embrace a Marxist methodology to confront capitalism; must embrace a historical materialism method to completely reject capitalism (Cloud and Mazaros evidence)<br />
Dana Cloud, 2001, “the affirmative masquerade” www.acjournal.org/holdings/vol4/iss3/special/cloud.htm<br />
<br />
Cloud 2003, “Marxism and oppression” talk for regional socialist conference, 4/19/03, online<br />
<br />
Meszaros, 1995, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, p 738<br />
<br />
The ALT: method is the foremost political question b/c one must understand the existing social totality before one can act on it – grounding the sites of political contestation or knowledge outside of labor and surplus value merely serve to humanize capital and prevent a transition to a society beyond oppression<br />
Stephen Tumino, 2001, “what is orthodox Marxism and why it matters now more than ever” Red Critique, online<br />
“any effective political theory…systematic inequality….masquerades as social theory”<br />

<br />
FRAMEWORK – 1NC<br />
A. our interp – the aff should present a topical plan of action and defend their policy should be adopted by the USFG<br />
<br />
B. defs<br />
1. the topic is defined by the phrase following the colon – the USFG is the agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters:<br />
Websters 2000 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm</a><br />
<br />
2. resolved expresses intent to implement the plan<br />
American heritage dictionary 2000, www.dictionary.com<br />
<br />
3. should denotes an expectioan of enacting a plan<br />
American heritage dict.<br />
<br />
4. our def excludes action by small political groups or individuals<br />
Blacks Law, 1999 (“federal gov’t)<br />
<br />
C. violation – the aff is not an instrumental affirmation of the resolution<br />
<br />
RTP<br />
1. ground – the aff will always win that the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract – we can only debate the merits of their fw if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation<br />
Michael Ignatieff, Lesser Evils, 2004, p. 20-21<br />
As for moral perfectionism…betray another<br />
<br />
Without predictable grounds debate becomes meaningless and produces pllitical strategy that is wedded to violence and fails to achieve productive change<br />
Ruth Lessi Shively, 2000, Political theory and partisan politics, p. 182-183<br />
The point may seem trite…the act of argumentation<br />
<br />
Lastly, this is an independent reason to vote neg – the fairness of the aff’s advocacy must precede considerations of its merits or else all contestation is meaningless<br />
Shively, 2k, p. 181-182<br />
The requirements given…agreement or harmony<br />
<br />
<br />
Next is topical education – by manipulating the topic to access their political project they skirt debate about the implementation of policies by the gov’t. their education is distrusting of institutional study and pragmatic reform. Even if their intentions are noble, their message results in fascist totalitarianism.<br />
Martin Lewis, Green Delusions, 1992, p. 258<br />
A majority of those born…inconvenient niceties<br />
<br />
Again, this argument is an independent voting issue<br />
Shively, p. 186<br />
To sum up the argument…require these judgments<br />
<br />
<br />
Next is limits – there are limitless contexts or avenues through which they could purport to advocate the plan. Our interp limits debate to promote politically relevant dialogue and structured communication<br />
Donald S. Lutz, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, 2000, p. 39-40<br />
Aristotle notes in the Politics…logical clarity…moral vision of the non-theorist<br />
<br />
<br />
And, exploring predictable limits neutralizes the discursive benefits to debate and renders their advocacy meaningless – only our interp preserves the revolutionary potential of a deliberative activity<br />
Shively, p. 180<br />
Thus far, I have argued…reject civility and democracy<br />
<br />
<br />
Voting Issues –<br />
1. this argument provides a-priori reasons to vote negative. You must use yoru ballot to ratify constraints on discourse to preserve a politically-enabling discussion<br />
Shively, p. 179<br />
To put this point another way…firm support that we can give them<br />
<br />
2. the deliberative implications of their advocacy are an a-priori question – pre-conditions of agreement are necessary for your decision to have any political value<br />
Adolf G. Gundersen, 2000, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p. 104-105<br />
Indirect political engagement…important extent the same question
