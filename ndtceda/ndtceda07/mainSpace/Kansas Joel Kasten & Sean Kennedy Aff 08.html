Plan: The USFG through the Sccretary of the Navy should offer to the government of Iran a guarantee that the United States Naval forces will not inferfere with Iranian naval formations, will not attack or simulate attacks on Iranian ships or aircraft, and will use appropriate international signals when engaged in maneuvers in exchange for Iranian reciprocity to be formalized in an Incidents at Sea agreement.<br />

Observation 1 is the Location<br />
<br />
A. In the status quo, American rhetoric about the Middle East deludes us into thinking that the Arab-Israeli conflict is happening somewhere far away. This is incorrect - The violent Rhetoric of the Arab Israeli conflict is happening right here and right now.<br />
Khawaja , 2003. (Irfan, Instructor of Philosophy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice Oct 3, “Muslim Anti-Semitism and Zionist Orientalism: The Workings of a Vicious Cycle,” On Formation and Renewal, Notre Dame. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/archives/documents/IrfanKhawaja.doc" rel="nofollow">http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/archives/documents/IrfanKhawaja.doc</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. The discursive conflict around Israel and Palestine starts in the American academy, but it doesn’t stay there. Intellectual Zionist rhetoric trickles down to “street” speech where it does its damage in the form of arguments for extermination of the Palestinians. The connection between intellectual and street discourse is living and real, in our institutions.<br />
Khawaja , 2003. (Irfan, Instructor of Philosophy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice Oct 3, “Muslim Anti-Semitism and Zionist Orientalism: The Workings of a Vicious Cycle,” On Formation and Renewal, Notre Dame. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/archives/documents/IrfanKhawaja.doc" rel="nofollow">http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/archives/documents/IrfanKhawaja.doc</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
C. In the academy, the charge of anti-Semitism has been expanded to any criticism of Israel. This silences productive discourse and makes it impossible to asses what is and is not anti-Semitic.<br />
Butler, 2004 - (Judith, Professor of English and Rhetoric at Berkeley, Precarious Life, p102)<br />
<br />
Observation 2 – The Charge<br />
<br />
A. In the academy, yet another accusation of anti-Semitism is being deployed. These recent claims of a “new anti-Semitism” are designed to exploit the historical suffering of Jews and immunize Israel from scrutiny.<br />
Finklestein, 2005. Professor of PoliSci at DuPaul U. Beyond Chutzpah, pg 21-22)<br />
<br />
<br />
B. This discourse around anti-Semitism re-envisions any critique of Israel as anti-Semitic by attributing prejudice to the speaker. The criticism is thus treated not as a productive discourse, but seen instead as a cloak for discrimination against Jews.<br />
Butler, 2004 - (Judith, Professor of English and Rhetoric at Berkeley, Precarious Life, p102)<br />
<br />
<br />
C. These charges are carry extreme weight. Anyone with any proposal to change status-quo Israel is accused of wishing to destroy all Jews. This is a flawed argument for four reasons.<br />
Khawaja , 2003. (Irfan, Instructor of Philosophy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice Oct 3, “Muslim Anti-Semitism and Zionist Orientalism: The Workings of a Vicious Cycle,” On Formation and Renewal, Notre Dame. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/archives/documents/IrfanKhawaja.doc" rel="nofollow">http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/archives/documents/IrfanKhawaja.doc</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
D. The accusation of a desire to kill all Jews treats any critic of Israel, whether academic or terrorist, as an unjust enemy whose moral maxim makes peace impossible.<br />
<br />
E. This leads to Extinction. As great Carl Schmidt is, he is wrong. Constructing enemies as unjust breaks down the safeguards of sovereignty and law, Schmidt’s construction of the enemy breaks down the law, which breaks down the concept of the friend. This throws humanity into total war without limits and creates an absolute threat to humanity.<br />
Moreiras, Director of European Studies at Duke, 2k4 (Alberto, “A God without Sovereignty. Political Jouissance. The Passive Decision”, CR: The New Centennial Review 4.3, p.81-83, Project MUSE)<br />
<br />
<br />
F. Don’t be fooled into thinking its for the better good. This interpretation of Anti-Semitism, which has protected Israel from kritik has actually produced real anti-Semitism against not just Israel, but Jews more broadly.<br />
Finklestein, 2005. Professor of PoliSci at DuPaul U. Beyond Chutzpah, pg 21-22)<br />
Thus we advocate the following: charges of anti-Semitism should be rejected as a legitimate defense of Israel and its policy choices.<br />
Observation 3 - Solvency<br />
<br />
Rejecting the use of anti-Semtitism as a legitimate substitute for critique is key to opening a space for productive public discourse and a more dynamic identity for Jews.<br />
Butler, 2004 - (Judith, Professor of English and Rhetoric at Berkeley, Precarious Life, p125)<br />
<br />
<br />
Individual resistance to the charge of anti-Semitism is the first step to solving the crisis in discourse.<br />
Khawaja , 2003. (Irfan, Instructor of Philosophy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice Oct 3, “Muslim Anti-Semitism and Zionist Orientalism: The Workings of a Vicious Cycle,” On Formation and Renewal, Notre Dame. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/archives/documents/IrfanKhawaja.doc" rel="nofollow">http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/archives/documents/IrfanKhawaja.doc</a>.<br />
<br />
-Cooptation arguments are wrong. Even if co-opted in part, our case will not be completely co-opted.<br />
-And, Turn: the risk of cooptation is why we have a responsibility to change the conditions under which criticism is received by the audience.<br />

Incidents at Sea Case<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc1"><a name="UNI Case Outline-Kansas KK Naval Iran Case"></a>Kansas KK Naval Iran Case</h2>
 <br />
PLAN<br />
The USfg through the Secretary of the Navy should offer to the government of Iran a guarantee that the United States Naval forces will not interfere with Iranian naval formations, will not attack or simulate attacks on Iranian ships or aircraft, and will use appropriate international signals when engaged in maneuvers in exchange for Iranian reciprocity to be formalized in an Incidents at Sea agreement. Affirmative speeches will clarify intent.<br />
<br />
<br />
US War Games will spark acc war in the SQ<br />
“there is a massive concentration” “military action against Iran”<br />
<br />
Only scenario for war – military leaders check alt forms of escalation<br />
“I also believe that gates” “agreements with iran speaks volumes”<br />
<br />
Miscalc immediate and escalates quickly – impact is full scale war<br />
“here’s an American acronym” “naval analyses a Washington think tank”<br />
<br />
Lack agreement makes Iran escalation MLS for ME war<br />
“iran remains potentially the most dangerous” “forces would be a good first step”<br />
<br />
Emp the last time we were in a hair trigger confrontation with Iran, a miscalc became inevitable. The Vincennes incident empirically proves<br />
“at first it seemed like a triumph” “aegis system apparently worked as it was supposed to”<br />
<br />
Iran attack would involve bunker busters – they would blur the line between conventional and nuclear weapons, independently killing hundreds of thousands<br />
Feinstein 06<br />
“dangers inherent in preemptive action” “military traditions”<br />
<br />
Iran Strike will cause a global nuclear war that leads to human extinction<br />
Hirsch 04<br />
“iran is likely to respond to any US attack” “before anybody has prevailed”<br />
<br />
An incidents at sea agreement is a small opening for broader opportunities – military to military communuication is a key CBM to overcome the currently poisoned relations environment<br />
Afrasiabi 9/18<br />
“has been reflected in the US media” “environment dominating relations between the two countries”<br />
<br />
US Iran relations are at a crossroads<br />
Afrasiabi 9/26<br />
“that would be a pity” “sort out the security dimension”<br />
<br />
Incidents at sea agreement would show benign military intentions – this solves other issues which pose threats to relations<br />
Taphe 02<br />
“employ confidence building measures” “iran in acquiring nuclear weapons”<br />
<br />
The plan changes the framing of current negotiations – Iran will view the plan as a reassurance that the ‘great satan’ is no longer hell bent on their destruction<br />
Slavin 98 CSIS<br />
“avoiding incidents at sea” “way of changing the enemy’s mind”<br />
<br />
Relations are a vital IL to solving a risk to ME instability – Israel/Palestine/terrorism/iraq and afgahan<br />
Hadain 03<br />
“iran’s centrality and the myth of isolation” “hostile nature of US Iranian relations”<br />
<br />
IP conflict is the MLS for GPO conflict and nuclear IV<br />
Chomsky 99 fateful triangle p449<br />
“the disasters threatening&quot; &quot;possibility for political settlement&quot;<br />
<br />
Terrorism to extinction<br />
Sid-Ahmed 04<br />
“nuclear attack by terrorists” “we will all be losers”<br />
<br />
ME nuclear war goes nuclear<br />
Lesser 04 Future Security Env of the ME<br />
“several factors contribute to the prominence” “proliferation instead the region”<br />
<br />
US Iran relations K to avoiding a major escalation in Iraq<br />
Hadian 03<br />
“this is the most critical time in US-Iran relations” “Israeli invasion would be a better metaphor”<br />
<br />
Relations L to Azerbaijan stability<br />
Hadian 03<br />
“with the coming to power of ilham aliev” “Iranians as a hostile act”<br />
<br />
Leads to Central Asian instability<br />
Wall 02<br />
“the other reason why the Caucasus cannot be ignored” “into a potential war zone”<br />
<br />
Goes nuclear<br />
Blank 00 World Affairs 163 n2<br />
“thus many structural conditions” “almost everywhere else in the CIS”<br />
<br />
Our plan is a different era for negotiations – unlike previous negotiations over human rights and nuclearlization that were plagued by deception, the plan will kindle mutual cooperation<br />
Sokolski 04<br />
“call on Iran to agree to a montreux convention” “waterways in or near the gulf”<br />
<br />
Even if Iran immediately rejects the plan, international pressure will coalesce and force compliance<br />
Clawson 06<br />
“examples of csbms would be an exchange” “pressure iran will feel to concede”<br />
<br />
US is key – previous international approaches have been viewed as disingenuous bribes<br />
Clawson 06<br />
“to influence iran the united states needs instruments” “prevent unintended naval confrontations”
