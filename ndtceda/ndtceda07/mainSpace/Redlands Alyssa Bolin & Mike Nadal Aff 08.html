 <br />
We begin with the plan – <br />
<br />
The United States federal government should offer to negotiate a status of forces agreement with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and provide a security guarantee to maintain U.S. military presence as long as the democratically elected government of Afghanistan requires.<br />
<br />
Contention 1 is Afghan Stability<br />
<br />
The U.S. has not made a commitment to remain in Afghanistan for the long term<br />
