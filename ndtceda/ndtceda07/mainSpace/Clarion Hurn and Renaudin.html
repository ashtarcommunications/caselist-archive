A. Links - The plan is an endorsement of political realism<br />
<br />
1. The logic of the plan reduces the world to facts that can be organized and acted upon. Fact replaces truth, and all that is left is to race after history.<br />

<br />
2. The world is reduced to situations that can be acted upon and human nature is replaced by the human condition – more specifically, the AFF identifies a set of immediate harms that it labels as “destabilizing” and needing rectified.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
3. The AFF couches this realism within the logic of the nation-states as the central actor responsible for the management of power.<br />
<br />

B. Implications<br />
<br />
1. Dehumanization – individuals are lost in the unity of the masses as all are rendered as means<br />
<br />

[Jacques, Sources and Trajectories, translation/commentary by M. Dawn, 62]<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Turns the case – war become inevitable and worse – everything is reduced to “struggle for life” and the relationship between society and war is altered negatively under the imperialism of facts<br />
<br />

[Jacques, Sources and Trajectories, translation/commentary by M. Dawn, 62-4]<br />
<br />
3. Extinction - loss of the individual makes the annihilation of civilization and humanity inevitable<br />
<br />

[Jacques, Sources and Trajectories, translation/commentary by M. Dawn, 67]<br />
<br />
C. Alt - We must step from politics from politics and engage in reflection – acceptance of the political destroys faith<br />
