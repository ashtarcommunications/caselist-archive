The gift K run against K-State DF at KCK Tournament<br />
<br />
<strong>The plan appears to generate reciprocity, the nature of the exchange is simply an extension of alienation thru the exercise of power.</strong><br />
<strong><em>Der Derian, ’87.</em></strong> On Diplomacy: A Genealogy of Western Estrangement.<br />
“The changing nature of the gift exchange between leaders…in early proto-diplomacy by the missi.”<br />
<strong>This form of proto-diplomacy is necessarily one-sided – the accumulation of power collapses any chance of resolving estrangement and ensures the continuation of the harms outlined in the 1AC.</strong><br />
<strong><em>Der Derian, ’87.</em></strong> On Diplomacy: A Genealogy of Western Estrangement.<br />
“This is, admittedly, a rather simplified version…the church against forms of warfare new to the Middle Ages.”<br />
<strong>Our alt is the mutual recognition of estrangement. This recognition of history is the key to de-mythologize power and form the foundation of potential remedies.</strong><br />
<strong><em>Der Derian, ’87.</em></strong> On Diplomacy: A Genealogy of Western Estrangement.<br />
“But the mutual recognition of estrangement…the power of religion was displaced by a religion of power.”<br />
<strong>The per silences active questioning of diplomacy which is crucial to understanding the nature of estrangement and solving our alt.</strong><br />
<strong><em>Der Derian, ’87.</em></strong> On Diplomacy: A Genealogy of Western Estrangement.<br />
“Are these sufficient reasons to take another path…or that philosophy is born of estrangement.”<br />
<strong>Our alt must be a prior question to the plan – performing any element of the plan before the active questioning guarantees diplomacy-as-usual and full risk of our implications.</strong><br />
<strong><em>Der Derian, ’87.</em></strong> On Diplomacy: A Genealogy of Western Estrangement.<br />
“This chapter has been overloaded with shotgun ideas…be covered in the study of diplomacy.”<br />
<strong>Only the alt alone can create true mediation – the lens of genealogy requires a thorough investigation of affairs before reaching an immediate responses.</strong><br />
<strong><em>Der Derian, ’87.</em></strong> On Diplomacy: A Genealogy of Western Estrangement.<br />
“The solution which Hegel suggests is…reach the universal truth.”
