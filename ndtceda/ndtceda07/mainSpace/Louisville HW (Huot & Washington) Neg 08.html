Affirmative increases cultural assimilation in debate community and topic area.<br />

<strong>Georgia</strong> <strong>State – Rd 2 – Northwestern GR v. Louisville</strong><br />
<strong>Judge:</strong> Mike Hester<br />
<strong>Decision:</strong> Affirmative<br />
<br />
<strong>Comments:</strong> No competition between the negative advocacy and affirmative case. The neg doesn’t bind the aff to anything and so the aff can make itself a metaphor.<br />
<br />
<strong>Arguments</strong><br />
Affirmative must be a metaphor and address the exclusion within the debate community. The aff should address problems within the debate community before or at the same time that they address their case. Women and minorities are invisible within the debate community and we need to expose that.<br />

GSU Round 5<br />
Neg vs. Critical Palestine<br />
Judge: Jessica Yeats<br />
<br />
1. Debate dying<br />
<br />
2. Cultural assimilation present<br />
<br />
3. Aff not addressing issue of debate through metaphor<br />
<br />
4. Metaphor better to solve<br />
<br />
5. Without metaphor there is speaking for others<br />
