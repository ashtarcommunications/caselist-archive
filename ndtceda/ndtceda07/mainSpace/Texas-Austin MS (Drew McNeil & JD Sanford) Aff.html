 Observation One - Inherency<br />
<br />
A. Subpoint: Despite the National Intelligence Estimate Bush is still keeping the threat of military force against Iran on the Table<br />
Irish Times, December 2007<br />
(December 5th, &quot;Iran a Threat Despite Intelligence Estimate, says Bush&quot;, LN)<br />
A day after the... ...on the table,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
B. Subpoint: Bush will use these threats to ramp up the conflict to a full military confrontation<br />
Cohn December 2007<br />
(Marjorie, professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, &quot;Will Bush Provoke Iran?&quot; December 12th, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.alternet.org/story/71134/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternet.org/story/71134/</a> )<br />
Just as &quot;Operation Iraqi... ...against the united states.&quot;<br />
<br />
Plan - The United States Federal Government should offer to the government of Iran that the United States Federal Government will not attempt or support strikes on Iran. <br />
<br />
Advantage 1 - The Cycle of Violence<br />
<br />
America is locked in a cycle of violence that can only be stopped by removing ourselves from it. Maintaining ourselves as 'hegemonic' serves to only escalate tensions and violence while stepping away allows us to see the vulnerability within ourselves that allows the world to enter into a new politics of peace.<br />
Butler and Stauffer 2003<br />
(The Believer, &quot;Peace is a resistance to the terrible satisfactions of war&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200305/?read=interview_butler" rel="nofollow">http://www.believermag.com/issues/200305/?read=interview_butler</a> )<br />
<br />
Pre-emptive warfare is the worst type of violence. It is an attempt to hide from ourselves the fundamental truth that we are all vulnerable while establishing a sense of patriotic fervor that suppresses all voices of cultural criticism. <br />
Butler 2004<br />
(&quot;Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence&quot;, pg 149-151)<br />
Tragically, it seems that... ...they occasionally perform.<br />
<br />
War forces us to view people in terms of groups, ignoring the differences within categories. By Reducing individuals to mere statistics, these categories dehumanize individuals as tools of war.<br />
Horsburgh, 1968<br />
(Non-Violence and Aggression, Oxford University Press, p.17-18)<br />
In time of war... ...between persons and things<br />
<br />
Dehumanization is the root of all social and moral ills however, we can solve it through our nonviolent rhetoric.<br />
Maiese 2003<br />
(Michelle, University of Colorado, Boulder, &quot;Dehumanization.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/dehumanization/" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/dehumanization/</a> )<br />
Once certain groups are... ...the pursuit of common goals.<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 - Securitization<br />
<br />
The Status Quo fear mongering and security posturing about Iran exemplifies the security mindset that must be rejected. Identifying danger and attempting to control and eliminate it only legitimates nasty violent solutions and is based upon biased interpretation. <br />
Campbell 98<br />
(David, Professor of Cultural and Political Geogragphy, 8/1, &quot;David Campbell, Writing Security: United States Foreign Policy and the Politics of Identity&quot;, Pg. 31-32<br />
Most important, just as... ...their quasi Puritan figurations.<br />
<br />
The impact is extinction.<br />
Beres 94<br />
(Louis Rene, Ph.D., Princeton University, &quot;Self Determination, International Law and Survival on Planet Earth&quot;, Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law.)<br />
Rationalist philosophy derived from the idea... ...through the killing of &quot;outsiders.&quot;<br />
<br />
The feeling of vulnerability that comes from an act of nonviolence can be used to transform the United States from its current hegemonic state.<br />
Butler 2004<br />
(Precarious Life, pg. 40)<br />
I condemn on several... ...here and elsewhere<br />
<br />
In order to achieve freedom we must make the concept of security questionable and realize the co-existence between security and insecurity.<br />
Dillon 96<br />
(Michael, &quot;Politics of Security: Towards a Political Philosophy of Continental Thought&quot; p.18-19)<br />
Genealogy therefore allows me... ...have begun to think politically again.
