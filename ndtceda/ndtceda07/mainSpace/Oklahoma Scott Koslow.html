The First Fight<br />
<br />
Human activity is characterized by negation: When I eat an apple, I negate the apple in its current form in order to create something else - energy for myself. When I build a house, I must negate a forest in it's current form to transform it into something else. However, this negation isn't enough to sustain us. This can't explain why people engage in such wholesale destruction and negation - like when we kill and die for country, honor, or love. Human behavior is unique in our desire for the recognition of others; we want respect, we want love, and we want adoration. Go back to the beginning of civilization and you will find The First Fight, a fight to the death between two humans for pure recognition.<br />

The First Fight gives rise to a Master and a Slave. The Slave was unable to overcome their given-reality and risk death, they were a slave to their material reality. Thus they yielded to the master. But by laboring under the fear of death they overcome it, freeing themselves from nature, from their material reality, and from their master.<br />

Next, Something has Gone Terribly Wrong.<br />
<br />
Nietzsche saw that this is not how the slave responded. Rather than overcome the fear of death, they merely moved the object of the question from this world to another. They gave up hope of overcoming the master, accepted their position as slaves, embraced their weakness, for morality and salvation in the next world. This is the invention of slave morality, manifested as heaven in Christian philosophy or the ideal world in Platonic philosophy.<br />

Next is Negated Negating Negativity and The Last Man.<br />
<br />
These &quot;good and just&quot; slaves seek to preserve. All human action is destruction and creation, but the slave, deluded into thinking they know what is moral and good, don't allow destruction. They can not accept change. They have what they think is moral, and that must be preserved at all cost. No longer can we overcome ourselves or the world; this can only result in the degeneration of human beings into the last man.<br />

Thus, we offer the plan:<br />
<br />
The US Federal Government will offer a security guarantee to the governments of Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, Lebanon, and the Palestinian Authority not to try to fix anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
This action is a denial of the world and truth, but it brings us to revelation that the death of god brings freedom. We accept the impossibility of fixing the world and in doing so move beyond debilitating pessimism to become free spirits.<br />

Next is Nothingness.<br />
<br />
The negative will isolate multiple scenarios for nuclear war, or else they'll explain how we're oppressing women, the Orient, African Americans, Palestinians, and I'm sure many other groups beside; but you won't be surprised to hear that We. Don't. Care. While the negative posits abstract values outside human beings and then asks us to lay down our lives for them, we demand precisely the opposite: You must lay down your life for nothing, you must die for nothing. You must engage in that First Fight to the death and risk dying. We may die, that is a definite possibility, but only when we've done this can we live life.<br />
