<br />
<br />
<br />
2. The current international system of aid and development is hierarchical and creates gender binaries<br />

<br />
Framed in its own set of binary…it has traditionally been constructed<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Peterson and runyan 93<br />
<br />
The gendered division of power…are rendered practically invisible<br />
<br />
<br />

Cuomo 96<br />
<br />
Feminist ethical questions about war…practically and theoretically insufficient<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Parrish 01<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Study of the impacts of gender upon international relations are key to understanding world events<br />
Peterson and runyan 93<br />
<br />
Finally, gender-sensitive studies improve…in nonsustainable fashion<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gender in Afghanistan<br />
1. Afghanistan’s treatment of women is horrible, the highly politicized nature of gender there has made it the pet project of the feminist movement, this makes our aff the critical test case<br />

<br />
In Afghanistan, the role of women and…realm of religious interpretations<br />

<br />
Continuing insecurity, the use of force…centre to establish legitimacy<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Domestic violence is the root cause of international violence<br />
Peterson and runyan 93<br />
<br />
The assumption that violence…no interdependent relations<br />
<br />
<br />

Plan: The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan by replacing the current poppy eradication policies with a program modeled on the Senslis Council’s Poppy for Medicine licensing program.. As part of the implementation of this program, the United States federal Government should offer a substantial increase in foreign assistance dedicated to: cooperative association between Afghanistan and the rest of the international community, coordination of international development agencies, compulsory economic diversification, project participant engagement, an evaluation phase, and microcredit for economic diversification.<br />
