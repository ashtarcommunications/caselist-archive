Judge: D-Heidt:<br />
<br />
Hezbollah 1nc Frontline:<br />
<br />
1. The aff’s claim of a proxy relationship between Syria and Hezbollah is outdated—Syria no longer has any control.<br />
El Hokayam, 20007,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.twq.com/07spring/docs/07spring_elhokayem.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.twq.com/07spring/docs/07spring_elhokayem.pdf</a><br />
”terms such as proxy and clint... hizballah is pro-syrian.”<br />
<br />
2. Syrian crackdown on Hezbollah causes a backlash and escalation of conflict.<br />
washington institute, 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templatec04.php?cid=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templatec04.php?cid=18</a><br />
”hizballah is... unprecedented “explosion.”<br />
<br />
4. Iran will fill in for Syria.<br />

”return to the status... israel’s north.”<br />
<br />
5. No risk of escalating Hezbollah attacks-rocket scares are IDF lies.<br />
Zvi Bar’el, 2004<br />
”how did the 8,000 grow into 11,00...new budget book.”<br />
<br />
6. Syria won’t agree-return of the golan is a prerequisite to the cessation of syrian support of hezbollah.<br />

CONSULT NATO<br />
<br />
Text: The United states federal government should propose that it should...<br />
<br />
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for binding consultation. The united states federal government should support the prposal during consultation. The united states federal government should abide by the results of consultation. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
The disposition of our counterplan is logical limited conditionality-the negative gets to run one counterplan, and they can revert to the status quo at any time. The squo must always be a logical policy option to prevent a policymaker from being forced to implement a bad policy-dispositionality is illogical because proving the counterplan is bad does not prove that the plan is good.<br />
<br />
It’s not topical – the cp tests the word resolved which means to make a firm decision about, it also tests the word should which is used to express obligation or duty, counterplans that test the resolution are key to predictable negative ground.<br />
<br />
Consultation counterplans are legitimat enegative ground on a fopo topic, it offsets the aff adv of selecting the grouhnd, is limited by net benefit literature, and the aff should be prepared to defend unilateral action. Even if we lose this, theory shouldn’t be a voting issue, rejecting the arg is sufficient, any other alternative causes substantive crowd out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The net benefit is NATO cohesion:<br />
Nato is at a critical turning point because of a lack of consultation-a renewed commitment is critical to cohesion.<br />
renee de nevers, 2007, International Security, Nato’s international security role in the terrorist era, pg. 34-66, project muse<br />
“This examination of NATO’s... commitment to NATO.”<br />
<br />
Prior consultation is necessary to prevent alliance collapse.<br />
Beatice Heuser, 92, “What Nuclear Strategy for Post cold-war europe?”<br />
”existing threats and risks... the smaller allies.”<br />
<br />
Collapse of nato causes multiple escalatory nuclear wars.<br />
John s. Duffiel, 94, “Nato’s functions after the Cold War,”<br />
<br />
”Initiatl analyses of NATO’s... existence of nuclear weapos.:”<br />
