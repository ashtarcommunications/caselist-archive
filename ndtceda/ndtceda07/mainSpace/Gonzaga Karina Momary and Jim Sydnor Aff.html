American predominance prevents these… the United States back in again<br />

<br />
CRITICISMS OF AGGRESSIVE AMERICAN POLICIES TOWARDS IRAN RELY ON AN IMAGE OF IRAN AS A NOBLE SAVAGE THAT LEGITIMIZES THE AYATOLLAH’S SEXIST, RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC POLICIES AND THE VERY REAL EFFECT OF IRAN’S SUPPORT FOR MURDEROUS TERRORIST ATTACKS.<br />
