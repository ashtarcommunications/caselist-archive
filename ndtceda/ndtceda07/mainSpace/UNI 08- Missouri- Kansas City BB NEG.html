Ban Dumping Counterplan<br />
<br />
Text- The Untied States Federal Government should ensure export prices for cotton capture the full cost of production, including the cost of marketing and a reasonable profit. The United States Federal Government should establish a supply management system for cotton including price floors, set aside and/or quota systems designed to prevent the export of cotton below the cost of production. <br />
