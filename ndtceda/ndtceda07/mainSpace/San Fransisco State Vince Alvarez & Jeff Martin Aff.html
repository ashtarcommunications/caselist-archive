Currently the United States is committed to a nuclear free Middle East, it seeks to achieve these goals mainly through the application of the NPT.<br />
Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation 2007 (Washington, DC April 19, 2007 [Paper released at the 2007 PrepCom held in Vienna, Austria on April 19, 2007] US State Department <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.state.gov/t/isn/rls/other/87984.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/t/isn/rls/other/87984.htm)</a><br />
The United States remains … nuclear nonproliferation rules.<br />
<br />
Growing energy demand is already forcing Middle Eastern countries to look for nuclear technology in the international market.<br />
Webb 2008 (Simon, analyst for Reuters, “Middle East Speeds up Shift to Nuclear Power” January 21st 2008)<br />
Oil near $100 and rapid … options, including coal.<br />
<br />
Therefore we are resolved that: The United States federal government should increase its constructive engagement with the governments of Afghanistan, Iran, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, and Syria, by offering them a security guarantee and foreign assistance in the form of providing them with nuclear technology.<br />

Contention Two: Racism<br />
International nuclear treaty protocol in particular sustains nuclear “haves” and “have-nots”<br />
Biswas 2001 (Shampa, Prof of Politics @ Whitman College), Alternatives, Oct-Dec 2001 p. 485<br />
<br />
The anti-proliferation narrative of the status qou participates in and legitimates a variety of racist assumptions inherent in the fields of international relations and security studies. Innternational treaties constructing nuclear policy have resulted in a condition of nuclear apartheid and thru the monopoly on nuclear violence the provide it sustains the unjust hegemony of a few nuclear states.<br />

CONTENTION 3: WARMING<br />
Global warming will cause water shortages, famine, and dictators<br />
Gelbspan 1997 (Ross, journalist for the Boston Globe, “The heat is on” 156-7)<br />
<br />
Water shortages will hit the Middle East the hardest and cause armed conflict<br />
Wolf 1996 (Aaron, Prof of Geography @ Alabama U, July 10)<br />
<br />
CONTENTION 4: SOLVENCY<br />
The best way to fight global warming is to use nuclear power, the affirmative plan action enables an overall decrease in fossil fuel consumption.<br />
Llanos 2005 (Miguel, MSNBC reporter July 7 2005. “Hot idea: Fight warming with nuclear power)<br />
The growing pressure … 10 years ago,” he said.<br />
<br />
The US should stop biding its time and embrace a multi-nuclear world it is key to stability.<br />
Davis 2000 (Jay, Sponsor Defense Threat Reduction Agency “Nuclear Multipolarity and Stability” Institute for Defense Analysis)<br />
Moreover, in the current …reassurance, dissuasion, and compellence.<br />
<br />
Given the current political climate in the Middle East, it is a particular area that would benefit from a multinuclear situation. These are not just questions of counterbalancing but of creating situations where informed political decision making can occur.<br />
Davis 2000 (Jay, Sponsor Defense Threat Reduction Agency “Nuclear Multipolarity and Stability” Institute for Defense Analysis)<br />
One of those is the …especially U.S. military presence.<br />

We critique heteronormativity in traditional international relations scholarship and in traditional academic debating. We suggest that the results of heteronormativity have resulted in the structuring of terrorism and queerness in similar ways. informed by queer pedagogy, we attempt to &quot;interrupt these discourses.&quot; We believe that our performance is an example of such an interruption.<br />
<br />
We do a performance in the 1AC. We start out reading from Barnett Rubin about the current political situation in Afghanistan (cite below), Barnett then says that the reason he knows these things is that he was kidnapped by Taliban soldiers and turned in to their sex slave. We make arguments about queer theory and performance, and say that aesthetic practices are extremely salient in the context of our engagement with the Middle East and the War on Terror. The impact of our argument is heteronormativity. We say that the way that we should confront heteronormativity is through a pedagogy of interruption.<br />
<br />
While we do not explicitly name authors or read cards here are some cites that we use for arguments in our affirmative:<br />
