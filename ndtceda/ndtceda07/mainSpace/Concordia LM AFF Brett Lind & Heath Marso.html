<strong>The rhetoric used by the status quo Bush administration is one of a dichotomizing division of good vs. evil. Despite current NIE reports, Bush still feels that Iran is evil and actively pursues policies of regime change.</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt">“There is one question that … lead to decades of mutual hostility.” </span><br />
<br />
<strong>The Bush strategy is to keep the public on their toes- to continue introducing potential threats and keep the world in a continuous state of war. Whether or not we actually go to war with Iran, or if they have nuclear weapons is irrelevant, the only thing that matters is that they are evil and <em>could</em> do anything to us</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>And, the emphasis on security justifies endless warfare as we attempt to secure all that we define as a threat. This justifies extinction in the long run as threats are always constructed to justify the very security we seek to keep</strong><br />

“Survival refers not only… insecurity and eventually violence.”<br />
<br />
<strong>However, this rhetoric isn’t unique to Bush. Our entire system of academia is caught up in an orientalist framework of the world. This perpetuates the so called experts who predict these doomsday scenarios and justify a forever continuation of the status quo security politics and racist depictions of the Middle East</strong><br />
