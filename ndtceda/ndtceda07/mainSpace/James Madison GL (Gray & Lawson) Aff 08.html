 <h2 id="toc1"><a name="Shirley R1 – Afghan Land Mines-PLAN"></a>PLAN</h2>
 The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan through offering a security guarantee that the United States will no longer lay mines or drop cluster bombs in the territorial borders known as Afghanistan. Plan will include an increase in foreign assistance through providing technical support, security for de-mining activities, coordination, and training to be <strong>CONDITIONED</strong> on the government of Afghanistan participating in de-mining activates. <br />
In Afghanistan people die or are permanently disabled from landmines every day. You wouldn’t wish their experiences on your worst enemy.<br />

If you think our impacts are just rhetorical know that 12 innocent people die unnecessarily a day in Afghanistan from land mines.<br />

<br />
<br />
If this wasn’t bad enough, the U.S. has dropped hundreds of thousands of cluster bombs on Afghanistan and will continually do so. These weapons are particularly insidious because many of the bomblets fail to detonate making them ticking time bombs, each capable of killing a person.<br />

Do not allow yourself to ignore these atrocities. Brushing off our impacts denies your humanity and trivializes their pain. <br />

To vote for the affirmative is a move to empathize with the pain of the people affected by landmines which is key to avoiding policy paralysis and allows us to transcend the barbaric, racist and ethnocentric policies that allow for such brutality outlined in this speech.<br />

Given the course of human history it is uniquely important for us as American to recognize other people’s pain so that we may empathize with them and find our own humanity. Failure to do so prevents us from challenging the dehumanizing policies of the Bush administration, threatening our very survival as a species. <br />

<strong>And The U.S. must do the plan.</strong>  <br />
