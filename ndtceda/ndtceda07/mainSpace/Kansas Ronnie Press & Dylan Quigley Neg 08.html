2NR: Consult Russia<br />
<br />
Crowd out CTR DA<br />
1.) The Middle East is the most important location of US Russian competition and Russian Influence is because of US non-engagement.<br />
M.K Bhadrakumar. 2007. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/Central_Asia/1B17g01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/Central_Asia/1B17g01.html</a><br />
“Of all the regions, it is the Middle East…..Washington was patently interested.”<br />
<br />
2.) Russia’s foreign policy elites have a zero sum view of competition with the US especially with Syria and Iran<br />
Ariel Cohen. 2007 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/RussiaandEurasia/bg2048.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/Research/RussiaandEurasia/bg2048.cfm</a><br />
“ Russia’s foreign strategy is driven by…..particularly Iran and Syria.”<br />
<br />
3.) Foreign Policy elites will backlash to the plan by destroying cooperation on CTR.<br />
Celeste Wallander 2002. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://armscontrol.org/act/2002_01-02/wallanderjanfeb02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://armscontrol.org/act/2002_01-02/wallanderjanfeb02.asp</a><br />
“The greater risk is that Putin will face……their post ABM relationship will grow.”<br />
<br />
Consult Russia<br />
NRC Shell<br />
The United States Federal Government should enter into a process of binding consultation with the Russian Federation through the NATO-Russia Council on the issue of Iranian proliferation and nuclear facilities use. The United States federal government will continuously advocate that the United States federal government should offer Iran economic incentives and a non-aggression pact in exchange for a verifiable agreement by Iran to limit their nuclear facilities to civilian use throughout the consultation but will allow the Russia Federation to propose changes to implementation. All of the Russian Federation proposals will be accepted. If Russia agrees, the United States Federal Government should offer Iran economic incentives and a non-agression pact in exchange for a verifiable agreement by Iran to limit their nuclear facilities to civilian use.<br />
<br />
The foundation for US Russia partnership exists but us failure to use the NRC to genuinely consult Russia on key issues risks breaking down of US Russian relations. The plan and counterplan can’t solve.<br />
Smith 2006. “Russia and NATO since 1991: From the Cold War through cold peace partnerships?” pg. 99-114-120<br />
“Notwithstanding this, and in view of what…..foreign country since 1991.”<br />
<br />
Genuine consultation key to stabilize the NATO-Russia council and create a framework for future cooperation. The plan and the perm kill US Russian relations.<br />

1.) North Korea will demand greater concessions in response to us concessions to Iran<br />
Sanger 2006. New York Times june 24 lexis<br />
“But the delay, along with warnings……of the 1994 accord.”<br />
<br />
2.) New Demands by north korea will tank the efficacy of the agreement.<br />

“Hill’s visit should be viewed…..tons of aid away.”<br />
<br />
3.) The New deal with north korea will end their nuclear weapons program now.<br />
