The aff utilizes suffering and conflict as a puppet---tools we bulldoze through the ballot. Using suffering for our personal benefit becomes enjoyable porn. This strips victims of agency by commodifying their suffering as an object external to them, silencing voices and perspectives. Those who refuse to play their role as victims become the ‘poor, self destructive Afghans’ who we must benefit of the community. We must respect alternative subjectivities by embracing that the act representing violence is always structured by unacknowledged interests; never an objective description of the Real. We should allow the other to speak for themselves.<br />

“But what of…they become iatrogenic”<br />
<br />
The Women of Afghanistan do not need us to speak for them nor act on their behalf-this is simply an attempt to assuage our guilt for their exclusion, their author<br />
<br />
Mary Anne Franks, Winter 2003 (Hypatia, Obscene Undersides: Women and evil between the Taliban and the United States, 18:1)<br />
<br />
“in a slightly…able to recognize”<br />
<br />
Their call for int’l support epitomizes an imperial speaking over the possible message of the women of Afghanistan which is autonomy not Aid to be included into the gov’t<br />

<br />
“While RAWA calls…and free Afghanistan”<br />
<br />
Ptix of pity inscribes a sense of superiority over the other that ultimately results in a deferral of action and an abdication of responsibility. Viewing becomes strangely comforting for the viewer—reject their representations.<br />
<br />
Campbell 99 (David, prof of Int’l politics in the department of politics U of Newcastle, 1999, Sovereignty and Subjectivity, Edited by Edkins, Persram, and Pin-Fat, p 21-3)<br />
<br />
“La Victimalitie assortie…can be subjected”<br />
<br />
Capitalism forced us into humanitarian operations so that it may have an alibi to further consume the trauma of third world violence and the commodification of the other’s suffering. This is the epitome of interpassivity every act of compassion only allows the reproduction of their suffering. So as to never engage the object of our desire but inject suffering as a drug to release our sentiment and construct ourselves as good subjects versus the helpless victims endlessly.<br />
<br />
Baudrillard 94 (Jean, prof of sociology @ Nanterres, The Illusion of the end, p 66-9)<br />
<br />
“We have long…to now, the…”<br />
<br />
After months of being divided on political voice on the threat of violence, the Heat sisters were forced to make a tough decision. Were they going to stay in Afghanistan and risk execution or worse? Or would they flee to Pakistan and attempt to escape the situation completely. Finally the sisters decided to split up. Alina, the sister who decided to flee, was forced out of contact with her beloved sister. After months of fearing the worst, she finally revieved word that her sister had indeed been captured by the Northern Alliance-“Woe is Me” she cried. “What am I to do? Perhaps if Northwestern BM would just talk about me more at the NDT, all of my problems would be solved. Thank god American college students are able to understand my unique plight<br />
<br />
The usage of Fictional representations allows for the development of a relationship with the victims, while escaping from the fantasies that are imposed upon us by drive to show the real. This is no a question of the plan is a good idea, it’s a question of how we’re motivated to it.<br />

Poor pop psychology to repress the Bomb. Physical manifestation of the death drive<br />

<br />
The psychological interventions…all still here, folks.<br />

Off Case Args:<br />
<br />
Insistence to help – lowering of self to pity<br />

Von Tevenar, 05 (Gudrun, Nietzsche’s Objection to Pity and Compassion)<br />

<br />
The affirmative will always be able to locate some external threat to world order. It is not a coincidence that Breaking News occurs every fifteen minutes because international politics are unpredictable. The insecurities cited by the affirmative are not unique; international terrorism is an ever-present threat, a SARS outbreak is just around the corner, killer bees are infesting our neighborhoods and there might just be poison in our children’s Halloween candy. The uncomfortable yet irresistible truth is that uncertainty and risk are part and parcel of human life. Rather than coming to terms with this, the affirmative encourages us to stay glued to the television screen, stocking up on duct tape and water. At issue here is not just life itself but what makes life valuable. We encourage indifference and carelessness in a world inherently characterized by insecurity in an attempt to reclaim joy from the affirmative’s world of paranoid tiptoeing.<br />

<br />
One must begin with Nietzsche’s idea…calculation of risks and benefits.<br />
<br />
The realization of their ideal world of peace is the foundation of the will to annihilate current existence<br />

Zupancic 03 (same, p. 70)<br />
<br />
I should point out…a different configuration<br />
<br />
Those who cannot cope with suffering should be left behind<br />
<br />
Vantagimer 95 ((Gudrun, Nietzsche’s Objection to Pity and Compassion)<br />
<br />
With the above in mind…alleged wider significance<br />
<br />
Those who say Nietzsche is a Nazi is an incorrect misunderstanding<br />

2nr Strategy:<br />
<br />
Orient yourself to the inevitable violence of the world<br />
<br />
1 – pain is not real, existential construct<br />
<br />
2 – white, question of ethics<br />
<br />
3 – Perm isn’t allowed. New contextualization! 1ac proves that they framed in terms of responsibility<br />

The intensification and quickening of the exchange of information and images does not preclude us from still developing a sense of reality that directly contests domination. Even if they winthat the distinction between reality and virtuality has been blurred, this does not demand their epistemological nihilism, but magnifies the potential of dissident politix to transcend traditional boundaries. </span><br />

The aff is a fundamental forfeiture of ethical responsibility. Their focus on external manifestations of U.S. imperialism misses the point as it fails to address a more important priority—that we are occupants of stolen land and benefactors of genocide, Churchill ‘96<br />
This is a question of ethics—participants in genocide can not absolve themselves of responsibility by appealing to the lesser of two evils. They are obligated to deconnect from the system, Churchill, ‘03<br />
CE issues from the imperialist motives of U.S. colonialism. Their assistance to the middle east is only a new era in the wilderness, keeping in fact the same racism and violent logic of manifest destiny, Pan ‘04<br />
Terminal impact is extinction. Colonialism can’t stop itself, Friedberg ’00.<br />
Our alternative is to kick the United States off the planet. This is an ethical first priority which must precede consideration of the aff. Their best intentions are corrupted by a legacy of genocide. Decolonialization is a precondition to genuine social change. Skipping this step can only make us more comfortable in our colonial views, Churchill ‘96<br />
