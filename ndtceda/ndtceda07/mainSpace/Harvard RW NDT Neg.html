 <br />
No Golan war<br />
a. domestic politics deter<br />
Ma’oz, 9/6/07, Syria’s role in the region mediator, a century foundation response<br />
Similarly, at the end of that war… end of Olmert’s political career.<br />
b. fear of Hezbollah retaliation<br />
International Crisis Group, 4/10/07, Restarting Israeli-Syrian Negotiations, Middle East Report No. 63<br />
Strikingly, in recent Crisis Group meetings, both Israeli and Syrian… Hizbollah or Syria.<br />
c. Syria won’t ignite <br />
International Crisis Group, 4/10/07, Restarting Israeli-Syrian Negotiations, Middle East Report No. 63<br />
Prospect that Syria will provoke… extraordinary for a state.<br />
d. not coming now<br />
al Husseini, 2/26/08, The Anticipated Regional War Will Not Take Place<br />
A phone call with a well-informed Western source… Jordan do not want war.<br />
e. neither Israel nor enemies want war in ME<br />
al Husseini, 2/26/08, The Anticipated Regional War Will Not Take Place<br />
This is why there is no prospect… concern is Iran.<br />
f. war unlikely—history proves Syria prefers proxies<br />
Ben-David, 3/10/08, In a cold war with Iran can Syria become Israel’s ‘China card’?, Jerusalem Post<br />
The good news from the intelligence forecast… threat of nuclear capability.<br />
No prospect for a peace deal till after the presidential election and the election solves the impact<br />
Jewish Review, 2/29/08, Israel’s 2008 Plans: Engage Syria, Palestinian peace, Upgrade US ties<br />
The Israeli intelligence assessment, however, is that Syria… making any substantial moves.<br />

CP Text<br />
The USFG should offer to the government of Syria that the United States Federal Government will monitor and report compliance under the conditions agreed upon a Syrian/Israeli non-aggression deal with an observer force if the government of Syria concludes a non-aggression deal with the government of Israel over the Golan Heights and agrees to respect Lebanese sovereignty and support a political compromise with Lebanon.<br />
US must condition its support for Golan negotiations on an agreement to respect Lebanese sovereignty—that’s key to prevent Lebanon from being sold out in negotiations AND build trust that facilitates Golan cooperation. <br />
Makovsky, 1/9/08, “The Lebanon Red Line”<br />
When President George W. Bush arrives in Israel… but it is its prerequisite.<br />
US must act to stabilize Lebanon or conflict and terrorism are inevitable<br />
Sullivan, May/June 2007, “Levantine Labyrinths”, National Interest, Issue 89<br />
Lebanon is caught in a vortex of sectarian… particularly by Iran.<br />
Renewed Lebanese civil war causes regional escalation<br />
Aikman, 7/20/07, Implications: A Journal from the Trinity Forum, Another Middle East War?<br />
But in the Middle East region, very few events are isolated from each other…military response against Syria proper.<br />
Syria has considerable influence to prevent civil war in Lebanon; encouraging them to do so is key to avert a war which would collapse Syria and undercut Golan negotiations<br />
The Daily Star, 1/23/08, “A Failed Lebanon Would Impose Heavy Costs on Syria, Too” <br />
It is still not too late for Damascus to play… allies to be more flexible.<br />
Saudi DA<br />
US Saudi relations strong because of US defense commitments<br />
Hersh, 3/5/07, The Redirection: Annals of National Security, The New Yorker<br />
In the past year, the Saudis...“up for grabs.”<br />
Plan hurts relations—SA and the US are unified in opposition to Syria—the Saudis have opposite interests from Syria on every issue and fear increased Iranian influence through Syrian proxy<br />
IHT, 3/24/08, “Syria hosting arab summit riven by deep differences, pro-US leaders reluctant to attend”<br />
Syria is putting on a gracious face as host… its influence in the region.<br />
Percieved relations decline causes Saudi prolif, nuclear coup, terrorism, regional arms race and collapse of global economy<br />
McDowell, November 2003, “Is Saudi Arabia a Nuclear Threat?”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/McDowell03.pdf" rel="nofollow">__www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research /theses/McDowell03.pdf__</a><br />
The security umbrella provided by the U.S. military… war on terrorism.<br />
Troop Tradeoff DA<br />
Iraq stable now bc troop levels but still risk of backsliding—plan causes troop reductions and civil war<br />
McCain and Lieberman, 1/10/08, Wall Street Journal, “The Surge Worked”<br />
Instead, conditions in that country have been… war to a successful outcome.<br />
Golan requires lots of troops<br />
Phillips, 2/1/96, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/research/middleeast/bg1066.cfm" rel="nofollow">__www.heritage.org/research /middleeast/bg1066.cfm__</a><br />
The Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping… Europe or South Korea.<br />
Plans troops would have to come from Iraq<br />
Yglesias, 4/5/04, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=collateral_damage" rel="nofollow">__www.prospect.org/cs/articles ?article=collateral_damage__</a><br />
To be sure, there is no strict trade-off between money… to preserve order over there.<br />
Iraq civil war à global escalation to nuke war<br />
Corsi, 07, “The Late Great USA”, WorldNet Daily<br />
If a broader war breaks out… World Wars I and II began.<br />

 <br />
Case<br />
No war over the Golan—fear of escalation<br />
AJI, 9/19/07, Associated Press<br />
W. Patrick Lang, former head of Mideast… go-ahead from the U.S.<br />
Israeli bombing reduced tensions over the Golan<br />
Mitnick, 10/17/07, Washington Times<br />
Israeli-Syrian military tension on the Golan Heights… had in the summertime.<br />
Strength of the IDF deters Syria from participating in the war<br />
Ben Israel, 5/11/07, Summer War Unlikely, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ynetnews.com/" rel="nofollow">__www.ynetnews.com__</a><br />
The most important defense-related question… not be automatically disqualified.<br />
Conflict with Israel is key in rationalizing the tactics and existence of Bashar—the plan is rejected and only emboldens Syria<br />
Seliktar, 2/26/08, Ignorance Cannot Be Realistic: A Critique of the Mearsheimer-Walt Thesis, Turkish Weekly<br />
The regime’s adamant rejection of a comprehensive… continues existing policies.<br />
The Syrian Regime exists because of opposition to Israel—they have no reason to say yes to the plan<br />
Benson, 3/24/08, The Huffington Post, “Engaging Syria”<br />
Another potential point of discussion between… Golan back are genuine.<br />

Voter: Fairness &amp; Education<br />
<br />
Metaphysics is totalitarian. Totalitarian systems claim to explain, definitively, the historical process, and understand some proposition - something as true<br />
<br />
Lefort 02 (Claude, An International Quarterly of SS Volume 69 Number 2 Summer p.621-656)<br />
<br />
Let us briefly recall…..great men in history<br />
<br />
Dogmatic truth/Self-evident thought should be rejected in favor of radical thinking<br />
<br />
Deleuze 68 Difference and Repitition 131-134<br />
<br />
Thoughtlessness is the worst form of totalitarianism because it displaces intentionality.<br />
<br />
Arendt 74 The Life of Mind 3-5<br />
<br />
The 1AC demonstrates the capture of the war machine by the state, voting neg for creative lines of flight<br />
<br />
Deleuze and Guattari 87 A Thousand Plateaus 230-231<br />
<br />
Aff is a fascist war machine – microfascism turns into macrofascism – lines of flight turn into lines of death<br />
<br />
Deleuze and Guattari 77<br />
<br />
Vote negative in favor of thinking – a point of transcendence. Adopt a Socratic form of inquiry, rather than the dogmatism of the 1AC<br />
<br />
Arendt 74 The Life of the Mind 171 -175<br />
<br />
Block Strategy:<br />
<br />
Psychoanalysis moves dogmatism<br />
<br />
Dooam 95<br />
<br />
Duty of the judge = link of dogmatism<br />
<br />
Without the new – totalitarianism is manifested. By determining a subject’s meaning through a symbolic order<br />
<br />
Booanmour 99<br />
<br />
Necessary duty is what Deleuze says<br />
<br />
Recognition is problematic – who is recognized? What is recognition? The federal government still arbitrarily defines terms<br />
<br />
War machine is a metaphor to understand the 1AC<br />
<br />
Desire and Lack are not relevant<br />
<br />
Perm doesn’t work. The new lines of thought must be total. If you agree with Socratic questioning, vote negative<br />
<br />
Deleuze 68<br />
<br />
Apparatus of capture link is conceded<br />
<br />
Zionism is always bad is a conceded link<br />
<br />
Eichman is an example of dogmatism that lead to mass genocide<br />
<br />
Overidentification is a link of exteriority/internality<br />
<br />
State becomes implementation of totalitarianism – that’sDeleuze<br />
<br />
Expose the values underlying the affirmative, not whether the negative is inside or outside of some order<br />
<br />
We don’t need to “solve” the case<br />
<br />
Impacts should be viewed in terms of the risk of totalitarianism<br />
<br />
Foucault<br />
<br />
Voting negative dissolves the advantages<br />
<br />
Proposition-Solution mentality = dogmatism<br />
<br />
<br />
2nr Strategy:<br />
<br />
Concepts used by the plan is a link (legitimacy/democracy)<br />
<br />
The plan isn’t the psychoanalysis that they claim<br />
<br />
The concept of the subject is conditioned by language<br />
<br />
Vote negative to reject dogmatism<br />
<br />
Extend Foucault – we have to reject totalitarianism<br />
<br />
The refusal to question leads to the harms of the 1AC<br />
<br />
Autistic people aren’t inside of their view of the subject because they can’t speak – they are able to be eliminated<br />
<br />
Constantly using the state apparatus is dogmatism – working outside of this<br />
<br />
Concepts expose uncertainty, it is not an action
