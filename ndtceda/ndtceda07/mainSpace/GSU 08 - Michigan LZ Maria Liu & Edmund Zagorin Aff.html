US cotton subsidies create incentives for overproduction, causing a market glut which depresses the global price and disadvantaging cotton producers in developing countries<br />

<br />
And US cotton producers will inevitably lose their comparative advantage and succumb to economic pressure regardless of continuing subsidies<br />

Cotton producers are already anticipating subsidy cuts and are shifting to other crops<br />

Aberrantly high cotton prices means that price-linked export subsidies extremely low?transition NOW is key<br />
Ryan ?8 Missy Ryan Reuters February 14, 2008 ?U.S. is expected to lose WTO fight on cotton subsidies?<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Congress should eliminate all annual subsidies defined by the World Trade Organization as ?amber box? in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 for upland cotton, as well as all domestic subsidies for upland cotton defined by the World Trade Organization as ?green box? on the basis that said subsidies are found to distort market prices for upland cotton by the World Trade Organization, and should further remove the user subsidy on upland cotton of four cents per pound. We?ll clarify.<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Trade War<br />
<br />
Cotton export subsidies are illegal under the WTO? Brazil has won a case against the US authorizing billions of dollars worth of sanctions unless the US removes them<br />
<br />
NYT ?8 June 4 ?Brazil to Seek Sanctions Over US Cotton Subsidies?<br />
<br />
This case is a flash-point for disputes in the Doha round of trade talks<br />
Lynne and Ryan ?7 Jonathan Lynne and Missy Ryan, Reuters ?US Must Do More to Reform Cotton Subsidies- WTO? December 18, 2007<br />
<br />
Absent the plan, this dispute will escalate into a full-fledged trade war, devastating the US economy and triggering retaliation against other globalized economies<br />

The Brazil cotton precedent has already caused other nations to file more cases against other subsidies?there is only a risk that specific commitments on cotton subsidies will allow for trade progress on Doha<br />

Finally, don?t be fooled by kritiks written by well-off ivory tower academics that claim to speak for the marginalized--- most residents in developing countries WANT subsidies to be reduced so that they can raise their standard of living through market access. The alternative to free trade is unfair trade<br />
