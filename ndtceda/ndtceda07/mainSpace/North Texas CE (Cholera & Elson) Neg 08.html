Roger Soeagele 2002, International Relations and the ‘Third Debate’<br />
<br />
“However, Ashley’s arguments about meaning…discourse is utopian, relativist, and irrational.”<br />
<br />

Robert Branham 1995 “I was gone on debating’: Malcolm X’s Prison Debates and Public Confrontations”, Winter, vol 31, no 3, p. 117<br />
<br />

<br />
“A second norm is relevance, a belief…by a few self-interested parties.”<br />
<br />
<u><strong>Case Cards</strong></u><br />
<br />
Baudrillard’s critique is naïve and contradictory, does not correspond with reality, and is normatively useless<br />
James Marsh 1995 Critique, Action, and Liberation, p, 292-293<br />
<br />
“Such an account, however…movies, television, and radio.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Baudrillard’s critique is empirically denied by the Gulf War<br />
Christopher Norris 1992 Uncritical Thoery: Postmodernism, Intellectuals, and the Gulf War, p. 11<br />

Baudrillard’s alternative allows conservative ideological distortion<br />
Christopher Norris 1990, What’s Wrong with Postmodernism, p. 190-1<br />
<br />
“Baudrillard’s alternative is stated…promoting the work of ideological mystification.”<br />
<br />
If there is no truth, then all standards for comparing arguments are arbitray. All rational argument collapses. The K can’ tprove that AIDS isn’t caused by beign gay or that the Holocaust was more thatn a Jewish conspiracy<br />
Roger Kimball 2000 Expierments Against Reality, p 20-1<br />
<br />
“In his book Overcoming…or scientific, forensic, historical, mathematical.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Criticism of capitalism kills innocents and makes conditions worse<br />

<br />
“There are many contradictions;…there is a need to rethink this idea.”<br />
<br />
The nature to seek domination is inevitable, in non-capitalist systems the drive to acquire money is repaced by the drive to exterminate<br />
James Wilson, The Morality of Capitalism, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cis.org.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.cis.org.au</a><br />
<br />
“Capitalism also has another advantage that…of military might or political power.”<br />
<br />
Reducing everything to power relations causes genocide<br />
John Ellis 1997 Literature Lost, p 163-4<br />
<br />
“Everything that is valuable in a society…use of power behind the window dressing of laws.”<br />
<br />
Postmodernism destroys the only tool capable of combating anti-Semitism-rational debate cant stop an irrational ideology, only a strong belief in comparing assumptions to an objective historical record will solve<br />
Samuel Fleishacker 2006, “Hating Science; Hating the Jews: What’s Philosopically Interesting About Anti-Semitism”, www.engageonline.org.uk/journal/index.php?journal_id=5&amp;article_id=18<br />
<br />
“a) If my account…of anti-semitism may dry up.”<br />
<br />
<br />

Haim Gordon and Rivca Gordon 1995, Satre and Evil: Guidelines for a Struggle, p. xi-xiii<br />
<br />
“We also believe in the existence…thought, no.”<br />
<br />
Without objective truth, there is no reason to endorse the K—why bother acting ethically?<br />
Douglas Groothuis 2006, “What are some pitfalls inherent in the Postmodern Outlook?”, www.ivpress.com/questioningfaith/resources/postmodernism.php<br />
<br />
“Inasmuch as postmodernist thinkers such as…if not a total collapse.”<br />
<br />
Terrorism turns their critique—no matter how violent our politics seem, they are better than the death of politics that terrorism represents<br />
Michael ignatieff 2002, Social Research<br />
<br />
“La politique du pire does away…them should be relations of war.”<br />
<br />
Our Impact outweighs—anti-Semitism is just as pervasive as racism or sexism but isn’t combated because academics rationaliz it as a symptom of something else<br />
Samuel Fleischacker 2006, “Hating Science; Hating the Jews; What’s Philosophically Interesting About Anti-Semitism”, www.engageonline.org.uk/journal/index.php?journal_id=5&amp;article_id=18<br />
