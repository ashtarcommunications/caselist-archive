 <br />
Because of the suffering resulting from current paradigms of water management and global geopolitics, we affirm that the United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of the Palestinian Authority and it should include offering them a security guarantee.<br />
<br />
This year's resolution takes on a plethora of meanings: it is a piece of language traditionally imbued with specific meanings in relation to policies. We take a different approach, viewing the resolution as not merely referential but a point of power and discursive enactment. The resolution can mean different things, not necessarily that we should act as the United States government offering a security guarantee. We look to alternate interpretations of the words in the resolution and take a different approach. Our enactment and reinterpretation of the words in the resolution is not a mistake. We take a postcolonial approach, recognizing that we must speak of the United States and security guarantees, but we do not endorse these institutions. We as people, as a part of the United States, wish to constructively engage the Palestinian Authority and discourses of the status quo by giving a security guarantee to emphasize an unconditional affirmation of a human right to water.<br />

 EU CP: (1) doesn’t solve US avoidance (2) we have responsibility (3) politics DA mobilizes forces of security (or something similar) (4) perm do both (5) perm do CP (6) perm do CP then plan (7) perm do CP (8) conditionality bad<br />
<br />
Framework: (1) reconsider resolution – give it new meaning Shapiro deeply political and postcolonial (2) we meet the burden of the res – give best ground and increase creativity (3) should is a more important term than resolved (4) policy fails without critical reflection (McChesney 96) (5) roleplaying à totalitarianism (6) we provide lots of ground (7) creativity good (8) resolutionality (?) (9) gatekeepers – Bleiker<br />
<br />
Security K: (1) we redefine security – link T (2) we are best stance to change (3) this is a double turn with framework (4) status quo is security (5) we challenge security (6) perm do alternative (7) perm do both (8) perm do aff + reject other security (9) security is a disad to the alt (10) negotiation solves conflict (11) alternative does not solve discourse, so their link is non-unique (12) case is a disad<br />
<br />
RRW: (1) no link – plan doesn’t really happen (my potentially inaccurate paraphrase) (2) link turn – our advocacy challenges geopolitical thought and violence (3) no impact – racism and imperialism (4) aff solves the impact (5) prolif discourse – Mutimer<br />

Plan: The USFG should increase its constructive engagement with the Hamas led Palestinian Authority. This increase in constrictive engagement will include aiding the Hamas lead Palestinian Authority an increase in foreign assistance by repealing the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006.<br />
<br />
1AC w/ cites:<br />
1. US congress has passed legislation that cuts of assistance to the Hamas – led Palestinian Authority. This legislation declared the Palestinian Authority a “terrorist sanctuary” – Robinson May 23, 2006; “House approves Palestinian Sanctions Bill Opposed by Bush” “by a 361 to 37…and Palestinian officials”<br />
<br />
2. Next, this legislation was signed into law by Bush on Dec. 21, 2006<br />
Bush 2k6 “President’s statements on S. 2370, the “Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006” “Today, I have… The Palestinian Authority”<br />
<br />
3. Discourse of “terrorist sanctuaries” promotes a series of counter-terrorism strategies that enhance the biopolitical and hegemonic control of the state –<br />
Jackson 2006 “The State and Terrorist Sanctuaries: A critical analysis” [Richard; “From a discourse… distinctly ideological purpose]<br />
<br />
ADV 1 : Discursive language<br />
1. Repealing the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism legislation is important – labeling of Hamas as a terrorist sanctuary spills over. It creates a belief among people that Hamas is a group of evil that needs to be crushed. This label is the justification for militarism and torture at home and abroad<br />
Fonkem Achankeng 2007 “terrorism as political manipulation” “when the united states…are against us”<br />
<br />
2. labeling of terrorism creates an artificial struggle over identity – the sense of danger and fear inscribed by these labels leads to a militarism and constructed lines between superiority and inferiority – Campbell 98 – “writing security; Uniteed States foreign policy and the politics of identity” “More recently, with…Cold war in particular”<br />
<br />
3. These labels are used as a justification for neoliberal, imperialist wars. They represent the basis for United States Genocidal expansion<br />
Nikhil Singh 2006; “The afterlife of fascism” south atlantic quarterly 105:1 Winter [Moreover, like Mill’s.. these United States”]<br />
<br />
4. Events following the Hamas victory in the election prove our argument. The United States has aligned with Israel and Abbas to exterminate Hamas. The belief is that by supporting Abbas the United States can impose a more “moderate” Islamic government in Palestine favorable to the United States. The result will be a genocide of the Hamas people<br />
Chomsky; July 30, 2007 [ <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=107&amp;itemID=13453" rel="nofollow">http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=107&amp;itemID=13453</a> ] “The death of…Scholar Richard Falk”<br />
<br />
5.Division between good and bad, support of the moderate and isolation of the extremists is the root of Imperialism<br />
Choudhury 2007<br />
“Terrorists and Muslims: The construction, performance, and regulation of Muslim Identities in the post 9/11 United States” “The genealogy of both… the bad muslims”<br />
<br />
6. Finally, the terminal impact to this ideology is extinction. The belief that we need to save humanity through imperialism, neoliberalism, militarism, and genocide will eventually lead to the destruction of humanity<br />
Santos 2k3<br />

<br />
Observation 2 = solvency<br />
<br />
1. Palestinian Anti terrorism act is the most draconian sanctions bill congress has ever imposed on Palestine. It limits foreign assistance and labels Palestine a terrorist sanctuary thus limiting US exports<br />
Trisha Saenger in 2006 “Palestine Elections” NH Peace Action” “In response to…West Bank and Gaza”<br />
<br />
2. The removal of sanctions and ending isolation is constructive engagement – vietname proves<br />
Tieu 1998 “A constructive engagement: The Jackson – Vanick Waiver for Vietnam” “after nineteen years… decades of isolation”<br />
<br />
3. constructive engagement is impossible without repeal of the Palestine Anti Terrorism Act. The labeling of Hamas as a terrorist organization prevents engagement<br />
Raphael Perl in 2001<br />
“Terrorism, the future, and US foreign policy” “In incidents of… or their representatives”<br />
<br />
4. Next, engagement with democratically elected Hamas government is the best hope for peace in the region. Conflict is inevitable in a world in which Hamas is isolated by the United States (Ahmed Yousef; “Engage with Hamas: We earned our support” June 20, 2007 “It is not… such an outcome”<br />
<br />
5. Next – Israel Palestine issue effects all other issues or international relations<br />
Ellen Hellquist 2006; “Outlawing Hamas” The Israeli-Palestinian… the whole world”<br />
<br />
6. The repeal of the terrorist labels of the state opens up ciritical space for effective policy solutions through constructive engagement<br />
Jackson 2007 “constructing enemies: ‘islamic terrorism’ in political and academic discourse” “In constrast to… and non sensical<br />
