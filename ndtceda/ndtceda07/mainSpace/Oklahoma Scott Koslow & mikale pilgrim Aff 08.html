Each of us remembers September 11: The footage of the towers, the lives lost, the revelation that we can be attacked anywhere at any time. The lesson we took from this memory is telling – rather than learn to live with insecurity, we were mobilized to secure ourselves. Video surveillance, roving wiretaps, airport security, undocumented detention, we are unsafe everywhere so we need to secure every part of life.<br />

This logic of retribution is an attempt to reinscribe the moral order. We are superior to bin Laden and we must make him remember. We must brand this fact in his flesh, thus we can bring him to “reason.” This lowly being dared to hurt us, so we must make him repay his debt.<br />

<br />
We must constantly remember the events of September 11 and those who gave their lives. It is because of September 11 that we've gone to war in Afghanistan, that we've gone to war in Iraq, and that we must give up our civil liberties. We owe this to the memory of the victims.<br />

<br />
The footage of the two ... better off forgetting September 11.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This notion of indebtedness to those who died is the logic that gave birth to bad conscience. Our freedom is because of them, it is their gift to us. Therefore, we must sacrifice that freedom to repay them.<br />
<br />
We bear a debt to them, and yet they sacrificed themselves to save us. According to this logic promulgated by Bush, those who died are noble, selfless, brave – think of the passengers on flight 193 who wrestled the plane from its suicidal path – on the other hand we are weak, selfish, and scared. We must pay them back, but they are dead and we can never make up that debt. We must constantly give more and more, we must serve in the army, we must wait in airports, we must submit ourselves to constant surveillance, and still it isn't enough. We tear at ourselves to try and make this debt even, and this makes it impossible to live our own life.<br />

<br />
At this point, I can .... been a lunatic asylum!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our position is that we should forget September 11 and the morality play Bush has constructed of the noble victims and the savage terrorists. This does not literally mean dismissing from our minds those who died that day. In fact, it is the popular memory of the event which overshadows these diverse memories. This monolithic memory erects an insurmountable obstacle for critical politics, ensuring only reactionary foreign policy and the endless deferral of freedom for the sake of state security. Only forgetting creates a capacity for embracing the reality of insecurity.<br />
<br />

<br />
Of course, very much in .... the memory of the dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Only by forgetting September 11 can we focus on the present. We must kill the gods we have created so that we can live this life rather than trying to repay our infinite obligation to our ancestors.<br />

Plan: The United States Federal Government should offer a security guarantee to the government of Afghanistan to end all current or future action using the events of September 11, 2001 as justification.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our argument is not that bin Laden isn't out there or doesn't want to hurt the US. We concede that he is and he probably does. 9/11, the Madrid bombing, the assassination of Pakistani president Bhutto – all prove that terrorism is out there an we can't control it. Instead, our argument is that rather than try to control a chaotic world, we should accept this insecurity and celebrate it. Where the politics of Bush would have us locked in our bathroom, stocking up on duct tape and bottled water, we ask you to live life.<br />

The US has invaded the Middle East. We have bombed Afghanistan into the Stone age, we have torn down the government in Iraq to replace it with anarchical sectarian war, we have continuously funded Israeli colonialist policies, and we have supported terrorists, monarchs, and dictators in Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. According to John Steinbrenner and Nancy Gallagher, the US has created the “appreciable risk of ultimate doom.” We do not believe this is an accident. The US government is engaged in a messianic quest in the Middle East, by making this world into Hell they believe they can bring about the end-times and reach Heaven.<br />

The US has already selected a scenario for Armageddon and is pushing for it now. The only question now is who's going to die and whether it'll be Allah, Jesus, or God that greets the faithful at the gates of Heaven. The preferred scenario: Israel bombs Iranian nuclear sites; Iran retaliates, probably with nuclear or chemical weapons, killing millions of Israelis; this gives the US an excuse to use nuclear weapons against Iran, ushering in the end of days.<br />

<br />
It is our position that this is not the insane plotting of religious fundamentalists. All religious and moral visions engage in precisely this eschatology. They imagine an ideal world – Heaven in Christianity or the ideal state in philosophy – and then devalue this world to achieve it. What exists in this world is irrelevant, it is broken, what matters instead is being moral and achieving the ideal.<br />

<br />
These ideologues, driven by the notion that they know what is good and what is just, must see their vision achieved. The negative will present themselves as more moderate than the neoconservatives aiming at the End Times. And they are, but they engender the same process. Envision their perfect world, and anything that deviates from that, any attempt to create something new or unique, can not be allowed. They must preserve their vision at all costs.<br />

To Zarathustra, the 'noble man' ... always in the beginning of the end.<br />
<br />
Our thesis is simple: When we identify some cause or end as valuable, as a goal to which we must strive, we always devalue this world. We must destroy everything that we see as negative, because it will not fit in our utopia. We can clearly see this with Christian eschatology, but it's true of secular projects as well. The Nazi utopia could only be reached by identifying the causes of economic problems, or disease, of suffering and then eliminating them.<br />

Thus, we offer the plan:<br />
The US Federal Government will offer a security guarantee to the governments of Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, Lebanon, and the Palestinian Authority not to try to fix anything.<br />
<br />
This is a denial of any eschatological project to remake the world. Rather than devalue this world to achieve some holy vision, we ask you to join us in killing God. Only when we've done this, when we've rejected the idea of a world without suffering, crime, and hate, can we celebrate the world that does exist.<br />

The negative will tell you that we must act, that it's vital that we intervene to fix this or that problem. But they do not ask the question: Why us? Why us when the people we are imposing our will on don't want us? Why us when we so regularly intervene in the Middle East and always make the situation worse? No action will satisfy us. Once we posit a moral law, we will never achieve the utopia it demands, instead we should leave them be.<br />

The negative will isolate scenarios for nuclear war and the oppression of women, racial minorities, religious minorities, and countless others, all as a result of our plan. However, in response the the administrations messianic policy which demands that we die for god, we ask you to take the only alternative, to die for nothing. Yes, there is a risk involved in the plan, but that risk is the very essence of life. Only when we accept this world and take that risk can we live.<br />

First of all there is the overwhelming ... other than a social fiction.<br />
<br />
The creative type will always tear down the existing system to affirm themselves. They disallow us from affirming what we would like or creating ourselves, this causes parasitic forms of debate where we tear down the rules but never affirm anything. This is not a human life.<br />

Our alternative is to reject all claims to a true framework and embrace perspectivism, where we recognize all views as valid. This is key to avert Nazism.<br />

 The First Fight<br />
<br />
Human activity is characterized by negation: When I eat an apple, I negate the apple in its current form in order to create something else - energy for myself. When I build a house, I must negate a forest in it's current form to transform it into something else. However, this negation isn't enough to sustain us. This can't explain why people engage in such wholesale destruction and negation - like when we kill and die for country, honor, or love. Human behavior is unique in our desire for the recognition of others; we want respect, we want love, and we want adoration. Go back to the beginning of civilization and you will find The First Fight, a fight to the death between two humans for pure recognition.<br />

Reproduced in Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on The Phenomenology of Spirit. By Alexandre Kojeve. Assembled by Raymond Queneau. Edited by Allan Bloom. Translated from French by James H. Nichols. 1980. Pages 3-9.<br />
<br />
<br />
The First Fight gives rise to a Master and a Slave. The Slave was unable to overcome their given-reality and risk death, they were a slave to their material reality. Thus they yielded to the master. But by laboring under the fear of death they overcome it, freeing themselves from nature, from their material reality, and from their master.<br />

<br />
<br />
Next, Something has Gone Terribly Wrong.<br />
<br />
Nietzsche saw that this is not how the slave responded. Rather than overcome the fear of death, they merely moved the object of the question from this world to another. They gave up hope of overcoming the master, accepted their position as slaves, embraced their weakness, for morality and salvation in the next world. This is the invention of slave morality, manifested as heaven in Christian philosophy or the ideal world in Platonic philosophy.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Next is Negated Negating Negativity and The Last Man.<br />
<br />
These &quot;good and just&quot; slaves seek to preserve. All human action is destruction and creation, but the slave, deluded into thinking they know what is moral and good, don't allow destruction. They can not accept change. They have what they think is moral, and that must be preserved at all cost. No longer can we overcome ourselves or the world; this can only result in the degeneration of human beings into the last man.<br />

Thus, we offer the plan:<br />
<br />
The US Federal Government will offer a security guarantee to the governments of Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, Lebanon, and the Palestinian Authority not to try to fix anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
This action is a denial of the world and truth, but it brings us to revelation that the death of god brings freedom. We accept the impossibility of fixing the world and in doing so move beyond debilitating pessimism to become free spirits.<br />

<br />
<br />
Next is Nothingness.<br />
<br />
The negative will isolate multiple scenarios for nuclear war, or else they'll explain how we're oppressing women, the Orient, African Americans, Palestinians, and I'm sure many other groups beside; but you won't be surprised to hear that We. Don't. Care. While the negative posits abstract values outside human beings and then asks us to lay down our lives for them, we demand precisely the opposite: You must lay down your life for nothing, you must die for nothing. You must engage in that First Fight to the death and risk dying. We may die, that is a definite possibility, but only when we've done this can we live life.<br />
