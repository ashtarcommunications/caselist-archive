The affirmative dreams of a world without war, a lasting peace bolstered by liberal ideasl such as engagement, diplomacy, and dialogue. But we can’t just take this rosy account of international liberalism at face value. You must instead evaluate the aff within the context of the structures of global liberal governance in which the affirmative both participates and bolsters, a knowledge-power complex crucial to the way liberal states wage both peace and war. <br />
Michael Dillon, 2001, Millennium, Vol. 30, No. 1<br />
It is always…biopolitics and war. <br />
<br />
Specifically, their attempt to tame disorder through tactics of engagement is a means of brining recalcitrant and unstable states into the fold of global liberal governance. <br />
Susanne Soederberg, Associate Professor in Development Studies at Queen’s University, 2004, Third World Quarterly, Vol. 25, No. 2<br />
Third, in the post-cold war era…pre-emptive development. <br />
<br />
It’s try or die for “reject the affirmative” – biopolitics will kill us all unless we break its hold upon our minds<br />
James Bernauer, 1990, Michel Foucault’s Force of Flight: Towards an Ethics of Thought, p. 141-2<br />
