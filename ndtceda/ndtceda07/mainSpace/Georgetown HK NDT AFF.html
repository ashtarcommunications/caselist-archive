Reality exists-discourse ultimately cannot change how things are<br />
Thomas 2006- web<br />
But reality is not a function…really is yellow.<br />
Quickly delivered evidence becomes a proxy for stories with which we’re all familiar—this rapid-fire simplification promotes effective communication and understanding within political debates<br />

A. Telling political Stories It is not…typically does not. N193<br />
Accountability turn<br />
A. policy debate is not the same as debate in actual decision-making bodies- advocacy outside of these spheres avoids the negative dynamics of institutional structures<br />
Adolf G. Gunderson 2000 Political <u>Theory and Partisan Politics</u> p. 97-98<br />
In contrast to “deliberation”…requires an opponent.<br />
B. Decentralized political interdependence that is founded on accountability preserves personal value and prevents the indiscriminate destruction of life<br />

round X<br />
Foreign assistance has no exact definition<br />
Connie Veillete 11-7-07 “Foreign Aid Reform: Issues for Congress and Policy Options” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/sgp.crs/row/RL34243.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/sgp.crs/row/RL34243.pdf</a><br />
There is no precise definition of what the term foreign assistance encompasses. At its broadest level, it can refer to any and all expenditures that provide assistance to foreign countries in the areas of economic development, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, security and military assistance, governance and rule of law, health, and trade development.<br />
<br />
Substantial is in the main<br />
Words and Phrases, 2005, v.40B, p. 329<br />
Okla. 191 1. “Substantiall” means in substance; in the main; essentially; by including the material or essential part.<br />
<br />
Bilateral development assistance is the largest category of US assistance<br />
Curt Tarnoff and Larry Nowels, 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/31987.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/31987.pdf</a><br />
There are five major categories of foreign assistance:…largest category of U.S. aid.<br />
<br />
Foreign assistance is only development assistance which is economic development<br />
Congressional Budget Office, 1997 “The Role of Foreign Aid in Development”<br />
A common means of defining and measuring foreign aid….forgiveness for military loans<br />
<br />
They aren’t development assistance<br />
Adams, 12-18-07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thebulletin.org/columns/gording-adams/20071218/html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebulletin.org/columns/gording-adams/20071218/html</a><br />
This approach may make the most sense…current coordination problems.<br />
<br />
Limits – requiring the affirmative to be development assistance creates the most balanced limit – it provides adequate and supple affirmative ground yet prevents topic explosion<br />
<br />
Ground – development assistance as economic development provides links to trade off and spending and international counterplans<br />

Criticism is not enough to address suffering – we need to actively create policies to address loss of rights and oppression<br />
<br />
Katy Gardner, 1996 (Anthropology, Development and the Post-Modern Challenge, p 156-158)<br />
<br />
Yet while it is important to acknowledge…inequality and oppression.<br />
<br />
Critical theory and local action have hit a wall – we must look for fractures within the inevitable system to assert a progressive politics of compassion. The risk of cooption pales in comparison to the risk of fragmentation and defeat<br />
<br />
Eugene Wolfenstein, 2000 (Inside/Outside Nietzsche, 235-237)<br />
<br />
This line of reasoning…compassion must light our way.<br />

2AC Notes<br />

A2: LOST Politics DA<br />
<br />
<br />
Afghanistan security is bipart<br />
<br />
BBC, 2007 (“Afghan Daily says US speaker’s visit reaffirmed support” BBC Worldwide Monitoring, lexis)<br />
<br />
Speaker of the US House…resources beyond the borders.<br />
<br />
No PC – can’t even pass small bills<br />
<br />
Pivarnik, 3/25 (Marijuana Prohibition only helps Government” lexis)<br />
<br />
Many states have begun…possibly spent more efficiently.<br />
<br />
LOST not pass – irrational fear and loathing in Senate<br />
<br />
McClatchy-Tribune, 2008 (“Sign the U.N.’s Law of the Sea Treaty” lexis)<br />
<br />
The level of fear and loathing…steal our sovereignty.<br />
<br />
Not pass too controversial<br />
<br />
Kincaid, 2008 (“Making NAFTA Stronger: Bipartisan Attacks Against the Constitution”)<br />
<br />
Since this article appeared…NAFTA was thrown out.<br />
<br />
No vote until 2009<br />

A2: Agamben<br />
<br />
Traditional Framework<br />
<br />
No Text to the Alternative<br />
<br />
Biopower solves the link to the alternative: it excludes no one and makes way for “whatever being”<br />
<br />
Mika Ojakangis, 2005 (“Impossible Dialogue on Biopower”)<br />
<br />
It could be argued…generating “forms-of-life.”<br />
<br />
Attempts to wish away sovereignty only recreate its effects – we must work through it and struggle with the question it poses<br />
<br />
Walker, 99 (Transnational Law and Contemporary Problems,)<br />
<br />
To try to imagine alternative…any other way of being.<br />
<br />
The generalization of all biopolitics as equivalent to genocide trivializes events like the Holocaust and ignores the historical context of those events.<br />
<br />
Rabinow and Rose, 2003 (“Thoughts on the Concept of Biopower Today”)<br />
<br />
Agamben takes seriously…hidden dark truth of biopower.<br />
<br />
Torture is the worst form of biopower<br />
<br />
Hardt and Negri, 2004 (Multitude, p 19-20)<br />
<br />
Biopower wields not… technique of power.<br />
