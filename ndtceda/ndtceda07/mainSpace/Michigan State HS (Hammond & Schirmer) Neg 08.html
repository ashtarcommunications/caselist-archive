<strong>Georgia</strong> <strong>State - Round 7 – Northwestern GR v. Michigan HS</strong> <br />
<strong>Judge:</strong> Roy Lefkowitz<br />
<strong>Decision:</strong> Neg (loss)<br />
<br />
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Aff evidence doesn’t make an argument that U.S. is vital to recognition. I think that you need a piece of evidence in the 1AR to prove that if they 2NC CP to give the ENTIRE budget for Afghanistan to Iraq that it would cause destabilization in Afghanistan. Because you don’t have that ev I don’t give much credibility to your argument that the 2NC CP straight turns the Afghanistan stability DA.<br />
