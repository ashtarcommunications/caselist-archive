Debate about policy analysis fw<br />
Our interp solves-edu thru participation in policy debates is essential to check manipulation of the government by powerful private interests<br />
Donald S. Lutz, 00, Political Theory and Partisan Poliics p.36-700<br />
metaphor proves Gereau ev . is important<br />
neg precludes discussions of images of torture<br />
Policy analsis should preced descourse-most effective way to challenge power<br />
Jill Taft-Kaufman, 95, Sothern comm. Journal, Spring, v. 60, Iss. 3, “Other Ways”, p pq<br />
plan k2 inject us into public discourse and solve torture<br />
Role-playing is a form of defiant deliberative politics that reclaims the political sphere<br />
Jessica Kulynyck, 97, n2 p315(32)<br />
turn-accountablilt<br />
A.Policy debate is not the same as debate in actual deciison-making bodies-advocacy outside of the se speres avoids the negative dynamics of institutiona structures<br />
Adolf G. Gundersen, 00, Political Theory and Parisan Politics, p. 97-8<br />
B.Decentralized political interdependence that is founded o accountability preserves personal value and prevents the indiscriminate destruction of life <strong>gender modified</strong><br />
Arlene W. Saxonhouse, 00, Political Theory and Prtisan Politics, p.24-6<br />
C. This impact is offensive-refocusing debate away from the consequences of institutional implementation destroys the political efficacy of citizen accounability<br />
Adolf G. Gundersen, 0, political Theory and Partisan Politics, p.98-9<br />
Have same goal of winning<br />
No distinction made btwn strats and tactics<br />
Lnx to their own K<br />
Switch side debate is key to becoming an informed citizen-focus on technique and strategy is the only way to gain education and become involved in te hreal world<br />
Star A. Muir, 93, “A Defense of the Ethics of Contemporary Debate”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 26, No.4, pg. 285-6<br />
neg not able to inject themselves in academic sphere, so can’t access edu debate provides<br />
academics exist to change world<br />
Debate is k 2 forming effective public decisions and tying edu to the ral world<br />
Star A. Muir, 93, “A Defense of the Ethics of contemporary Debate”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, vol. 26, No. 4, pg 286-7<br />
Switch side debate allows us to debate issues, not necessarily endorse them-this gives us space to experiment with different ideas<br />
Star A. Muir, 93, “A Defense of the Ethics of contemporary Debate”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, vol. 26, No. 4, pg.288<br />
Debate is k t cognitive thinking and edu on real world topics-switch side debate is especialy critical to edu<br />
Star A. Muir, 93, “A Defense of the Ethics of contemporary Debate”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, vol. 26, No. 4, pg. 282-5<br />
All of your offense is overstated-nobody speaks so fast that it hurts edu or communication and if they did they would lose speaker points and probably the round-even the fastest debates have to remain comprehensible in order to succeed<br />
There’s no loss of fairness-slow debaters can and have succeeded at policy debate-everyone from Andy Ryan to Wake CH proves<br />
The impact is inevitable-everyone is naturally capable of different things. A debate who can wrie with both hands would have a huge advantag too but that’s not a reason to vote aggainst them. Debate is exclusive like every other compettitive activity in that is has rules regarding speech times and side constraints, if some people have the advantage of being able to make more args in theat time then tha’s just part of competing in life<br />
Speed increases deu-it allows us to debate further in depth about args and anylyze a multiplicity of warrants and aves for discussion and internal to the issues about which we debate<br />
Quickly delivered ev becomes a proxy for stories w/ which we’re all familiar-this rapid-fire simplification promotes effective communication and understanging w/in political debates<br />
Holly Doremus, 00, 57 Wash &amp; Lee L. Rev. 11<br />
Ther’s no brightline at which debate becomes “too fast”-you should reject arguments that aren’t supported by clear standards b/c they’re self-serving and cater to judge bias.<br />
must inject ourselves into discourse of industrial prison complex to change it<br />
ext. ev from 1AC<br />
neg not able to see that the torture=wrong or to stop it<br />
neg being heard in this round, so either they can’t accomplish goals or strategy is in place<br />
must unite w/nature of academia<br />
neg wouldn’t be taken seriously b/c they don’t subscribe to academia<br />

Gereau ev. Not solvency for neg<br />
Neg not=gamng bad neg<br />
We’re first torture aff in present time<br />
Neg gives up political style of deliberation<br />
No mpx if they don’t kill debate<br />
Neg mpx must be ends based<br />
Ext. role playing good<br />
Ext. Gunderson<br />
End game is ballot for neg (and they link to their K) or you vote aff<br />

 aff=mpx turn to neg interp; neg refuses to engage in discussion necessary to change the squo<br />
ext. Gereau ev.<br />
Don’t claim Gereau as solvency in 2nr<br />
Spatial args don’t apply; plan allows review of abuses<br />
No reason why neg would come before real world changes<br />
No articulation about how termporal conception solves<br />
All neg mpx predicated on diff btwn strat and tactic<br />
Cocede that neg=strat; don’t articulate why they’re not<br />
End goal of neg=ballot<br />
Make enemy of traditional policy debate<br />
No way neg can effect change<br />
Alt solvency would mean that they would be dominant; would oppress others<br />
Ext. ev about academia<br />
Emphasis on discursive means we can’t do anything good<br />
No reason why aff excludes neg’s form of discussion<br />
Neg=attempting to exclude fw<br />

Georgetown FM (A) v Kansas State MZ (N) – Round 1<br />
<br />
Aff:<br />
<br />
Text: USFG should substantially increase assistance to the government of Afghanistan by offering to provide the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission all necessary support to monitor prisons run by the United States in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court rulings on Gitmo did not put an end to America’s practice of indefinte detention – prisions in Afghanistan now operate as legal blackholes where torture, murder and unimaginable violence reign<br />
Smith and Ratner, 2006 (Democracy Now)<br />
“Well, both Clive and I …. Going to vanish forever?”<br />
<br />
Prisoners in Afghanistan have become some of the worst in the world alongside brutal violence, inmates are psychologically tortured.<br />
Goodman and Smith, 2006 (Democracy Now 2/27)<br />
“Guardian by Suzanne … it’s going to be out fully”<br />
<br />
Justifications for torture create a psychological slope for future violence<br />
Opotow 2007, Moral Exclusion and Torture: The Ticking Bomb Scenario and the Slippery Ethical Slope, Peace and Conflict: Jounral of Peace Pychology vol 13. Issue 4<br />
“Those who support … to do with tyranny”<br />
<br />
The US Has succeeded in keeping prisons in Afghanistan completely closed to human rights organizations allowing for abuse above and beyond anything in Iraq and Abu Grahib.<br />
Dwyer, 2004 ISR “War Without End” Sept/Oct<br />
“Omar, they did not …. The rule of law”<br />
<br />
Our Futuer is one ofprisions and punishment, violence and tourture without end or limit. We have to inject ourselves into the formations of the penal and make namable and grievable those who have disappeared into the black holes of Americas extra judicial war prisons<br />
Brown, 2005 American Quarterly, 57:3, Project Muse<br />
“Abu Graib, like Gitmo…. What will our futures be?”<br />
<br />
Dehumanization is not some amorphous impact; it is the critical internallink to violence racism and torture.<br />
Hooks and Mosher, 2005 (Social Forces 83.4 project muse)<br />
“The abuse documented… not been an occupation”<br />
<br />
The Us should engage the independent human rights commission to rein in prisoner abuses<br />
Synovitz 2005 (Radio Free Europe)<br />
“Nader Ahmad Naderi…. In the first place”<br />
<br />
Top down government action reverses the cause that justify this immoral behavior<br />
Vallacher, 2007 Global Consequences: A Dynamic Systems Perpective on Torture, Journal of Peace Psychology vol 13, issue 4<br />
“ for negative feedback….. sooner rather than later”<br />
<br />
This breaks down cultural fear mongering and values which promote torture<br />
same site<br />
<br />
US engagement with Afghanistan high and inevitable<br />
Barnicle 2004<br />
<br />
Don’t be seduced by the neg’s shock and awe impacts – predictive scenario planning is a crapshoot and almost always wrogn – default to our impacts<br />
Menand, 2005<br />
<br />
Fixation with worst case scenarios is counterproductive<br />
Rescher 83<br />
<br />
And TONS and TONS of cooperation now, aid now, and few more consequentialism cards
