Contention One- The Status Quo<br />
Afghanistan is at the tipping point, weak central government and lack of committed US presence has placed Afghanistan on the brink of slipping back into chaos<br />
Hutcheson, 2k7 [Ron. “Bush plans Afghan aid, but is it too late?” Star Tribune, Feb. 15, Pg. l/n]<br />
<br />
Thus the Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase it’s constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan by offering a security guarantee to negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement.<br />
<br />
Advantage One: United States Commitment to Afghanistan<br />
<br />
Scenario 1 is Afghanistan Stability:<br />
<br />
First, despite mounting terrorism and instability in Afghanistan, the Bush administration’s commitment to Afghanistan shrinks by the day<br />
Rohde and Sanger, 2k7 [David and David. “How a ‘Good War’ in Afghanistan Went Bad” NY Times, August 12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/world/asia/12afghan.html?ref=asia" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/world/asia/12afghan.html?ref=asia</a>]<br />
<br />
We have 2 internal Links, first is Karzai Government Legitimacy<br />
<br />
Karzai government lack of international backing fosters instability and terrorism.<br />
Musharraf, Pervez. “Pakistan says border security is Joint responsibility” BBC Monitoring. February 3rd 2007.<br />
<br />
Second is Insurgency: These groups are gaining strength, lack of strong US commitment and presence reinvigorates the Taliban and wrecks havoc in Afghanistan<br />
Jalali, Professor at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, 2k7<br />
[Ali. “The Legacy of War and the Challenge of Peace Building” Building a New Afghanistan. Ed. Rotberg, Pg. 57]<br />
<br />
These growing Taliban/insurgency groups are destroying any possibility of afghan stability<br />
Rubin, Director of Studies at the Center for International Cooperation at NYU, 2k6<br />
[Barnett. “Afghanistan on “Life Support” Warns Council Report” CFR, April 10, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/13477/csis.html?breadcrumb=%2Fregion%2F280%2Fafghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/13477/csis.html?breadcrumb=%2Fregion%2F280%2Fafghanistan</a><br />
<br />
d. Afghan Stability is key to central Asian security<br />
Lal, Rand, 2k6 [Rollie, Rand Corporation, &quot;Central Asia and Its Asian Neighbors. Security and Commerce at the Crossroads,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A450305&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A450305&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf</a><br />

<br />
Scenario 2 is NATO Legitimacy<br />
a. Lack of US commitments to NATO casts doubts over all contributing countries undermining the success of the mission<br />
USA Today, January 27, 2007, “Rice seeks allies' help with Afghanistan” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-01-25-afghanistan_x.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-01-25-afghanistan_x.htm</a><br />
This  perception of weakness creates terrorist safe havens and damages NATO’s credibility<br />
<a name="_Toc50455736"></a><br />
[Michael, “Barbarians at the Gate,” McLean’s L/N]<br />
<br />
Two Impacts- First is Afghani Success, A stable US commitment to NATO is key to win the hearts and minds of the Afghani's and halt insurgents by eliminating  the perception of weakness.<br />

US-LED NATO Success in Afghanistan is important test for US leadership of the alliance – which is crucial to the overall success of the mission<br />
Gallis, Specialist in European Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division – Congressional Research Service, 2k7<br />
[Paul. , “NATO in Afghanistan: A Test of the Transatlantic Alliance” CRS Report for Congress, July 16, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33627.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33627.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
Second is NATO Burden Sharing. Strong US Commitment in Afghanistan key worldwide to Support and legitimacy of NATO<br />

<br />
Advantage Two is Iraq<br />
US Troop withdrawal in Iraq is inevitable, Public Backlash, and congressional defections mean that Bush has no hope for keeping troops in Iraq<br />
BFR 07 (The Bulletin Frontrunner, July 13, 2007, Despite Firm Stance, Bush Seen As Losing Debate Over Iraq &quot;Surge.&quot;, Lexis, ADI//WEJ)<br />
Withdrawal of US Troops in Iraq Inevitable, the only question is how and when. The US must do it on our own terms to salvage credibility and solve troop overstretch<br />
Barry R. Posen, Ford International Professor of Political Science at MIT, January/February 2006, Boston Review, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://bostonreview.net/BR31.1/posen.html" rel="nofollow">http://bostonreview.net/BR31.1/posen.html</a><br />
Transitioning US troops to Afghanistan secures Peace in Iraq and Afghanistan<br />
Wadhams, Caroline. “Renewing America’s Commitment in Afghanistan” Center for American Progress. November 28th 2006<br />
Withdrawal now is key to containing civil war, regional stability and isolating Al Qaeda—staying for any longer guarantees mayhem and terrorism<br />
Bruce Riedel, Senior Fellow, Saban Center for Middle East Policy, and Samuel Berger, National Security Adviser, 1997-2000, “America Must Pull Out of Iraq to Contain Civil War”, Financial Times, July 23, 2007<br />
<br />
Contention Three is Solvency.<br />
Strong US Commitment to Afghanistan through the Status of Forces Agreement gives the Afghani government Legitimacy and coordinates security forces<br />
Rubin, Barnet “AFGHANISTAN: Interview with regional analyst Barnet Rubin” June 2006. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=34410" rel="nofollow">http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=34410</a><br />
