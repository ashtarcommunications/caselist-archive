Recent parliamentary elections have solidified the position of hardliners within Iran—continued strategy of sanctions and isolation enhances hardliner power and disempowers reformists<br />
Borger, 3-22-08, The Guardian<br />
The conservative consolidation of power… have more control internally.<br />
The resulting virtual arms race in the Middle East from the spread of enrichment technology ensures nuclear war<br />
Cirincione and Grott, March 2007, “Contain and Engage”, Center for American Progress<br />
Regardless of how Iran behaves with a nuclear… this is a recipe for nuclear war.<br />
Dueck and Takeyh, 11/2/07, “Iran’s Nuclear Challenge”, Political Science Quarterly, Vol 122, No 2<br />
What then is to be done… to bargain in earnest.<br />
Iran’s leadership is divided—they’re willing to give up their nuclear program—offering incentives is key<br />
Takeyh, 2/27/08, “El Baradei is Quietly Managing to Disarm Iran”, Financial Times<br />
It is a popular parlour game in Washington’s… has paved the way for success.<br />

The Iranian foreign policy… But that’s the idea.<br />
Selective engagement gradually integrates Iran and overcomes ideological opposition to cooperation<br />
Takeyh, 06, Hidden Iran, p. 226<br />
The essence of this… sections of its population.<br />
Attempts to resolve multiple issues at once will fail—asks too much<br />
Maloney, 2004, “Iran: Time for a New Approach”, Council on Foreign Relations<br />
U.S. ones are clearly communicated… objectives at the same time.<br />
This causes negotiations breakdown<br />
Pollack, 05, The Persian Puzzle, p 398<br />
