 <ul><li>In terms of this year’s resolution, we advocate that to enable solvency for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, <strong>the United States Federal Government should offer Hamas a security guarantee by taking them off the Foreign Terrorist Organizations list and include them in talks about the future of the Israeli-Palestinian disputes and the future of the Middle East.</strong></li><li>This means inviting the Israeli government and the leadership of Fatah, Hamas, Israel to the table.
