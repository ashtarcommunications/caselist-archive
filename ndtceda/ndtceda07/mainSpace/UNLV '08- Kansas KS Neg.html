Capitalism 1NC:<br />

IDENTITY POLITICS ARISES OUT OF THE CRISIS OF LIBERALISM—SUCH POLITICS PARTICULARIZES THE OPPRESSIONS OF CAPITALISM TO THE POINT THAT THE UNIVERSAL SYSTEM IS NATURALIZED.  ATTAINING WHITE, MALE BOURGEOISSE PRIVILEGE BECOMES THE BENCH-MARK OF POLITICAL SUCCESS, RE-ENTRENCHING THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE SYSTEM<br />

CLASS MUST BE RECOGNIZED AS QUALITATIVELY MORE IMPORTANT—OTHERWISE THE SYSTEM IS ABLE TO SATISFY DEMANDS ON GROUNDS OF FORMAL EQUALITY, DESTROYING ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME CAPITALIST OPPRESSION<strong>*<br />

Politics and morality…painful lessons of the recent past.<br />

THIS IS NOT THE ALTERNATIVE, BUT IN TRUTH THE ONLY OPTION— METHOD IS THE FOREMOST POLITICAL QUESTION BECAUSE ONE MUST UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING SOCIAL TOTALITY BEFORE ONE CAN ACT ON IT—<br />

Price support and supply management is key to a sustainable agriculture – this counters neoliberal removal of subsidies<br />

Supply management and price supports are key to stable food markets – allows government control of prices to avoid spikes and collapse<br />

It’s time to abandon the false hope of liberalization – free market policies increase corporate control and ensure chronic global poverty<br />

THE AFF’S CALL TO DECREASE SUBSIDIES IS SYMBOLIC OF THEIR RELIANCE ON THE NEOLIBERAL ORDER—THIS DEVASTATES COUNTRIES AT THE PERIPHERY FORCING CURRENCY CRISES AND POVERTY<br />

</strong>Case 1NC<strong><br />
<br />
THE 1AC’S SUPPOSEDLY RADICAL ATTEMPT TO TRANSFORM THE WORLD IS A LIE- THEIR ATTEMPT AT REVOLUTION IS JUST A FARCE- IT DOES NOT CHALLENGE THE UNDERLYING DEMOCRATIC FRAME UPON WHICH POLITICS RESTS- THEIR DESIRE FOR CHANGE AND ACTION PLAY RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE VERY SYSTEM OF THOUGHT THEY SEEK TO DISMANTLE<br />

</strong>Resolutionality/ Framework**<br />
<br />
A. interpretation-<br />
1. the affirmative must defend a literal interpretation of the resolution- the usfg should decrease its agricultural subsidies<br />
2. the affirmative must defend the united states federal government- this is the central government in washington dc<br />
3. the affirmative must defend the resolution as the ending point of their advocacy- they cannot start from the resolution and come to a different conclusion<br />
b. voting issue- the question of the resolution is a prior question that is necessary for debate<br />
c. reasons to prefer-<br />
1. predictable ground- the resolution provides a predictable set of arguments that allows negatives to be prepared to engage the affirmative in debate about the merits of the resolution, which allows better clash- that’s the biggest impact because it’s the only form of education unique to debate<br />
2. switch-side debate is good- each team is allowed to argue both sides of the resolution- this allows us to best understand all issues<br />
3. balance of arguments- division of ground between the aff and neg is inevitable- allowing the aff to make this division ensures they will always disadvantage the negative. the resolution is written to ensure a balance of arguments for both sides and provides a neutral distinction for aff and neg ground<br />
4. limits- allowing the affiramtive to expand their advocacy outside of a literal interpretation of the resolution allows an infinite amount of advocacies that leaves the negative unprepared<br />
5. extra-rez- if the affirmative claims advantages or reasons to vote that are not results of usfg action this is extra-resolutional. this is unpredictable and destroys negative ground while allowing an infinite amount of aff advocacies that the neg can’t leverage offense against- that’s an independent voter for fairness
