Thus we offer our advocacy in defense of the resolution:<br />
<br />
President George W. Bush, in his capacity as head of the executive branch of the United States Government, will extend an invitation to President Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad of the Islamic Republic of Iran to come to the United States to the Crawford Ranch for dinner. The dinner will be served and the food prepared in accordance with Islam precepts of halal. A specific security guarantee will be made during the visit in the form of a promise to cease the use of cowboy rhetoric and cowboy diplomacy in the relationship between the United States and The Islamic Republic of Iran.<br />
rhetorical construction of enemy is accomplished through reference to 'outlaws' calls to mind the gunslingers of the old west<br />
