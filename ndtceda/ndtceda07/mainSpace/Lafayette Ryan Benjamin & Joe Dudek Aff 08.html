 LAF BD and LAF GR 1AC Outline<br />
<br />
Observation One is INHERENCY<br />
<br />
Energy is in shambles in Afghanistan and remains the lowest priority for foreign donors AND no effort has been made to develop geothermal energy<br />
<br />
Center on International Cooperation, 2005. [Barnett Rubin, Humayun Hamidzada, Abby Stoddard. “Afghanistan 2005 and Beyond: Prospects for Improved Stability.” Avail@ <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN022665.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN022665.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
The availability of…Afghanistan’s geothermal reserves.<br />
<br />
AND, the United States is no longer making energy assistance to Afghanistan a priority<br />
<br />
Rubin, Senior Fellow at NYU’s Center on International Cooperation, 2007. [Barnett. “Saving Afghanistan.” Foreign Affairs, January/February 2007. Available at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070101faessay86105-p10/barnett-r-rubin/saving-afghanistan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070101faessay86105-p10/barnett-r-rubin/saving-afghanistan.html</a>] <br />
<br />
Moreover, the lack…made no such allocation.<br />
<br />
THUS the PLAN<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the Government of Afghanistan by offering a substantial increase in foreign assistance through the development of geothermal energy in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Observation Two is SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
Reconstruction of Afghanistan will only accelerate the nation’s energy needs<br />
<br />

<br />
As Afghanistan continues…biomass, solar or wind.<br />
<br />
AND, Geothermal is perfect for Afghanistan and is untapped in the status quo<br />
<br />

<br />
Prospects of low…resources of Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Observation Three is ADVANTAGES<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE: RECONSTRUCTION<br />
<br />
Reconstruction efforts are failing in the status quo<br />
<br />
Milne, Staff Writer, The Guardian on August 23, 2007 [Seamus, August 23, 2007 Thursday, Comment &amp; Debate: How can this bloody failure be regarded as a good war?: The western occupation of Afghanistan has brought neither peace nor development - and it fuels the terror threat] MK<br />
<br />
For Afghans, six years…have sunk reconstruction.<br />
<br />
AND, Electricity shortages in Afghanistan hurt remote rural populations and damage reconstruction efforts – geothermal can solve<br />
<br />

<br />
Electricity is in serious…their geothermal fields.<br />
<br />
AND, successful reconstruction is crucial to ending deplorable conditions and mass human rights abuses<br />
<br />
Bayani, Staff Writer, 2007. [Farhad. “Angry protests against foreign troops and government in Afghanistan; Reconstruction can help win war against Taliban.” Inter Press News Service/IPS Latin America. August 10th. L/n] JB<br />
<br />
Only reconstruction…3 decades of war.<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO: POVERTY<br />
Afghanistan faces widespread poverty and must revitalize the energy sector and rural economy to solve<br />
<br />
Rubin, Senior Fellow at NYU’s Center on International Cooperation, 2007. [Barnett. “Saving Afghanistan.” Foreign Affairs, January/February 2007. Available at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070101faessay86105-p10/barnett-r-rubin/saving-afghanistan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070101faessay86105-p10/barnett-r-rubin/saving-afghanistan.html</a>] MK<br />
<br />
Effective economic aid…attracting new investment.<br />
<br />
Numerous geothermal plants in Afghanistan can service communities off the grid in remote areas<br />
<br />

Musazai and Taraki are Economics Professors. “Geothermal Energy in Afghanistan: Prospects and Potential.” Center on International Cooperation and Afghanistan Center for Policy and Development Studies.

<br />
Though, such cross border…in dire need of it.<br />
<br />
AND, more deaths are attributed to poverty than nuclear war and genocide in the last 15 years<br />
<br />
Gilligan, Director of the Center for the Study of Violence, 1996. [James. Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and it’s Causes 191-196] MZ<br />
<br />
The deadliest form of violence…to war and genocide).<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE THREE: ECONOMIC GROWTH<br />
<br />
Afghanistan must improve its economy if it is to gain legitimacy and end reliance on the drug trade<br />
<br />
Center on International Cooperation, 2005. [Barnett Rubin, Humayun Hamidzada, Abby Stoddard. “Afghanistan 2005 and Beyond: Prospects for Improved Stability.” Avail@ <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN022665.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN022665.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
Reinforcing the state’s…below that level.<br />
<br />
AND, Afghan opiate trafficking is fueling the largest HIV/AIDS epidemic in the world<br />
<br />
Maskas, JD University of Tulsa, 2005 [Marisa L. Maskas, J.D. University of Tulsa, “Trafficking Drugs: Afghanistan’s Role in Russia Current Drug Epidemic.” University of Tulsa Law Review, Fall 2005 pg. lexis///wdcT.]<br />
<br />
Today, one of the most…other international markets. 11<br />
AND, the next step in Afghanistan’s reconstruction is to improve the economy so the people don’t rely on opium, patronage of warlords and international presence for income<br />
<br />
Center on International Cooperation, 2005. [Barnett Rubin, Humayun Hamidzada, Abby Stoddard. “Afghanistan 2005 and Beyond: Prospects for Improved Stability.” Avail@ <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN022665.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN022665.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
The establishment of…livelihoods, and services.<br />
<br />
FINALLY, developing indigenous energy supplies will reduce Afghanistan’s trade deficit and will boost the overall economy – geothermal is the key<br />
<br />

Musazai and Taraki are Economics Professors. “Geothermal Energy in Afghanistan: Prospects and Potential.” Center on International Cooperation and Afghanistan Center for Policy and Development Studies.

<br />
Presently, Afghanistan is very…to generate electric power.<br />
<br />
FRAMEWORK<br />
<br />
You shouldn’t factor improbable, worst-case scenarios into your decision calculus because they do not prove the undesirability of the plan<br />
