<strong>Plan: The United States federal government should offer a guarantee to the government of Iran that the United States will not pursue regime change in Iran.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Observation One: The Problem of US Regime Change Rhetoric</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>FIRST - Current US rhetoric of regime change is escalating tensions between the US and Iran, strengthening hardliners and making miscalculation inevitable</strong><br />
Dr. Bahram <strong>Rajaee</strong>, <em>senior policy consultant for NIAC and an expert on Middle East affairs, May 25</em> <em><strong>07</strong></em><br />

<u>A key determinant …</u>undoubtedly strengthened Iran’s hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>EVEN WORSE – the rhetoric of regime change is the source of tensions. As long as the United States continues to threaten Iran – or browbeat it into submission – no progress can be made</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
After years of indecision …dig in their heels.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>IN FACT – the <em>threat</em> of regime change itself creates a negative spiral that dooms all efforts for cooperation. Aggression will be the response to any US strategy – stick OR carrot – if regime change is even an option.</strong><br />

The second main …<strong><u>trying to overthrow the regime</u></strong><u>.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>WHAT’S MORE – US policies fundamentally misunderstand what drives the Iranian regime – it values its survival above all else; it’s not a revisionist power, but merely seeks influence – negotiations aren’t going to work until the US adapts to this stance.</strong><br />
Dr. Fariborz <strong>Mokhtari ‘6</strong>- [member of the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies’ faculty at the National Defense University - 'Mahmud Ahamadinejad's Presidency: What Does Iran Really Want?', American Foreign Policy Interests, 28:5, 355 – 365 October]<br />

<br />
<strong><u>Advantage One: Nuclear Weapons</u></strong><br />

<strong>FIRST – Iran’s fears of US regime change policies drive it to acquire nuclear weapons – the regime will endure ANY COST as long as it fears for its security</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>There are two internal links:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First – Miscalc</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Iranian nuclear weapons would create complex nuclear configurations in the region – in such a system, stability and deterrence are impossible.</strong><br />

<br />
<u>Weapons control is the…</u>is not easily answered.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The second link is regional acquisition of nuclear weapons</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>FIRST – Iranian nuclear capability causes regional arms races – such a system would have no mechanism to contain or prevent a war.</strong><br />
<br />
Michael <strong>Einstadt ‘7</strong>, director of Military and Security Studies Program, July 2007 [Washingotn Institute for Near East Studies Policy Focus #72, “Deterring the Ayatollahs: Complications in Applying Cold War Strategy to Iran”]<br />
Might Iran be tempted …action remains an option.<br />
<br />
<strong>WORSE STILL – such a multipolar arms ensures a war. Volatility and uncertainty would ensure conflict</strong><br />
<br />

<u>Before accepting the answer …<strong>regional nuclear</strong> <strong>war</strong></u>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>AND, these arms races will start before Iran even gets the bomb – engagement with Iran is key to assure other countries the US will contain the problem</strong><br />
<br />

<u>The manner in which Iran emerges …such chaos to reign.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Advantage Two: Iraq</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>There are two internal links:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>FIRST -- US hostility towards Iran creates a self-fulfilling prophecy of escalation in Iraq – it draws in other powers and produces massive regional chaos.</strong><br />

In principle, <u>neighbouring …</u>with considerable assets.<br />

<br />
So far, <u>Tehran</u> <u>has …between Shiites and Sunnis.</u><br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong><u>Observation Two is Solvency</u></strong><br />

<strong>In order break the negative spiral, the US must take regime change off the agenda. A reversal of rhetoric would usher in Iranian cooperation on nuclear weapons and Iraq.</strong><br />
