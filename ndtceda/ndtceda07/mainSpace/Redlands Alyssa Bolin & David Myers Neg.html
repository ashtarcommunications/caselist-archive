<strong><u>Topicality Arguments</u></strong>  <br />
<br />
<strong>Interp=Constructive Engagement=Three Parts</strong> <br />
<br />
1. Opening Up-Creating space for economic investment and political pluralism in the target state <br />
2. Tying Down-Encouraging that state to get involved in international organizations with set standards of behavior, and <br />
3. Binding together-Establishing a security component that reduces incentives for competition between the U.S. and the target state<br />
The Gazette 98 (G. John Ikenberry, &quot;The grand strategy': At last, the U.S. has found itself a post-Cold War foreign policy,&quot;, 7-15-98, lexis) &quot;The strategy is sometimes called constructive engagement...and its fullest expression in the Franco-German relationship&quot; <br />
<br />
<strong>T-Constructive Engagement Requires Conditions</strong> <br />
<br />
A topical affirmative must offer to provide a security guarantee or financial assistance if <u> meets certain conditions within a specified time <br />
<br />
An offer requires the other party to perform a certain act<br />
Ronayne, no date cited (Debbi, Realtor at Keller-Williams Realty, www.ronayneteam.com/pages/Real_Estate_Glossary.asp#o )<br />
&quot;Offer-A promise made by one party...&quot;<br />
<br />
Constructive engagement requires that good relations be conditioned<br />

Chan, &quot;Gentle and Slow Persuasion,&quot; March 1996, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.burmaissues.org/En/Newsletter/BINews1996-03.php#_Gentle_and_Slow_Persusasion" rel="nofollow">http://www.burmaissues.org/En/Newsletter/BINews1996-03.php#_Gentle_and_Slow_Persusasion</a>?, v. 6, n.3 accessed 8-24-07) &quot;By definition, a policy of constructive engagement.....you meet these specific conditions by a specific date&quot; <br />
