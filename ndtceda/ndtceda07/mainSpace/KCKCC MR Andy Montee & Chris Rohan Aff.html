In 2002, the government of Israel began construction on a barrier intended to separate the state of Israel from the Palestinians located in the West Bank. The wall was justified by Israel as a means to keep Palestinian suicide bombers in a place where they could not harm others.<br />

<br />
2. The wall has been damned by nearly every international organization and country because of the humanitarian crisis that it has created, but U.S. support for it is allows construction to continue.<br />

Hassan 05. William Journal of Int’l Law 13.97<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Federal Government should constructively engage the Palestinian Authority, offering support against the separation barrier on the condition they will join our peace movement.<br />
<br />
The separation barrier is a tool for Israel to both symbolically and literally deploy a discursive practice of creating an “us” versus “them” mentality. The United States and Israel both support the wall because of a misguided ideal that it will keep us safe in our homes and keep everything bad on the other side of that wall.<br />
<br />
Eliezer and Feinstein 07 Israel Studies 12.1 p 171-192<br />
<br />
The United States and Israel uphold the identity differences between themselves and their enemies in order to give themselves an easily identifiable sense of purpose. Their sole purpose becomes centered around opposition of whoever is deemed “the enemy,” and they are left forever seeking to defend and secure themselves against those enemies.<br />
<br />
Lipshutz 1995<br />
<br />
These attempts to protect ourselves from our scary neighbors is ultimately pointless. Conflict is an inevitability, and our attempts to suppress our fear of it only seeks to recreate more fear. We must no longer continue living in a world based on denial of reality.<br />

We apply these borders to anyone that is unfamiliar to us. The state feeds on that fear to create a permanent security state.<br />

Our solution lies in the acceptance of the other. We can overcome our fears by looking beyond the barriers that exist in the world, and by recognizing that we aren’t going to be safe by locking ourselves in the cellar. We must move towards an acceptance of those we see as “enemies” and “terrorists.”<br />

1. Our framework is an interpretation of the way that individuals can act within a given space to accomplish their goals. An example of a Palestinian peace protest shows that while they had set goal of breaking down the wall, their discursive intent was wider in scope to challenge security discourse.<br />
<br />
Eliezer and Feinstein 07 Israel Studies 12.1 p 171-192<br />
<br />
2. In the debate round, we should be seen and treated as a peace protest, such as the Anti Wall Movement’s, with the goal of the United States giving foreign assistance to the Palestinians. Our plan is a protest sign and is what we think should be done.<br />
<br />
Eliezer and Feinstein 07 Israel Studies 12.1 p 171-192<br />
<br />
3. We can do this by moving towards a temporary autonomous zone where we can individually make strikes at oppression<br />

Our solution to these fears is to build walls around ourselves. We imagine that these walls are to keep our foes out, but they ultimately only seek to lock ourselves within.<br />
These fears of the other, of the enemy, and this arbitrary ideal of “security,” begin continue to worsen and worsen. They escalate as the potential for escalation occurs. We then internalize this fear and lose our sense of self that makes life worth living.<br />
