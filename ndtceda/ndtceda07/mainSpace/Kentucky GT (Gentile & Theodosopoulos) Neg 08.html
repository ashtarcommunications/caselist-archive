Spending<br />
PayGo is slowing debts now – but we have to bring spending under control to prevent collapse<br />
National Journal, 7-26-2007<br />
(David Hess, “CBO, GAO Heads Say Pay/Go Alone Won't Fix Fiscal Woes,” LexisNexis)<br />
Top CBO and … budget does today.<br />
<br />
Off-budget spending destroys Congress’ commitment to fiscal discipline<br />
Alan Greenspan, FRB Chairman, April 17, 1996 [CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, p. Lexis]<br />
On behalf of myself and the other members of the Board, I am pleased to respond to your letter of<br />
ability of the government to control federal spending.<br />
<br />
Fiscal discipline and adherence to budgetary rules are critical to reducing deficits and preventing a flood of new spending.<br />
Cohen, 07<br />

The Concord Coalition said today that the Congressional Budget Resolution to be voted on in the House and<br />

Runaway spending and deficits cause a global depression.<br />
Schiller, ‘97<br />

The ever-cautious budget office hints at the kind of disaster that might ensue: &quot;Foreign investors might<br />

T Quid Pro Quo<br />
INTERPRETATION— Constructive Engagement is by definition conditional and requires quid pro quo in behavior from the target state<br />
Crocker, 1989 (Chester, as Assistant Secretary for African Affairs at the Department of State, 1981-89; he is currently Distinguished Fellow, United States Institute of Peace, and Research Associate at the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University, “SOUTHERN AFRICA: EIGHT YEARS LATER,” Foreign Affairs, Fall, ln)<br />
Regarding South Africa, constructive engagement was<br />
…absence of <a name="ORIGHIT_3"></a><a name="HIT_3"></a>fundamental internal change.<br />
VIOLATION— the plan doesn’t explicitly condition its incentives on a change on a separate issue. Making an unconditional offer where the only expected change is their acceptance isn’t topical<br />
Chan, 1996 (N., Burma Issues, “Gentle and Slow Persuasion,” Vol. 6 #3, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ww.burmaissues.org/En/Newsletter/BINews1996-03.php" rel="nofollow">http://ww.burmaissues.org/En/Newsletter/BINews1996-03.php</a><br />

Politics – Genocide Resolution – It’s old and dead so we won’t be reading it but we did read it<br />
<br />
Prolif Discourse K<br />
Prolif discourse creates a violent dichotomous relationship that defines states as immature villains in order to construct our own identity as law-abiding heroes.<br />
David Mutimer, Assistant Prof of Political Science at York University, 2000, The Weapons State, pg 93-95<br />
The U. S. military… of supplier states.<br />

According to Franz Hinkelammert<br />
<br />
<br />
Olmert D/A<br />
a. uniqueness: recent comments about splitting jerusalem have placed olmert under fire<br />
klein 10/19/07<br />
[Aaron, &quot;Rabbis urge: Save Jerusalem,&quot; World Net Daily, p. lexis, Gautam]<br />
&lt; TEL AVIV – A group of hundreds of prominent…claimed the plan violated Kadima's platform.&gt;<br />
<br />
b. link: any concessions to palestine will lead to olmert's overthrow<br />
gulf news 2007<br />
[Manal Alafrangi, Staff Writer, &quot;What peace conference?&quot; September 17, 2007, p. lexis]<br />
&lt;These issues have been pushed so far…cemented his reputation as a weak leader.&gt;<br />
<br />
c. impacts:<br />
1. breakup of the government leads to early elections and a landslide victory for netanyahu<br />
jerusalem report 5/28/07<br />
&lt;Still, Olmert remains vulnerable. There…victory public opinion polls are predicting.&gt;<br />
<br />
2. netanyahu will strike iran if elected<br />
bremmer 2006<br />
[Ian, &quot;Our Status Quo Foreign Policy,&quot; January 23, 3006, p. lexis]<br />
&lt;Benjamin Netanyahu, one of the lead…world's ticking political time-bombscan be safely defused.&gt;<br />
<br />
3. the impact is extinction<br />
Larry ross , CHAIRPERSON OF THE NEW Zealand Peacemaking Association, 6/11/05 , &quot;Lowering Still Further, the Barrier to Nuclear War&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nuclearfree.lynx.co.nz/localcommanders2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://nuclearfree.lynx.co.nz/localcommanders2.htm</a> [Sohin]<br />
&lt;So if the U.S. both creates the war situations… the risks of nuclear war go up.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Appeasement D/A<br />
Bush is taking a hardline stance now on Iran<br />
BBC Monitoring Middle East 2007<br />
‘The announcement that…for domestic consumption.”<br />
<br />
Tehran is looking to break the nuclear impasse and has sent their top nuclear negotiater to put out feelers<br />
Newsweek 5/22/06<br />
“American and Iranians…the other side”<br />

Anyone underestimating continued…and false friends<br />
<br />
This leads to a global nuclear exchange<br />
Khalilzhad 95<br />
<br />
Biopower K<br />
The War on Terrorism is a war without responsibility – The government is not responsible for those slaughtered by the operations of war – their intentions are good so they are not responsible for the bad outcomes – sure we might be torturing innocent people in secret prisons or killing innocent civilians but we have the best of intentions, we mean to kill the “terrorists”<br />
Butler 2004 (Judith, Prof of Rhetoric @ UC-Berkeley, Precarious Life, pg 8-9)<br />
<br />
Oh but the affirmative plan brings us peace you say – Erroneous, erroneous on both accounts – peace is coded war – attempts at keeping the peace in the Terror on War are a clever cover for the continuation of society’s war on difference – law is used to justify the use of war powers not stop them – Victory will always look like more war<br />
Foucault 1976 (Michel, Chair of the History of Systems of Thought @ College de France, Society Must Be Defended, pg 48-51)<br />
<br />
B. The state’s ability to control and manage life is not benign. The flipside of the ability to guarantee life to whole populations is that it necessitates destruction of life on an equal scale. The affirmative’s world is one in which massacres have become vital as the only means at which the health of one’s own populace can be guaranteed.<br />
Dean 2001 (Mitchell, Professor of Sociology @ Macquarie University, Ethnographic Explorations of the Postcolonial State, ed. Hanson and Stepputat, pg. 53-54)<br />
<br />
C. Vote Negative – refuse the affirmative’s call to become a legislator of grand solutions – instead endorse the political act of the 1NC. Only by situating ourselves as specfic intellectuals is it possible to become thinkers who do not fall back into the dangerous role of managers of life<br />
Owen 1994 (David, Assistant Director of the Centre for Post-Analytic Philosophy, Maturity and Modernity: Nietzsche, Weber, Foucault and the Ambivalence of Reason, pg 208-210)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nuclear Criticism<br />
A. The End of the World As We Don’t Know It – The 1AC description of nuclear war is a fiction that has never occurred and cannot be described as having occurred. The specter of nuclear annihilation exists only textually, as created by language. The consequence of debate over nuclear threats lies in the meanings produced.<br />
Jacques Derrida, philosopher and linguist, Diacritics vol. 14, no. 2, 1984<br />
<br />
B. We will survive – The affirmative’s appeal to survival as a justification for the plan is a political act creating humanity in terms of nuclear weapons and preventing an escape from inevitable self-destruction<br />
Chaloupka 92 (William, Professor of Political Science @ Colorado State, Knowing Nukes: The Politics and Culture of the Atom, pg. )<br />
<br />
C. Implications – Engagements with the literal terms of apocalypse politics only plays into the hands of nuclear managers and prevents an analysis of the symbolic politics of the bomb that are used to silence anti-nuclear activism and can only feed repression and detachment<br />
Chernus 86 (Ira, Professor of Religious Studies @ University of Colorado, Dr. Strangegod)<br />
<br />
China D/A<br />
A. We control uniqueness –<br />
<br />
Sino-US relations are not yet locked into a zero-sum equation.<br />

<br />
“Instead, as proven by the just-ended…instead of damaging duels.”<br />
<br />
B. Link –<br />
<br />
The PRC is paranoid about US encirclement policies – Demand for oil supplies means China perceives the plan as an attempt to contain the country through economic destabilization.<br />
<br />
David Zweig and Bi Jianhai, Foreign Affairs, September-October 2005<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fullaccess.foreignaffairs.org/20050901faessay84503/david-zweig-bi-jianhai/china-s-global-hunt-for-energy.html" rel="nofollow">http://fullaccess.foreignaffairs.org/20050901faessay84503/david-zweig-bi-jianhai/china-s-global-hunt-for-energy.html</a> (jfs)<br />

“China’s resources hunt…not exacerbate them needlessly.”<br />

Construcitve Disengagement K<br />
FIRST, AMERICA IS ADDICTED TO INVOLVEMENT IN THE MIDDLE<br />

AMERICAN PRESENCE AND RULES OUT DISENGAGEMENT<br />
Hadar, 1994<br />
(Leon, , Research fellow- foreign policy- CATO, &quot;The real lesson of<br />
the Oslo accord: Localize the Arab- Israeli conflict, Foreign policy<br />

One can compare the high-level U.S. involvement in the Middle East to<br />
an addicting drug. Various regional players have become<br />

<br />
SECOND, THE PLAN'S RELIANCE UPON THE ASSUMPTION THAT AMERICA 'MUST DO<br />

US PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WILL INEVITABLY EXACERBATE CONFLICT AND<br />

(Leon, a research fellow at the Independent Institute, the Washington<br />
correspondent for the Singapore Business Times — and a contributing<br />
editor to The American Conservative, Sandstorm: Policy Failure in the<br />
Middle East, 61)<br />
<br />
OUR ALTERNATIVE IS THAT WE SHOULD CONSTRUCTIVELY DISENGAGE THE MIDDLE<br />
EAST. ONLY BY REJECTING THE PLAN'S CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT CAN WE<br />
CREATE THE SPACE TO RETHINK US POLICY ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAKE<br />
INSTABILITY AND VIOLENCE INEVITABLE<br />
