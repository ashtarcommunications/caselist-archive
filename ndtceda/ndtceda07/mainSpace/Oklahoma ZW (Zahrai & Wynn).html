<span style="font-size: 12pt">The United States has itself locked into a never ending support system that utilizes agricultural subsidies to destroy small farms while the supporting the apparatus of the larger industrial system. <strong>Cook 04</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt">(Chris D. <u>Cook Diet for a Dead Planet</u>, P. 217-219) </span><br />
<em>In the steady march....entire rural economies abroad</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt">This industrial way of eating and making food is the most serious threat to planetary survival. All other scenarios pale in relation to the impacts that subsidized agriculture has on our ability to access and afford food. <strong>Cook 04</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt">(Chris D. <u>Cook Diet for a Dead Planet</u>, P. 243-245) </span><br />
<em>The way we make and eat....environmental sustainability</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt">The corporate stranglehold over our food system is only strengthened by our ignorance. Each and every day new farmers are erased from the planet, moving closer and closer to agribusiness control over the absolute beginning of life. <strong>Cook 04</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt">(Chris D. <u>Cook Diet for a Dead Planet</u>, P. 6-7) </span><br />
<em>No one can deny...the absolute beginning of life</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt">“Eating is an agricultural act”—We are not just passive consumers but co-creators of the system that feeds us, Our food system depends on consumers not knowing much beyond the price at the checkout counter—eliminating subsidies is key to breaking down this wall of ignorance. <strong>Pollan 8</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt">(Michael Pollan, Professor of Journalism at Berkeley, <u>In defense of Food</u>, P. 159-161) </span><br />
<em>A wall of ignorance...values like quality and health</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt">The western diet is the most radical change in the way humans eat since the discovery of agriculture—the super abundance of cheap calories is making people increasingly sick and fat. 4 of the top 10 causes of death are diseases directly linked to the industrialization of food. <strong>Pollan 8</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt">(Michael Pollan, Professor of Journalism at Berkeley, <u>In defense of Food</u>, P. 9-11) </span><br />
<em>The rise of...predictable series of Western diseases</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt">From farm gate to dinner plate, the effects can be seen throughout the agriculture industry. Farmers have been reduced to serfs, assuming all risk and liability for the corporations they are forced to do business with. <strong>Wirzba 4</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt">(Norman Wirzba, Chairs the philosophy department at Georgetown, <u>The Essential Agrarian Reader</u>. P. 11-12) </span><br />
<em>Farmer independence is....production exceed product income</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt">Agribusiness doesn’t want people to know how to feed themselves—Under the banner of feeding the world—mega companies have monopolized the food industry, pushing American grain overseas and keeping grain cheap here so the American consumer is left in the dark. Even though surplus crops are at an all time high—people all over the world starve to death. <strong>Logsdon 4</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt">(Gene Logsdon, Economic /Cultural critic and Farmer, <u>The Essential Agrarian Reader</u>, P. 161-162) </span><br />
<em>The whole issue....feed the world</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt">Thus we affirm the resolution in its nearly all form—we believe the agricultural subsidies that function to enhance overproduction and privilege larger corporations and farms over small and local food systems should be eliminated. <strong>Wirzba 4</strong> </span><br />
