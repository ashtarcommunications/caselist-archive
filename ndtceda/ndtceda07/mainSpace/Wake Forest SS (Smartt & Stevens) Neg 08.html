&lt;willingness to make and fulfill a contract or to bargain&gt;<br />
Security Guarantee is a quid pro quo<br />
&lt;SIPRI, “Security guarantees are issued on a quid pro quo basis&gt;<br />
2NC<br />
A topical plan must include a quid pro quo – its incentives must be conditioned on policy changes by the target country.<br />

“Offer” requires a bargain that can be accepted or refusie. <br />

Quid pro quo is the best interp<br />
