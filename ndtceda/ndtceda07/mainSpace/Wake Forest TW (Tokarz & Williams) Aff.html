Contention 1 --- <u>Status Quo</u><br />
<br />
U.S. assistance to Afghanistan strong and new allocations are coming<br />
<br />
Walker ‘07<br />
(David M., Comptroller General of the United States, GAO Reports, 5-24, Lexis)<br />
<br />
Since 2001, the United States … stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
However, most assistance is funneled through NGOs instead of the Afghan government<br />
<br />
Rubin ‘07<br />
(Barnett, Director of Studies and Senior Fellow, Center on International Cooperation at NYU, and Humayun, Associate Research Scientist at NYU CIC, <em>International Peacekeeping</em>, 14(1), March)<br />
<br />
The Afghanistan Compact include…..with programs for capacity building.<br />
<br />
<br />
U.S. focus on NGOs sets the global trend --- ensuring circumvention of government control<br />
<br />
Oakley ‘03<br />
(Robert, Fmr Ambassador – Pakistan and Visiting Fellow – National Defense U., Washington Post, 1-3)<br />
<br />
A year after the Bonn Conference… for the entire region and the United States.<br />
<br />
Plan ---<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should implement the provisions of Annex II of the Afghanistan Compact regarding governmental budget capacity, including offering to increase the percentage of its foreign assistance given directly to the central government of Afghanistan in exchange for Afghanistan’s progress in meeting budget management criteria established in the Afghanistan National Development Strategy. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 2 --- <u>Stability</u><br />
<br />
Assistance through NGOs isn’t used for reconstruction --- massive corruption siphons it off<br />

(Richard, Et al., Public Affairs 860, International Issues, “Nation-Building in Afghanistan,” Spring, www.lafollette.wisc.edu/publications/workshops/2006/nationbuilding.pdf)<br />
<br />
<u>Afghanistan</u> <u>has had a shaky start… it comes at the <strong>expense of government legitimacy</strong></u><u>.</u><br />
<br />
Delays cause artificially high expectations, public backlash, and instability<br />

<br />
Impact on the Government of Afghanistan… <strong>increasing the security risk</strong>.<br />
<br />
Leaving the Afghan government ‘out of the loop’ on aid crushes its credibility and legitimacy<br />

<br />
Afghanistan’s problems are a <strong>… battle and still lost the war</strong>.<br />

<br />
The situation in Afghanistan … Central Asian and South Caucasus conflicts.<br />

But abetting the continuing destabilization…resulting in loss of control over weapons of mass destruction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most probable scenario<br />

Blank ‘2K<br />
(Stephen, Prof Research – Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, “U.S. Military Engagement with Transcaucasia and Central Asia”, www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub113.pdf)<br />
<br />
Washington’s burgeoning military-political-economic… neither has willing proxies capable of settling the situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even a low risk outweighs<br />
<br />
Art ‘03<br />
(Robert J., Prof IR – Brandeis U., <u>A Grand Strategy for America</u>, p. 212-3)<br />

<br />
The Afghanistan Compact includes… these efforts by insisting on U.S. contracting or earmarking.<br />
<br />
<br />
This builds Afghan capacity and reduces corruption<br />

<br />
Richard Holbrooke, a former U.S. diplomat… is destroying the coalition effort,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is because of indirect U.S. assistance --- sending money through the government restores Karzai’s credibility and domestic political base<br />
<br />
Watson ‘06<br />
(Paul, Staff – Los Angeles Times, 11-12, Lexis)<br />
<br />
Afghanistan's Karzai faces disaffection … <strong>in them</strong>, rather than on <strong>parallel tracks</strong> outside,&quot; he said.<br />

<br />
Since the Party’s life is “above all else,…. hostage and gamble with their lives.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Two impacts: 2nd --- <u>Terrorism:</u><br />
