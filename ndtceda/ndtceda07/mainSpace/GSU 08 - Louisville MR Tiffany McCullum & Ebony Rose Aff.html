<strong>Louisvile MR (Tiffany McCullum &amp; Ebony Rose) Pre-Tournament Disclosure</strong><br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">Resolved: that the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies, for biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat. </span><br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">Me and Ebony will advocate throughout this round that the US Federal Government should eliminate subsidies for cotton. We will continuously demonstrate how unethical the system of subsidies are on a global level and particularly the ways that cotton subsidies hurt African farmers.  </span><br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">My purpose in this debate revolves around my sheer humanity. No, I’m not a humanitarian. I’m not even someone who always finds the time or the will to think about someone else before myself the majority of the time. But, as a human, watching fellow humans suffer is never easy for me. Even further, through the identification of people who have suffered for centuries, as a human being, I cannot simply turn away.  </span><br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">Poem </span><br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">Cotton subsidies impose an unnecessary burden upon not only the American peoples but upon the commerce in the impoverished countries of Africa. Currently African farmers are crying for U.S. subsidies to cease because they lower the price of cotton on the world market and cause Africans to lose up to $400 million dollars of domestic revenue.  </span><br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">The presidents of two West African countries, Mali and Burkina Faso, that heavily rely on profit from cotton trade and sale agree that the damage that American subsidies has done to the African economy has been devastating and unbelievably selfish </span><br />
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Narrow'; mso-bidi-font-style: italic">In the period from 2001 to 2002, America's 25,000 cotton farmers received more in subsidies—some $3 billion—than the entire economic output of Burkina Faso, where two million people depend on cotton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Further, United States subsidies are concentrated on just 10 percent of its cotton farmers. Thus, the payments to about 2,500 relatively well-off farmers have the unintended but nevertheless real effect of impoverishing some 10 million rural poor people in West and Central Africa. (Touré and Compaoré, 2003). </span><br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">Is it right that the United States values its 2,500 citizens that are living well and forgets about the countries in Africa who rely on cotton trade and revenue as a stimulant to their poor economy? As human beings that make up the USDA and USFG observing the plight of Africans being caused by US cotton subsidies, I wonder where in this world is morality? When is it that we feel the urge to practice morality before worrying about our bank accounts? Is there no code of conduct when it comes to hurting an entire continent? Or is it really true that as long as we are able to raise the price of cotton in America, as we flood the market and lower prices for the world market and reach our profit then the suffering of others, the casualties do not matter?  </span><br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">What America has been ignoring is the detrimental effect that continuing the system of subsidies also has for the world view of America, a country that boasts free trade and says they believe in the liberalization of the trade system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Helling, Beuler and Hall, who have studied the benefits of reform for agricultural policy remind us that: </span><br />
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Narrow'">Though these subsidies facilitate market stability for a few U.S. cotton producers, they undermine the more general U.S. argument in favor of free trade and have an enormous impact on the international economy. <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">America</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">’s dogged resistance against reducing or eliminating cotton subsidies weakens America’s international legitimacy and breeds anti-Americanism. America’s position as a leader in trade talks and economic integration begins to look hypocritical when it refuses to budge on issues like agricultural reform. </span>Given the fact that trade is correlated with both peace and prosperity, reconsidering U.S. cotton programs (as well agricultural subsidies more generally), would be in the national interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> </span><br />
