Contention 1: The Terrorists<br />
<br />
The Bush Administration is preparing to label the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization. THis is a continuation of the current politics of security which enables violent military aggression across the globe<br />
<br />
<strong>The New York Times 2007</strong> (August 15th &quot;US Weighing terrorist label for Iran Guards&quot;)<br />
<br />
THe bush administration...    ...called its destabilizing role in iraq.<br />
<br />
The Iran/US conflict is unqique it is characterized by constant demonization and a refusal to compromise with each other. <br />
Beeman 2003 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/anthropological_quarterly/v076/76.4beeman.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/anthropological_quarterly/v076/76.4beeman.pdf</a>) <br />
Post-Modern Conflict...   ...both nations held of each other <br />
<br />
Adding the Revolutionary Guard to the terrorist list will be the tipping point for regional conflict between the U.S. and Iran-Only dialogue solves<br />
Hashemi 2007 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://globalpolitician.com/articledes.asp?ID=3474&amp;cid=1&amp;sid=27" rel="nofollow">http://globalpolitician.com/articledes.asp?ID=3474&amp;cid=1&amp;sid=27</a>) <br />
As long as Tehran...  ...democracy internally.<br />
<br />
Fear of the unkown creates a resentment of evil driving us to eliminate anything that is not domestic. This cycle of violence is repeated endlessly because there is always another danger lurking around the conrer.<br />
Der Derian 98 (On security Chapter 2)<br />
THe desire for security...   ...mistrust and evil experiences.<br />
<br />
These Security calculations are the zero point of the Holocaust<br />
Dillion 99<br />
<br />
Insecurity makes life not worth living-fear is death-only embracing our relationship with the unpredictable affirms life<br />
Osho 99(The book of Secrets pg. 1004)<br />
You are afraid... ...you do is just a deception<br />
<br />

<br />
Contention 2: The Iranian Revolutionary Guard<br />
<br />
The Terrorist list will foreclose future dialogue<br />
Financial Times 9/29/07<br />
While the economic... ...nuclear issue and -terrorism<br />
<br />
<br />
Dialogue leads to substantive improvments in relations between the U.S. and Iran<br />
Boston Globe 9/26/07<br />
That would be a pity...  ...between the two sides<br />
<br />
<br />
We don't claim to &quot;solve&quot; violence , but removal of obtuse poltiical labels will allow a more effective focus on violence than the SQ<br />
Nusseibeh 06 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://sari.alquds.edu/elusive_answer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sari.alquds.edu/elusive_answer.htm</a>)<br />
In conclusion...   ...they could be contained.<br />
<br />
The aff is a precondition to all ethical evaluations and conflict resolution<br />
Zlomislic 04 (www.the-philosopher.co.uk/conflict.htm)<br />
Kants concept of hospitality... ...(chez lui chez l'autre)<br />
<br />
Repersentations, not rational action, cause violence<br />
Der Derian 2002 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/pmt/exhibits/1066/DerDerian.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/pmt/exhibits/1066/DerDerian.pdf</a>) <br />
The charge of moral...  ...It wouldn't be.&quot; <br />
<br />
Realism's exclusive state focus is irrational and obscures a complete analysis of global politics<br />
George and Cambell 1990<br />
The impetus...  ...political exclusion of others&quot;<br />
<br />
Realism has acted as a shadow for ideological justifications of violence<br />
Checkel 98 (The Constructivist turn in international relations theory)<br />
The constructivst critque of neorealism...  ...they are mutually constituted<br />
<br />
Realism derives from our concepts of mastery and normalcy, this precludes any solution<br />
Saurette 96 <br />
The notion that realism...  ...of control and order
