<strong><u>1AC</u></strong><br />
Contention One: The Taliban<br />
The illegal opium trade is contributing to a Taliban resurgence<br />
Johnson 07 (Thomas, “on the edge of the big muddy”, China and Eurasia quarterly, www.comw.org/warreport/fulltext/0705johnson.pdf)<br />
Kw: the Taliban resurgence….government is struggling for its survival….narcotics industry<br />
<br />
<br />
Opium is the root cause of instabiloity – stopping the drug trade is essential to prevent terrorism and conflict from overtaking Afghan<br />
Van Ham and Kamminga, 07 (peter and Jorrit, “poppies for peace” Washington quart)<br />
Kw: security and development….main source of income….lingering drug crisis<br />
<br />
<br />
Opium will destroy Afghan w/o the plan<br />
Costa et al 06 (Antonio maria, “Afghanistan: 2006 annual opium poppy survey”, www.unodc.org/pdf/execsummaryafg.pdf<br />
Either Afghanistan destroys…bottomless pit of destruction<br />
<br />
US action is key – its eradication policy alienates Afghans and fuels the Taliban<br />
Van Ham and Kamminga<br />
Kw: the results…eradication measures…field research…addressed effectively<br />
<br />
Eradication will undermine intel gathering and cause a Taliban resurgence<br />
Felbab-Brown 07 (vanda, “afghanistan’s opium wars” wall street journl, www.brookings.edu/views/op-ed/fellows/felbabbrown20070220.htm)<br />
Kw: even more importantly….bankrupted by eradication…strengthened insurgency<br />
<br />
Resurgence of the Taliban will embolden Pakistan, causing a south asian nuc war that draws in US and china<br />
Kavanagh, 07 (trevor, The Sun, “we need to win the hearts and minds at home too, l/n)<br />
Kw” but these fragile movements are an affront….spread of terror”<br />
<br />
And you can forget about Kashmir – afghan is the new battleground between India &amp; pak<br />
Rashid, 06 (ahmed, Daily Telegraph,)<br />
Kw: despite bush and blair…funding an insurgency…accede to its demands<br />
<br />
The result is nuclear winter<br />
Fai 01 (ghulam nabi, Washington times, 7/8)<br />
The most dangerous place on the planet is Kashmir…cut-off convention<br />
<br />
Stable afghan is a prerequ to sustainable terrorism prevention – drug money is key to future Al Qaeda attacks<br />
Brookes and Ju-Yung 04 (peter and Chung, Afghan Abyss, www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed012604a.cfm<br />
Kw? But here’s the bad news…war on terror…depends on it<br />
<br />
Fundamentalists will attack w/ a nuclear weapon<br />
Kraska 07 (james, Am Univ Intl Law Rvw)<br />
Kw: atomic bomb design and manufacture…islamic extremists…last decade<br />
<br />
That escalates to nuc war<br />
Speice 06 (Patrick, Wm &amp; Mary Law Rvw)<br />
The potential consequences of the unchecked spread of nuclear knowledge…full-scale nuclear conflict<br />
<br />
<br />
Destabilization of Pakistan alone will cause fundamentalist uprisings and multiple nuclear wars<br />
Morgan, 07 (Stephen, “better another Taliban Afghanistan”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Better-Another-Taliban-Afghanistan,-than-a-Taliban-NUCLEAR-Pakistan?&amp;id=475808%29" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Better-Another-Taliban-Afghanistan,-than-a-Taliban-NUCLEAR-Pakistan?&amp;id=475808)</a><br />
Kw” however, events may prove him sorely wrong…nuclear arsenal, pitted against the US<br />
<br />
w/o US action to show our commitment, afghan will succumb to regional proxy-wars<br />
Khalilzad, 05 (zalmay, the national interest)<br />
First, we have to help the leaders of regional powers shift away…short attention span<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: Opium trade<br />
<br />
Afghan is key to the global market for heroin<br />
UN 07 (Un office on drugs and crime, www.unodc.org/pdf/research/wdr07/WDR_2007.pdf<br />
At least in the short-run, condition in the world’s heroin markets…new record high…over 2005<br />
<br />
Increases in heroin use from Afghan have become the primary cause of the global AIDS epidemic<br />
UN 07 (same)<br />
Heroin accounts for more than 70 per cent of opiates abuse…transmission of HIV in recent years…global average<br />
<br />
Unchecked AIDS results in extinction<br />
Ojedokun et al 07 (educational research and review v2n6, “policy, philosophy and pedagogical initiative to HIV/AIDS education in the Nigerian secondary school’s social studies curriculum,” www.academicjournals.org?ERR/PDF/pdf%202007/Jun?Ojedokun%20et%20al..pdf)<br />
Kw: apparently, of the numerous civic issues…group will be affected<br />
<br />
<br />
The increase of AIDS will cause multiple nuc wars<br />
Randy Cheek 04 (“public health as a global security issue” Foreign services Journal, December, www.afsa.org/fsj/dec04/Cheeck.pdf<br />
Kw: preying upon our most innate of drives…the next wave…internal conflict…regional conflict and instability<br />
<br />
<br />
Afghan opium is responsible for the AIDS outbreak in Russia<br />
Maskas 05 (Marisa, Tulsa J of Comp &amp; Int’l Law)<br />
After the communist fall, increases in availability, heroin along Russia’s drug trafficking routes…accounts for 36 percent of AIDS cases<br />
<br />
The impact is an AIDS-tuberculosis cocktail that will cause extinction<br />
Grinberg et al. 06 (Lev, “Russia’s Yekaterinburg faces combined outbreak of HIV, TB” BBC Monitoring)<br />
The sitting of the presidium of the State Council….experts describe…frightening infection cocktails which in principle can threaten humankind<br />
<br />
<br />
AIDS will destroy the Russian economy<br />
Gordon 02 (David, “the next wave of HIV/AIDS” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://img.thebody.com/whatis/pdfs/aids_wave.pdf%29" rel="nofollow">http://img.thebody.com/whatis/pdfs/aids_wave.pdf)</a><br />
The rising AIDS problem in Russia is likely to exacerbate…such as heart disease and TB<br />
<br />
<br />
The impact is nuclear war<br />
Steven David, 1999<br />
<br />
<br />
THE PLAN: the USFG should constructively engage the government of Afghanistan by offering to provide assistance for the establishment and operation of a village-based opium licensing scheme for the domestic production of opium alkaloids for domestic use and export to nations outside the current market for licit opiates.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOLVENCY:<br />
Opium licensing guarantees economic development by providing incentives for Afghan farmers to switch from illegal drug production to manufacture of opiate painkillers like morphine<br />
Senlis Council 07 (“poppy for medicine” www.senliscouncil.net/documents/poppy_medicine_technical_dossier)<br />
The local production of finished poppy-based medicines…benefit the Afghan government….Poppy for Medicine projects<br />
<br />
<br />
And, we don’t need to win full solvency – even if we stop half the drug trade, we’ll still provide stability<br />
Applebaum 07 (Anne, “legalize it: how to solve Afghanistan’s drug problem” Jan 16, slate.com)<br />
Why not add Afghanistan to this list…expand poppy eradication further<br />
<br />
<br />
A shortage of painkillers in developing countries ensures a market for Afghan morphine, which can be sold in the short term to provide security and economic development of Afghanistan<br />
Van Ham and Kamminga<br />
Afghanistan should explore other ways to decrease its illicit opium economy…it would be possible to set upa medicine-producing industry in the short term…developing world<br />
<br />
<br />
Afghanistan will say yes – they already have legal mechanisms in place, but need political backing<br />
Van Ham and Kamminga<br />
Afghanistan should be fully responsible for and in control of such a new system…terrorist groups to operate<br />
<br />

US action is key to local model – only the US has the political resources to get local communities on board<br />
Zalmay Khalilzad, the national interest “how to nation-build”<br />
Second, Afghanistan is succeeding because the united states…Americans have been seen as a catalyst…rooted in the old order…..by virtue of its power…world’s only superpower<br />

No solvency – only the US has built the relationships and experiences in building the political capital of local political leaders – this is key to solvency – successful local politics is key to winning in Afghanistan<br />
