Displacement K cites (Missouri State FJ)<br />
The affirmative posits change in the realm of current political institutions. The activism of the 1AC acts as an end rather than a beginning because we are only able to effectuate positive change only insofar as the 1AC gives us permission. The 1AC’s attempt to beat the system at its own game results in a colonizing of our collective consciousness and obfuscates alternative ways of thinking and knowing the world around us. Reclaiming the ability to ethically relate to individuals is a necessary pre-cursor to changing the negative conditions cited in the 1AC<br />
<br />
Peter Hershock (East-West Center) 1999 “Changing the way society changes”, Journal of Buddhist Ethics, 6, 154<br />
<br />
I have argued at some length ….. right' and 'being wronged'\<br />
Their insistence of the political as the background to the project is the ultimate unethical act because it presupposes that ethical posture in and of itself is unsufficient absent its capacity to generate change with the domain of institutional politics<br />
<br />
Adam Thurschwell (Asst. Prof. of Law, Cleveland State University) 2003 24 Cardozo L. Rev. 1193<br />
<br />
Thus, as Derrida puts it….resembles pure faith.<br />
The affirmatives framing of the question in terms of what the government should do obfuscates our own personal responsibility for the violence that surrounds us. The continual search for grand stages of action for solutions to violence elides the fact that we create the conditions that allow violence in our everyday thoughts. We as individual must recognize and focus on our own ethical responsibility for war and violence<br />
<br />
Susanne Kappeler (Associate Professor at Al-Akhawayn University) 1995 The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, pg. 75-76<br />
<br />
War does not suddenly break out ….values of war and violence.<br />
It is this displacement of our personal ethical commitments that allows for genocidal violence to take place. The allowance of political institutions to determine what is and is not ethical action or is the root of all atrocities<br />
<br />
Zupancic Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan, March 2000, p. 96-7<br />
<br />
“Another problem still remains, however: ….a by-product' of our actions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our alternative: Reject the affirmatives displacement of their ethical commitment on outside institutions but embrace the individual ethical responsibility embodied within the 1AC.<br />
The use of the law as the vehicle for ethical change and social activism is counter-productive. The Affirmative will argue that they are a unique case of reform but the combination of personal ethical activism with the law creates saps any form of radical action or change. It mandates authoritarianism and violence and is independently unethical because it sacrifices relationships in the name of political expediency<br />
<br />
Dennis Fox (Emeritus Associate Professor, Legal Studies University of Illinois at Springfield) 1991 “Law Against Social Change” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dennisfox.net/papers/law-against.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dennisfox.net/papers/law-against.html</a><br />
<br />
Well-meaning efforts by ….. threats or the mystification of legitimacy.<br />
Embracing the alternative and divorcing our personal ethical commitments onto external institutions solves. Every individual action is key, ethics is impossible without divorcing ourselves from the political and the realm of political action<br />
<br />
Adam Thurschwell (Associate Professor of Law B.A., Yale University) 2003 “Specters of Nietzsche: Potential Futures for the Concept of the Political in Agamben and Derrida” 24 Cardozo L. Rev. 1193,<br />
<br />
I would not call this attitude utopian. ….concerns the political and political action<br />
