Judged by Clark<br />
<strong>Plan: The United States federal government should offer to fully comply with its obligations under Article Six of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in return for a commitment from the government of Iran to not seek the development of nuclear weapons.</strong><br />
<strong><u>1AC</u><br />
Contention one: Manufacturing War</strong><br />
<strong>Iran</strong><strong>’s nuclear program is not an ahistorical phenomena that sprung out of an irrational desire for blood, but as a result of United States recommendation to the Shah’s pro-American regime. Iran and the US ratified the NPT on the same day. However, the nature of their relationship began to change. Iran’s nuclear program became a threat the same time their foreign policy fell out of lockstep with the United States’. Instead of adhering to its own promises of eventual disarmament, the US is attempting to prevent other nations from pursuing programs. Our historical involvement produced an ideology which defines Iran as a threat.<br />

&quot;Us policy makers… ongoing tug-of-war</strong>&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Our hysteria over Iran’s nuclear program is produced though an orientalist discourse which equates Islam with irrationality and untrustworthiness, trying to maintain the bomb as privilege that can only be granted to those who actively support the expansion of American power.<br />
Izadi and Saghaye-Biria 07<br />
“The case of Iran’s Nuclear Program” Journal of Communication Inquiry v31 n2<br />
&quot;the three newspapers’… can be trusted with.</strong>&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>This production of Iran as a threat occurs through a process of manufacturing consent. The way Iran is translated to us as an irrational enemy incapable of handling a nuclear program is part of an ideological effort to produce a reality that is increasingly violent and genocidal.<br />
Adib-Moghaddam 07<br />
“Manufactuing war: Iran in the neo-conservative imagination” Third world quarterly 28:3<br />
&quot;Abu Nasr Farabi expressed… liberation of mankind&quot;</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Our ideological investment with Iran and its dangerous nuclear program creates a binary narrative which reveals the truth about Iran, yet banishes as irrational anything which contests our preconceived understanding of the situation. This narrative merely serves to produce knowledge of the other as the archrival enemy of the West and a source of instability in need of management and salvation. However, this salvation only functions to assert our superiority and define the inhumanity of our enemy.<br />
Izadi and Saghaye-Biria 07<br />
“The case of Iran’s Nuclear Program” Journal of Communication Inquiry v31 n2<br />
&quot;Using critical discourse analysis… of the out-group</strong>&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>In assigning itself as the responsible agent for ending proliferation, the US seeks to produce a docile subjectivity and a Western-centric order rooted in the belief that some countries are entitled to nuclear weapons and others are not – these dichotomies are racialized and violent, denying the humanity of others in the very constitution of ourselves as human.<br />

<br />
<strong>Contention Two: Re-Framing Politics<br />
Constructive engagement with Iran offering negative security guarantees and Article VI compliance is necessary to revitalize the NPT in ways that respond to its weaknesses. The plan provides an opportunity for Iran to show its commitment to a peaceful future without the threat of violence looming over their head. Abandoning the NPT would merely legitimize the imperial mission of the US.<br />

“For if states-parties approach…nuclear material and technology.”</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>While we downplay Iran’s right to nuclear technology, the US consistently denies its own obligations under the NPT. Our cynical application of the NPT to the Iranian other maintains a violent nuclear apartheid. We must focus on our mutual responsibility in the elimination of nuclear weapons in order to direct our approach away from violence.<br />

<br />
<strong>Our affirmative approaches the question of weapons and the NPT from a disarmament frame rather than a proliferation frame. This allows us to rupture our image of the proliferating rogue in order to reshape the priorities of the NPT and open possibilities for a different relationship to technology and weapons.<br />

Contention One: Ready to Die<br />
Killing cultures and living cultures are performed by different means. Killing cultures operate under the veil of an imperialist universalism. They self-perpetuate by eradicating difference and colonizing history and future. Killing cultures inability to respect otherness creates diverse forms of violence and makes war and extermination inevitable. Living cultures, on the other hand, begin from the question of difference, solidarity, and universal humanity. They provide not only alternatives to the imperialistic mode of relating to difference but the conditions for cooperation and coexistence as an expression of freedom. The contrast between living cultures and killing cultures is the basis of our critique of the status quo.<br />
Dr. Vandana Shiva, Alternative Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader in the International Forum on Globalization and one of India’s leading and groundbreaking Theoretical Physicists, 2005, Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace, pg 109-111<br />
Our age is marred by …the midst of killing cultures.<br />
The United States’ policy towards Lebanon cannot be divorced from its history of interference. The people of Lebanon are forced by their elite to succumb to the policies of the US, World Bank, and IMF, all symbols of America’s hegemony, while at the same time living amidst culture wars fully supported by the US. The form of globalization being promoted here, one where America provides assistance only in exporting violence, provides for nothing but a bleak future for Lebanon.<br />
As`ad AbuKhalil, Research Fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of California Berkeley and Professor of Political Science at CSU Stanislaus and Our History 12A Professor, February 2000, Lebanon: Key Battleground for Middle East Policy, Foreign Policy in Focus, Volume 5, Number 2, International Relations Center (IRC)<br />
Lebanon has historically prided … can only look forward to an aggressive and often violent imposition of American economic and political will.<br />
Washington’s stake in reconstruction was not about attending to the needs of others nor a rush to repair the destruction caused by its own foreign policy towards Lebanon. It was nothing more than an attempt to make profit through neoliberal restructuring. Of the billions made, the average Lebanese person has seen none of it yet they are the ones who bear the full burden of debt every day and are forced to serve at the will of America’s geopolitical concerns. The unconditional cancellation and reparation of Lebanon’s debt is a necessary starting point to investigate this logic and attempt at change.<br />
Renaud Vivien, member of CADTM, 1/31/2k7, “The Paris III Conference on Assistance to Lebanon: Who Aids Whom?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/vivien310107.html" rel="nofollow">http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/vivien310107.html</a><br />

Even the postwar reconstruction …who are disproportionately Shi'a.<br />
These problems did not suddenly spring fully armed from the head of the World Bank. They are a result of the conscious set of politics aimed at promoting a form of development which extracts the blood of the poor for the sake of further developing the rich. The operation of debt policy is akin to waging undeclared war, forcing people to sacrifice to pay back loans they never asked for and from which they derive no gain.<br />
Susan George, Associate Director of the Transnational Institute and Serves on the International Board of Greenpeace, 1997, “How the Poor Develop the Rich,” The Post-Development Reader, pg 207-213<br />
If the goals of official debt managers were to squeezer the…They are still doing it, and, quite simply, they have to be stopped.<br />
Debt embodies a relationship that instrumentalizes life—it constitutes a political bond based on control and expendability.<br />

First, we have seen a general … disposed of as slaves, pawns, or clients.<br />
Debt-Slavery legitimizes a global economy of death. The anti-life dimensions of economic security ensure people become less than capital exchange, culminating in extinction.<br />
Dr. Vandana Shiva, Alternative Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader in the International Forum on Globalization and one of India’s leading and groundbreaking Theoretical Physicists, 2005, Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace, pg 13-14<br />
The word economics is … has mutated into “live or live not.”<br />
Our commitment to this imperialistic globalization is emerging as the worst form of genocide in our times. Society is emerging as the killing culture, founded on a reductionist perspective which constructs the world in terms of monocultures, legitimizing the most violent forms of exclusion. We must shift form our life-annihilating tendencies to a life-preserving processes.<br />
Dr. Vandana Shiva, Alternative Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader in the International Forum on Globalization and one of India’s leading and groundbreaking Theoretical Physicists, 2005, Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace, pg 111-113/120<br />

Debt 1AC—Solvency<br />
Contention Two: Life After Debt<br />
Despite its massive debt, Lebanon is excluded from the current campaign for debt cancellation—only our unconditional demand for cancellation can successfully challenge the US’ current policies of economic imperialism.<br />
Robert Naiman, Senior Policy Analyst and National Coordinator of Just Foreign Policy, 1999, No Jubilee for the Middle East?, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.merip.org/mer/mer213/213_naiman.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.merip.org/mer/mer213/213_naiman.html</a><br />
The website of Jubilee 2000-… &quot;It never did and it never will.&quot;<br />
Debt is the worst injustice in human history. The case of Lebanon is emblematic of it’s operation as slavery and extortion on a global scale. We in the West have a solemn and absolutely undeniable duty to alter our political and economic priorities by canceling it.<br />
Michael Rowbotham, British Economist and Lecturer, 1996, The Grip of Death, P. 147-149)<br />
It seems only just that if … and take place at a humane rate.<br />
Only our affirmative which paces human rights at the center of economic thought can arrest vicious cycles of violence by breeding living cultures amongst killing ones.<br />

Negative economies and negative … diversity is the alternative to globalization.<br />
The call for debt cancellation is a lens through which all international financial and political relations can be brought into focus. Our plan is a starting point towards radical change. Our focus on the nexus between capital, militarism, and identity allows a synergistic approach to politics that makes radical transformation possible.<br />
Dot Keet, Senior Researcher, Centre for Southern Africa Studies, School of Government at University of The Western Cape, South Africa, 1999, The International Anti-Debt Campaign – an Activist View From &quot;the South&quot; to Activists in &quot;The North&quot;…and the South, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.milli.no/~forum/dokumenter/activist.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.milli.no/~forum/dokumenter/activist.htm</a><br />
