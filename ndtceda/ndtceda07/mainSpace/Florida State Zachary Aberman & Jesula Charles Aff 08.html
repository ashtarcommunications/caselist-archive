Obs. 1: The world we live in<br />
<br />
As a response to a perceived threat the United States will use military strikes against Iran<br />
The Economist, February 10th, 2007<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should constructively engage Iran by offering a security guarantee that the United States will not participate in our support any military strikes against Iran.<br />

Observation II: A slave to the game<br />
<br />
The United States attempt to halt the development of Iranian nuclear technology is a tool of imperialist domination.<br />

Stopping Iran’s uranium enrichment program makes Iran a slave to United States usury by making Iran dependent on American energy. <br />

This example of neocolonialism descends Iranian life into domination and submission<br />

Observation III: Fire Dance<br />
<br />
An American attack on the nation of Iran would involve bunker buster weapons which would serve to blur the distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons- killing hundreds of thousands of people.<br />

The nuclear firebreak is key to stopping a nuclear war, while it is in place there is no risk, without it nuclear escalation becomes inevitable.<br />

Observation IV: The crazy giant<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
America is sick with Super power syndrome. An illness where it seeks to control the world through domination yet paradoxically has an intense fear of vulnerability. America’s policy towards Iranian nuclear program is Super Power Syndrome to the fullest where the US feels that it has the right to decide which technology Iran deserves because of America’s intense fear of competition on the world stage.<br />

<br />
In order to maintain Super Power Syndrome the US will eliminate the vulnerability perpetuated by Iran.<br />
Lifton, Robert Jay. 2003 Super Power Syndrome (Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical College)<br />
<br />
<br />
Our nuclear dominance represented by our relations with Iran is representative of Super Power Syndrome. The US will take all actions necessary to remain the only nuclear super power and comes to be grouped with a fear and eradication of terrorism.<br />
<br />
Lifton, Robert Jay. 2003 Super Power Syndrome (Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical College)<br />
<br />
<br />
The militarized “War on Terror” justifies endless violence<br />
<br />
Lifton, Robert Jay. 2003 Super Power Syndrome (Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical College)<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan is a realization that Iran could become a rival nation. This act is key to stepping off of the treadmill of death and apocalyptic violence.<br />
<br />
Lifton, Robert Jay. 2003 Super Power Syndrome (Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical College)<br />
<br />
<br />
The notion that Iran will build a nuclear weapon is unfounded. It goes against their political and religious beliefs, the Iran-Iraq war proves.<br />
