OBSERVATION 1: THE SUBSIDY DEBATE<br />
<br />
THE HISTORY OF U.S. ARGICULTURAL POLICY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE CONSTANT POLICY DEBATES ABOUT THE INCREASE OR DECREASE OF AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT BY THE USFG, REVEALS A RHETORICAL TERRAIN WHERE COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS OF RURALITY SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR ALL MAJOR POLICY DECISIONS. IN ALL INSTANCES, COMPETING CAMPS OF POLICYMAKERS HAVE CONSTRUCTED THE INTEREST OF 'RURAL AMERICA' IN LINE WITH A PARTICULAR INTERPRETATION OF AGRICULTURAL POLICY AT A GIVEN TIME. THE DEBATE ABOUT RURALITY SHIFTS BACK-AND-FORTH BETWEEN AN IDEALIZED CONSTRUCTION OF THE FAMILY FARMER AS THE BULWARK OF DEMOCRACY AND THE USE OF THE FARMER AS AN ULTIMATE SYMBOL OF AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN A GLOBAL MARKETPLACE<br />
Dixon &amp; Hapke<u>2003 (Deborah P. Dixon [Institute of Geography and Earth Sciences, University of Wales-Aberystwyth] &amp; Holly M. Hapke [Department of Geography, East Carolina Universiyt]; &quot;Cultivating Discourse: The Social Construction of Agricultural Legislation&quot;, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 93(1), pp. 142-164)<br />
&quot;The New Deal... by government.&quot;<br />
<br />
CONSISTENT WITH THIS HISTORICAL FRAMING OF 'THE RURAL' IN AMERICAN POLICY DEBATES ABOUT USFG ACTION, THE TRANSITION INTO THE 21ST CENTURY HAS SEEN THESE DEBATES PLAY OUT ALONG THE SAME LINES. THE CALL FOR THE REDUCTION OF SUBSIDIES FOLLOWS THE CONSERVATIVE LOGIC OF UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THE FREE MARKET. THIS LOGIC FACES OFF AGAINST THE PROGRESSIVE ARGUMENT ABOUT FAMILY FARMS BEING AT THE HEART OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. IN BOTH CASES, RURALITY IS CONFLATED WITH AN IDEALIZED NOTION OF THE AMERICAN FARMER.<br />
Dixon &amp; Hapke</u>2003 (Deborah P. Dixon [Institute of Geography and Earth Sciences, University of Wales-Aberystwyth] &amp; Holly M. Hapke [Department of Geography, East Carolina Universiyt]; &quot;Cultivating Discourse: The Social Construction of Agricultural Legislation&quot;, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 93(1), pp. 142-164)<br />
&quot;According to... global mission.&quot;<br />
<br />
THE EFFECTS OF THIS CONFLATION OF 'RURAL' WITH 'AGRICULTURE' IN THE TERRAIN OF USFG POLICYMAKING PRODUCES FINANCIAL DEVASTATION THROUGHOUT RURAL AMERICA – A MYRIAD OF RURAL LIFESTYLES AND PEOPLES ARE RENDERED INVISIBLE IN THESE DEBATES. THE ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES ARE RIFE WITH ASSUMPTIONS MADE ABOUT RURAL AMERICANS FROM AN URBANIZED PERSPECTIVE<br />
Porter<u>2005 (Katherine Porter [Assoc Prof of Law, U of Iowa College of Law]; &quot;Going Broke the Hard Way: The Economics of Rural Failure,&quot; Wisconsin Law Review 969, l/n)<br />
&quot;For most... nonfarm families.&quot;<br />
<br />
THIS SITUATION RESULTS IN THE STEREOTYPING OF RURAL DWELLERS AS OUTSIDERS, WHICH PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION FOR DISCRIMINATION THAT CONTINUALLY DISTANCES AND MARGINALIZES THE RURAL POOR<br />
Bassett_2006 (Debra Lyn Bassett, visiting professor of law at the University of California Davis, &quot;Distancing Rural Poverty,&quot; 13 Geo. J. Poverty Law &amp;Pol'y 3, lexis)<br />
&quot;In addition... and bias.&quot;<br />
<br />
THIS DISCRIMINATION RELIES ON THE IMPLICIT ASSUMPTION THAT POOR WHITE RURAL AMERICANS ARE GENETICALLY DEFECTIVE. THIS OTHERIZATION IS THE LOGIC OF EUGENICS<br />
Newitz &amp; Wray_1997 (Annalee Newitz and Matt Wray [Newitz, Ph.D from U.C. Berkely in English and American studies, and served as a fellow at M.I.T. Wray graduated from University of California, Berkeley's doctoral program in Ethnic Studies in 2000 &amp; spent the following academic year as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the National Museum of American History @ the Smithsonian Institute; writes about cultural and social theory and teaches courses in race and ethnic relations], White Trash: Race and Class in America, pp. 2-3)<br />
&quot;According to... class differences.&quot;<br />
<br />
THIS PORTRAYAL OF RURAL WHITES AS GENETICALLY INFERIOR FEEDS A DIALECTIC OF HATE BETWEEN THE MIDDLE-CLASS AND LOWER-CLASS WHITES. THE ELIMINATION OF LOWER-CLASS WHITES BY MIDDLE-CLASS WHITES BECOMES JUSTIFIED VIOLENCE. THE OTHER EFFECT OF THIS RHETORICAL FRAMING IS TO POSIT WHITES AS VICTIMS, ALLOWING A SIMULATION OF RACIAL INNOCENCE. THIS PROVIDES A LOOPHOLE FOR WHITENESS TO AVOID THE QUESTION OF HOW WHITE SUPREMACY IS UTILIZED AS A TOOL OF DOMINATION AGAINST OTHER RACES<br />
Newitz</u>1997 (Annalee Newitz [Ph.D from U.C. Berkely in English and American studies, and served as a fellow at M.I.T.];&quot;White Savagery and Humiliation&quot;, Wray and Newitz; White Trash: Race and Class in America, pp. 144-145)<br />
&quot;Seen in this light... non-whites.&quot;<br />
<br />
THE CONFLATION OF 'RURAL' WITH 'AGRICULTURE' IS UNFORTUNATE, GIVEN THAT ONLY ABOUT 6% OF RURAL AMERICANS ARE FARMERS *. IN ORDER TO COMBAT THE LATENT NORMS OF WHITE SUPREMACY AND RURALISM INHERENT IN THE WAY THAT THIS YEAR'S RESOLUTION FRAMES THE DEBATE ABOUT AGRICULTURAL POLICY, WE INVITE YOU TO AFFIRM THE MOSAIC OF POSSIBILITIES OF RURALITY THE RESOLUTION CONTAINS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Resolved: That the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies, for biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat.<br />

OBSERVATION 2: VOTE AFF<br />
<br />
RECOGNITION OF RURALISM IS THE NECESSARY FIRST STEP FOR CHANGE<br />
Bassett<u>2003 (Debra Lynn Bassett [Professor of Law at Michigan State University] &quot;Ruralism,&quot; 88 Iowa Law Review 273, pp. 17-18)<br />
&quot;Rural dwellers... maximize opportunities.&quot;<br />
<br />
FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE RURALISM &amp; INTERROGATE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF RURALITY AND THE CONSTANTLY CONFLICTING IMAGES IT PRODUCES MEANS THAT LEGAL FRAMEWORKS LIKE THE RESOLUTION WILL ALWAYS PERPETRATE INJUSTICE<br />
Pruitt</u>2006 (Lisa R. Pruitt [Professor, University of California, Davis, School of Law] Rural Rhetoric, 39 Conn. L. Rev. 159, November, LN)<br />
&quot;A large share... rural America.&quot;<br />
<br />
EMBRACING THE POSSIBILITY OF DIFFERENCE IN REGARD TO RURALITY UNDERMINES THE BINARY LOGIC THAT FRAMES POLICY DEBATES ABOUT AGRICULTURE<br />
Dixon &amp; Hapke<u>2003 (Deborah P. Dixon [Institute of Geography and Earth Sciences, University of Wales-Aberystwyth] &amp; Holly M. Hapke [Department of Geography, East Carolina Universiyt]; &quot;Cultivating Discourse: The Social Construction of Agricultural Legislation&quot;, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 93(1), pp. 142-164)<br />

CHALLENGING DEBATES FRAMED IN DUALISTIC UNDERSTANDINGS OF SUBJECTIVITY IS THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE THE CASE<br />

Heidegger Aff<br />
Round 6 UNLV<br />
The aff’s will to will (i.e. being resolved to do plan action) regards everything as a resource to be manipulated – this is what enables power and domination<br />
Rohkramer ’05 (Thomas Rohkramer [teaches modern Germany in the Dept of History @Lancaster U, UK]; “Martin Heidegger, National Socialism, and Environmentalism,” in How Green Were the Nazis? Nature, Environment, and Nation in the Third Reich, edited by Franz-Josef Bruggmeier, Marc Cioc, and Thomas Zeller, pp. 181)<br />
[Heidegger’s most comprehensive criticism… …decisive for Heidegger from 1936 onwards]<br />
<br />
DIALOGUE from Heidegger’s “Conversation on a Country Path”<br />
Scholar: Non-willing, for one thing… …uncovered something essential<br />
<br />
Agriculture is the ultimate embodiment of the will – it is nothing but an attempt to master and control the earth while objectifying all aspects of nature into usable/calculable resources.<br />
Heidegger ’53 (Martin Heidegger [Philosopher/professor] The Question Concerning Technology, publishing 1977 in Basic Writings, pp. 320-1)<br />
And yet, the revealing that holds sway… …turns the wheel that keep a factory running.<br />
<br />
Next, this will to calculate and control reduces all of nature to a stable and always predictable standing reserve. All beings are rendered objects in a steadfast refusal of the revelations of Being, ensuring war and ecocide.<br />
Zimmerman ’81 (Michael E. Zimmerman [prof of Philosophy @ Tulane U]; Eclipse of the Self: The Development of Heidegger’s Concept of Authenticity, pp. 220-4)<br />
In 1951, Heidegger noted… …the capitalist is a rational miser.”<br />
<br />
The aff’s ethics and guilt reassert managerial control – they view the problem having resulted from humanity’s failure to manage properly, i.e. that more managerialism will solve the problem. This serves to reinforce human control.<br />
McWhorter ’92 (Professor of philosophy and women’s studies department of philosophy, University of Richmond. [La Delle, Heidegger and the Earth: Essays in Environmental Ethics, page 8-9])<br />
When we respond to Heidegger’s call… …even if what is shattered eventually is ourselves.<br />
<br />
DIALOGUE from Heidegger’s “Conversation on a Country Path”<br />
Teacher: Horizon and transcendence… …to our re-presenting are objects<br />
<br />
Thus, alternative is releasement to this openness – in which simply being resolved allows for an entirely novel revelation of Being outside of the domain of the will and its strangehold on politics.<br />
Zimmerman ’81 (Michael E. Zimmerman [prof of Philosophy at Tulane U]; Eclipse of the Self: The Development of Heidegger’s Concept of Authenticity, pp. 245-8)<br />
Under the domination of egoism and self-will… …beyond the personal God of Creation<br />
<br />
DIALOGUE from Heidegger’s “Conversation on a Country Path”<br />
Scholar: To be sure, I don’t know yet… …belong to the domain of the will.<br />
Scientist: Releasement is indeed the release… the coming forth of truth’s nature
