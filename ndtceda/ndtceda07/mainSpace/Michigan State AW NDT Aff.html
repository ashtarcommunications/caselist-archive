Round # 7<br />
vs Team: Emory MS<br />
Judge: (Smith, Burk, Bauschard)<br />
<br />
Plan Text Same as Casebook<br />
<br />
<br />
1ac w/ cites New China Advantage<br />
War between US and China in Taiwan Straits Coming this year (BBC 08, “The Growing Danger in the Strait)<br />
Even absent intentional attack, current levels of Chinese defense spending will cause miscalculation (WSJ, 08, “China’s Military Boost May Stir Fear”)<br />
This escalates to all out war (UPI, 7)<br />
Extinction (Straits Times, 2000)<br />
Independently, high levels of defense spending case Chinese domestic upheaval (Chase, 7, “China Brief, Vol 7, #20)<br />
Implosion goes nuclear – sucking in India, US, and Cina. Given population counts, it’s the greatest security risk on earth (Klintworth, 94, “Australian Journal of International Affairs, November)<br />
Fortunately, the plan solves – removing the threat of force against Iran sends a signal of cooperation that prevents war and slows Chinese defense spending (Rosemon, 8, “Is China a threat,”)<br />
<br />
2ac Tricks, Add-Ons,<br />
Solvency<br />
Putting all the evidence on the table is key to justify<br />
Doesn’t assume limited enrichment<br />
Not in the context of the Grand bargain<br />
Khomeni will say says (12/14)<br />
He has the last had – will say yes to strengthen moderates (Takeyh)<br />
Will say yes to the plan (Porter), 2000)<br />
Want a framework for relations<br />
<br />
China Advantage<br />
US-China will escalate – question of extinction = granted<br />
Plan is critical to reverse<br />
Protest will cause disintegration<br />
Doesn’t assume a massive downturn and internal spending<br />
China defense spending will lead to an arms arace (Impact is Khalilzad)<br />
<br />

b) policy education<br />
c) moots 1AC<br />
d) Multiple frameworks<br />

Rejection negative peace<br />
Alternative fails<br />
<br />
Iran-Russia D/A<br />
Iran-Russia relations are doomed now<br />
Relations are low<br />
Iran is considering moving Caspian base as its own territory<br />
Energy monopoly crush US-Euro relations – leads to nuclear war<br />
Russia energy monopoly moots democracy<br />
<br />
<br />
Israel D/A<br />
Elections are inevitable (yNet 3/16)<br />
Making concession on Palestine<br />
Israeli public supports the plan<br />
Direct talks are popular<br />
Elections are irrelevant<br />
Netanyahu is not crazy<br />
No uniqueness because of the NIE –<br />

Engaging Iran over Iraq in the s/q<br />
<br />
<br />
Oil D/A<br />
Low prices are inevitable<br />
Low prices are inevitable (Cassidy, 7)<br />
Oil prices are not key to renewable<br />
High oil prices lead to the impact<br />
Warming is inevitable<br />
No global warming<br />
Global warming is not urgent<br />

Answers To Off Case Args<br />
Policy Framework = Key<br />
a) Education – forces debates about the resolution<br />
b) Frailness – stops a race to the bottom<br />
They have not defined a altneative framework<br />
The critique is doomed to replication<br />
Epistemology does not happen first<br />
<br />
AT – Imperialism K<br />
1. US engagment is crucial to solve solidarity<br />
2. US action is not imperialist<br />
3. Conditional policies are not imperialist<br />
4. Demands on the state create a condition for strategic reversibility<br />
5. Rejection will insulate western perspectives<br />
6. Specific policy proposals are key in the context of Iran<br />
7. Individual morality should not be privilege over real suffering<br />
8. Perception of peace fails and has no core meaning<br />
9. Conditions and leverage are key to solve the case<br />
10. Rejection of coercive diplomacy makes violence inevitable<br />
11. Total rejection of the plan leads to political paralyze<br />
12. Impacts are inevitable because of realism<br />
13. Refusal to engage dooms political sphere<br />
14. Alternative leads to a political void that lacks in the status quo<br />
15. Using the discourse of security is not an endorsement, merely recognition of its existence<br />
16. Impact claims are false, simply threat constructions<br />
17. Declaring the intent of the critique is not enough<br />
18. Declaration does nothing – you have no mechanism<br />
19. Critiques spiral without political action<br />

Rejection of coercive diplomacy and conditions make vilence inevitable – their links are wrong (Hoffman, 2005 “Reconstructing Diplomacy”)<br />
