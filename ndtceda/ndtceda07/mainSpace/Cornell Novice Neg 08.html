Israeli Nationalism DA<br />
<br />
UNIQUENESS – ISRAELI NATIONALISM IS RESURGENT AND ATTACKING OLMERT FOR MAKING CONCESSIONS TO ISRAEL’S ENEMIES<br />
<br />
Reuters, November 5, 2007, “PM Slams Israel Rightists’ Provocations Over Peace” &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,-7051610,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://football.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,-7051610,00.html</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
LINK – RIGHT WINGERS DON’T BELIEVE THE U.S. WILL ENGAGE THEIR ENEMIES – THE PLAN OF CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST MARKS A SEISMIC SHIFT IN THE BUSH DOCTRINE – ISRAELI HARDLINERS WILL BE FREAKED OUT AND WILL USE THE RADICAL REVERSAL TO CONSOLIDATE POLITICAL POWER <br />

INTERNAL LINK – OLMERT IS DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO KEEP HIS COALITION TOGETHER – ANOTHER LOSS WOULD SEND IT COLLAPSING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF PUBLIC PRESSURE AND LEAD TO A NETANYAHU TAKEOVER<br />

THE STRIKES WILL BE WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS – THIS LEADS TO WMD EXCHANGE AND WORLDWIDE NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE AS THE CONFLICT ESCALATES<br />

Iraq Withdrawal DA<br />
<br />
UNIQUENESS – BUSH IS STAVING OFF THE DEMOCRATS CALLS TO WITHDRAW FROM IRAQ, BUT THE PRESSURE IS ON – THE DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING FOR MORE VOTES AND HE NEEDS ALL OF HIS POLITICAL CAPITAL TO GET THE REPUBLICANS TO FALL IN LINE ON AN UNPOPULAR WAR<br />

LINK – ANY CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE MIDDLE EAST AND ISRAEL’S NEIGHBORS WOULD REQUIRE MASSIVE POLITICAL CAPITAL – AIPAC CONTROLS CONGRESS <br />

<br />
MODERATE REPUBLICANS ARE THREATENING TO JUMP OFF THE SINKING IRAQ SHIP – THE MORE THEY VOTE FOR IT THE MORE IT DRAGS THEM DOWN IN 2008 – THE WHITE HOUSE NEEDS EVERY OUNCE OF POLITICAL CAPITAL TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM DEFECTING <br />

IMPACT – IMMEDIATE IRAQI WITHDRAWAL WOULD LEAD TO MASSIVE REGIONAL WAR BETWEEN SUNNI’S AND SHIITES<br />

Quiet Diplomacy CP<br />
<br />
PRIVATE NEGOTIATIONS SOLVE JUST AS WELL AS PUBLIC ONES<br />

<br />
QUIET DIPLOMACY IS HOW WE ENGAGE OTHER COUNTRIES – WE ENGAGE IN CLOSED DOOR, SECRET DIALOGUES, AND QUIET NEGOTIATIONS WITH COUNTRIES ALL THE TIME – LITERATURE INDICATES THAT ITS MORE THE RULE THAN THE EXCEPTION PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT, SO THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO ABUSE<br />

EU Counterplan<br />
<br />
THE EU IS A GLOBAL SUPERPOWER IN TRADE, FOREIGN ASSISTANCE, MULTILATERALISM, PEACEKEEPING, AND POLICING – THEY CAN SOLVE IN WAYS THE U.S. CAN’T DUE TO RISING ANTI-AMERICANISM AND THE ECONOMY IS JUST GETTING STRONGER<br />
<br />
Moravcsik, Professor of Politics and Director of the European Union Program at Princeton University, June 08, 2006 (Andrew, “Rumors of Europe’s Demise are Greatly Exaggerated”) &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/001452.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/001452.php</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
THE EU CAN SOLVE FOR ¬THE MIDDLE EAST MILITARILY AND ECONOMICALLY – IT NEEDS TO ACT TO ASSERT ITS REGIONAL HEGEMONY AND CAN SOLVE WHERE THE U.S. CAN’T BECAUSE OF PERCEIVED NEUTRALITY<br />
