The affirmative is a fundamental failure to attend to common sense- everyday world of popular belief and discourse which directly influences individual and group behavior and justifies the social arrangements and practices. This is significant deficiency they forfeit the impetus to critically engage the popular imaginary and substitute for politics pretentious theory words and games.<br />

During the mid to late 19th century… can occur without a prior basis in everyday worldviews<br />
<br />
They conflate the consequences of political conditioning with something intrinsic to human relationships themselves. In so doing, they effectively naturalize status quo systems of power and domination and preclude the possibility of questioning them.<br />

Beaudrillard thinks his account of the masses…wants to deny a liberatory potential to resistance in everyday life.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Beaudrillard’s criticism damns us to sponge like passivity. In fact, the simulacrum provides a space for the proliferation of difference. Overidentifying with simulation pushes the copy beyond itself, such that it actively resists and subverts the model. Investing the simulation with so much difference transcends the dilemma between copy and model and radically changes the contours of social reality.<br />

The affirmatives discourse of securing Syria is tied to a larger project of re-shaping the world over in the United States’s image. Diplomacy, military action, and negotiations alike all operate within the same ontology of eradicating difference. Quite specifically our fears of middle eastern instability are rooted in a fear of difference in the form of political and ideological differences and as such must be kept at a safe arms length and violently normalized.<br />

The U.S. government’s rhetoric of global security…no nation but the United States.<br />

Their conception of stability US and Pakistan is a constructed one which obfuscates the inevitability of conflict from the lack of a clear separation between the two exemplified in Waziristan. Securitizing the region only provides a temporary illusion of peace and proliferats conflict and assimilation<br />

To think politically in modern times means to adopt a metaphysical outlook ordered and conditioned by security. Every encounter with another being is throught of as potentially dangerous and comes to identify that which is unknown as such. This configuration of ontology refuses to let things be because it is fixated on managing the world by reducing it to a stable, predictable reserve that which interrupts the smooth functioning of this worldview becomes necessarily threatening and must be elminated ironically creating the possibility for global extermination under the guise of a more<br />

First, it alerts us to the inescapable violence…continuously defers the terminal<br />
<br />
The affirmative will always be able to locate some external threat to world order. It is not a coincidence that Breaking News occurs every fifteen minutes because international politics are unpredictable. The insecurities cited by the affirmative are not unique; international terrorism is an ever-present threat, a SARS outbreak is just around the corner, killer bees are infesting our neighborhoods and there might just be poison in our children’s Halloween candy. The uncomfortable yet irresitable truth is that uncertainty and risk are part and parcel of human life. Rather than coming to terms with this, the affirmative encourages us to stay glued to the television screen, sotcking up on duct tape and water. At issue here is not just life itself but what makes life valuable. We encourage indifference and carelessness in a world inherently characterized by insecurity in an attempt to reclaim joy from the affirmative’s world of paranoid tiptoeing.<br />
Der Derian, 1993, The political subject of violence, p. 101-105<br />
One must begin with Nietzsche’s idea…calculation of risks and benefits.<br />
<br />
The inability to accept the inherent disorder of existence and the arena or international relations in particular results in a violent struggle to overcome uncertainty in the name of an unattainable of security – this futile quest has brought into existence the technology to eradicate life on earth and the political context that makes such an apocalypse both possible and necessary<br />
Cambell and Dillon, 1993, the political subject of violence, p. 163-165<br />
This interpretation of violence as constitutive of identity…and moral inhibitions.<br />
<br />
So what is the alternative to a system of security that so deeply pervades our lives? The answer is in the reclaiming of the political through recognition that freedom is the essence of human being. Make no mistake about it, our argument is not that we can solve conflict, in fact the opposite, that conflict is a part of human being that should be embraced rather than extripated. While the affirmative’s call to secure the globe disciplines being in a way that denies its fundamental freedom and the agnoism at the heart of modern society, our alternative is an embracing of human mortality and freedom and asserting ethics in the face of that. By embracing agnoism and insecurity it becomes possible to live with others ethicall and affirm life in totality<br />
