<br />
Same opening and framework as in Shirley Round #1<br />
Current ways of knowing in debate ignore white supremacy and leave it unchallenged – Charles Mills – Racial Contract – 1997<br />
White aesthetic treats the white debater as the norm. The somatic norming of the body reinforces white supremacy. Mills 97<br />
We must criticize capitalism and white supremacy simultaneously. - Mills 97<br />
We must have a framework that orients against white supremacy - Mills 97<br />
As black males, we infuse our social location. Our methodology is of the revolutionary aesthetic. Destruction of white ways of looking at the world allows new ethics. The Black aesthetic embodies this revolution - hooks 92<br />

Shelton K. wrote an article on Black participation that expressed many concerns from black debaters about the predominately white community. He concluded<br />
Hill 97’<br />
“Debate like the”…”of African Americans.”<br />
<br />
We see the western ideology that is rampant in this activity as white aesthetic that takes the white body and existence as the ideal debater and one who is normative Pegg McIntosh’s article unpacking the invisible knapsack of privilege “whites are taught to think of their lives as morally neutral, normative and average, and also ideal, so that when we work to benefit others, this is seen as work that will alow them to be more like us.<br />
<br />
The somatic norming of the white body in this activity makes the white debate performance ideal and average<br />
Mills 97<br />
“Finally, the norming”…”and dark races.”<br />
<br />
Tim wise a former debater describes how whiteness props up in this activity<br />
Wise 05<br />
“I say that”…”the Nazi’s would win.”<br />
<br />
Some main practices that become structural norms to prop up the whit aesthetic<br />
1. The sole reliance on traditional authors<br />
2. Silence on the issue of white supremacy<br />
3. Use of objective disconnected narrative<br />
<br />
These claims of fairness, objectivity, and predictability are ways to marginalize the oppressed and silence our voices<br />
Delgado 92<br />
<br />
We have cleverly built power’s view of the appropriate standard of conduct into the very term fair. Thus, the stronger party is able to have his/her way and see her/himself as principled at the same time.<br />
“Imagine for example”…””performance of debate.”<br />
<br />
Larry Neal sheds light on this<br />
“Hoyt Fuller in his essay,”…”their colonizing gaze.”<br />
<br />
Bell hooks writes<br />
“That bls is a phrase.”…”despite racist domination.”<br />
Debate would become a space where we orient ourselves towards methods of liberation and justice<br />
-Resolutions would not be solely focused on how the USFG should do a certain action but how we as academics have agency to change the conditions of our society<br />
<br />
-People of color would not feel the psychic trauma of the white gaze when they present a revolutionary policy to liberate the oppressed<br />
<br />
-So called objective standards would not be the only criteria to adjucate rounds because they are rooted in a narrative of the stronger party<br />
<br />
-The education produced here will relate to how one lives and behaves and relates to formulating strategies to liberate the oppressed and dismantle white supremacy<br />
<br />
These would be some introductory visions of debate instead of propping up imperialist agenda and role playing the oppressor that will be exported to larger society<br />
Willaim Spanos<br />
“I am very much”…”world must occur.”<br />
<br />
White students have more ability to exert court whiteness into our furture political systems<br />
McKinney 05’<br />
“Thus, white students”…”will be eradicated.”<br />
<br />
Questioning the legitimacy of the debate community<br />
Giroux 06’<br />
“Reclaiming higher education”…”the intellectual community.”<br />
<br />
This activity has been on that has grown from the roots of white supremacy. The methods of the debate reflect whit ways of viewing and knowing the world. This method is presented in a privileged illusory fait fantasy world that is uncritical of racism and white supremacy<br />
<br />
Charles Mills 97’<br />
“thus in effect”…”Fridays and Sambos.”<br />
<br />
This makes white supremacy and the white aesthetic an invisible unnamed system that has made the modern world what it is today<br />
Charles Mills 97’<br />
“White Supremacy is the unnamed”…”political, are highlighted.”<br />
<br />
We must make a framework to address theses claims at their root As Charles Mills said.<br />
<br />
“what is needed”…”rights and duties.”<br />
<br />
Our FW- Dayvon and I believe Debate should be about the liberation of the oppressed and changing conditions of this white supremacist institution<br />
Our FW is who best engages consistent practice and advocacy that advances the liberation of the oppressed<br />
<br />
The white aesthetic creates objects to use as pawns in their overall game of exclusion<br />
Dayvon and I are constantly forced to become objects of the particular type of education and ground produced in this activity that isn’t conductive of our identity. WE ARE THE TRANSGRESSORS WHO NEED TO BE DESTROYED AND PUNISHED BY THE BALLOT.<br />
<br />
Larry Neal 68<br />
“The western (white) aesthetic”…”system of ideals.”<br />
<br />
Thus Dayvon and I advocate that the debate community should embrace a Revolutionary aesthetic to destroy the dominate white western aesthetic<br />
<br />
As black makes we don’t embrace a universal aesthetic because our social location must be infused in our discursive acts to lead credents to the issue we speak of- our methodology of a revolutionary aesthetic is a way for people to self determine their own way to view identity and how to topple oppression that faces them.<br />
<br />
Claiming individual innocence is a white defense mechanism- honoring the claim ensures the perpetuation of racism<br />
DiAngelo 06<br />
“At the same time”…”most superficial ways.”<br />
<br />
<br />
2ac Tricks, Add-Ons,<br />
WARNING- ask what they are trying to overcome through their advocacy- it shifts throughout the debate.<br />
