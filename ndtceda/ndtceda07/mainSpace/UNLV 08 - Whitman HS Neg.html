Lewis and I release ourselves towards the topic allowing to to reveal itself to us in a multitude of alternative ways by resolving: that The United States Supreme Court should issue a narrow ruling holding that the United States federal government cannot constitutionally preempt state regulations in the area of biofuels, factory farms, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat.  The Court should specify that this ruling is limited to the facts of the case and distinguish it from relevant precedents.<br />

The fifty United States and United States territories should ban production of biofuels, factory farms, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat on their territories. <br />

Bringing disaster avoidance into the realm of policy is key to preventing future disasters – whether our disad impact happens or not is irrelevant, because something is eventually going to kill us all unless we start weighing low level risk analysis over systemic harms<br />

The United States Federal Government Should Remove All Its Agricultural Support for Biofuels, Concentrated Animot Feeding Operations, Corn, Cotton, Dairy, Fisheries, Rice, Soybeans, Sugar and Wheat. <br />

The word “animot” challenges the homogeneity contained in the word “animal.” The counterplan breaks the laws of language at its limit and recognizes the absolute impossibility of understanding the non-human other.<br />

&quot;philosophical ideas and plays on words that sustain it, that make it legible.&quot; <br />
The affirmative’s discourse legislates the fantasy of the animal’s linguistic death, which helps us cope with our anxiety about the other’s pain. The word “animot” exposes the impossibility of a rhetorical relation between animality and language.<br />

First, The disintegration of capitalism is inevitable. It is built on contradictory structural tendencies that foster simultaneously both the overproduction of commodities and the impoverishment of the masses. Once the lower class cannot even afford to purchase the capitalist’s products the system will collapse and the alienated majority will rise up against the private property regime.<br />

<br />
&quot;Marx's reasoning may be briefly summarized as follows. The capitalist is subject to the exigencies of the &quot;<br />

And, The current agricultural crisis is ultimately rooted in this contradiction, which is tearing capitalism apart at the seams. The plan will do nothing but integrate subsistence farmers into the world market. This temporarily saves the system, but sets the stage for a worse crisis in the future.<br />

The affirmative’s proposal represents the greatest threat to the world’s poor ever seen. Eliminating subsidies won’t solve any of their impacts because the system survives based on the creation of starvation and hunger.
