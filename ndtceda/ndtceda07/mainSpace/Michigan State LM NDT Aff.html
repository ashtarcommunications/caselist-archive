Michigan State LM Aff<br />
<br />
Round # 8<br />
<br />
vs Team: Towson CL<br />
<br />
Judge:<br />
<br />
PLAN TEXT AND ADVANTAGE SAME AS CASEBOOK<br />
<br />
<br />
FRAMEWORK—<br />
<br />
Boggs evidence—SAME AS CASEBOOK<br />
<br />
-Debate should be about deliberation and consensus—if we agree with the aff’s arguments we should be allowed to count those arguments as consensus and the judge should only evaluate the rest of the debate, Stannard 6<br />
<br />
-Their alt method of debate leads to even more elitist debate enclaves which allow oppression to continue uncriticized—only our framework allows us to question domination without throwing the baby out with the bath water, Stannard 6<br />
<br />
-Our argument is key to producing the conditions for self-reflection which solves their impact claims, Stannard 6<br />
<br />
-The alternative puts individual moral purity above real suffering—the aff’s policy proposal is the most ethical option, Chaudhry and Klein 5<br />
<br />
-Their argument is extracted from an argument that has limited scope—their application is argumentatively unsound—it lacks uniqueness, fails to produse either causal or rhetorical coherence and it encourages tyrannical model of debate—the affirmative replicates power relations by engaging in a form of ethnocentrism which assumes there is primordial differences in debate between identity categories, Stannard 6<br />
<br />
-Role-playing in debate deconstructs the state as a monolithic power—it allows to recapture the notion that the state is comprised of individuals, Joyner and Cofman-Wittes ‘9<br />
<br />
-Their obsession with anti-imperialism blocks an embrace of Iranian liberal politics—produces a new form of imperialism, Zakaria ‘7<br />
<br />
-Their alternative is appropriated to crush dissent—it falls prey to all of their criticisms of Orientalism, Zakaria 7<br />
