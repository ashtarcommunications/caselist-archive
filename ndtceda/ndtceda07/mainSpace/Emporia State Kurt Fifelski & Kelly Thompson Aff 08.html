The war in Iraq has left millions of refugees strewn throughout<br />
Lebanon and Syria- folks choose to leave Iraq so they don't die by the<br />
bomb and encounter a more pernicious form of violence . those left<br />
without a country to call their own.<br />
Larry Johnson 07 online<br />
It's the biggest outpouring…rape, about discrimination.&quot;<br />
<br />
These refugees find themselves in the position of being speechless-<br />
this position is a paradox of neoliberal globalization- the world<br />
grows increasingly interconnected and interdependent but nations cling<br />
to their notions of sovereignty, refusing to admit refugees because<br />
they constitute a security threat- investigating the biopoliticization<br />
of refugees, therefore, lends unique insight into the topography of<br />
neoliberal globalization – security politic and neoliberalism prove<br />
deadly and violent for refugees.<br />
Benjamin Mueller &quot;Globalization, security, paradox: towards a refugee<br />
biopolitics,&quot; Centre for Refugee Studies, 22 Issue: 1 Page: 49(9)<br />
Following the events of…and sites of struggle.<br />
<br />
The mass violence done to refugees is not an accident or oversight- it<br />
is the deliberate result of biopolitical neoliberalism-those who fled<br />
Iraq simply don't have a place in the economic order of neoliberalism<br />
and will therefore be exterminated-this culminates in a horrible<br />
biopolitical machine that subjects entire populations to genocidal<br />
violence on behalf of the smoother flow of capital- all struggles<br />
shouls be oriented against this securitized neoliberalism<br />
Etienne Balibar We, the People of Europe?: Reflections in<br />
Transnational Citizenship p. 126-129<br />
In the end it would be my…absolute triumph of irrationality?<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should constructively engage and<br />
provide assistance to the governments of Syria and Lebanon to assist<br />
with resettlement and humanitarian concerns regarding refugees.<br />
<br />
The USFGis largely responsible for the refugee crisis in Syria and<br />
Lebanon and still contributes the least to helping refugees- our<br />
foot-dragging is collapsing international efforts- only US action can<br />
re-invigorate a multilateral effort<br />
Younes and Kurtzer 07 online<br />
The situation for Iraqi refugees in…diplomatic and donor communities.<br />
<br />
Our investigation and call for political action is crucial to creating<br />
the possibility of refugee politics-pedagogy is particularly important<br />
for refugees because of the paradoxical position they assume in<br />
neoliberalism – our affirmative is a global investigation of<br />
securitized neoliberalism through the politics of the refugee<br />
Benjamin Mueller cite above.<br />
At the heart of this reflection… rights, and voice is fought.<br />
<br />
There are countless reasons why the plan would fail cause<br />
harmfulresults, or is not perfect logistically heoretically- but the<br />
negativity is the product of the manufactured citizenshipof<br />
neoliberalism- there is just always some reason why the political<br />
climate isn't perfect, that the money just isn't there, or that it<br />
might rub our allies the wrong way but we need to rediscover political<br />
agency beyond those cynical concerns- voting for the plan is an act of<br />
political hope-consequences are less important than pedagogy- the ways<br />
we learn about political problems package cynicism with our<br />
understanding. We cannot possibly help refugees because intelligence<br />
estimates tell us they could be terrorists- our investigation of Iraqi<br />
refugees and demand for political action is a challenge to<br />
neoliberalism at the level of pedagogy<br />
Giroux 05 online<br />
As the bush administration… for a global democracy.<br />
<br />
The politics of hope is not a final solution but rather a way of<br />
re-opening politics to political agency- in order to challenge<br />
neoliberalism we must first be able to believe that a different future<br />
is possible- even if the aff causes some bad consequences, we should<br />
be hopeful that there is a possibility of a different future for<br />
refugees-this form of educated hope is truly subversive while not<br />
abandoning the political to the cynics<br />
Giroux 02 online<br />
Hence, hope is more than…at the level of pedagogy.<br />

Our negative stuff has not changed, we have run those same list of<br />
arguments still and only.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 1AC is the same affirmative but there are some slight changes, here<br />
is the version of the 1AC we read at the swing:<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 1 ­ the status quo<br />
The bush administration is pursuing a policy of reckless war-mongering<br />
in the middle east ­ dissent is dismissed as unpatriotic while millions<br />
feel the inherent violence of militarized global fascism<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Imperialist warfare is not isolated to Iraq ­ the construction of Iran<br />
as a threat proves that, left unchecked, the enemy paradigm will breed<br />
more conflict in the form of Iran ­ the discourse of security will lead<br />
to conflict<br />
Mohammad Zarif 3/22/07<br />

Relationshipâ€<br />
<br />
<br />
The systemic suppression of dissent has silenced debate ­ it is not<br />
simply that the bush administration must be opposed, but rather how the<br />
debate can be initiated to begin with ­ disinformation and<br />
non-engagement prevent the normal modes of dissent from functioning. You<br />
cannot appose the administration â€œby the bookâ€ because the law is<br />
written as it is spoken<br />

<br />
Security rhetoric is the only internal link to securitization ­<br />
securitization as an act happens as a result of unabated rhetoric and<br />
allowing manipulative dialogue to persuade the people ­ ending our<br />
complicity in security rhetoric prevents securitization<br />
Thierry Balzacq European Journal of International Relations Vol. 11,<br />
Iss. 2. June 2005. â€œThe Three faces of Securitization: Political agency,<br />
audience and contextâ€<br />
<br />
<br />
The act to secure threats is self-defeating and destructive.<br />
Securitization makes violence inevitable. Only a return to challenging<br />
security politics can break out of this cycle<br />
Dillon 96, politics of security, p. 150-151<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This securitization makes entire populations not matter in political<br />
calculations ­ the civilian casualties in iraq, for example, are not<br />
important because they are a necessary cost of security security ­ this<br />
logic leads to the zero-point of the holocaust<br />
Dillon, 99, Political Theory, Vol. 27, No. 2<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan<br />
<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive<br />
engagement with the government of Iran by offering them a security<br />
guarantee that the United States Federal Government will not take<br />
securitizing action toward the Islamic Republic of Iran nor will the<br />
United States Federal Government engage in security rhetoric toward the<br />
Islamic Republic of Iran.<br />
<br />
<br />
We will defend the plan for purposes of topicality and disad links.<br />
However, we all know that the United States Federal Government will not<br />
change policies because of this debate, and neither will alternative<br />
actors nor your utopian alternatives. We will defend our dissent as<br />
individuals who are the federal government.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 2 ­ Resuscitating dissent<br />
Our advocacy risks living within the truth which calls into question the<br />
tyrannical form of the bush administration. Although it seems a simple<br />
gesture, voting affirmative is a political move that calls into question<br />
to universe of mis-information the administration has used to make the<br />
case for imperialist expansion. This form of dissent invariably trigger<br />
persecution and exclusion, i.e., being called unpatriotic or the<br />
exclusion of this type of politics with topicalit<br />
y and framework<br />
arguments. But that is a risk it is necessaryfullness of human being, and hence, affirming life through dissent to<br />
counter to calculative cycle of security.<br />
Vaclav Havel, 1990, The Power of the Powerless, p. 39-40<br />
<br />
<br />
The ballot isnâ€™t some instrument of utopian change: it is simply an<br />
everyday form of resistance ­ the negative will argue that voting aff is<br />
a trivial gesture but it is just the opposite ­ even a single ostensibly<br />
powerless person crying-out the truth is more powerful than all of the<br />
voting or role-playing we could engage in. Voting affirmative unmasks<br />
power relations and affirms our humanity<br />

<br />
<br />
Engaging in our form of dissent is critical to reverse the trend of<br />
politicians in persuading the public ­ that persuasion is what leads to<br />
the worst forms of securitization ­ vote affirmative to cut off the<br />
internal link between securitizing rhetoric and the political act of<br />
securitization.<br />
Security rhetoric is the only internal link to securitization ­<br />
securitization as an act happens as a result of unabated rhetoric and<br />
allowing manipulative dialogue to persuade the people ­ ending our<br />
complicity in security rhetoric prevents securitization<br />

<br />
<br />
This dissent solves securitization and biopolitical violence ­ the<br />
affirmative is a rbeak with the normalized suppression of debate within<br />
the bush administration -0 the alternative to political dissent is the<br />
continuation of warfare and biopolitical violence that spirals into<br />
extinction ­ our affirmative loosens the noose of biopolitical control<br />

Plan (in all caps)<br />
<br />
THE BALLOT IS A TOOL OF INTELLECTUAL ENDORSEMENT. WE CANNOT ACTUALLY CHANGE THE WORLD FROM INSIDE OF A DEBATE ROUND. BUT FURTHERMORE, IT IS NOT PRODUCTIVE TO IMITATE, THROUGH FIAT, A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL NOT RESPOND TO AND SUPPRESSES DISSENT THROUGH NORMAL CHANNELS OF RESISTANCE. WE HAVE ALREADY TRIED NOT VOTING FOR THESE PEOPLE IN 2000 AND 2004; IT DIDN’T WORK. WE HAVE TRIED RESISTING THE JINGOISTIC CALL-TO-ARMS THROUGH PROTEST AND WERE CALLED UNPATRIOTIC TERRORISTS WHO HAVE ALREADY FORGOTTEN SEPTEMBER 11TH: HENCE, IT DIDN’T WORK.<br />
<br />
NORMAL MODES OF DISSENT SIMPLY DON’T WORK. THUS, FIAT IS NOT A USEFUL TOOL FOR CHANGING OUR GOVERNMENT’S POLICIES. WE’LL “OPT-OUT” OF FIAT FOR THAT REASON. INSTEAD, OUR ARGUMENT IS THAT THE DEBATE IS ABOUT PERSONAL POLITICS, AS IT INEVITABLY IS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU FOCUS ON PERSONAL POLITICS PROPER OR DECIDE TO ROLE-PLAY THE GOVERNMENT. HENCE,<br />
<br />
VOTE AFFIRMATIVE TO DISSENT AGAINST THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION’S USE OF SECURITY POLITICS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.<br />
