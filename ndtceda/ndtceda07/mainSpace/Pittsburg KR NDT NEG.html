 K<br />
Difference btwn tactics and strategies<br />
Tactics concerned w/ creating ruptures in the space<br />
Tactics take the position of non-relevance and use it against the dominant order<br />
Neg allows for the weak to have more power<br />
The aff’s spacial thinking is ineffective<br />
Tactics=prereq to stopping torture<br />
Monitoring not stop abuse<br />
Should operate temporally and face the unknown in front of us<br />
Strategy’s privelaging of space is exclusionary<br />
Neg comes to grips w/ their privalege and uses it against the dominant order; aff has not done this<br />
Fear card<br />
When we lose sight of world outside of debate round, we allow conservatism to flourish; imitations of real world are not enough<br />
Gereau ev helps neg<br />
Aff can’t prove they access public discussion<br />
Neg’s discursive resistance of aff=reason why they would solve<br />
Neg fights conservative domination<br />
96<br />
no perm, so if we win lnx, mpx turn, vote neg;neg=competative<br />
tactics inject themselves into strategical spaces and rupture them<br />
neg does not create a threat; don’t outright reject policy debate<br />
aff defines who can talk and who can’t<br />
aff uses manipulation<br />
no internal link as to how neg would kill debate<br />
neg is not partisan; no claims that we could make changes in terms of partisanship<br />
lnx-Butler in 90<br />
don’t kill debate; neg has no fw, so can question policy debate<br />
neg allows for multiple levels of analysis, increases edu<br />
aff’s focus on advocacy means no multiple criticisms of affs; justifies having racist cards, etc.<br />
policy fw means we can only talk about how policies function<br />
<u>The fitting metaphor for tactical opposition is the guerilla war- ambushes, traps, and momentary resistances create ruptures in the ability of strategic logic to control spaces and the knowledge production within.</u><br />
<u>Pelevin, victor 2003 interview web</u><br />
<u>The effect of this book…order of things.”</u><br />
Everything is a hallucination<br />
Pelvin 03<br />
Prereq to imagination and creativity<br />
06<br />
imagination is k2 understanding<br />
<h3 id="toc7"><a name="x-Pittsburg KR Neg-2nr Strategy:"></a><strong><em>2nr Strategy:</em></strong></h3>
 K:<br />
If neg wins fw mpx turns, neg should win<br />
To say that certain args are improper is bad<br />
Aff doesn’t say strats good<br />
Aff supposes spatial understanding of power<br />
Should make something that’s not completely intelligible<br />
Ext. ev.<br />
Monitoring doesn’t stop abuse<br />
No aff articulation as to how rendering somehing visible solves it<br />
Fw kills aff<br />
Prefer comparative analysis<br />
MPX:<br />
Nonsense good<br />
Coherent work such as aff bad<br />
Ext. ev-aff =example of politix and fear<br />
Ext.-Politix of fear is blinding us, leads to extinction<br />
Ext.- virtual disinformation destroyed demo<br />
Aff stil not coming to grips w/ their privalege and doing something about it; this is mpx to structural equality<br />
No mpx to academic irrelevance; must alter edu strats<br />
ALT:<br />
Ext. Pelvin ev.<br />
Ext ev.- must refasion imagination, “we are the only political action that we have”<br />

 There wasn’t any, it was just straight down.<br />
Deleuze and Guattari <u>A thousand plateaus</u> p. 227<br />
“We cannot say… the first line.”<br />
Felix Guatarri 1996 <u>Soft subversions</u> page 85<br />
Polis=dead<br />
Virilio 2000 <u>The Information Bomb</u> p. 108-9<br />
Thus, after the atom…cyberwar being declared.<br />
Butler 90<br />
The fitting metaphor for tactical opposition is the guerilla war- ambushes, traps, and momentary resistances create ruptures in the ability of strategic logic to control spaces and the knowledge production within.<br />
Pelevin, victor 2003 interview web<br />
The effect of this book…order of things.”<br />
Terminal impact to hallucination argument, impact turn to predict<br />
Thoburn, Nicolas <u>Deluze and the contemporary world</u> “vacuoules on noncommunication” p. 44<br />
Movements of minor creativity…field of vitality’.<br />
Imagination is the cornerstone for knowledge production and understanding our formatation as debaters, the failure of imagination will only lead to further control and refashioning ourselves as fascists.<br />

Same K as always – on casebook.<br />
<br />
K of Strategy, distinct from tactics. Aff is strategy which bases itself on a determined space which it acts upon. The K is a tactic that creates a rupture in space and doesn’t link itself to a telos.<br />
<br />
Based on Deleuze and de Certean.<br />

Block Strategy:<br />

<br />
Key Cites:<br />
<br />
Aff call for unity and coalitional politics is inherently bad because they replicate notions of the neoliberal order and don’t take into account power differentials between actors/authors.<br />
<br />
