<u>Thus the Plan:</u> <br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Lebanon by offering the government of Lebanon a substantial increase in foreign assistance which enacts the full cancellation of the bilateral debt the United States claims that the Lebanese government owes.<br />
<br />
Observation One – A Cycle of Debt <br />
<br />
The debt crisis in the Middle East is out of control – 14 percent of current earning go to servicing an unpayable debt, at the expense of essential social services for impoverished populations. In Lebanon alone, 47 percent of the budget is dedicated to servicing the debt, placing an enormous and unpayable burden in a place overlooked by existing debt relief campaigns. <br />

Unfortunately, the US backed war on Lebanon has forced the government to take out even more reconstruction assistance. These aid packages are tied to neoliberal economic reforms which will only continue the cycle of colossal debt. <br />

Unfortunately, current attempts to relieve the debt in Lebanon have become politicized, with parties enacting the continuation of war by other means in order to impose unpopular economic reforms on a government which already has a debt equal to 180 percent of its GDP. Debt servicing eats up two-thirds of the Lebanese budget and current attempts to refinance the debt ensure higher taxes and the expansion of privatization schemes at the expense of the livelihood of Lebanon's poor and working classes. <br />

This debt is a byproduct and precursor to war. For countries like Lebanon, the debt makes war more thinkable and necessary. But for those who directly experience the debt, it is war – no other means can be as devastating to entire populations while operating discretely to drive the people into more debt. <br />
Michael <strong>Rowbotham</strong>, Teacher and Activist, <strong>2k</strong> Goodbye America! p. 123-4 <br />
The expansion of global neoliberalism coupled with the simultaneous drive of the US military empire has made traditional understandings of war a means of leaving resisters complacent in the on-going war against innocent citizens. Theories that see war solely as an event cannot accommodate the true level of violence inherent in everyday life. Conceptualizing day-to-day violence, such as the debt, as part of on-going war is critical to challenging the violent system of militarism. Failure to do so leaves us trapped in a perpetual state of crisis politics, moving from war to war and ignoring the omnipresence of militarism. <br />

Every day of delay in dealing with the debt crisis deals a crushing blow to the 45 percent of the world's population living on less than two dollars a day. Current debt servicing initiatives ensure debtor countries can not meet the basic needs for livelihood within their country. Dealing with the entire debt will no doubt take a long time, however, something must be done to help those who can not afford to wait another day as their basic needs go unmet while their governments are paying down an illegitimate debt under a faulty system of neoliberalism. <br />

The devastating consequences imposed by conditioned foreign aid ensures the inevitable drive towards our collective destruction. The secret war of American militarism, designed to promote the ideas of neoliberalism, requires a global movement from below that challenges the genocidal logic that characterizes the current debt situation in Lebanon. <br />

Observation Two – Globalization from Below <br />
<br />
Current debt relief initiatives which condition aid on Lebanon undertaking Western neoliberal reforms only increase the debt and the suffering the Lebanese people have already experienced as a result of war sponsored and financed by the United States. Outright cancellation of the debt is critical to countering a program of economic reform that ensures the West will maintain its neoliberal choke hold on the Lebanese people. <br />

The debt is unjust and our responsibility as citizens of the supposed creditor nation is to embrace the call for debt cancellation as a way to reclaim our identity from capital and use it to reconceptualize the use of the debt as a means of enacting war upon millions whom have done no wrong. <br />
Stephen <strong>Browne</strong>, Director of the UN Social Development and Poverty Elimination Division, 19<strong>99</strong> <u>Beyond Aid</u>. p. 68-71 <br />
The current debt regime is an unsustainable excuse for limiting broader movements that challenge the power of neoliberal ideology. Demands for debt cancellation in the Middle East create space for these movements to coalesce and raise skepticism against the policies of neoliberal institutions that use progressivism as a facade for supporting illegitimate and brutal regimes. <br />
<strong>Middle East</strong> <strong>Report</strong> 213, Winter 19<strong>99</strong> Robert Naiman, “No Jubilee for the Middle East,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.merip.org/mer/mer213/213_naiman.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.merip.org/mer/mer213/213_naiman.html</a> <br />
Debt cancellation in the Middle East will have broad implications for the people living in the region. Canceling the debt would represent a critical challenge to Western imposed policies of neoliberalism that serves as a means of stangulation that ensures opposition to the developed world's agenda is controlled. Current reforms and offers for relief rely upon this logic that subordinates the target population to the economic and political agenda of the donor country, whereas outright cancellation of the debt sets a dangerous precedent for a model of sustainability designed to keep populations in check. <br />

<u>The campaign for debt cancellation has broad implications</u><br />
<br />
<br />
The debt and the violence it enacts upon the world are our responsibility, for we make it thinkable and acceptably by allowing the war to be perpetuated in our name. Demanding debt cancellation is crucial to reshaping our relationship with capital, the State and militarism and is a necessary first step to end our complacence in violence. <br />
