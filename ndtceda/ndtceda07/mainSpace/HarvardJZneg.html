 Neg vs. Emory MS<br />
<br />
TERRORISTS ARE THE NEW QUEERS – THEY ARE SOCIALLY TIED TO VIOLENCE AND DEATH MUCH LIKE QUEERS ARE TIED TO THE AIDS PANDEMIC. THEPLAN’S CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT IS AN ATTEMPT TO ASSIMILATE THE UNKNOWABILITY OF THE TERRORISTS – THIS IS A FALSE INCLUSION BECAUSE TERRORISM AND DEVIANCE ARE INEXTRICABLLY INTERLINKED. THE PLAN WILL BE USED TO CREATE NEW NORMS AND EXCEPTIONALISMS THAT ARE MEDIATED BY THIS EXCLUSION. <br />

“THIS STRATEGY…CELLS AS WELL.”<br />
<br />
AMERICAN IMPERIALISM OPERATES THOUGH A DUAL PROCESS OF INTEGRATION AND EXCLUSION THE AFFIRMATIVES INCLUSION OF [ ] WILL BE MATCHED WITH A NEW, MORE SEEMINGLY LEGITMATE EXCLUSION OF “REAL” THREATS. <br />

<br />
GRANTING WESTERN, LIBERAL NORMS MORE LEGITIMACY RENDERS OPPOSITION TO THESE NORMS ILLEGITMATE AND INHUMAN. THIS CAUSES TOTAL VIOLENCE AGAINST THE RECONSTITUTED OUTSIDE IN THE NAME OF PROTECTING HUMANITY.<br />

DON’T TIE YOUR BALLOT TO A REPETITION OF THE SAME PARADIGN OF SECURITY THAT PRODUCES VIOLENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE. REFUSING THE AFF IS A WAY OF ASSERTING YOU AGENCY AS A POLITICAL BEING – THAT IT ITSELF CAN CHALLENGE THE DISCURSIVE DOMINANCE OF SECURITY AND OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES <br />
<br />
THE PRAGMATIC COMPROMISE OF THE PERMUTATION REPLCIATES THE SAME PROBLEM WITH A HUMAN FACE – INSTEAD OF PERFECTING OUR IMPERFECTIONS, THE VERY THINGS WHICH LOCK US INTO CYCLES OF POLITICAL FAILURE, WE MUST ABANDON THIS THIRD WAY POLITICS THAT ONLY MASKS THE VIOLENCE WE ENJOY. <br />
ZIZEK, WINTER 2004, “THE ON GOING SOFT REVOLUTION” CRITICAL INQUIRY 30.2, P LION.CHADWYCK.COM<br />
“WHAT MAKES THE…WITH SOCIAL SOLIDARITY.” <br />
<br />
AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WITH THE WAR ON TERROR – WHILE THEY FOCUS ON THE REAL THREATS OUTSIDE, THEY ARE CONSOLIDATING A POLITICS OF JUSTIFIED VIOLENCE WITHIN US ALL – REJECT THE FALSE CHOICE BETWEEN PRESENTED BY THE 1AC.<br />
ZIZEK “THE IRAQ WAR: WHERE IS THE TRUE DANGER?” 3/13/2003. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/IRAQ.HTM" rel="nofollow">WWW.LACAN.COM/IRAQ.HTM</a><br />
“WE SHOULD THEREFORE…INTO THE MAINSTREAM.” <br />
<br />
THE NARRATIVE OF THE 1AC DOES NOT JUST PRESENT THE WORLD, IT RE-PRESENTS THE WORLD IN A WAY THAT INEVITABLY GUIDES OUR ACTIONS TOWARDS OTHERS BY GIVING US A CERTAIN IDENTITY. THIS IDENTITY IS NOT NEUTRAL, BUT PRODUCES THE VERY VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHERS THAT THEY DECRY. <br />
OUR ALTERNATIVE IS A DISRUPTION OF PERFORMANCE OF THE 1AC AND A REFUSAL OF THE IDENTITY IT OFFERS TO US. WHILE WE CAN ENGAGE THE POLITICS OF THE OF THE AFFIRMATIVE’S CRITICISM OF THE VIOLENT IDEOLOGY OF REGIME CHANGE DIRECTED TOWARD THE PALESTINIAN LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AS WELL, OUR FRAMEWORK OR RESISTANCE TO THE SLANTED REPRESENTATIONS OF THE 1AC IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN ESCAPE THE STRUCTURES THAT CREATE THIS VIOLENCE. BY DISRUPTING THE INTELLIGIBILITY OF BIOPOLITICAL STRUCTURES WE CAN ENGAGE IN A POLITICS THAT REFUSES TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN FORMS OF OTHERNESS AND LOCATE THEM IN MATRICES OF EXTERMINATION, ALLOWING US TO PERFORM A DIFFERENT NARRATIVE AND CREATE A DIFFERENT WORLD<br />

Yet the perceived need for the UNDP’s accounting … about Western authority in these matters.<br />
This discourse simply legitimizes development<br />
