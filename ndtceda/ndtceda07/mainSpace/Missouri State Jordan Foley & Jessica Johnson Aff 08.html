Plan Text (same as MM)<br />
The United States federal government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Syria. This should include offering them a security guarantee that the United States does not seek regime change in Syria as an inducement to engage in dialogue about the United States-Syria relationship. This engagement will also include the United States announcing that it will return an ambassador to Syria, support negotiations for and the return of the Golan Heights to Syria, acknowledge Syria's special interest in Lebanon, and announce that it will be willing to remove Syria from the Department of State's list of countries sponsoring terrorism in exchange for Syria's ending of support for militant/terrorist organizations, cooperation on Iraq and respect for the political independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon.<br />

Plan: .<br />
<br />
<br />
INHERENCY<br />
<br />
<br />
The United States maintains a hard-line policy toward Syria. Relations are at an impasse and the US in unwilling to cooperate. We must reassess our policy to break the stalemate in US-Syrian relations.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Regardless of the merits or ….breaking the current stalemate.<br />

<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE: ISRAEL-SYRIA PEACE<br />
<br />
<br />
Washington's isolation of Syria is the principal reason why Israel doesn't respond to Syria's attempts to resume negotiations for peace between Israel and Syria. Both Israel and Syria are anxious to resume talks but a hostile US stance will prevent any progress on this track toward peace.<br />
<br />
Rahman, 2007 (Professor As'ad Abdul Rahman, Chairman of the Palestinian Encyclopedia, Gulf News, April 7, 2007, US HOLDS KEY TO SYRIA-ISRAEL PEACE, LN)<br />
<br />
Washington seems to be ….move this track.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In a world lacking negotiations, the potential for military confrontation in the Golan is high. Syria might attempt a take over of or sponsor low level attacks in the Golan to improve negotiating position and out of disgust at the lack of negotiations. Israel will respond to this threat with their own military build up in the region. The chance of miscalculation is extremely high.<br />

<br />
<br />
These low level attacks will escalate into full scale Middle East conflict<br />
<br />

<br />
The mere existence of Israel-Syrian negotiations would drastically change the regional balance and increase peace in the region. Extremists and other Arab countries would recognize the need to change their behavior<br />
<br />
Zunes, 2007 (Stephen, Middle East editor for Foreign Policy In Focus (www.fpif.org), is a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco, Foreign Policy in Focus, &quot;U.S. Blocks Israel-Syria Talks&quot;, May 1, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/4190%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/4190)</a><br />

Many Israelis also ….in an awkward position.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A deal on the return of the Golan and peace with Israel will change Syrian priorities…this solves the connection with Iran and allows Israel-Syria-Lebanon peace. Hizbollah would have no reason to pursue resistance. Syria will halt sponsorship of militant groups and abide by the terms of a peace agreement.<br />

ADVANTAGE: IRAQ<br />
<br />
A) TERRORISM<br />

3. SYRIA IS THE MAIN COUNTRY WHICH SMUGGLES TERRORISTS- ONE ORDER FROM THE GOVERNMENT CAN STOP IT<br />

B) IRAQ STABILITY<br />

1. CURRENT STRATEGY IS FAILING- IT'S CAUSING A POWER VACUUM IN IRAQ- SYRIAN ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE INFLUENCE CAUSE INSTABILITY<br />

<br />
ADVANTAGE: LEBANON<br />
<br />
<br />
Our hardline policies toward Syria are driving them to re-impose their hegemony over Lebanon, supporting violence and undermining Lebanese democracy<br />
<br />
Harris, 2007 (William, professor in the Department of Political Studies at the University of Otago in New Zealand, &quot;High stakes: The bigger picture behind the urgent need to preserve Lebanon's democracy and independence&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=7071%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=7071)</a><br />
<br />
Above all, Lebanon's future ….in and from Lebanon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Reaction to Syrian-led violence in Lebanon will lead to crackdowns and larger wars. These wars will spin out of control in the Middle East and last for decades.<br />

<br />
<br />
Reestablishment of U.S.-Syrian relations are key to Middle East stability because Syria has influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine and Iran. The ability of the US and Syria to cooperatively respond to several regional conflicts will be key to preventing escalation.<br />
KLIGER 2K7 (Has the U.S.-Arab Marriage Gone Sour? MEDIA LINE, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.themedialine.org/news/news_detail.asp?NewsID=18702%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.themedialine.org/news/news_detail.asp?NewsID=18702)</a><br />

Relations between …. in the region,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SOLVENCY:<br />
<br />
<br />
The United States must constructively engage Syria. Syria should be assured we will not seek regime change, they should be removed from the terrorist list, and we should encourage negotiations over Golan Heights. In exchange Syria would end support for terrorist organizations, cooperate on Iraq, and respect the sovereignty of Lebanon.<br />

<br />
Although the Bush …. the inevitable fallout.<br />
<br />

<br />
US should engage in quid pro quo engagement with Syria offering dialogue, sending ambassador to Syria and making it clear it has no interest in regime change<br />

Improving US and Syrian Relations: Some Possible Beginnings<br />
<br />
This paper has focused on Syrian ….. violent change and instant &quot;democracy.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The current pressure on Syria will fail and cause regional war, engagement is the best option- Syria is willing to work with the US to preserve Middle East stability in exchange for security guarantees<br />
<br />
Ben-Meir, 05 (Alon, professor of international relations at the Center for Global Studies at NYU and is the Middle East Project Director at the World Policy Institute, Turkish Daily News, 11/7, lexis)<br />
<br />
For these reasons, the administration …. in the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
<br />
The time is right for engagement with Syria – Bashar will say yes. Syria wants to be brought in from isolation from the West<br />
<br />
Terry Newman 01.22. 07, Engage Syria; Isolate Iran Western dialogue with Syria could benefit both sides <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3355363,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3355363,00.html</a> Terry Newman currently works between Cairo and Tel Aviv as a political analyst and business consultant<br />
<br />
The West wants to isolate ….. and Gaddafi? Perhaps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Engagement with Syria is not rewarding bad behavior. Current policy shows no sign of hope and engagement will decrease terrorism, solve extremism, and create stability in Lebanon<br />
