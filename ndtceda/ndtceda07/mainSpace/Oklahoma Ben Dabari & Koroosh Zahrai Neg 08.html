 1NC  Shell Crusades<br />
<br />
The action of the affirmative cannot be isolated to only this moment in time to understand the process of the holy wars that began many years ago.<br />
<br />
If we step back and look at the process of the holy wars, and the desire for the Christians to regain control of Jerusalem, we can see that our current foreign engagement within the areas of the so called “holy lands, are a continuation of the crusades Hidlebrand started in 1063 as part of the “reconquista”.<br />

The illegitimate government of the United States continuously finds rationale to justify its continued existence and extermination of indigenous peoples around the globe.  After the conquering of the North American continent the empire has now turned its gaze on the Muslim and Arab world as the next place of conquer.  The affirmative is only another act by the colonial empire enhancing contact with the those whom it seeks to colonize.<br />

 The ultimate objective of the crusades was to recapture Jerusalem.  The ideologies laid out by Gregory to lay down ones lives for this purpose continues today in many forms.<br />

We must stop being so naïve as to think the United States will bring good things through our engagement.  We are participating in one of the worst forms of global violence possible.<br />

The alternative is to be an active part of the solution, or remain equally part of the problem – there is no third option.<br />

The ability to define others as inferior or to identify them as in need allows the US public to be deceived in accepting the global slaughter we participate in.<br />

The alternative is to not endorse action by the colonial beast and to cease turning on the colonial treadmill.<br />

I will debunk some of this nonsense in…. …orthodox script.<br />
<br />
This yea we turn our topic gaze onto the Middle East, but this is not the first time a group of people have been singled out for their difference, and sized up for assimilation or elimination . The arab and the muslim world have become the next frontier for the conquering savagery nd barbarism for the sanctity of civilization<br />

Change must begin at home. We must end the cycle of violence perpetuated in our name by the empire.<br />
