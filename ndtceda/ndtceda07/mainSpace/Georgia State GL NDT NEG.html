The same humanism K from the first round at this tournament – all the cites are already there.<br />
All the 2NC cards are there as well. There is one additional 2NC link card read on the perm debate to prove a link:<br />
Threats of instability and violence without hegemony are strategic exaggerations to sell the public on an aggressive foreign policy – makes conflict a self-fulflling prophecy<br />
Layne 1997 [Christopher, Assoc Prof of Poli Sci at U of Miami, “From Preponderance to Offshore Balancing,” International Secrity, Summer, V22 No1]<br />
“The security/interdependence nexus…security obligations in core areas.”<br />
<br />
Block Strategy: The 2NC goes for the K. The 1NR takes the conditionality debate, the vague alternatives debate, and the two perms, which are grouped.<br />

<br />
Speaking for Gov K<br />
<br />
Aff says that the government cannot do anything and this takes away the hope that is necessary to solve<br />
<br />
This mindset will cuase the right to backlash<br />
<br />
Aff will be co-opted by the right and made worse<br />
<br />
Critical action adds to the plethora of ideas that prevent any action<br />
<br />
We can lead through positive action through the state<br />
<br />
<br />
Ethics K<br />
<br />
Their focus is a form of moralism is objectifiying and prevents solvency<br />
<br />
Affs moral stance makes absence in the colonial and makes debate impossible<br />
<br />
This is a form of dehuminzation through discourse<br />
<br />
<br />
Oil DA-no cards were read, just the statements<br />
<br />
Oil prices are high now because of speculation<br />
<br />
Engaging with iran will decrease oil prices<br />

High oil prices are key to alternative fuels that solve for co2 emissions<br />

Off Case Args:<br />
<br />
Topicality (constructive engagement has to be unconditional)<br />
<br />
Definition: constructive engagement has almost meant unconditional engagement<br />
Baker, Honey and VIngar, ed. In Richard Hass and O’Sullivan, p. 96-7, google books<br />
“The United States has been quietly engaging in the South African…. it assumed that South Africa was interested in a settlement.”<br />
<br />
Violation: the plan sets conditions on ending regime change<br />
Reasons to prefer (limits, moving target, mixes burdens, violates resolved)<br />
Voter (fairness and debatability)<br />
ASPEC<br />
<br />
Russia disad<br />
<br />
Brink: Now is a crucial time in US-Russian relations. The US must avoid antagonizing Russia in the short term. The alternative is a collapse of relations that swamps normal checks of interdependence<br />
Nationalists are targeting Medvedev – he needs internal clout to impose reform<br />
Link: the middle east is the only place Russia can use successful foreign policy to boost national self-esteem and prevent nationalist unrest – Russian domestic perception is key<br />
Medvedev still considers Iran and Syria part of the Russian sphere<br />
Impact: Increased nationalism breaks the Kremlin’s control of the movement and results in a full-scale takeover<br />
Nationalist takeover in Russia leads to US nuclear first-stike<br />
Kritik of representations<br />
<br />
The same as on the wiki<br />
Olmert Disad<br />

Olmert is in negotiations with Yishai now to prevent him leaving<br />
Perception of US support for Olmert’s policy keeping Olmert in and Netanyahu out<br />
US support for Israel key to Olmert’s political standing<br />

Agamben Cites<br />
<br />
<br />
We must realize the double movement of every step in what the 1AC calls progress – the rights and liberties won by certain individuals requires an increasing inscription of life within sovereign power. The Aff ignores the way “Humanity” is politically constructed to write certain individuals from the script<br />
<br />
Jess Whyte, 2002 (“The Human is a battleground” stateofemergency.nomasters.org/reader/human.html)<br />
<br />
How then do we respond…out of the sphere of humanity.<br />
<br />
Accepting the role of the affirmative would have us play moves us further into the status of sacred life, where we all become potential lice waiting to be exterminated by the sovereign<br />
<br />
Agamben, 1995 (Homo Sacer, p 112-115)<br />
<br />
It is Jean-Luc Nancy’s…we are all virtually hominess sacri.<br />
<br />
Questions of ontology must be asked and answered first because they are the fundamental and inescapable basis for any line of thinking<br />
<br />
Michael Dillon, 1999 (“Another Justice” p 160-1)<br />
<br />
Heirs to all of this…technocrats of decision making.<br />
<br />
Vote negative to reject the call to protect rights, a rejection of the entire classification of sovereign classification and discourse, and the embracing of what Agamben calls “whatever being.” This simple rejection is enough to give us access to this form of being that defies violent biopower by claiming no common identity<br />
<br />
Anne Caldwell, 2004 (“Bio-Sovereignty and the Emergence of Humanity” Theory and Event)<br />
<br />
Can we imagine another form…made up of whatever life, appears.<br />
<br />
The aff’s reliance on th discourse of rights is self defeating. They bring violence survivors from the periphery to the center in an attemopt to bring the voice and rights as a form of recourse – this invokes a constant state of emergency by the sovereign to mask the political aspects of its force. This strengthens the system that caused their harms in the first place<br />
<br />
Zen Dochterman, 2002 (“An anarchist analysis of the detention of Immigrants and War” aporiajournal.tripod.com/detention.htm)<br />
<br />
The State has assumed…must be more all-pervasive.<br />
<br />
A2: Perm<br />
<br />
The alt is not a question of including those that have been excluded but refusing to draw lines in the first place. This is not a utopian dream – whatever politics can be fought for in the here and now<br />
<br />
Jenny Edkins, 2007 (Giorgio Agamben: Sovereignty and Life, “Whatever Politics” p 89-91)<br />
<br />
However, as Agamben…thinking and practice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Framework Cites<br />
<br />
The framework for the debate rests on the distinction between politics and “the political.” The philosophical underpinnings of the plan act as a photographic negative that determines the direction of their politics. The link to the K is a prior question<br />
<br />
Andrew Norris, 2005 (p 15-16, Introduction, name of book not given)<br />
<br />
If Agamben’s analysis and description…Agamben would claim the same.<br />

Round # : 1<br />
Vs Team: Baylor MR<br />
Judges: Hall, Short, ___<br />
<br />
Case Args: No case args, but the K probably turns the case. They’re going for the argument that the case isn’t true.<br />
<br />
<br />
Off Case Args: ASPEC, QPQ, and Humanism. ASPEC didn’t have a card for the interp and the QPQ and Humanism cites are already on the casebook. Here are the extra cites that they read on humanism that aren’t already on the casebook:<br />
On the perm –<br />
1. the perm is a non-starter – the alt is mutually exclusive because it acceptes international conflict and the aff rejects it.<br />
2. If the perm solves it’s severance – severance is a voter<br />
3. The perm fails – doing the plan makes peoeple like the liberal order so the US is still the global police.<br />
4. The perm is a no-contest plea – they footnote the critcism in order to commit worst epistemological crimes<br />
Der Derian 95 (James, Reinterpreting Realism, page 374)<br />
“But what happens – as seems to be the case…the ‘spiro-ette’ effect in International Relations”<br />
<br />
in general –<br />
The alternative is not a rejection of realism but hermeneutical bridge – realism must by reinterpreted or it will die<br />
Der Derian 95 (James, Reinterpreting Realism, page 370-371)<br />
“The three approaches that make up a critical pluralism…in a period of rapic systemic change.”<br />
<br />
The alternative has practical political implications – a securitization perspective on the threat constructions of radical islam and terrorism opens possibilities for alternative patterns of actions that can inform policy debates<br />
Sheikh 07 (Mona Kanwal, MA in political science university of Copenhagen, Fearing Secularism, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ku.dk/satsning/religion/sekularism_and_beyond/pdf/paper_sheikh.pdf%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.ku.dk/satsning/religion/sekularism_and_beyond/pdf/paper_sheikh.pdf)</a><br />
“Another related implication of the presented analysis…and for conflict resolution attempts.”<br />
<br />
The “Chinese Threat” is not some objective description of reality but a ready-made category that we use to classify the other. This absolute other is a permanent feature of US foreign policy<br />
Pan 04, Chengxin IR at Australian National University, (Alternative 29)<br />
“What does this US self-knowledge have to do with…its autobiographical nature.”<br />
<br />
The liberal global order they uphold posits emergencies as simple in need of linear policy solutions – the world is really a nonlinear economy of power and knowledge filled with material inequality – their oversimplification will cause serial policy failure.<br />
Dillon and Reid in 2000 (Micheal and Julian, Lecturer at U of Lancaster and Lecturer on International Politics at U of London, Alternatives: Social Transformation and Human Governance, V25 I1, Jan-Mar)<br />
“Serial policy failer is no simple…as Foucauldian “biopower” ways.”<br />
<br />
They try and mask the normative assumptions of the 1AC behind a false mask of objectivity – how we know things determines what we see<br />
Smith 97 (Professor of political science at the university of Wales. Steve, Review of International Studies, Cambridge journals online)<br />
“My central claim is that Wallace…or a matter of common sense.”<br />
<br />
Their worst-case scenarios are not objective security threats but socially constructed narratives<br />
Croft 06 (Stuart, prof of intl studies @ Warwick Univ., Culture, Crisis, and America’s War on Terror, p 5-6)<br />
“Much of the work published in the English language…and, thereby, new policy programs.”<br />
<br />
Debate is a key battleground -- rejection of the 1AC directly underminds the real-world success of terror discourse<br />
Jackson 05 (Richard, Prof of Politics @ U. of Manchester, Writing the War on Terrorism, p. 159)<br />
“Perhaps the most important characteristic of the discourse…important political and social institutions.”<br />
<br />
on QPQ:<br />
Constructive as conditioned is crucial for every resolutional term – alternative interpretations result in shallow debates about the general elements of engagement, precision in our definition of key<br />
Capie and Evans 2002 (David H, Paul M. Sr Lecturer of Int’l Rels at U Columbia, Asia-Pacific Security Lexicon, 113-4)<br />
“Third, engagement increasingly appears in the literature…the distinctions drawn below are often blurred in practice.<br />
<br />
Offering must be conditional on an action by the recipient<br />
Tiersma 1986 (Peter Meijes, PhD UC San Diego, “The Language of Offer and Acceptance: Speech Acts and the Question of Intent,” California Law Review, V74 N1, Jan, p189)<br />
<br />
Requiring a quid pro quo means we should get all arguments related to interference within a country – this is the heart of constructive engagement<br />
Saunders 1985 (Cliff, BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, Johannesburg Home Service, text of commentary by Cliff Saunders, “Africa Survey,” 2-27, p. Lexis)<br />
“American Ambassador Herman Nickel has charged back to Washington…which would want a Democrat in power.”<br />
<br />
Foreign assistance isn’t limiting<br />
US Code No Date (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/iscode/html/uscode22/usc_sec_22_00002394----000-.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.cornell.edu/iscode/html/uscode22/usc_sec_22_00002394----000-.html)</a><br />
“Foreign assistance” means any tangible or intangible item…owned by the United States Government.”<br />
<br />
Security guarantee is limitless<br />
SIPRI 2000 (“Security Guarantee” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cbw.sipri.se/glos.phtml%29" rel="nofollow">http://cbw.sipri.se/glos.phtml)</a><br />
“Security guarantees are…contain a non-use obligation.”<br />
