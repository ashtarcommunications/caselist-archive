<hr />
We first offer a quote of Heilbrun in 1988<br />
<br />
We engage the village of Neve Shalom/Wahat Al-Salom through our reading and telling of stories. We feel that any outside assistance or interference should be pre-texted with stories from those whom we would be acting towards.<br />
<br />
There is a village amongst the place mentioned in our topic called Neve Shalom/Wahat Al-Salam. This is a place where people from different places and with different languages learn to live in a world of accepting difference without sacrificing identity.<br />

The author continues:<br />
<br />
<strong>Feuerverger, 2001</strong><br />
<br />
We encourage border crossing as a method of understanding and pedagogical manifestation. We affirm our engagement with Neve Shalom/Wahat AL-Salam as a metaphor for “constructively engaging” the “governments” listed in the topic.<br />
<br />
Last chapter: Peace-making<br />
<br />
We do not endorse the concept of “peace” as the absence of war. Our position is that understanding how to respect other perspectives while maintaining your own personal identity is critical in learning how to enlarge ones moral vision.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Feuerverger continues:</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Feuerverger concludes:</strong><br />
<br />
We acknowledge that some people view the “governments” as legitimate entitites, but we hope you understand why others might choose to not identify with these governments. The Palestinian and Arab disapora spreads among all of the formally named “governments” in the resolution. We feel that Neve Shalom/Wahat Al-Salom represents all of these places as people under two different languages continue to live in a world of violence because of the continued determination to elevate their perspective as right, while not knowing the “other” by whom you disagree.<br />
