Academic debate, when faced with a decline in participation, was argued as being in a state of crisis.<br />
With the stylistic choices of debaters characterized as a variety of irrational techniques, the main cause of the crisis was the willingness of the judges to endorse these practices<br />
Judges were seen as reconstructing debates for hours at a time providing little incentive for debaters to argue and speak clearly<br />
Our methodology of persuasion can only being given validity within the community through an endrocement of the ballot<br />
Rowland and Deathrage, 88<br />
“Academic policy debate is in a state of crisis. By virtually any measure…debaters with little incentive to argue and speak clearly.”<br />
A revolution in debate is critical to solve for societal aggression. This revolution is key. Harms of society are learned here, debate change will cause real world change. THIS IS THE BEGINNING.<br />
William V. Spanos, professor SUNY Binghamton, “E-Mail to Joe Miller”, posted on Cross-X.com, November 18, 2004<br />
“A few days ago, I emailed William V. Spanos to confirm whether or not an e-mail I’d found published on eDebate was in fact written by him. This was his response:<br />
Dear Joe Miller, Yes, the statement about the American debate circuit you refer to was made by…of Bush administration and his neocon policy makers is leading.”<br />
Freire, p. 152<br />
“the theory of antidialogical action has one last fundamental characteristic: cultural invasion, which like…that choice—or are expected to follow it.”<br />

Trying to adapt to semi-join the revolution is bad. Not genuine.<br />

All their cards come from this book – they made the cites up on hand<br />
