<strong>Contention Three: Political Compassion</strong><br />

Compassion is an experience of immersing yourself into the stories of others and responding to their needs. Contemplation of feelings fosters attentiveness to the causes of exclusionary violence and establishes a foundation of trust and reconciliation that provides a political alternative to a Sacred politics founded on hostility towards strangers.</strong><br />
