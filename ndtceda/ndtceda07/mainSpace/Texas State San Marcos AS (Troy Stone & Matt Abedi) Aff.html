We begin with Contention 1 – the Status Quo<br />
<br />
Palestine is on the brink of a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe, but current strategy to pressure the Hamas government is to pull USAID out of Gaza’s water sector. This is having disastrous effects and change is needed immediately.<br />
Gray 2006<br />
(Alice, columnist for Counter Currents, “’Positive Conditions’ – The Water Crisis in Gaza”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.countercurrents.org/pa-gray090806.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.countercurrents.org/pa-gray090806.htm</a>)<br />
Inadequate sewage treatment infrastructure … Israel, or import from the West Bank<br />
<br />
AND By 2010 the Palestinian people will be in the midst of an all-out water crisis. The lack of water resources is causing mass death from disease and risks conflict that devastates lives and living conditions.<br />
Nettnin 2005<br />
(Sonia, Middle East Journalist, Global Research, 11/3, Water Crisis in Gaza: How Occupation Affects Palestinians Access to Water, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=NET20051103&amp;articleId=1178" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=NET20051103&amp;articleId=1178</a>)<br />
Gaza has a water crisis… be available to them?<br />
<br />
AND The Palestinian water crisis is an act of ethnic cleansing. Israel’s leaders continue to deny the Palestinian people access to water, the basis of human life, condemning them to mass suffering, illness, death, and expulsion under the banner of Zionist beliefs and values. This situation demands our aid and assistance; failure to act helps dig the graves of the Palestinian people.<br />

Thus resolution of Palestine's water problems … much greater suffering, than direct military actions<br />

 <br />
Contention II is Solvency -<br />
The USAID policies in Gaza, such as desalination facilities and the Coastal Aquifer Management Program must be reinstituted now; these programs are key to resolving the water crisis.<br />
Nettnin 2005<br />
(Sonia, Middle East Journalist, Global Research, 11/3, Water Crisis in Gaza: How Occupation Affects Palestinians Access to Water, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=NET20051103&amp;articleId=1178" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=NET20051103&amp;articleId=1178</a>)<br />
The United States Agency for International Development … prevent viable solutions from resolving a dire situation.<br />
<br />
Empirically, USAID water programs in Gaza are extremely successful and more than double the amount of water available for use.<br />
The Jerusalem Times 2002<br />
(3/13, “USAID projects stress water, community service and health”, p. LN)<br />
The focus in Gaza is on wastewater … the drought prone Gaza area.<br />
<br />
AND CAMP establishes effective data and environmental monitoring, which allows for effective altering of projects to address changes.<br />
Moe, Hossain, and Fitzgerald 2001<br />
(H., R., and R., Camp Dresser and McKee Inc., Application of a 3-Dimensional Coupled Flow and Transport Model in the Gaza Strip, First International Conference on Saltwater Intrusion and Coastal Aquifers – Monitoring, Modeling, and Management, April 23-5, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.olemiss.edu/sciencenet/saltnet/swica1/Moe-Hossain-Fitzgerald-paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.olemiss.edu/sciencenet/saltnet/swica1/Moe-Hossain-Fitzgerald-paper.pdf</a>)<br />
From a hydrological point of view … mapping their critical aquifer resource.<br />
<br />
AND Political support for Palestine is key to moderate Israeli position and actions – Israel will comply and align itself with plan, not backlash against it.<br />
Zasloff 2006<br />
(Jonathan, Professor of Law at UCLA School of Law, “Left and Right in the Middle East: Notes on the Social Construction of Race”, Virginia Journal of International Law, Fall, 47 Va. J. Int'l L. 201, p. LN)<br />
&quot;The past is never dead,&quot; … also by the requirements of peace.<br />
<br />
Progress on Palestinian water issues has a ripple effect across the region.<br />
Fisher 2004<br />
(Franklin M., Ph.D., Jane Berkowitz Carrolton and Dennis William Carlton Professor of Economics at MIT and chair of the Water Economics Project, “Water Scarcity in the Middle East: Regional Cooperation as a Mechanism Toward Peace”, Hearing Before the Committee on International Relations of the US House of Representatives, 108th Congress, 2nd Session, 5/5, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.house.gov/archives/108/93528.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.house.gov/archives/108/93528.pdf</a>)<br />
The other thing I want to … get moving out of the impasse.<br />
<br />
Palestinians want to work to address the water issue, but a lack of resources tanks their ability to address it – they would accept our offer for water infrastructure.<br />
Satterfield 2004<br />
(Career member of the Senior Foreign Service and Ambassador to Lebanon, “Scarcity in the Middle East: Regional Cooperation as a Mechanism Toward Peace”, Hearing Before the Committee on International Relations of the US House of Representatives, 108th Congress, 2nd Session, 5/5, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.house.gov/archives/108/93528.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.house.gov/archives/108/93528.pdf</a>)<br />
I wouldn’t characterize it … from Saudi Arabia to North Africa.<br />
<br />
Hamas will accept the offer and cooperate with the United States.<br />
Haass 2006<br />
(Richard N, “The New Middle East,” Foreign Affairs, Nov-Dec 06, pg 2 vol. 85 no 6, lexis)<br />
Diplomacy also needs to be revived … behavior in line with U.S. policy.<br />
<br />
We have a real world impact. Talking about these issues raises awareness and visibility which impacts the way real world policymakers react. The personal is political and if we fail to take a stand, these decisions will be made by outside forces that deny there’s a problem.<br />
Keefer 1993<br />
(Joseph, Associate Professor of Communication Studies at Penn State, Journalism Quarterly, Summer, p. EBSCO)<br />
The visibility of an issue is … among citizens who feel otherwise.<br />
<br />
Specifically, our discussion of foreign policy toward Palestine is key to combat American Zionism’s control of information and policy.<br />
Said 2001<br />
(Edward, University Prof of English and Comparative Literature at Cambridge University and was the founding figure of post-colonial theory, “American Zionism – the Real Problem”, Media Monitors Network, March 14, 2001, &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mediamonitors.net/edward12.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediamonitors.net/edward12.html</a>&gt;).<br />
AIPAC has for years been so powerful … right to help itself to what it wishes.
