Among extraterrestrial bodies in our solar system, Mars is singular in that it possesses all the raw materials required to support not only life, but also a new branch of human civilization. This uniqueness is illustrated most clearly if Mars is contrasted with the Earth's Moon, the most frequently cited alternative location for extraterrestrial human colonization. Unlike the Moon, Mars is rich in carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, all in biologically readily accessible forms such as carbon dioxide gas, nitrogen gas, water ice, and permafrost.2 Carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen are only present on the Moon in parts per million quantities. Oxygen is abundant on the Moon, but only in tightly bound oxides such as silicon dioxide, ferrous oxide, magnesium oxide, and alumina oxide, which require very high-energy processes to reduce.3 Current knowledge indicates that if Mars were smooth and all its ice and permafrost melted into liquid water, the entire planet would be covered with an ocean over 200 meters deep.4 This scenario contrasts strongly with the Moon, which is so dry that if concrete were found there, lunar colonists would mine it to get the water out. Thus, if plants could be grown in greenhouses on the Moon (an unlikely proposition, as the Moon's 2-week-long dark spell is unsuitable for most plants, and the absence of any atmosphere would make necessary very thick glass for solar flare shielding), most of their biomass material would have to be imported. The Moon is also deficient in about half the metals of interest to industrial society (copper, for example), as well as many other elements of interest such as sulfur and phosphorus. Mars has every required element in abundance. Moreover, on Mars, as on Earth, hydrologic and volcanic processes have occurred that are likely to have consolidated various elements into local concentrations of high-grade mineral ore. Indeed, the geologic history of Mars has been compared to that of Africa, with very optimistic inferences as to its mineral wealth implied as a corollary.5 In contrast, the Moon has almost no history of water or volcanic action, with the result that it is basically composed of trash rocks with little differentiation into ores that represent useful concentrations of anything interesting. Power could be generated on either the Moon or Mars with solar panels, and here the advantages of the Moon's clearer skies and closer proximity to the Sun than Mars roughly balance the disadvantage of large energy storage requirements created by the Moon's 28- day light/dark cycle. But if the desire was to manufacture solar panels so as to create a self-expanding power base, Mars holds an enormous advantage, as only Mars possesses the large supplies of carbon and hydrogen needed to produce the pure silicon required for making photovoltaic panels and other electronics. Also, there is no geologically purified source of silicon dioxide, such as sand, on the Moon. In addition, Mars has the potential for wind-generated power, while the Moon clearly does not. But both the Sun and wind offer relatively modest power potential—tens or at most hundreds of kilowatts here or there. To create a vibrant civilization, a richer power base is needed, and Mars has this both in the short and medium term in the form of its geothermal power resources, which offer the potential for large numbers of locally created electricity-generating stations in the 10 megawatt (10,000 kilowatt) class. In the long term, Mars will enjoy a power-rich economy based upon exploitation of its large domestic resources of deuterium fuel for fusion reactors. Deuterium is five times more common on Mars than it is on Earth, and tens of thousands of times more common on Mars than on the Moon.6 But the biggest problem with the Moon, as with all other airless planetary bodies and proposed artificial free-space colonies, is that sunlight is not available in a form useful for growing crops. A single acre of plants on Earth requires 4 megawatts (MW) of sunlight power; a square kilometer needs 1,000 MW. The entire world put together would not produce enough electric power to illuminate the farms of the state of Rhode Island. Growing crops with electrically generated light is economically hopeless. But natural sunlight cannot be used on the Moon or any other airless body in space unless the walls on the greenhouse are thick enough to shield out solar flares, a requirement that enormously increases the expense of creating crop land. Even accomplishing this requirement would do no good on the Moon, because plants will not grow in a light/dark cycle lasting 28 days. But Mars has an atmosphere thick enough to protect crops grown on the surface from solar flares. Therefore, thin-walled inflatable plastic greenhouses protected by unpressurized ultraviolet-resistant hard-plastic shield domes can be used to rapidly<br />
create crop land on the surface. Even without the problems of solar flares and a month-long diurnal cycle, such simple greenhouses would be impractical on the Moon as they would create unbearably high temperatures. On Mars, in contrast, the strong greenhouse effect created by such domes would be precisely what is necessary to produce a temperate climate inside. Such domes up to 50 meters in diameter are light enough to be transported from Earth initially, and they eventually could be manufactured on Mars out of indigenous materials. Because all the resources to make plastics exist on Mars, networks of such 50- to 100-meter domes could be manufactured and deployed rapidly, opening up large areas of the surface to both shirtsleeve human habitation and agriculture. Looking further into the future, it will eventually be possible for humans to thicken Mars' atmosphere substantially by forcing the regolith to outgas its contents through a deliberate program of artificially induced global warming. Once that has been accomplished, the habitation domes could be almost any size, as they would not have to sustain a pressure differential between their interior and exterior. In fact, once that has been done, it will be possible to raise specially bred crops outside the domes. The point is that unlike colonists on any other known extraterrestrial body, Martian colonists will be able to live on the surface, not in tunnels, and move about freely and grow crops in the light of day. Mars is a place where humans can live and multiply to large numbers, supporting themselves with products of every description made out of indigenous materials. Mars is thus a place where an actual civilization, not just a mining or scientific outpost, can be developed. And it is this civilization, grown in size and technological potency on a frontier planet with a surface area as large as all the continents of Earth put together, that will both radically tip the balance among those who remain behind on Earth and provide the pioneers with the craft and outlook required to push the human reach much further. Thus, for our generation and those soon to follow, Mars is the new world. The nation that settles it is one whose culture, values, social forms, and ideas will provide the point of departure for the further development of human civilization as our species expands outward from its planet of origin to the innumerable others awaiting us in the infinite reaches of space.<br />

In essence, by taking advantage of the most obvious local resource available on Mars— its atmosphere—the plan allows accomplishment of a manned Mars mission with what amounts to a lunar-class transportation system. By eliminating any requirement to introduce a new order of technology and complexity of operations beyond those needed for lunar transportation to accomplish piloted Mars missions, the plan can reduce costs by an order of magnitude and advance the schedule for the human exploration of Mars by a generation. Exploring Mars requires no miraculous new technologies, no orbiting spaceports, and no gigantic interplanetary space cruisers. We do not need to spend the next 30 years with a space program mired in impotence, spending large sums of money, and taking occasional casualties while the same missions to nowhere are flown over and over again and professional technologists dawdle endlessly without producing any new flight hardware. We simply need to choose our destination and, with the same combination of vision, practical thinking, and passionate resolve that served us so well during Apollo, do what is required to get there. We can establish our first small outpost on Mars within a decade. We and not some future generation can have the eternal honor of being the first pioneers of this new world for humanity. All that is needed is present-day technology, some 19th-century industrial chemistry, a solid dose of common sense, and a little bit of moxie.<br />

In the previous chapters, we described the space rocket engines, how they work, their role in past and current spaceflight, and their limitations. We have also shown that the rocket is not the only propulsion type that could be employed in space. Among the types of space propulsion currently under investigation, one is particularly promising: the solar sail. This propulsion mode is not conceptually new, even though only recent technology gives it a good chance to make a quality jump in spaceflight. Its principles and how to efficiently use a sail vehicle could be understood better by reviewing what happened about four millennia ago on the seas and by referring to the progress of physics in the 19th and 20th centuries. Early pioneers of solar sailing conceived a space use of sails in the first half of the 20th century, whereas the first technical publications and space designs began in the second half. But let us proceed in chronological order.<br />

One might suppose that a low-thrust Sun-pushed gossamer spacecraft will have no application in ventures testing the fringes of galactic space. One would be wrong! In a maneuver called ``sundiving'' by science-fiction authors Greg Benford and David Brin, the sailcraft is initially placed in a parabolic or elliptical solar orbit with a perihelion (point of closest solar approach) as close to the Sun as possible (Fig.9.3). At perihelion, the sail is pointed toward the Sun, and the craft is ejected from the solar system. Contemporary, Earth-launched sail technology seems capable of achieving solar-system escape velocities as high as 50 kilometers per second (km/s), with or without the giant-planet gravity assists utilized to accelerate Pioneer 10 and 11 and Voyager 1 and 2. The solar-system escape velocities possible utilizing the sundiver maneuver are far in excess of the velocities of the Pioneers and Voyagers. Within a flight-time of about two decades, a sail-launched extrasolar probe could reach the heliopauseÐthe boundary between solar and galactic influenceÐat 200 astronomical units (AU) or so from the Sun and measure local field strengths and particle densities. If the probe can survive another few decadesÐnot impossible in light of Pioneer's and Voyager's longevityÐ data could be returned from the inner focus of the Sun's gravitational lens at 550 AU, which would provide a check on Einstein's general relativity theory as a mission bonus. The possibility to fly by the Sun and get a high escape speed from the solar system is much more than a science-fiction idea. We have a strict mathematical theory, coming from many years of scientific research, which tells us that even without resorting to far future technologies, a sufficiently light sailcraft could be controlled in such a way as to reach the solar gravitational lens with a speed of 120 km/s, at least. Of course, emerging technologies could do excellent things for the designs of whole sailcraft and help us to transform such theoretical results into reality. Some may conservatively argue that probes to the edges of interstellar space may have little relevance to terrestrial life. But, since mass-extinction events on Earth may be linked to galactic influences, a few such interstellar craft may well be launched as our sail technology improves. And these early flights will only be the start of the sail's flirtation with the galactic abyss. Because the solar sail is scalable, we may view these early efforts as humanity's first true starships.<br />

<strong>Fifth— Colonization is an insurance policy against extinction— Every second we delay colonization of space costs one hundred trillion potential human lives.</strong><br />

As I write these words, suns are illuminating and heating empty rooms, unused energy is being flushed down black holes, and our great common endowment of negentropy is being irreversibly degraded into entropy on a cosmic scale. These are resources that an advanced civilization could have used to create value-structures, such as sentient beings living worthwhile lives. The rate of this loss boggles the mind. One recent paper speculates, using loose theoretical considerations based on the rate of increase of entropy, that the loss of potential human lives in our own galactic supercluster is at least ~10^46 per century of delayed colonization.[1] This estimate assumes that all the lost entropy could have been used for productive purposes, although no currently known technological mechanisms are even remotely capable of doing that. Since the estimate is meant to be a lower bound, this radically unconservative assumption is undesirable. We can, however, get a lower bound more straightforwardly by simply counting the number or stars in our galactic supercluster and multiplying this number with the amount of computing power that the resources of each star could be used to generate using technologies for whose feasibility a strong case has already been made. We can then divide this total with the estimated amount of computing power needed to simulate one human life. As a rough approximation, let us say the Virgo Supercluster contains 10^13 stars. One estimate of the computing power extractable from a star and with an associated planet-sized computational structure, using advanced molecular nanotechnology[2], is 10^42 operations per second.[3] A typical estimate of the human brain’s processing power is roughly 10^17 operations per second or less.[4] Not much more seems to be needed to simulate the relevant parts of the environment in sufficient detail to enable the simulated minds to have experiences indistinguishable from typical current human experiences.[5] Given these estimates, it follows that the potential for approximately 10^38 human lives is lost every century that colonization of our local supercluster is delayed; or equivalently, about 10^31 potential human lives per second. While this estimate is conservative in that it assumes only computational mechanisms whose implementation has been at least outlined in the literature, it is useful to have an even more conservative estimate that does not assume a non-biological instantiation of the potential persons. Suppose that about 10^10 biological humans could be sustained around an average star. Then the Virgo Supercluster could contain 10^23 biological humans. This corresponds to a loss of potential equal to about 10^14 potential human lives per second of delayed colonization. What matters for present purposes is not the exact numbers but the fact that they are huge. Even with the most conservative estimate, assuming a biological implementation of all persons, the potential for one hundred trillion potential human beings is lost for every second of postponement of colonization of our supercluster.[6]<br />

In a similar vein, the philosopher Derek Parfit (1984) wrote: I believe that if we destroy mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people think. Compare three outcomes: 1. Peace 2. A nuclear war that kills 99% of the world’s existing population 3. A nuclear war that kills 100% 2 would be worse than 1, and 3 would be worse than 2. Which is the greater of these two differences? Most people believe that the greater difference is between 1 and 2. I believe that the difference between 2 and 3 is very much greater.... The Earth will remain habitable for at least another billion years. Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. If we do not destroy mankind, these thousand years may be only a tiny fraction of the whole of civilized human history. The difference between 2 and 3 may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the rest of this history. If we compare this possible history to a day, what has occurred so far is only a fraction of a second. Human extinction in the next few centuries could reduce the number of future generations by thousands or more. We take extraordinary measures to protect some endangered species from extinction. It might be reasonable to take extraordinary measures to protect humanity from the same.19 To decide whether this is so requires more discussion of the methodological problems mentioned here, as well as research on the extinction risks we face and the costs of mitigating them.20<br />

An extinction event today could cause the loss of thousands of generations. This matters to the extent we value future lives. Society places some value on future lives when it accepts the costs of long-term environmental policies or hazardous waste storage. Individuals place some value on future lives when they adopt measures, such as screening for genetic diseases, to ensure the health of children who do not yet exist. Disagreement, then, does not center on whether future lives matter, but on how much they matter.6 Valuing future lives less than current ones (“intergenerational discounting”) has been justified by arguments about time preference, growth in consumption, uncertainty about future existence, and opportunity costs. I will argue that none of these justifications applies to the benefits of delaying human extinction. Under time preference, a good enjoyed in the future is worth less, intrinsically, than a good enjoyed now. The typical justification for time preference is descriptive—most people make decisions that suggest that they value current goods more than future ones. However, it may be that people’s time preference applies only to instrumental goods, like money, whose value predictably decreases in time. In fact, it would be difficult to design an experiment in which time preference for an intrinsic good (like happiness), rather than an instrumental good (like money), is separated from the other forms of discounting discussed below. But even supposing individuals exhibit time preference within their own lives, it is not clear how this would ethically justify discounting across different lives and generations (Frederick, 2006; Schelling, 2000). In practice, discounting the value of future lives would lead to results few of us would accept as being ethical. For instance, if we discounted lives at a 5% annual rate, a life today would have greater intrinsic value than a billion lives 400 years hence (Cowen &amp; Parfit, 1992). Broome (1994) suggests most economists and philosophers recognize that this preference for ourselves over our descendents is unjustifiable and agree that ethical impartiality requires setting the intergenerational discount rate to zero. After all, if we reject spatial discounting and assign equal value to contemporary human lives, whatever their physical distance from us, we have similar reasons to reject temporal discounting, and assign equal value to human lives, whatever their temporal distance from us. I Parfit (1984), Cowen (1992), and Blackorby et al. (1995) have similarly argued that time preference across generations is not ethically defensible.7 There could still be other reasons to discount future generations. A common justification for discounting economic goods is that their abundance generally increases with time. Because there is diminishing marginal utility from consumption, future generations may gain less satisfaction from a dollar than we will (Schelling, 2000). This principle makes sense for intergenerational transfers of most economic goods but not for intergenerational transfers of existence. There is no diminishing marginal utility from having ever existed. There is no reason to believe existence matters less to a person 1,000 years hence than it does to a person 10 years hence.<br />

Although the Space Treaty does not bar private ownership of &quot;celestial bodies&quot;, this does not mean that someone can simply say: &quot;I own Mars&quot;. Legal precedent requires possession. Consider, for example, maritime salvage law (also known as Admiralty and Maritime Law, and the Law of Salvage), which explicitly states that to claim ownership, the party making the claim must first make contact with and secure the property which must be beyond or outside a nation's national territory (Norris, 1991; Shoenbaum, 1994). In terms of &quot;salvage&quot; the original owner is entitled to a percentage of whatever is recovered. In the case of Mars, there are no original owners (and if there were, they are long dead and gone). Therefore, although some may argue that the 1967 treaty bars national ownership of Mars, the treaty does not apply to private ownership. This means that those who first arrive on Mars, may claim Mars (or all areas of Mars explored by humans) as private property. They may also sell portions of this property to other private parties or corporations. What might humans of Earth pay to own an inch or acre of Mars? Traditionally, mineral resources within national territory, belong to the government ruling that territory. Corporations and individuals must license the right to extract and sell those resources. Therefore, if those who first take possession of Mars form a government, they may claim ownership of all mineral and other resources (e.g. minerals, metals, gemstones, ores, salt, water). However, in the early history of the United States, private owners owned both &quot;surface rights&quot; and &quot;mineral rights&quot; and they had the right to sell, lease, or give away these rights. According to the Mars Mineral Spectoscropy Database of Mount Holyoke College, a wide variety of over 50 minerals may exist on Mars. Gold, silver, platinum, and other precious metals are likely to exist in abundance above and below the Martian surface; spewed out by volcanoes, and produced by ancient hydrothermal activity and circulating goundwater which acted as a concentrater. Therefore, once humans land on Mars, Martian mineral rights can be sold to the highest bidders, and Martian real estate can be sold by the inch or acre, with all these funds going to support the Human Mission to Mars and the colonization of the Red Planet.<br />

<strong>Ninth— Mars colonization revitalizes the economy—open immigration, sale of real estate, and innovation</strong><br />

We have examined the prospects for colonizing Mars, addressing the question of its economic viability. We have shown, that of all bodies in the solar system other than Earth, Mars is unique in that it has the resources required to support a population of sufficient size to create a new branch of human civilization. We have seen that despite the fact that Mars may lack any resource directly exportable to Earth, Mars' orbital elements and other physical parameters gives a unique positional advantage that will allow it to act as a keystone supporting extractive activities in the asteroid belt and elsewhere in the solar system. We have examined the potential of relatively near-term types of interplanetary transportation systems, and shown that with very modest advances on a historical scale, systems can be put in place that will allow individuals and families to emigrate to Mars at their own discretion. Their motives for doing so will parallel in many ways the historical motives for Europeans and others to come to America, including higher pay rates in a labor-short economy, escape from tradition and oppression, as well as freedom to exercise their drive to create in an untamed and undefined world. Under conditions of such large scale and open immigration, sale of real-estate will add a significant source of income to the planet's economy. However the greatest source of Martian wealth, and the greatest benefit of its existence to the terrestrial world, will be as a pressure cooker for invention and innovation of every type. In analogy to frontier America but going well beyond it, Mars will be a society of self-selected immigrants, operating in a harsh, labor-short environment in which practical innovation and technological acumen will be at a premium. Licensing on Earth of the inventions created under conditions of necessity on Mars will bring vast amounts of income to support the development of the Red Planet, even as these same inventions continue to raise terrestrial living standards and destabilize tendencies that would otherwise exist on Earth towards technological and social stagnation. What the Mediterranean was to the Greeks, what the New World was to the Western Europeans, Mars will be to the pioneering nations of the next several centuries; the engine of progress of the coming era. As America showed in the 19th Century, such an engine of can pull far more than its own weight.<br />

<strong>Contention two is solar storms</strong><br />

In light of recent news, the following information is paramount. On July 14, 2010 we learned that our sun is passing through an interstellar energy cloud which excites/energizes the sun. NASA, along with The National Academy of Science and other world renowned scientist are so concerned about this up and coming solar maximum in late 2012, that way back in March 10, 2006 NASA issued a solar storm warning (in writing) for 2012. What NASA omitted in their 2006 solar storm warning is what prompted NASA in the first place to issue a 2012 solar storm warning four years in advance? Then in 2010, NASA again warns the general population of a pending solar storm, telling the population to get ready for a once in a lifetime solar storm. Despite that news agencies and websites like this one are beginning to cover this developing story, no high government official has yet to stick his or her neck out to make an official announcement about the catastrophic implications as to allow the global population to begin preparing. The following scientific data revealed by Alexei Dmitriev further supports NASA’s original 2012 solar storm warning issued back in March of 2006. Astrophysicist Alexei Dmitriev says that both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 satellites reveal that our sun, as well as our entire solar system, is now moving into an interstellar energy cloud. Opher, a NASA Heliophysics Guest Investigator from George Mason University says this interstellar energy cloud is turbulent. Dmitriev explains that this cloud of energy is exciting the atmospheres of our planets and especially our sun. As this interstellar energy cloud continues to excite/charge the sun, it causes the sun to become more active, resulting in greater output from the sun. IE: Bigger and more frequent solar storms and CME’s resulting in the Carrington effect. This interstellar cloud of electrical energy is also absorbed by the Earth, and scientist have found that it results in more earth quakes, all while dramatically effecting our weather here on earth. When asked how long will it take our sun to pass through this interstellar energy cloud, Dr. Dmitriev replied, “I don’t know. But If I had to guess, I would say somewhere between two thousand to three thousand years.” This interstellar cloud is a wispy band of charged particles through which our solar system is slowly moving through. When Dr. Dmitriev was asked what are the implications of all this for earth he replied, “Global catastrophe! Not in tens of years from now, but in ones of years” …in that this global catastrophe is basically right around the corner setting the stage for NASA’s latest solar storm warning 2012-2013.<br />

There are other, more down-to-earth impacts spawned by these storms, especially for those living at northern latitudes. Recall that charged particles moving through a magnetic field will experience force acting upon them. So also will a moving magnetic field induce an electric current in a wire. Electrical utility wires (particularly those hanging from telephone poles at northern latitudes) will feel the effect of the solar storm as Earth's magnetic field is compressed, varying in intensity with time. This changing magnetic field induces current flow in the wires, creating spurious currents that knock out transformers and otherwise disrupt or shut down the transmission of electrical power. This is a real effect and it has happened.<br />

Companies and whole industries use the global positioning system and other satellite assets to accurately manage their inventories and track shipments. Corporate managers plan their business strategy and make decisions based on where certain products or materials are located at any given time. With a sudden loss in this capability, millions or even billons of dollars might be jeopardized. Cable television, now estimated to be in 68 percent of television-equipped U.S. households, is also at risk. After all, the cable only carries the television signal from your local cable company to your living room. The cable company gets the television signals from satellites located about 36,000 kilometers above the equator. If the satellites go out, the cable companies go out of business.<br />

The Bush years have of course revealed the perils of drawing facile parallels between the challenges of the present day and the great catastrophes of the 20th century. Nevertheless, there is reason to fear that the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression could have comparable consequences for the international system. For more than a decade, I pondered the question of why the 20th century was characterized by so much brutal upheaval. I pored over primary and secondary literature. I wrote more than 800 pages on the subject. And ultimately I concluded, in The War of the World, that three factors made the location and timing of lethal organized violence more or less predictable in the last century. The first factor was ethnic disintegration: Violence was worst in areas of mounting ethnic tension. The second factor was economic volatility: The greater the magnitude of economic shocks, the more likely conflict was. And the third factor was empires in decline: When structures of imperial rule crumbled, battles for political power were most bloody. In at least one of the world's regions -- the greater Middle East -- two of these three factors have been present for some time: Ethnic conflict has been rife there for decades, and following the difficulties and disappointments in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States already seems likely to begin winding down its quasi-imperial presence in the region. It likely still will. Now the third variable, economic volatility, has returned with a vengeance. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's &quot;Great Moderation&quot; -- the supposed decline of economic volatility that he hailed in a 2004 lecture -- has been obliterated by a financial chain reaction, beginning in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, spreading through the banking system, reaching into the &quot;shadow&quot; system of credit based on securitization, and now triggering collapses in asset prices and economic activity around the world. After nearly a decade of unprecedented growth, the global economy will almost certainly sputter along in 2009, though probably not as much as it did in the early 1930s, because governments worldwide are frantically trying to repress this new depression. But no matter how low interest rates go or how high deficits rise, there will be a substantial increase in unemployment in most economies this year and a painful decline in incomes. Such economic pain nearly always has geopolitical consequences. Indeed, we can already see the first symptoms of the coming upheaval. In the essays that follow, Jeffrey Gettleman describes Somalia's endless anarchy, Arkady Ostrovsky analyzes Russia's new brand of aggression, and Sam Quinones explores Mexico's drug-war-fueled misery. These, however, are just three case studies out of a possible nine or more. In Gaza, Israel has engaged in a bloody effort to weaken Hamas. But whatever was achieved militarily must be set against the damage Israel did to its international image by killing innocent civilians that Hamas fighters use as human shields. Perhaps more importantly, social and economic conditions in Gaza, which were already bad enough, are now abysmal. This situation is hardly likely to strengthen the forces of moderation among Palestinians. Worst of all, events in Gaza have fanned the flames of Islamist radicalism throughout the region -- not least in Egypt. From Cairo to Riyadh, governments will now think twice before committing themselves to any new Middle East peace initiative. Iran, meanwhile, continues to support both Hamas and its Shiite counterpart in Lebanon, Hezbollah, and to pursue an alleged nuclear weapons program that Israelis legitimately see as a threat to their very existence. No one can say for sure what will happen next within Tehran's complex political system, but it is likely that the radical faction around President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will be strengthened by the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. Economically, however, Iran is in a hole that will only deepen as oil prices fall further. Strategically, the country risks disaster by proceeding with its nuclear program, because even a purely Israeli air offensive would be hugely disruptive. All this risk ought to point in the direction of conciliation, even accommodation, with the United States. But with presidential elections in June, Ahmadinejad has little incentive to be moderate. On Iran's eastern border, in Afghanistan, upheaval remains the disorder of the day. Fresh from the success of the &quot;surge&quot; in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, the new head of U.S. Central Command, is now grappling with the much more difficult problem of pacifying Afghanistan. The task is made especially difficult by the anarchy that prevails in neighboring Pakistan. India, meanwhile, accuses some in Pakistan of having had a hand in the Mumbai terrorist attacks of last November, spurring yet another South Asian war scare. Remember: The sabers they are rattling have nuclear tips. The democratic governments in Kabul and Islamabad are two of the weakest anywhere. Among the biggest risks the world faces this year is that one or both will break down amid escalating violence. Once again, the economic crisis is playing a crucial role. Pakistan's small but politically powerful middle class has been slammed by the collapse of the country's stock market. Meanwhile, a rising proportion of the country's huge population of young men are staring unemployment in the face. It is not a recipe for political stability. This club is anything but exclusive. Candidate members include Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey, where there are already signs that the economic crisis is exacerbating domestic political conflicts. And let us not forget the plague of piracy in Somalia, the renewed civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the continuing violence in Sudan's Darfur region, and the heart of darkness that is Zimbabwe under President Robert Mugabe. The axis of upheaval has many members. And it’s a fairly safe bet that the roster will grow even longer this year. The problem is that, as in the 1930s, most countries are looking inward, grappling with the domestic consequences of the economic crisis and paying little attention to the wider world crisis. This is true even of the United States, which is now so preoccupied with its own economic problems that countering global upheaval looks like an expensive luxury. With the U.S. rate of GDP growth set to contract between 2 and 3 percentage points this year, and with the official unemployment rate likely to approach 10 percent, all attention in Washington will remain focused on a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package. Caution has been thrown to the wind by both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The projected deficit for 2009 is already soaring above the trillion-dollar mark, more than 8 percent of GDP. Few commentators are asking what all this means for U.S. foreign policy. The answer is obvious: The resources available for policing the world are certain to be reduced for the foreseeable future. That will be especially true if foreign investors start demanding higher yields on the bonds they buy from the United States or simply begin dumping dollars in exchange for other currencies. Economic volatility, plus ethnic disintegration, plus an empire in decline: That combination is about the most lethal in geopolitics. We now have all three. The age of upheaval starts now.<br />

It’s important that we avoid all these policy errors — not just for the sake of our prosperity, but for our survival. The Great Depression, after all, didn’t end until the advent of World War II, the most destructive war in the history of the planet. In a world of nuclear and biological weapons and non-state terrorist organizations that breed on poverty and despair, another global economic breakdown of such extended duration would risk armed conflicts on an even greater scale.<br />

Solar sails are especially effective at performing missions that otherwise require a large amount of propellant. A particularly propulsive-intense maneuver is required to change the orbital inclination of a spacecraft, whether it orbits the earth, another planet, or the sun. The orbit's inclination is simply a measure of the angle the orbit plane makes with respect to some reference plane, which usually is either Earth's equator or the ecliptic.(Note that the ecliptic is a plane, not an orbit, although the terms earth orbit and ecliptic often are used interchangeably.) Moving from the initial launch orbit to another ``angle'' in orbit is very difficult, and conventional propulsion systems are limited in performing this maneuver by the amount of fuel they can carry. Taking advantage of a solar sail's virtually unlimited ability to provide thrust, scientists are eager to place a spacecraft into a highly inclined orbit around the Sun in order to study what happens near its poles. Current observations of the Sun are limited to spacecraft launched from Earth, which remain nearly in the ecliptic (because they are launched from Earth, which inhabits the ecliptic), limiting our views to those near the solar equator or its mid-latitude regions. The proposed mission to study the Sun's poles is called, the Solar Polar Imager, and it can only be realistically implemented with a solar sail propulsion system. The Solar Polar Imager spacecraft would benefit from the 46 increase in solar propulsive thrust available from operating at 0.5 AU. While the proposed mission is just a concept at this time, studies show that current solar-sail technology could be used to implement the mission with a square, 3-axis stabilized sail no more than 150 meters on a side.<br />

Fortunately, in addition to adding lots of mass to the spacecraft, there are two other ways to mitigate the effects of these storms, and both require some sort of advanced warning of an impending storm. One is to turn off particularly vulnerable spacecraft systems when the worst of the storm arrives, and power back up after the storm is over. The other would be to reorient the spacecraft so as to maximize any onboard spacecraft mass between the most vulnerable systems and the ionizing radiation in the plasma for the duration of the storm.<br />

Much of the damage can be mitigated if managers know a storm is coming. Putting satellites in 'safe mode' and disconnecting transformers can protect these assets from damaging electrical surges.

<strong>And— Military readiness deters global war</strong><br />

Military readiness is vital because declines in America's military readiness signal to the rest of the world that the United States is not prepared to defend its interests. Therefore, potentially hostile nations will be more likely to lash out against American allies and interests, inevitably leading to U.S. involvement in combat. A high state of military readiness is more likely to deter potentially hostile nations from acting aggressively in regions of vital national interest, thereby preserving peace.<br />

Solar sails operate best in the inner solar system and well away from Earth. Sunlight is plentiful and continuous. Away from planetary gravity, there are few mechanical stresses on their tenuous gossamer structures. Though the extreme effects of LEO are not present in interplanetary space, it, too, is far from empty.<br />

Solar sails stress our current state-of-the-art materials capabilities, but the needs of first-generation sail missions can now be met. Materials that are manufacturable in large sizes, yet lightweight enough to provide thrust under photon bombardment exist and have been tested in simulated space conditions. The radiation tolerance of candidate materials has been measured, with some outperforming others. Several materials appear to be both foldable and storable with minimal, if any, subsequent deployment issues. From a materials point of view, first-generation solar sails are ready to fly!<br />

Moving forward a few decades, we can reasonably expect major improvements in sail technology. Various sail structures and unfurlment techniques will have been perfected. Sails will be thinner, stronger, and more temperature resistant. A number of exciting mission opportunities could be implemented during this timeframe. One of these is the possibility of formation flying with a comet and returning comet samples to Earth.<br />

Although Mars exploration has captured the hearts and minds of the public, altering orbits of some near-Earth objects (NEOs) of asteroidal or cometary origin may be of much greater terrestrial significance. There are thousands of these bodies scattered between the orbits of Venus and Mars. And it is known that they occasionally whack Earth, with disastrous consequences. The most famous of these impacts occurred about 65 million years ago in the Yucatan region of Mexico. Eons before the Mayan rulers sported in the warm waters of the Caribbean, the tremendous fires and ash from the impact of this 10-kilometer object may have helped cause the demise of the dinosaurs and the rise of mammals to ascendancy. But smaller objects, such as the 100-meter-radius object that impacted in Tunguska Siberia in 1908 with the force of a 20-megaton hydrogen bomb, strike much more frequently than NEOs of the dinosaur killer's size at intervals of few centuries or less. Although in principle there is a certain (low) risk of Earth-NEO collisions in the course of centuries, do not panic; unlike our ancestors, we can do something about this threat, taking responsibility for our own future. Although nuclear explosives are certainly an option to divert a NEO targeting Earth, sails present a much more elegant option. A large, thin solar sail deployed at an NEO would increase both the reflectivity and the effective area of the NEO, allowing for a decades-duration alteration in the NEO's orbit, converting a direct hit on Earth into a near miss.<br />

Another space mission of interest that could be implemented in the near term is the terrestrial pole sitter. Using the thrust on a sail provided by sunlight to balance Earth's gravitational attraction, a pole sitter is just that Ð a sail-propelled spacecraft that appears to ``sit'' above one of the Earth's poles. This is a high-latitude analogue to the geosynchronous position of most communication satellites, which are permanently stationed 35,786 kilometers above the equator. The period of such an orbit is exactly one Earth rotation period (about 86,164 s) and the satellite will apparently remain stationary above the same location on Earth's surface and serve as a convenient target for radio beams. A terrestrial pole sitter would be situated in the sky as near to the pole star's location as possible. Rather than rotating at the same angular velocity as Earth's surface, it would have a relatively constant location on the celestial sphere. Thus, designers of telecommunication, Earth-resource, navigation, and weather satellites designed to serve high-latitude users cannot use this convenient orbit since high-latitude ground stations find geosynchronous satellites to be below or near their horizon. Although high-latitude pole sitters are certainly possible, they will have certain annoying consequences for telecommunication customers. Studies indicate that solar-sail pole sitters will function best if situated at the Moon's distance or beyond. This greater distance would introduce a longer time delay in telephone calls via pole-sitter spacecraft. This will not please all customers! The ability to hover over a single area of Earth would be highly desirable for those monitoring the environment. Instruments placed on such craft would be able to continuously monitor local weather and environmental conditions. Military users would also benefit from the ability to continuously observe the activities of a potential adversary.<br />

Pictures such as those taken by the Apollo astronauts helped to stimulate the growth of the “green” movement and of environmental awareness among the lay public. The state of health of the oceans, the equatorial forests, the polar icecaps, and the atmosphere became political as well as scientific issues. Public concern over what became known as “the environment” led to international agreements as well as national legislation intended to control and reduce pollution of the atmosphere and oceans in an attempt to reduce the impact of global warming. Images from unmanned Earth-orbiting satellites such as the TIROS/NOAA weather satellites also contributed to public concern over the state of the environment. For example, Figure 3 shows the Antarctic ozone hole for the period September–December 1995. These images, together with ground measurements, were instrumental in preparing the way for an international treaty to reduce the amounts of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases released into the atmosphere. It is evident that images from space have had a considerable impact on the way human beings perceive our home planet. From the perspective of a sixteenth-century sailor, the earth would probably have seemed a very large and hostile place with limitless resources. As we enter the twenty-first century, our perception is quite different; we see a small and fragile earth that is at risk from the activities of its six billion human inhabitants. It is a planet that needs care and attention. We have also learned that the earth’s atmosphere, oceans, land surfaces, and biosphere are all intimately connected. This point of view is developed further in NASA Earth Science Enterprise: A New Window on Our World.<br />

Global Warming continues to be approaches by governments as a &quot;luxury&quot; item, rather than a matter of basic human survival. Humanity is being taken to its destruction by a greed-driven elite. These elites, which include 'Big Oil' and other related interests, are intoxicated by &quot;the high&quot; of pursuing ego-driven power, in a comparable manner to drug addicts who pursue an elusive &quot;high&quot;, irrespective of the threat of pursuing that &quot;high&quot; poses to their own basic survival, and the security of others. Global Warming and the pre-emptive war against Iraq are part of the same self-destructive prism of a political-military-industrial complex, which is on a path of mass planetary destruction, backed by techniques of mass-deception.&quot;The scientific debate about human induced global warming is over but policy makers - let alone the happily shopping general public - still seem to not understand the scope of the impending tragedy. Global warming isn't just warmer temperatures, heat waves, melting ice and threatened polar bears. Scientific understanding increasingly points to runaway global warming leading to human extinction&quot;, reported Bill Henderson in CrossCurrents. If strict global environmental security measures are not immediately put in place to keep further emissions of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere we are looking at the death of billions, the end of civilization as we know it and in all probability the end of humankind's several million year old existence, along with the extinction of most flora and fauna beloved to man in the world we share.<br />

One way to support an expanding space infrastructure and render it less dependent on Earth is to mine NEOs as we rearrange their orbits and ship the materials back to space-processing facilities near Earth. Solar sails may provide an economical, though slow, method of altering the orbit of an NEO to allow its riches to be mined and exported back to Earth and elsewhere. The NEO-obtained material may be used to create a geosynchronous ring of solar-power satellites to beam energy back to Earth, rendering the West's current oil addiction obsolete. Solar-sail freighters, perhaps under robotic control, would make very effective transporters of material from the NEOs. Such an application may prove to be the most economically significant of all sail uses in this time frame.<br />

Our responses to these provocations have been muted and hapless. Why? Because any forceful action on our part against nations like Iran and Saudi Arabia could result in the disruption of oil supplies that the world economy is completely dependent upon.

[“The Origins of the New Terrorism,” Parameters: US Army War College Quarterly, Volume 34, Issue 1, Spring]<br />
The practice of terrorism has undergone dramatic changes in recent years. The categorical fanaticism that is apparent in terrorist organizations across a spectrum of belief systems is a major part of this change. In the past, terrorists were more likely to be dominated by pragmatic considerations of political and social change, public opinion, and other such factors. Today, a phenomenon that was a minute rarity in the past—terrorists bent on death and destruction for its own sake—is more commonplace than ever. In addition, the statelessness of today’s terrorists removes crucial restraints that once held the most extreme terrorists in check or prevented them from reaching the highest levels in their organizations. Terrorists can still enjoy the funding and shelter that only a national economy can mobilize, but they are on their own to a greater degree in greater numbers than in the past. Organizationally, terrorists are using the non-hierarchical structures and systems that have emerged in recent years. Finally, the potential availability of nuclear, chemical, and biological WMD technology provides the prospect that these trends could result in unprecedented human disasters.Terrorism has quantitatively and qualitatively changed from previous years. Whether it is Gurr and Coleman’s “third wave of vulnerability” or Rapoport’s “fourth wave of terrorism,” contemporary terrorism is a significant departure from the phenomenon even as recently as during the Cold War. The US National Security Strategy has recognized terrorism, in the memorable phrase “the crossroads of radicalism and technology,” as the predominant security threat in the post-Cold War world. The cataclysmic impact of 9/11 on both the American strategic consciousness and the international security environment can scarcely be overstated. Those attacks resulted from a combination of cultural, political, and technological factors and were a revelation to the world of the emergence of the new terrorism.<br />

The combination of horror and outrage that will surge upon the nation will demand that the president retaliate for the incomprehensible damage done by the attack. The problem will be that the president will not immediately know how to respond or against whom. The perpetrators will have been incinerated by the explosion that destroyed New York City. Unlike 9-11, there will have been no interval during the attack when those hijacked could make phone calls to loved ones telling them before they died that the hijackers were radical Islamic extremists. There will be no such phone calls when the attack will not have been anticipated until the instant the terrorists detonate their improvised nuclear device inside the truck parked on a curb at the Empire State Building. Nor will there be any possibility of finding any clues, which either were vaporized instantly or are now lying physically inaccessible under tons of radioactive rubble. Still, the president, members of Congress, the military, and the public at large will suspect another attack by our known enemy – Islamic terrorists. The first impulse will be to launch a nuclear strike on Mecca, to destroy the whole religion of Islam. Medina could possibly be added to the target list just to make the point with crystal clarity. Yet what would we gain? The moment Mecca and Medina were wiped off the map, the Islamic world<br />
– more than 1 billion human beings in countless different nations – would feel attacked. Nothing would emerge intact after a war between the United States and Islam. The apocalypse would be upon us. Then, too, we would face an immediate threat from our long-term enemy, the former Soviet Union. Many in the Kremlin would see this as an opportunity to grasp the victory that had been snatched from them by Ronald Reagan when the Berlin Wall came down. A missile strike by the Russians on a score of American cities could possibly be pre-emptive. Would the U.S. strategic defense system be so in shock that immediate retaliation would not be possible? Hardliners in Moscow might argue that there was never a better opportunity to destroy America. In China, our newer Communist enemies might not care if we could retaliate. With a population already over 1.3 billion people and with their population not concentrated in a few major cities, the Chinese might calculate to initiate a nuclear blow on the United States. What if the United States retaliated with a nuclear counterattack upon China? The Chinese might be able to absorb the blow and recover. The North Koreans might calculate even more recklessly. Why not launch upon America the few missiles they have that could reach our soil? More confusion and chaos might only advance their position. If Russia, China, and the United States could be drawn into attacking one another, North Korea might emerge stronger just because it was overlooked while the great nations focus on attacking one another.<br />

Solar sails are giant, lightweight mirrors which use the force exerted by photons from the sun to propel through outerspace. Solar sailing is still in the works, but when perfected, it will revolutionize space travel and make the age of rocket-fueled spacecraft a distant memory. Currently, 95% of the weight of a spacecraft at launch is rocket fuel. This means that space travel today is not only impractical, but also very expensive. The current cost negatively affects the space program directly and indirectly, as political support and government funding is hampered by much of the public's opinion that the vast amounts of money are better used elsewhere. Thus the advent of solar sailing should jumpstart a space age where perhaps even interstellar travel will one day be possible.<br />

To get reelected, politicians must curry favor with the electorate. Sometimes high-profile stunts in space and huge projects economically supporting lots of workers with little practical output are favored over sounder approaches. The high-profile stunt results in favorable publicity and headlines; the ``pork-barrel'' project garners votes. To succeed, a rational space-development program must work with the politically inspired funding cycles.<br />

From the latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey: Despite the country's struggling economy and vocal opposition to some of his policies, President Obama's favorability rating is at an all-time high. Two-thirds feel hopeful about his leadership and six in 10 approve of the job he's doing in the White House. &quot;What is amazing here is how much political capital Obama has spent in the first six weeks,&quot; said Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff. &quot;And against that, he stands at the end of this six weeks with as much or more capital in the bank.&quot; Peter Hart gets at a key point. Some believe that political capital is finite, that it can be used up. To an extent that's true. But it's important to note, too, that political capital can be regenerated -- and, specifically, that when a President expends a great deal of capital on a measure that was difficult to enact and then succeeds, he can build up more capital. Indeed, that appears to be what is happening with Barack Obama, who went to the mat to pass the stimulus package out of the gate, got it passed despite near-unanimous opposition of the Republicans on Capitol Hill, and is being rewarded by the American public as a result. Take a look at the numbers. President Obama now has a 68 percent favorable rating in the NBC-WSJ poll, his highest ever showing in the survey. Nearly half of those surveyed (47 percent) view him very positively. Obama's Democratic Party earns a respectable 49 percent favorable rating. The Republican Party, however, is in the toilet, with its worst ever showing in the history of the NBC-WSJ poll, 26 percent favorable. On the question of blame for the partisanship in Washington, 56 percent place the onus on the Bush administration and another 41 percent place it on Congressional Republicans. Yet just 24 percent blame Congressional Democrats, and a mere 11 percent blame the Obama administration. So at this point, with President Obama seemingly benefiting from his ambitious actions and the Republicans sinking further and further as a result of their knee-jerked opposition to that agenda, there appears to be no reason not to push forward on anything from universal healthcare to energy reform to ending the war in Iraq.<br />

WASHINGTON — High-profile critics fear President Barack Obama's commercial overhaul of human spaceflight is going nowhere and could mark the end of half a century of US supremacy among the stars and planets. &quot;We will have no American access to, and return from, low Earth orbit and the International Space Station for an unpredictable length of time in the future,&quot; Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the Moon, warned lawmakers at a recent hearing. The end of the space shuttle era has left America's human spaceflight program in an &quot;embarrassing&quot; state, Armstrong said, arguing that NASA needs a stronger vision for the future and should focus on returning humans to the Moon and to the International Space Station. With the US space shuttle program now mothballed after its last flight in July, the United States is forced to depend on Russia's Soyuz capsules to ferry astronauts to the orbiting research laboratory until at least 2015. Obama canceled the Constellation program that aimed to return humans to the Moon by 2020 and called on NASA to instead focus on new, deep-space capabilities to carry people to an asteroid by 2025 and Mars by 2030. NASA is counting on the private sector to develop a shuttle alternative at the least possible cost within the next five years. But many experts doubt that the firms, most of which have little space experience, can step up to the challenge. &quot;I don't think any of the ISS partners looks at what we are doing in the US with commercial cargo and crew and feels very confident,&quot; Space Policy Institute director Scott Pace told AFP. &quot;So there is a great gap between the aspirations of the policy and the actual capabilities that exist now.&quot; A ticket on the Soyuz capsules to the ISS costs global space agencies between $50 million and $60 million each. Former astronaut Eugene Cernan, who commanded the Apollo 17 flight and was the last man to walk on the Moon in 1972, said Constellation has been replaced by a &quot;mission to nowhere&quot; and urged NASA to return to the Moon. Under intense congressional pressure from both his fellow Democrats and rival Republicans, the White House has agreed to develop sooner than planned a heavy-lift launch vehicle for deep human space exploration dubbed the Space Launch System. But financing and other details remain vague. NASA is focusing especially on deploying the SLS to explore asteroids around 2025, remaining vague on plans to visit Mars and mute on a return to the Moon. Worried about the course taken by NASA, Cernan said that &quot;today, we are on a path of decay. We are seeing the book close on five decades of accomplishment as the leader in human space exploration.&quot; Republican Representative Ralph Hall, the chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, agreed. &quot;If NASA doesn't move out quickly, more and more of our industrial base, skilled engineers and technicians, and hard-won capabilities are at risk of withering away,&quot; Hall said.<br />

 <strong>No risk of a Moody’s credit downgrade—it’s not in the banks’ self-interest.</strong><br />

There is one way in which the public can better recognise what Moody's motivations may be. All banks, including giants like Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, hold huge amounts of US government debt. They are also reliant on the US government for all sorts of reasons, including potential bailouts. If the US government were to default on its debts, then it would almost certainly wipe out every major bank in the country. There is no plausible scenario in which the US government defaults on its debts and the banks will still be able to make good on their debt payments.This means that if Moody's were to downgrade the government's debt, to be consistent it must also downgrade the debt of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and the other big banks. If Moody's downgrades the government's debt, without downgrading the debt of the big banks – or even threatens to downgrade the government's debt without also threatening to downgrade the debt of the big banks – then it seems more likely that it could be acting in pursuit of Wall Street's political agenda than presenting its best assessment of the creditworthiness of the US government.<br />

<strong>The bond ratings agencies have no credibility—their threats are politically motivated.</strong><br />

Moody's and the other bond rating agencies have featured prominently in the build-up to the financial crisis. These agencies gave investment grade ratings to complex financial instruments filled with subprime mortgages and other bad assets. These ratings allowed Goldman Sachs and other investment banks to sell this trash around the country and the world, ensuring that the effects of the collapse of the housing bubble would reverberate throughout the financial system. It was not just incompetence that caused Moody's to misunderstand the quality of the issues it was rating. Moody's and the other bond-rating agencies were getting paid by the banks whose assets that they were rating. The bond-rating agencies knew that these companies wanted investment grade ratings for their issues. As one examiner for Standard and Poor's said in an email, they would give investment grade ratings to products &quot;structured by cows&quot;. This record must be kept in mind when considering the possibility of a Moody's downgrade of US government debt. It is no secret that many on Wall Street would love to see social security and Medicare cut back or even privatised. Investment banker Peter Peterson has even committed $1bn toward promoting this agenda. When Moody's threatens to downgrade US government debt, or if it actually does so, it may reflect its actual assessment of the creditworthiness of the US government or it could be a reflection of the Wall Street agenda to cut back these key public programmes.<br />

NMI Retirement Fund investment consultant Wilshire Associates mentioned yesterday that the new credit move down received by the U.S. has no evident repercussions on the CNMI’s marketplace investments. Wilshire leading Maggie Ralbovsky mentioned the United States’ credit rating waste the highest. SP is the initial credit group to disintegrate the United States from its longtime triple-A credit rating roost when it downgraded this to AA+. The rating group believes the mercantile converging outline that the U.S. Congress and White House concluded to falls partial of what would be vital to stabilise the government’s medium-term debt dynamics. Ralbovsky mentioned yesterday that SP is only a the 3 general credit rating agencies-with Fitch Rating and Moody’s as the other two-that give rating performance. She explained that if these 3 rating firms rate an entity differently, “this entity is deliberate broken up rated and a broken up entity is deliberate having the aloft rating.” “In the nearby term, no [impact] really,” she said, adding that the United States’ ratings with Moody’s and Fitch sojourn at AAA. “In essence, the move down is not a solid preference reason by financial marketplace players,” she said, adding that the move down was due to the misleading prophesy of the U.S. to compromise its bill shortage and not since the U.S. Treasury was in fact downgraded. Yesterday, the Wilshire leading cited a few reasons is to one after another sensitivity of the market. Among these is the diplomatic doubt in the Middle East, the debt predicament in Europe, incompatible opinions and resisting views in the U.S. Congress, and others<br />

Another significant issue favoring solar sailing is space debris, which by now surrounds Earth at virtually any altitude up to and around the geostationary orbit (35,786kmhigh). Most of it is the remnants of either the explosion of launchers' upper stages or spacecraft orbit-maneuver engines, or collisions of satellites with other debris. If a sailcraft fails in orbit about Earth, there is one big piece in area (but not in mass) to be monitored, not many millions of particles that eventually spread on a large range of altitude. If ever garbage-collection space vehicles were designed in the future, approaching a failed sailcraft would be much less complicated than locating many small pieces (dangerous indeed) endowed with very high speed (*8±10km/s) with respect to the chaser system. Apart from that, sail- endowed vehicles orbiting about Earth not only can use the sail during their operational lives, but also can be utilized to enter the upper atmosphere so as to burn at the end of the mission. This would avoid the formation of new big orbital debris (as has been shown by author Vulpetti in a theoretical study for the European Space Agency, June 1997).<br />

The pathologies of reporting and commentary on policymaking are well-known: various proposals are simplified into a very few competing alternatives and reporting on these alternatives treats them in horse-race fashion. See, for example, this article by Regina Lawrence on welfare reform. The specific pathology that Brendan, Matt, and Ezra debunk is a fixation on the president in the policymaking process. Presidential power is assumed to be essentially limitless — e.g., if Obama would just say so, Joe Lieberman would roll over and vote for a single-payer system. (I exaggerate, but only a little.) When members of Congress don’t do exactly what the president wants or when (God forbid) the president “lets” Congress do actual legislating, reporters start in with “news analysis” like this silliness from John Broder in Sunday’s New York Times. Here, climate change is framed around what Obama can or cannot accomplish, complete with portentous questions like: Can Mr. Obama surmount those problems in his latest effort to save the world? A while back, I posted about a Ted Lowi essay in which he characterized this sort of news coverage as “unbelievably primitive.” And it is. Understanding policymaking means taking Congress seriously and treating legislators as autonomous. It means acknowledging (repeatedly) the multiple veto points that are built into the system. Policy change is not solely a matter of presidential will or skill — as I and others have noted. Of course Obama has an agenda with regard to health care, climate change, etc. And of course legislative success or failure has implications for his presidency. But Yglesias and others have rightly pounded away at the notion that policymaking should somehow be framed around the president’s goals, actions, and standing. This frame gets the policymaking process wrong, and it arguably hurts our understanding of the policies themselves, whose details are subordinated to armchair quarterbacking about the president’s decisions or lack thereof. At its worst, you get this stunning contempt from David Broder for the fact that making policy is a process and that the point of the process is to (try to) make the right decision…the urgent necessity is to make a decision — whether or not it is right.<br />

With the exception of a few experimental efforts, all publicly funded space efforts utilize technologies mostly developed decades in the past. To allow new in-space propulsion technologies such as the SPS to mature to their flight application, NASA developed a step-by-step procedure called technological readiness, which works as follows: when a new space propulsion idea emerges from a theory and its basic physical principles are validated, it is assigned a technological readiness level (TRL) of 1. An example of an in-space propulsion concept now at TRL 1 is the proton- fusing interstellar ramjet. It may always remain at this level since its physics is well validated but its technology may never be defined. In some cases, such as the matter±antimatter rocket, the technological requirements can be defined, even if not achieved. Such propulsion concepts are at TRL 2. As an in-space-propulsion concept matures, its TRL increases. Analytical or experimental proof-of-concept investigations are performed, followed by laboratory (breadboard) validation studies. Component and breadboard tests are then performed in a simulated space environmentÐa vacuum chamberÐto achieve a TRL of 5. The next step is to successfully test a prototype of the in-space propulsion system under study in the simulated space environment. To achieve a TRL of 7, a prototype of the propulsion system must be successfully tested in space. The completed system is then qualified through demonstrations on Earth or in space. The highest level of TRL is 9, in which the propulsion system is operationally used in space missions. Examples of such ``off-the-shelf'' TRL- 9 propulsion systems include chemical rockets, solar-electric rockets, and gravity assists. It might be argued that the TRL system is boring and bureaucraticÐjust the thing that a space agency might dream up to justify its own existence. But the beauty of the approach lies in its small, clearly documented incremental steps. A space-program manager can use TRL to compensate for the politically determined, highly variable nature of space-propulsion funding. Well-documented research can advance an in-space propulsion concept one or two TRLs during any funding cycle and then be used to efficiently pick up the research effort efficiently when large-scale funding resumes. In this way, it is not necessary to endlessly reinvent the wheel.<br />

[&quot;A Machine That Would Go of Itself: Interpassivity and Its Impact on Political Life,&quot; Theory &amp; Event, Volume 9, Issue 2, June, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project MUSE]<br />
Although interpassivity was first situated in the domain of the arts, the concept also seems well suited to describe and evaluate phenomena and developments outside the domain of aesthetics. My aim in this article is to set the concept to work in the domain of politics and citizenship. In particular, I want to show how interpassivity can shed light on the question why many citizens nowadays show strong signs of social discontentment, in societies that offer them unprecedented levels of democracy, well-being and security. It may help to explain the lack of interest in politics, in times when citizens are more closely being 'monitored' by politics than ever before. It may contribute to understanding why contemporary politics is the center of 'interest' of both elites and discontented masses, yet is bitterly criticized for being unreliable and impotent. The observations by Pfaller and Zizek form the starting point for a discussion of some general features of the phenomenon of interpassivity (¤1). First, interpassivity seems to indicate a lack of interest in the aims and goals of our actions. Second, it is intimately related to the prominent role of 'media', especially their power to focus (and narrow) our attention to certain 'superficialities' involved in the process of either arts or politics. Third, it stands in the tradition of critique of ideology, as it originated in marxism and was continuated in the Frankfurter Schule. Building on these insights, I propose that interpassivity is a suitable diagnostic tool to explain and evaluate certain important socio-cultural developments that affect multiple spheres of social life. My thesis is that these spheres show a development towards 'interpassivization', and that this has negative consequences for the sense of well-being and the self-understanding of the people involved in the activities that constitute these domains. Although my main analysis focuses on the sphere of politics, I will start off the second paragraph by discussing interpassive developments in the sphere of labor. This is useful, first, because labor constitutes one of the most important domains of social life, and the discovery of interpassive phenomena in this sphere thus testifies to their importance in general. Second, this discussion enables me to outline and develop some more general points concerning interpassivity in contemporary life. One of the most important of these themes is alienation. I find that interpassivity enables us to speak in a new, more insightful way about modes of alienation in contemporary life, especially in the domains of labor and politics. Such alienation implies an increased attachment to a process of production accompanied by a loss of interest in the product of this process. This explains how interpassivity can imply an increase in activity, while also in some important sense entailing a loss. In the third paragraph, I turn to the domain of politics. The developments here turn out to be similar in many ways to those in the domain of labor. Only the manifestations and consequences of interpassivity in politics are more invasive. By comparing labor and politics, I hope to show how, in both domains, differences in status and position in comparable ways determine how people are affected by interpassivity, or even suffer from it (¤4). Those in higher positions of management and policy-making are usually well off, while those who are being managed or ruled are most likely to experience the adverse effects of interpassivity. Moreover, both groups seem attracted to interpassive politics, although for different reasons that both typically misunderstand. Let us first take a closer look at the concept of interpassivity. What does it refer to? What sort of phenomena does it try to explain, and in what way? First, interpassivity implies a lack of interest in the aims and goals of our actions. At first sight, this appears strange. Why act if we do not care much about the consequences? Yet this seems to be the problem of modern consumption society. The more passionately and intimately we are attached to the institutions that can provide us with goods to use or consume, the less we seem actually able to enjoy our action or consumption.2 Our acquisitions seem to constitute not merely the beginning, but the end of our action and enjoyment. This kind of interpassivity is illustrated by Pfaller and Zizek through examples like buying books or recording videotapes, without ever getting around to read or watch them.3 The VCR, as it were, watches TV on our behalf.<br />

A government cost-cutting panel Thursday rejected a science ministry plea to hike its fiscal 2011 budget request for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to ¥190 billion, recommending it remain unchanged from fiscal 2010 at ¥180 billion. The Government Revitalization Unit urged th e Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry to limit its JAXA-related budget request to the same amount the Diet approved earlier this year. On the final day of its four-day screening of a range of proposed programs, the panel examined the appropriateness of the ministry's requests relating to Japan's participation in the International Space Station and the Earth observation satellites JAXA is developing. While underlining the importance of space development, the panelists cautioned that if JAXA were allowed to embark on new projects, it would create fresh strains on national finances by generating the need to conclude relevant contracts with businesses over subsequent fiscal years. The panelists also called on the ministry to rethink its plan to allow JAXA-related expenses to balloon to a level equal to 150 percent of its current expenses when the 2013 fiscal year gets under way.<br />

<strong>Brannen 2010, (</strong>Thomas J.D. Candidate, Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law, Summer, “Private Commercial Space Transportation’s Dependence on Space Tourism and NASA’s Responsibility to Both,” Journal of Air Law and Commerce, p.664<br />
While NASA can refuse to learn from its mistakes and continue to insist on controlling all aspects of space exploration, despite its budgetary constraints, the most mutually beneficial option is to require NASA to rely on private commercial providers. The recertification of the Shuttle would require large increases in or reallocations of NASA's budget and could potentially lead to the same inefficiencies that have plagued NASA throughout its history. Instead, NASA should follow the Committee's suggestion, learn from the success of prize-encouraged innovation, and &quot;strengthen ... incentives to the commercial providers&quot; in their development of suitable services to utilize in its ISS operations. By implementing a potentially government-sponsored prize coupled with guaranteed contracts, NASA would serve its own purposes of shortening &quot;the Gap&quot; and would produce additional incentives for innovation in the private commercial space transportation industry. Likewise, by ensuring that orbiting refueling centers are developed, NASA would incentivize and improve propositions of space transportation and space tourism services such as space hotels and private orbital spacecraft, allowing NASA to focus instead on deep space exploration.<br />

The advantage of the space agencies over small-scale entrepreneurs is essentially one of scale. Since space agencies are governmental entities, they have the ability to plan long-term research and development efforts supported by tax revenues. For example, much has been written in recent months about the success of privately funded suborbital space flights at a fraction of the cost of similar government-funded efforts. While these comparisons make a certain amount of sense, they entirely ignore the cost of the decades-long government-sponsored space infrastructure. Space Ship 1 would not have so readily won the X-Prize for repeated flights to heights in excess of 100 kilometers if Burt Rutan and associates had had to construct the Edwards Air Force Base and repeat the materials research leading to the technology used in their vehicle.<br />

American technological leadership is paramount today, vital to our national security, our economic prosperity and our global standing. America is the nation we are today in no small part because of the technological investments made in earlier decades, because of the engineers, scientists and elected officials who had the wisdom and foresight to make investments required for our country to emerge as a global technological leader. Those investments accelerated our economy through creation of new industries, products and services. They have yielded lasting societal benefit to all of us. For NASA, past cutting-edge technology investments led to design and flight of the Apollo missions, the space shuttle, the international space station, and a myriad of robotic explorers that allowed us to reach destinations across our solar system and peer across the universe. NASA remains one of the nation’s premier research and development agencies, pursuing breakthrough technologies that will expand the frontiers of aeronautics and space. Investments in research and technology are required to enable flight of NASA’s bold future missions. These same missions focus and sharpen NASA’s research and technology investment portfolio. The symbiotic relationship between innovative technology development and mission development drives the pace of our future in space, creates jobs and feeds the economic engine of our nation. The administration of President Barack Obama has demonstrated its commitment to our nation’s future, making investments in innovation and technology a priority, even in challenging fiscal times. Recent examples of NASA’s technology accomplishments include the advanced solar cell research that enabled design of Juno, the first solar-powered outer-planet spacecraft, launched towards Jupiter in August. Orbiting above us on the international space station, a pathfinder robotic refueling experiment is under way. This joint NASA/Canadian Space Agency experiment is designed to prove the tools, technologies and techniques needed to robotically repair and refuel satellites in orbit — a necessary capability for deep-space travel. In addition, with government investment in these foundational technology experiments, a commercial satellite servicing enterprise may soon emerge in which private companies provide roadside fuel and repair services along the space highway. These are but two examples of the broad portfolio of technology programs NASA is implementing in space. Many other technologies are in development, spanning such diverse areas as human-robotic systems, radiation protection, high-reliability life-support systems, and advanced in-space manufacturing. NASA structural engineers are developing large-scale composite cryogenic propellant tank technology, which offers a 30 percent mass reduction relative to current metallic tanks and has broad applicability to future incarnations of our launch vehicle fleet, in-space propellant stages and planetary landers. Similarly, inflatable aerodynamic decelerator testing may change the way we land large payloads on Mars or return vehicles from space to the Earth’s surface. NASA propulsion experts are pursuing in-space cryogenic propellant storage and transfer technologies to demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility in orbital operations needed for our future deep-space missions. And through autonomous operation and formation flying demonstrations, small-satellite development efforts are poised to provide future space reconnaissance, communication and observing capabilities only possible today with the cost and complexity of large, flagship missions. NASA just announced selection of three technology demonstration missions that will transform our nation’s space communications, deep-space navigation and in-space propulsion capabilities. These missions will develop and fly a space-based optical communications system, a deep-space atomic clock and a space solar sail. With data rates up to 100 times greater than today’s systems, space optical communication will enable rapid return of the voluminous data associated with sending spacecraft and humans to new frontiers. High-performance atomic clocks, 10 times more accurate than today’s systems, will enable a level of spacecraft navigation precision and autonomous operations in deep space never before achieved. And a solar sail that is seven times larger than any sail ever before flown in space, four times larger than what can be tested in ground-based facilities, will enable new space missions. An advanced space weather warning system capable of providing more timely and accurate notice of solar flare activity, approaches for economical orbital debris removal, and propellant-less deep-space science and cargo resupply systems are but a few of the missions solar sails could enable. Combined with the early stage innovation awards recently announced through the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts and Space Technology Graduate Fellowship programs, as well as the laboratory and ground-based testing moving forward through the Game Changing Development program, NASA’s space technology maturation pipeline is taking the ideas of our nation’s innovators from concept to flight. Today, there are space technology projects in development across all of NASA’s centers, academia and industry. These innovations position the agency for a bright future. Innovating a better future is what this country is all about. We are a nation of explorers. We are a nation never satisfied with the status quo. We are a nation continually striving to out-innovate ourselves in the creation of new knowledge and new capabilities. While facing significant fiscal challenges, we are a nation that remains full of opportunity. When I look at NASA, these are the same characteristics I see. These also are the characteristics required for success in the 21st century. It is for these reasons that I remain convinced that a NASA focused on grand challenges and operating at the cutting edge is not only critical for our nation’s future in space, but also for our nation’s technological leadership position in the world.<br />

Prizes have significant limitations. In most circumstances, they should not be the policy instrument of choice for science and technology. Since only winning teams receive prizes, and only after they have won, all entrants must have or raise the funds necessary to compete. Most researchers and small and medium-sized companies find it difficult to self-finance or raise external funding. For example, offering a prize for a breakthrough in high-energy physics would not work if it required physicists to raise billions of dollawrs to build a new particle accelerator. Furthermore, it may be impossible to clearly specify in advance what the victory conditions are, since the outcomes of fundamental research are, by definition, unknowable or difficult to quantify in advance. Many of the most interesting discoveries in science are serendipitous. Even when the goals of a prize are generally understood, it may be difficult to develop appropriately specific proxies for those goals, such as an improvement in the price-to-performance ratio of a given technology, or widespread market acceptance. Finally, prizes are more likely than traditional funding mechanisms to lead to duplication of effort, although this effect can be mitigated through careful program design (Newell and Wilson 2005).<br />

The Accounts Chamber says it has identified a possible reason for the spate of costly failures of Russia's space program. It comes following an audit of the books at the state space agency, Roscosmos. ­The Accounts Chamber has been looking into a list of major financial irregularities and misuses of budgetary funds. The chairman of the chamber, Sergey Stepashin, says investigation results are pointing at a direct connection between the embezzlements and recent launch failures. Law enforcement agencies will now be joining the investigation. The inquiries at Roscosmos are a result of a number of mishaps over the last ten months. In December 2010 a Photon-M rocket failed to launch on its mission to place three GLONASS navigation satellites into orbit. The GPS satellites went straight into the Pacific Ocean, making a $1.52 million hole in the Russian budget. In February this year a military satellite also failed to reach orbit. These failures led to the eventual resignation of Roscosmos chief Anatoly Perminov, who was replaced by Vladimir Popovik, first deputy to the defense minister at that time. But the shake-up at Roscosmos did not have the desired effect. In mid-August, another expensive satellite disappeared from Russian radar immediately after its launch. Days after this incident, a Progress space carrier broke up into pieces over the Altai Mountains a mere five minutes into its flight. The space carrier was loaded with more than 2.6 tons of oxygen, fuel, water and food to be delivered to the International Space Station. Roscosmos had to reschedule all its coming launches and called a special commission of experts to examine all the aircraft planned for space missions. The inquiry into the agency’s affairs has been going on since 2010’s incidents with officials within Roscosmos itself admitting more control should be taken over its finances to prevent further launch failures.<br />

 <strong>Tax incentives fail— Not enough, too high risk and private wont invest</strong><br />
<strong>The Space Review, 2005</strong><br />
[ “Tax policy and space commercialization”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1024:http://www.thespacereview.com/article/300/1 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/300/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/300/1</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1024 --> 10-5]<br />
The idea behind both proposals, of course, is to encourage private funding of space startups by giving investors an immediate reward for putting up their money, regardless if the startup eventually succeeds or fails. This reward, then, would convince otherwise recalcitrant investors to pony up, know that even if they lose their money, they still got a tax credit out of it. I’ve even seen some commentators take tax policy and space to extremes: on the Space Politics weblog last week one person claimed that the proposals by liberals to roll back President Bush’s tax cuts for the wealthy, including those like Paul Allen who have already invested in space ventures, meant that the “far left is not only against public space travel, but the private kind as well.” Extreme claims like that, as you might imagine, can be easily dismissed. If we go back to the late 1990s, before the Bush tax cuts and when (horrors!) a Democrat was in the White House, there was still money flowing into private space ventures. Indeed, the mid to late 90s was the peak of a space boom, as wealthy people like Walt Anderson, Andrew Beal, Bill Gates, and Craig McCaw invested tens, even hundreds, of millions of dollars in companies like Beal Aerospace, Rotary Rocket, and Teledesic. These ventures all failed. One can make the case that even if tax reform magically allowed these people to double or triple their investment, these companies would have still failed because of changes in the market (notably, the telecom bust) or other fundamental flaws in their business plans. But what about more targeted tax incentives, like Calvert’s and Rohrabacher’s proposals? Well, even without those tax credits, there still has been considerable investment in space startups. Allen reportedly put up about $25 million to develop SpaceShipOne, and now Richard Branson plans to spend up to $100 million to develop a commercial successor. Jeff Bezos has put some fraction of his Amazon.com billions into his secretive space startup, Blue Origin, while Elon Musk has reportedly invested tens of millions of his own money into SpaceX. John Carmack has spent a lesser, but still significant, sum on Armadillo Aerospace. That’s great, but proponents of tax credits will argue that these incentives will encourage more people to invest in space companies. There are certainly other worthy companies out there to invest in, but are there really people sitting on the sidelines waiting for tax credits to take the plunge? My gut feeling is that such credits won’t help much. Why am I so negative? I believe that, credits or not, space transportation and related companies just aren’t that attractive from the standpoint of typical investors, particularly large institutional investors. Such investors are looking for companies that quickly—on the order of just a few years—grow and thrive, or at least do well enough to provide investors with an exit strategy in the form of an acquisition or IPO. Major investors know that most of the companies they invest in may fail, but they hope to have one or two “home runs” that will more than make up for their failures (in much the same way Boston Red Sox fans remember infielder Mark Bellhorn for his game-winning home run in Game 1 of the 2004 World Series, not for leading the American League in strikeouts the same season.) Credits or not, space transportation and related companies just aren’t that attractive from the standpoint of typical investors, particularly large institutional investors. Using those criteria, space ventures don’t look that appealing. For one, they have long gestation periods. As an example, look at Virgin Galactic, Branson’s space tourism venture. Branson announced his investment in 2004, but it will be at least 2007 before the company will have a chance of recording any revenue. Worse, that’s with the vehicle technology the company needs already having been developed and tested—in the form of SpaceShipOne—over the course of several years. Those kinds of timelines would try the patience of most investors, given the plethora of other opportunities that could pay off in a much shorter time period. Second, commercial space is still a small market. When telecommunications ventures that just happen to use satellites (like satellite TV providers) are eliminated, the space industry looks remarkably small: just $37 billion in 2002 revenues, or less than a single quarter’s revenue for GM. (See “What is the ‘space industry’?”, The Space Review, July 14, 2003) Most of that is tied up in what one might call “legacy” space applications: the manufacture and launch of big communications satellites, a field where there’s plenty of competition and little chance for a startup to have much success. Even space tourism, touted by the alt.space community as the savior for commercial space, looks tiny: the Futron study shows tourism won’t get above a billion dollars a year in revenues until the end of the next decade. That’s not a lot of money to chase after in the big picture. Tax credits are based on the premise that the business plans for space transportation or other space startups can almost close, and the existence of the credits will be enough of an incentive for dispassionate investors to take the plunge. But, as shown above, space doesn’t look that enticing: the potential payoffs are small and will take years to develop. There are also all the risks associated with any high-tech startup, from technologies to markets, that a venture has to overcome to make its investors any money. Given those obstacles, it’s tough to see tax credits as enough of a carrot to get investors off the sidelines.<br />

 <strong>There is no alternative to capitalism – Any attempt to move away from the system is doomed to fail</strong><br />

Socialism is the Big Lie of the twentieth century. While it promised prosperity, equality, and security, it delivered poverty, misery, and tyranny. Equality was achieved only in the sense that everyone was equal in his or her misery. In the same way that a Ponzi scheme or chain letter initially succeeds but eventually collapses, socialism may show early signs of success. But any accomplishments quickly fade as the fundamental deficiencies of central planning emerge. It is the initial illusion of success that gives government intervention its pernicious, seductive appeal. In the long run, socialism has always proven to be a formula for tyranny and misery. A pyramid scheme is ultimately unsustainable because it is based on faulty principles. Likewise, collectivism is unsustainable in the long run because it is a flawed theory. Socialism does not work because it is not consistent with fundamental principles of human behavior. The failure of socialism in countries around the world can be traced to one critical defect: it is a system that ignores incentives. In a capitalist economy, incentives are of the utmost importance. Market prices, the profit-and-loss system of accounting, and private property rights provide an efficient, interrelated system of incentives to guide and direct economic behavior. Capitalism is based on the theory that incentives matter! Under socialism, incentives either play a minimal role or are ignored totally. A centrally planned economy without market prices or profits, where property is owned by the state, is a system without an effective incentive mechanism to direct economic activity. By failing to emphasize incentives, socialism is a theory inconsistent with human nature and is therefore doomed to fail. Socialism is based on the theory that incentives don’t matter! In a radio debate several months ago with a Marxist professor from the University of Minnesota, I pointed out the obvious failures of socialism around the world in Cuba, Eastern Europe, and China. At the time of our debate, Haitian refugees were risking their lives trying to get to Florida in homemade boats. Why was it, I asked him, that people were fleeing Haiti and traveling almost 500 miles by ocean to get to the “evil capitalist empire” when they were only 50 miles from the “workers’ paradise” of Cuba? The Marxist admitted that many “socialist” countries around the world were failing. However, according to him, the reason for failure is not that socialism is deficient, but that the socialist economies are not practicing “pure” socialism. The perfect version of socialism would work; it is just the imperfect socialism that doesn’t work. Marxists like to compare a theoretically perfect version of socialism with practical, imperfect capitalism which allows them to claim that socialism is superior to capitalism. If perfection really were an available option, the choice of economic and political systems would be irrelevant. In a world with perfect beings and infinite abundance, any economic or political system–socialism, capitalism, fascism, or communism–would work perfectly. However, the choice of economic and political institutions is crucial in an imperfect universe with imperfect beings and limited resources. In a world of scarcity it is essential for an economic system to be based on a clear incentive structure to promote economic efficiency. The real choice we face is between imperfect capitalism and imperfect socialism. Given that choice, the evidence of history overwhelmingly favors capitalism as the greatest wealth-producing economic system available. The strength of capitalism can be attributed to an incentive structure based upon the three Ps: (1) prices determined by market forces, (2) a profit-and-loss system of accounting and (3) private property rights. The failure of socialism can be traced to its neglect of these three incentive-enhancing components. HE Continues…The temptress of socialism is constantly luring us with the offer: “give up a little of your freedom and I will give you a little more security.” As the experience of this century has demonstrated, the bargain is tempting but never pays off. We end up losing both our freedom and our security. Programs like socialized medicine, welfare, social security, and minimum wage laws will continue to entice us because on the surface they appear to be expedient and beneficial. Those programs, like all socialist programs, will fail in the long run regardless of initial appearances. These programs are part of the Big Lie of socialism because they ignore the important role of incentives. Socialism will remain a constant temptation. We must be vigilant in our fight against socialism not only around the globe but also here in the United States. The failure of socialism inspired a worldwide renaissance of freedom and liberty. For the first time in the history of the world, the day is coming very soon when a majority of the people in the world will live in free societies or societies rapidly moving towards freedom. Capitalism will play a major role in the global revival of liberty and prosperity because it nurtures the human spirit, inspires human creativity, and promotes the spirit of enterprise. By providing a powerful system of incentives that promote thrift, hard work, and efficiency, capitalism creates wealth. The main difference between capitalism and socialism is this: Capitalism works.<br />

If you think about it, this hysteria is astonishing, even terrifying. The market economy has created unfathomable prosperity and, decade by decade, for centuries and centuries, miraculous feats of innovation, production, distribution, and social coordination.<br />
To the free market, we owe all material prosperity, all our leisure time, our health and longevity, our huge and growing population, nearly everything we call life itself. Capitalism and capitalism alone has rescued the human race from degrading poverty, rampant sickness, and early death. In the absence of the capitalist economy, and all its underlying institutions, the world’s population would, over time, shrink to a fraction of its current size, in a holocaust of unimaginable scale, and whatever remained of the human race would be systematically reduced to subsistence, eating only what can be hunted or gathered. And this is only to mention its economic benefits. Capitalism is also an expression of freedom. It is not so much a social system but the de facto result in a society where individual rights are respected, where businesses, families, and every form of association are permitted to flourish in the absence of coercion, theft, war, and aggression. Capitalism protects the weak against the strong, granting choice and opportunity to the masses who once had no choice but to live in a state of dependency on the politically connected and their enforcers. The high value placed on women, children, the disabled, and the aged— unknown in the ancient world—owes so much to capitalism’s productivity and distribution of power. Must we compare the record of capitalism with that of the state, which, looking at the sweep of this past century alone, has killed hundreds of millions of people in wars, famines, camps, and deliberate starvation campaigns? And the record of central planning of the type now being urged on American enterprise is perfectly abysmal.<br />

Whatever the specifics of the case in question, socialism always means overriding the free decisions of individuals and replacing that capacity for decision making with an overarching plan by the state. Taken far enough, this mode of thought won’t just spell an end to opulent lunches. It will mean the end of what we all know as civilization itself. It would plunge us back to a primitive state of existence, living off hunting and gathering in a world with little art, music, leisure, or charity. Nor is any form of socialism capable of providing for the needs of the world’s six billion people, so the population would shrink dramatically and quickly and in a manner that would make every human horror ever known seem mild by comparison. Nor is it possible to divorce socialism from totalitarianism, because if you are serious about ending private ownership of the means of production, you have to be serious about ending freedom and creativity too. You will have to make the whole of society, or what is left of it, into a prison. In short, the wish for socialism is a wish for unparalleled human evil. If we really understood this, no one would express casual support for it in polite company. It would be like saying, you know, there is really something to be said for malaria and typhoid and dropping atom bombs on millions of innocents.<br />

Centralization and capitalism are necessary for any intelligent civilization, yet in excess drains the base population of any sustenance whatsoever, leaving them unemployed, homeless and starving at worst. The answer to this event is not a swing on the pendulum all the way onto total equality fisted socialism out on a plate for everyone who isn’t rich, that would be devastating for organization, but is a more natural ecosystem type of financing of a near-barter economics with different values and currencies for localized entities and more buoyant monetary for inter-localities – only monetizing where absolutely necessary. Without the higher economics that goes beyond small barter communities, there could be no space programs, or planetary defences providing the technology or the organization necessary to survive extinction events or fund a military etc, it’s critical for the structure of the super-organism – yet too much and some individuals inside of it become so padded from outside reality that they completely ignore the world around them. Centralization is pseudo gravity of the political variant, it sucks everything down into a point, and through this it creates a civilization, a planet of its own amidst a world of other civilizations all coalescing out of species of life at a specific evolutionary capacity. Global modern day capitalism, in its most destructive phase, is made out of a ‘substance’ that cannot overcome itself to produce wealth through its centralization, as far as it has gone now. But it is possible, if many ‘planets’ ‘stars’ or everything that makes up a wealthy locality all evolve to revolve around a central core, then this will produce a kind of ‘active centralization’ where the dead and cold rock of debt is stripped apart of its structure and is made into pure wealth, pure value and then jetted out of the core of civilization, thereby producing wealth on a higher niche via fusing the negative debt with the unseen gravity of its social environment. Evolution is at a somewhat constant rate and afflicts every gene and meme in existence at varying energies, if we don’t adapt to our environment then we will be at the mercy of the ourselves alone, likewise if we don’t adapt ourselves we will be at the mercy of our environment alone. Although good for some, for the future it is severely disabling and cannot allow for space exploration. Capitalism, like every theory, is memes, therefore it can be improved by alternating the frequencies and wavelengths of its usage, it can be evolved to be more collective, to refertilize the environment so that individuals can once again contribute back into the centralization instead of a ‘once in a civilization opportunity’ where we have one big boom and the rest is dumped in the toilet for the peasants to feast. Like these active galaxies, absorb that which gets too centralized and jet it out as high energy wealth across the void of space, this jet then crushes the inert clouds, or communities, around it into fusing stars of their own. Modern capitalism needs a black hole at its centre, therefore the individuals at the core of its centrifuge will be spaghetified and will have their organizations and corporations torn apart into sub atomic values that then are then fused into exotic wealth able to drive civilization into space and into creating new homes on distant planets for our species. The centralization, combined with its spin, acts as a funnel to the higher castes of society that are then able to create beyond themselves enough that we can produce strong civilizations, culture, technology and mechanization. So remember you shit eating socialists, don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater or your people will not have an intelligent future at all, regressing into your economic swamps is not a viable solution.<br />

 <strong>FRONTIER IDENTITY IS KEY TO HEGEMONY – AMERICA IS FOUNDED ON EXPANSIONIST IDEOLOGY.</strong><br />
Bradley A. <strong>THAYER</strong>, Associate Professor in the Department of Defense and Strategic Studies at Missouri State University, <strong>2007</strong><br />
[&quot;The Case For The American Empire,&quot; American Empire: A Debate, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415952034, p. 7-12]<br />
If the United States is an empire, why is it one? After all, the United States could retreat into isolationism. Instead, it chooses to be an empire. In order to comprehend why, you have to understand the political motivation or political spirit of the American Revolution of 1776. I argue that when you understand the spirit of the American Revolution, you understand why the United States is an empire. The expansion of the United States was what the Founding Fathers wanted for their country—the expansion of its territory and its ideas. But like most critically important topics, people can disagree over this. Americans should disagree about what America’s interests are, not in 1776, but today. In essence, the heart of the debate in this book is whether this vision, the spirit that animates the American Empire, is the right one for the United States today. I strongly believe it is. Christopher Layne, equally strongly, believes it is not. People—and Americans in particular—should think through the central issue considered in this book and make their own judgments about the value and costs of the American Empire. The political spirit of the American Empire predates 1776, before the United States was even a country. In fact, the spirit of the American Empire helped to create the American Revolution. The desire to spread the creed or ideology of America has animated the politics and political figures in the [end page 7] United States from the earliest days. Consider the impassioned speeches of Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson or the writings of James Madison, Thomas Paine, and George Washington. “However unimportant America may be considered at present,” Washington wrote to the Marquis de LaFayette in 1786, “and however Britain may affect to despise her trade, there will assuredly come a day, when this country will have some weight in the scale of Empires.”6 Throughout his presidency, Jefferson declared that the United States was “an empire for liberty” and described it as “a chosen country” and a “rising nation” that was already “advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of the mortal eye.”7 In 1809, he wrote to James Madison that it was the genius of the American government that would permit “such an empire for liberty as she has never surveyed since the creation; and I am persuaded no constitution was ever before so well calculated as ours for extensive empire and self-government.”8 If you really want to understand the American Revolution—the motivation of the Founding Fathers—you also have to turn to the writings of Thomas Paine. As he did so often, Paine summarized the political spirit of the American Revolution: “From a small spark, kindled in America, a flame has arisen, not to be extinguished. Without consuming.. .it winds its progress from nation to nation, and conquers by a silent operation,” and when men know their rights they are free, and despotism is destroyed because “the strength and powers of despotism consist wholly in the fear of resisting it.”9 For America’s Founding Fathers, Paine’s view was common. In addition, they believed that the United States had a responsibility to spread its values and institutions in a world dominated by antiliberal forces, principally monarchy and its guiding principle, the Divine Right of Kings—the belief that God had chosen certain people to rule over others in His name. For the Founding Fathers, the world was in great need of the enlightenment provided by republican government. They would not have questioned either the superiority of American ideals or the flow of the tide of history in the direction of their universal application. And very few would have questioned the legitimacy of spreading America’s values around the globe. That was the mission of the United States of America. The spread of the flame of the American ideology through Paine’s “silent operation” has often been effective, but relying on it has never been sufficient to destroy those deemed despots by American leaders. The United States, like many other empires, has depended on hard power and soft power to realize the expansion of its influence. This spirit of the American Revolution meant that the United States has wanted to expand its influence since before its birth in 1776—and actually even before its birth it tried to do so. The expansion of its influence came in two forms. First was its territorial expansion, and the United States satisfied its appetite by 1900. The second was its expansion through the influence of its ideology [end page 8] Although it is as old as the desire for territorial expansion, the prodigious appetite of the United States for ideological expansion has never been satisfied. Few Americans recall how hungry for territory their country was in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Indeed, even before it had declared its independence—while it was still in the womb—it coveted Canada and attempted to seize it. In 1775, Congressional President John Hancock ordered General Philip Schuyler to conquer Montreal.’° This failed, as did many subsequent attempts. The rapidity of the expansion of the United States from thirteen colonies in 1776 to the status of a hegemon some two hundred years later is startling.” It really is remarkable, and too few Americans reflect on it. Think about this point for a minute. In about a person’s lifespan the United States came to dominate the North American continent. The country more than doubled its size with the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 not even thirty years after its founding. By 1819, it had added Florida to its territory. About seventy years after its creation, it had gained the independent Republic of Texas and all of the West. Or perhaps more accurately, reacquired Texas, since some historians think it was included in the Louisiana Purchase, but John Quincy Adams gave much of it away when he negotiated the United States border with Spain. When the United States was about ninety years old, it almost doubled its size with the purchase of Alaska from Russia. A large part of the explanation for this expansion lies with the recognition that the United States has long had the dream of empire, and now that has been fulfilled.’2 Its expansion and rise to its present status in international politics was made possible by a desire to expand and share its values in the world. John Quincy Adams captured this force well when, in 1819, as secretary of state to President James Monroe, he wrote that it was the “proper dominion” of the United States to possess all of North America including what is now Mexico and Canada, from “the time when we became an independent people it was as much a law of nature that this should become our pretension as that the Mississippi should flow to the sea.”3 Of course, the desire to expand was not solely the passion of Yankees but was shared below the Mason—Dixon Line. The Confederate States of America had aspirations to conquer the Caribbean and much of Latin America once the war was over, and I wonder if the Confederate States of America would have realized their ambition had positions been reversed at Appomattox in 1865. The rise of the United States to hegemonic status would not surprise many of the Founding Fathers or other observers such as the preeminent economist Adam Smith and the great political commentator Alexis de Tocqueville. In 1776, Smith wrote “From shopkeepers, tradesmen, and attornies [sic],” the American colonists have become “statesmen and legislators, and are employed in contriving a new form of government for an extensive empire, which, they flatter themselves, will become, and which, indeed, seems very likely to become, One of the greatest and most formidable that ever was in the world.”4 In 1846, [end page 9] Tocqueville wrote of the United States and Russia that they “have grown in obscurity, and while the world’s attention was occupied elsewhere, they have suddenly taken their place among the leading nations, making the world take note of their birth and of their greatness almost at the same instant.” And while Tocqueville admitted significant differences between the two countries, he saw presciently that “each seems called by some secret design of Providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of half the world.”5 Tocqueville’s vision would be realized, but it took time for America’s capabilities to match its ambitions. And it took a Civil War. The United States endured great vulnerability and dangerous adversity in its early years, including the Civil War, which ensured that the United States could become a great power. It could do so because it would remain united and thus more powerful than two United States—north and south—who would struggle against each other and be used by European great powers to advance their own ends in North and South America. The second reason the Civil War was important for the rise of the United States was that it confirmed the power of a federal government that could harness and organize the great resources of the country efficiently—infinitely better than fifty state governments attempting to do the same thing. Of course, the political spirit of the Revolution did not completely account for the speed of American expansion. One general point deserves to be made. And that is that, frankly, in its history, the United States has been (and remains) an extremely lucky country. Its geography is lucky. It was far enough away from Europe to make the projection of military power to North American difficult, as British King George III found out to his chagrin. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are formidable moats that America’s enemies have found very difficult to cross. In addition to its geographical good luck, two other elements were present. The United States was blessed with weak neighbors, such as Mexico, which were not able to prevent its expansion. Second, only European great powers possessed the ability to arrest American expansion, but they did not because of the threat of war in Europe or the distractions of maintaining their empires. Sometimes European powers even supported American expansion. Britain backed Jefferson’s Louisiana Purchase in order to ensure that French power was removed from the North American continent. Expansion by the weak United States was acceptble to London, but France was a formidable military power. French territory in North America was a threat to British interests. It could have become a base to reconquer the great expanse of North America that it lost to Britain at the conclusion of the Seven Years’ War in 1763. However, most frequently, the United States expanded while countries such as France and Great Britain were occupied with European concerns. Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the fear—rightly held by America’s early presidents—that European powers would block the expansion of the [end page 10] United States to the west, or even use their territory in North America to move against the United States when events in Europe were stable enough to allow them to act. Britain was the biggest concern and, occasionally, the United States acted to preempt British territorial conquest. Today, few Americans realize that Monterey—the premier California port at the time—was seized by the U.S. Navy in 1842, four years before the start of Mexican—American War, due to reports that a strong British force had sailed from Chile and that war had started between the United States and Mexico, and that Britain would seize the port first and occupy California in the name of protecting Mexico. After a short occupation, Monterey was returned to Mexican authorities. Of course, the U.S. Navy would be back in four years—this time to stay. In the meantime, the United States initiated what today we would call a covert action campaign to encourage the residents of California to rebel against Mexico and declare their independence. Here the United States was following the precedent it set in Texas a decade earlier. In fact, U.S. agents distributed copies of the Texas Constitution to encourage Californians to declare independence, at which time the United States could intervene. To advance this objective, explorer John Frémont and his fifty well-armed men not only scouted Mexican territory, as the history books record, but also attempted to encourage rebellion, combat British influence, and contact American agents in the territory. However, these actions did not have much success before Congress declared war on Mexico in 1846. So, when we reflect on the history of America’s foreign relations and the motives of the Founding Fathers and those statesmen who followed in their path, we realize that it is a false dilemma to believe that the history of American foreign relations was wholly internationalist or absolutely isolationist. As the eminent historian Felix Gilbert wrote of the Founders’ foreign policy ideas: “American foreign policy was idealistic and internationalist no less than isolationist” and often existed side by side.16 Those who look for absolute consistency in the foreign policy ideas of the Founding Fathers are bound to be disappointed. Some were isolationists. Some were expansionists. Most, however, were realists par excellence, swinging from isolationism to internationalism with ease, with no concern for consistency, only, for the interests of the United States. However, the great majority of the Founding Fathers, if not all, saw the United States as a special country, whose founding and ideals were like no other, and whose mission was to share its ideology with other peoples. To discover the spirit that animated them, simply look at the Great Seal of the United States on the back of the dollar bill. The mottos on the seal of the United States are Annuit coeptis (God has blessed this undertaking) and Novus Ordo Seculorum (A New Order for the Ages), and these truly capture the spirit of America’s founding and mission. The Founding Fathers did believe that they had created a special country, an empire of liberty, whose benefits should be shared by the [end page 11] rest of the world and, in turn, whose existence threatened despotic regimes and was threatened by them.<br />

 <strong>Their argument is moral evasion – consequentialist decision-making is absolutely necessary, it shows a respect for life, and it doesn’t treat individuals as a means to an end. (we apologize for the gendered language in this evidence.)</strong><br />

[“Against Moral Conservatism,” Ethics, Volume 82, Number 3, April, p. 228-230]<br />
Forget the levity of the example and consider the case of the innocent fat man. If there really is no other way of unsticking our fat man and if plainly, without blasting him out, everyone in the cave will drown, then, innocent or not, he should be blasted out. This indeed overrides the principle that the innocent should never be deliberately killed, but it does not reveal a callousness toward life, for the people involved are caught in a desperate situation in which, if such extreme action is not taken, many lives will be lost and far greater misery will obtain. Moreover, the people who do such a horrible thing or acquiesce in the doing of it are not likely to be rendered more callous about human life and human suffering as a result. Its occurrence will haunt them for the rest of their lives and is as likely as not to make them more rather than less morally sensitive. It is not even correct to say that such a desperate act shows a lack of respect for persons. We are not treating the fat man merely as a means. The fat man’s person – his interests and rights – are not ignored. Killing him is something which is undertaken with the greatest reluctance. It is only when it is quite certain that there is no other way to save the lives of the others that such a violent course of action is justifiably undertaken. Alan Donagan, arguing rather as Anscombe argues, maintains that “to use any innocent man ill for the sake of some public good is directly to degrade him to being a mere means” and to do this is of course to violate a principle essential to morality, that is, that human beings should never merely be treated as means but should be treated as ends in themselves (as persons worthy of respect). 11 But, as my above remarks show, it need not be the case, and in the above situation it is not the case, that in killing such an innocent man we are treating him merely as a means. The action is universalizable, all alternative actions which would save his life are duly considered, the blasting out is done only as a last and desperate resort with the minimum of harshness and indifference to his suffering and the like. It indeed sounds ironical to talk this way, given what is done to him. But if such a terrible situation were to arise, there would always be more or less humane ways of going about one’s grim task. And in acting in the more humane way toward the fat man, as we do what we must do and would have done to ourselves were the roles reversed, we show a respect for his person. 12 In so treating the fat man – not just to further the public good but to prevent the certain death of a whole group of people (that is to prevent an even greater evil than his being killed in this way) – the claims of justice are not overridden either, for each individual involved, if he is reasoning correctly, should realize that if he were so stuck rather than the fat man, he should in such situations be blasted out. Thus, there is no question of being unfair. Surely we must choose between evils here, but is there anything more reasonable, more morally appropriate, than choosing the lesser evil when doing or allowing some evil cannot be avoided? That is, where there is no avoiding both and where our actions can determine whether a greater or lesser evil obtains, should we not plainly always opt for the lesser evil? And is it not obviously a greater evil that all those other innocent people should suffer and die than that the fat man should suffer and die? Blowing up the fat man is indeed monstrous. But letting him remain stuck while the whole group drowns is still more monstrous. The consequentialist is on strong moral ground here, and, if his reflective moral convictions do not square either with certain unrehearsed or with certain reflective particular moral convictions of human beings, so much the worse for such commonsense moral convictions. One could even usefully and relevantly adapt here – though for a quite different purpose – an argument of Donagan’s. Consequentialism of the kind I have been arguing for provides so persuasive “a theoretical basis for common morality that when it contradicts some moral intuition, it is natural to suspect that intuition, not theory, is corrupt.” 13 Given the comprehensiveness, plausibility, and overall rationality of consequentialism, it is not unreasonable to override even a deeply felt moral conviction if it does not square with such a theory, though, if it made no sense to overrode the bulk of or even a great many of our considered moral convictions, that would be another matter indeed. Anticonsequentialists often point to the inhumanity of people who will sanction such killing of the innocent, but cannot the compliment be returned by speaking of the greater inhumanity, conjoined with evasiveness, of those who will allow even more death and far greater misery and then excuse themselves on the ground that they did not intend the death and misery but merely forbore to prevent it? In such a context, such reasoning and such forbearing to prevent seems to me to constitute a moral evasion. I say it is evasive because rather than steeling himself to do what in normal circumstances would be a horrible and vile act but in this circumstance is a harsh moral necessity, he allows, when he has the power to prevent it, a situation which is still many times worse. He tries to keep his ‘moral purity’ and avoid ‘dirty hands’ at the price of utter moral failure and what Kirkegaard called ‘double-mindedness.’ It is understandable that people should act in this morally evasive way but this does not make it right.<br />

<strong>Instrumental scientific rationality is a prerequisite for subverting arbitrary authority and fostering political equality – verification and falsifiability are key to effective resistance.</strong><br />

Much has been written about the need for a “new science” no longer defined by instrumental rationality and incapable of reifying the world. But these new undertakings always seem to ignore the need for criteria of verification or falsification; science without such criteria is, however, no science at all. Contempt for “instrumental” scientific rationality, moreover, undermines the possibility of meaningful dialogue between the humanities and the sciences. And that is a matter of crucial importance: popular debates are now taking place on issues ranging from the eco-system to cloning, the assumptions of western medicine to the possibilities of acupuncture, using animals for experiments to state support for space travel. This shows ethical progress, again perhaps not in the sense that people have become more “moral,” but surely in the sense that more questions of everyday life have become open to moral debate. Science has not eroded ethics. The Frankfurt School misjudged the impact of science from the beginning. It is still the case that the science plays a crucial role in subverting religious authority, and fostering political equality by enabling each to judge the veracity of truth claims. There is also nothing exaggerated in the claim [end page 159] that “the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century was perhaps the single greatest influence on the development of the idea that political resistance is a legitimate act.”6<br />

So-called “methodological” kritiks have also become fashionable recently. Such positions are not, on face, illegitimate; there is nothing wrong with arguing that traditional methods of proof (science, empiricism, expert testimony, for example) are defective and that alternative modes of argument (personal narratives, irony, poetry, etc.) are superior. I expect that if the merits of the more traditional and the more innovative modes of argument are debated out in a rigorous way that the more mainstream approaches will prevail. But that seems like a debate worth having; my main complaint is that it has not thus far occurred in an at all sophisticated way. That said, it is still worth noting that the focus on methodology can be overdone. (It is, after all, the quintessence of “instrumental rationality.”) Most methods have some merit; most modes of proof have some probative value. The real question is just how much weight they should carry in a given context. And it should also be remembered that method is not an end in itself. Rather, it is a means to reaching other conclusions. After the debate over method, one must still apply the available methods to the issue at hand.<br />

<strong>The plan is not mutually exclusive with the alternative.

To conclude this chapter, while modernist and postmodernist debates continue, while we are still unsure as to what we can legitimately identify as a feminist ethical/political concern, while we still are unclear about the relationship of discourse and experience, it is particularly important for feminists that we proceed with analysis of both the material (institutional and structural) as well as the discursive. This holds not only for feminists, but for all theorists oriented towards the goal of extending further moral inclusion in the present social sciences climate of epistemological uncertainty. Important ethical/political concerns hang in the balance. We cannot afford to wait for the meta-theoretical questions to be conclusively answered. Those answers may be unavailable. Nor can we wait for a credible vision of an alternative institutional order to appear before an emancipatory agenda can be kicked into gear. Nor do we have before us a chicken and egg question of which comes first: sorting out the meta-theoretical issues or working out which practices contribute to a credible institutional vision. The two questions can and should be pursued together, and can be, via moral imagination. Imagination can help us think beyond discursive and material conditions which limit us, by pushing the boundaries of those limitations in though and examining what yields. In this respect, I believe international ethics as pragmatic critique can be a useful ally to feminists and normative theorists generally.<br />

<strong>Falsifiability – questions of ontology are fundamentally irresolvable and do not disprove the desirability of the plan.</strong><br />

Indeed, the things that we assume are those which it is most difficult, if not impossible, to convincingly establish. This is especially true of such basic ontological [end page 45] issues as the existence of an external world, of other minds, and of causal relationships. Because of this, in most cases, the affirmative can neither prove, nor the negative disprove, many of the assumptions at play in a given debate. Nor, in most cases, is this necessary to establish the desirability of the affirmative plan. The chance that an assumption may be true (i.e., causation may exist) will be enough to justify endorsing a certain course of action.<br />

[&quot;Questions concerning Heidegger: Opening the Debate,&quot; Critical Inquiry, Volume 15, Number 2, Winter, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via JSTOR, p. 424-426 ]<br />
I understand Levinas' work to suggest another path to the recovery of the human, one that leads through or toward other human beings: The dimension of the divine opens forth from the human face. . . . Hence metaphysics is enacted where the social relation is enacted—[end page 424] in our relations with men. . . . The Other is not the incarnation of God, but precisely by his face, in which he is disincarnate, is the manifestation of the height in which God is revealed. It is our relations with men . . . that give to theological concepts the sole signification they admit of.35 Levinas places ethics before ontology by beginning with our experience of the human face; and, in a clear reference to Heidegger's idolatry of the village life of peasants, he associates himself with Socrates, who preferred the city where he encountered men to the country with its trees.36 In his discussion of skepticism and the problem of others, Cavell also aligns himself with this path of thought, with the recovery of the finite human self through the acknowledgment of others: As long as God exists, I am not alone. And couldn't the other suffer the fate of God? . . . I wish to understand how the other now bears the weight of God, shows me that I am not alone in the universe. This requires understanding the philosophical problem of the other as the trace or scar of the departure of God. [CR, p. 47013' The suppression of the other, the human, in Heidegger's thought accounts, I believe, for the absence, in his writing after the war, of the experience of horror. Horror is always directed toward the human; every object of horror bears the imprint of the human will.38 So Levinas can see in Heidegger's silence about the gas chambers and death camps &quot;a kind of consent to the horror.&quot;39 And Cavell can characterize Nazis as &quot;those who have lost the capacity for being horrified by what they do.”40 Where was Heidegger's horror? How could he have failed to know what he had consented to? Hannah Arendt associates Heidegger with Pad Valery's aphorism, &quot; 'Les henements ne sent que l'kcume des choses' ('Events are but the foam of things').”41 I think one understands the source of her intuition. The mass [end page 425] extermination of human beings, however, does not produce foam, but dust and ashes; and it is here that questioning must stop<br />

<strong>Turn—their infatuation with ontology is politically debilitating – focusing on ontology divests politics of its emancipatory potential and devolves into a self-justifying cycle of never-ending critique.</strong><br />

Similarly, we must consider the consequences that this 'ontological substitution' for the essence of the political has for politics, in terms of what is practically excluded by this rethinking. If the presently available menu of political engagements and projects (be they market or social liberalism, social democracy, communitarianism, Marxism, etc.) are only so many moments of the techno-social completion of an underlying metaphysics, then the fear of 'metaphysical contamination' inhibits any return to recognisable political practices and sincere engagement with the political exigencies of the day. This is what Nancy Fraser has called the problem of 'dirty hands', the suspension of engagement with the existing content of political agendas because of their identification as being in thrall to the violence of metaphysics. Unable to engage in politics as it is, one either [a] sublimates the desire for politics by retreating to an interrogation of the political with respect to its essence (Fraser, 1984, p. 144), or [b] on this basis, seeks 'to breach the inscription of a wholly other politics'. The former suspends politics indefinitely, while the latter implies a new politics, which, on the basis of its reconceived understanding of the political, apparently excludes much of what recognizably belongs to politics today. This latter difficulty is well known from Arendt's case, whose barring of issues of social and economic justice and welfare from the political domain are well known. To offer two examples: [1] in her commentary on the U.S. civil rights movement in the 1950s, she argued that the politically salient factor which needed challenging was only racial legislation and the formal exclusion of African-Americans from the political sphere, not discrimination, social deprivation and disadvantage, etc.(Arendt, 1959, pp. 45-56); [2] Arendt's pronounceraent at a conference in 1972 (put under question by Albrecht Wellmer regarding her distinction of the 'political' and the 'social'), that housing and homelessness were not political issues, that they were external to the political as the sphere of the actualisation of freedom as disclosure; the political is about human self-disclosure in speech and deed, not about the distribution of goods, which belongs to the social realm as an extension of the oikos.[20] The point here is not that Arendt and others are in any sense unconcerned or indifferent about such sufferings, deprivations and inequalities. Rather, it is that such disputes and agendas are identified as belonging to the socio-technical sphere of administration, calculation, instrumentality, the logic of means and ends, subject-object manipulation by a will which turns the world to its purposes, the conceptual rendering of beings in terms of abstract and levelling categories and classes, and so on; they are thereby part and parcel of the metaphysical-technological understanding of Being, which effaces the unique and singular appearance and disclosure of beings, and thereby illegitimate candidates for consideration under the renewed, ontological-existential formulation of the political. To reconceive the political in terms of a departure from its former incarnation as metaphysical politics, means that the revised terms of a properly political discourse cannot accommodate the prosaic yet urgent questions we might typically identify under the rubric of 'policy'. Questions of social and economic justice are made homeless, exiled from the political sphere of disputation and demand in which they were formerly voiced. Indeed, it might be observed that the postmetaphysical formulation of the political is devoid of any content other than the freedom which defines it; it is freedom to appear, to disclose, but not the freedom to do something in particular, in that utilising freedom for achieving some end or other implies a collapse back into will, instrumentality, teleocracy, poeisis, etc. By defining freedom qua disclosedness as the essence of freedom and the sole end of the political, this position skirts dangerously close to advocating politique pour la politique, divesting politics of any other practical and normative ends in the process.[21]<br />

<strong>Technology is inevitable and good – the way we use technology is up to us – technological thought is needed to determine our technology future.</strong><br />

Essentialist theories of technology define the technical in terms of the primary instrumentalization alone. At that level it seems possible to abstract technology from society, while the secondary instrumentalizations are transparently social, with the exception of some types of systematization. They lie at the intersection of technique and the other action systems with which it is inextricably linked insofar as it is a social enterprise. As a result, socially specific configurations of the secondary instrumentalizations are as variable as the contexts to which technique is integrated, subject to transformations corresponding to distinct eras in the history of technical systems and technical rationalities. For example, a dimension of technology such as vocation may be central to technical life in one era and eliminated as much as possible through deskilling in another. From this anti-essentialist standpoint, our form of modern society cannot be the untranscendable horizon of technical possibilities, defining for modernity in general. But neither can we conceive of a general deglobalization of modern societies, a splitting up of modernity into incommunicable varieties. The shared technical heritage provides what might be called a &quot;practical universality&quot; that has imposed itself on a planetary scale. No modern society can forego basic technical discoveries such as antibiotics, plastics or electricity, and none can withdraw from worldwide communication networks. The cost of an entirely independent path of development is just too high. But both in the advanced and the developing countries, significant innovations are possible with respect to what has been the main line of progress up to now. The terrain of practical universality is accessible from many standpoints for many purposes. It is not a destiny, but the place on which destinies can be worked out. It first emerged in the capitalist West around a particular panoply of technologies and rational systems. These intentionally deemphasized most secondary instrumentalizations with consequences we now experience as cultural homogenization, social anomie and environmental crisis. The threat of technology is due to this particular realization of its potential. This conclusion invites us to consider the possibility of an alternative form of technical rationality that would integrate the secondary instrumentalizations more fully through new concretizations. On this basis, I have argued elsewhere for a reform of modern technology to incorporate workers' skills, human communication, and environmental limits into its very structure (Feenberg, 1991: chap. 8). Similar arguments could be made with respect to the possibility of culturally specific technological configurations (Feenberg, 1995: chap. 9). The scope and significance of such change is potentially enormous. Technical choices establish the horizons of daily life. These choices define a &quot;world&quot; within which the specific alternatives we think of as purposes, goals, uses, emerge. They also define the subject who chooses among the alternatives: we make ourselves in making the world through technology. Thus fundamental technological change is self-referential. At issue is becoming, not having. The goal is to define a way of life, an ideal of abundance, and a human type, not just to obtain more goods in the prevailing socio-economic system. As Terry Winograd argues, technological designing is ontological designing (Winograd and Flores, 1987: 163). Unexpected struggles over issues such as nuclear power, access to experimental treatment for AIDS patients, and user participation in computer design remind us that the technological future is by no means predetermined. To the extent that such struggles spread, we can hope to inhabit a very different future from the one projected by essentialist critique. In that future technology is not a fate one must chose for or against, but a challenge to political and social creativity.<br />

President Obama has appointed some distinguished academic economists and lawyers to his administration, but few high-ranking political scientists have been named. In fact, the editors of a recent poll of more than 2,700 international relations experts declared that &quot;the walls surrounding the ivory tower have never seemed so high.&quot; While important American scholars such as Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski took high-level foreign policy positions in the past, that path has tended to be a one-way street. Not many top-ranked scholars of international relations are going into government, and even fewer return to contribute to academic theory. The 2008 Teaching, Research and International Policy (TRIP) poll, by the Institute for Theory and Practice in International Relations, showed that of the 25 scholars rated as producing the most interesting scholarship during the past five years, only three had ever held policy positions (two in the U.S. government and one in the United Nations). The fault for this growing gap lies not with the government but with the academics. Scholars are paying less attention to questions about how their work relates to the policy world, and in many departments a focus on policy can hurt one's career. Advancement comes faster for those who develop mathematical models, new methodologies or theories expressed in jargon that is unintelligible to policymakers. A survey of articles published over the lifetime of the American Political Science Review found that about one in five dealt with policy prescription or criticism in the first half of the century, while only a handful did so after 1967. Editor Lee Sigelman observed in the journal's centennial issue that &quot;if 'speaking truth to power' and contributing directly to public dialogue about the merits and demerits of various courses of action were still numbered among the functions of the profession, one would not have known it from leafing through its leading journal.&quot; As citizens, academics might be considered to have an obligation to help improve on policy ideas when they can. Moreover, such engagement can enhance and enrich academic work, and thus the ability of academics to teach the next generation. As former undersecretary of state David Newsom argued a decade ago, &quot;the growing withdrawal of university scholars behind curtains of theory and modeling would not have wider significance if this trend did not raise questions regarding the preparation of new generations and the future influence of the academic community on public and official perceptions of international issues and events. Teachers plant seeds that shape the thinking of each new generation; this is probably the academic world's most lasting contribution.&quot; Yet too often scholars teach theory and methods that are relevant to other academics but not to the majority of the students sitting in the classroom before them. Some academics say that while the growing gap between theory and policy may have costs for policy, it has produced better social science theory, and that this is more important than whether such scholarship is relevant. Also, to some extent, the gap is an inevitable result of the growth and specialization of knowledge. Few people can keep up with their subfields, much less all of social science. But the danger is that academic theorizing will say more and more about less and less. Even when academics supplement their usual trickle-down approach to policy by writing in journals, newspapers or blogs, or by consulting for candidates or public officials, they face many competitors for attention. More than 1,200 think tanks in the United States provide not only ideas but also experts ready to comment or consult at a moment's notice. Some of these new transmission belts serve as translators and additional outlets for academic ideas, but many add a bias provided by their founders and funders. As a group, think tanks are heterogeneous in scope, funding, ideology and location, but universities generally offer a more neutral viewpoint. While pluralism of institutional pathways is good for democracy, the policy process is diminished by the withdrawal of the academic community. The solutions must come via a reappraisal within the academy itself. Departments should give greater weight to real-world relevance and impact in hiring and promoting young scholars. Journals could place greater weight on relevance in evaluating submissions. Studies of specific regions deserve more attention. Universities could facilitate interest in the world by giving junior faculty members greater incentives to participate in it. That should include greater toleration of unpopular policy positions. One could multiply such useful suggestions, but young people should not hold their breath waiting for them to be implemented. If anything, the trends in academic life seem to be headed in the opposite direction.<br />

<strong>Discourse does not shape reality – translation proves that it’s the other way around.</strong><br />
Michelle <strong>Fram-Cohen</strong>, freelance translator and interpreter between Hebrew and English that has published articles on literature, translation theory, and philosophy, <strong>1985</strong><br />
[“Reality, Language, Translation: What Makes Translation Possible,” Paper presented in the American Translators Association Conference, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1031:http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/essays/text/michelleframcohen --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/essays/text/michelleframcohen" rel="nofollow">http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/essays/text/michelleframcohen</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1031 -->//possibilityoftranslation.html, Accessed 01-24-2007 ]<br />
The idea that language is created inside one's mind independently of outside experience eliminates the possibility that the external world is the common source of all languages. But a common source of all languages underlies any attempt to explain the possibility of translation. Chomsky suggests that the common basis of all languages is universal phonetics and semantics, with the result that &quot;certain objects of human thoughts and mentality are essentially invariable across languages.&quot; (13) To the best of my knowledge Chomsky did not develop this idea in the direction of explaining the possibility of translation. In contrast, linguist Eugene Nida insists that outside experience is the common basis of all languages when he writes that &quot;each language is different from all other languages in the ways in which the sets of verbal symbol classify the various elements of experience.&quot; (14) Nida did not provide the philosophical basis of the view that the external world is the common source of all languages. Such a basis can be found in the philosophy of Objectivism, originated by Ayn Rand. Objectivism, as its name implies, upholds the objectivity of reality. This means that reality is independent of consciousness, consciousness being the means of perceiving reality, not of creating it. Rand defines language as &quot;a code of visual-auditory symbols that denote concepts.&quot; (15) These symbols are the written or spoken words of any language. Concepts are defined as the &quot;mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted.&quot; (16) This means that concepts are abstractions of units perceived in reality. Since words denote concepts, words are the symbols of such abstractions; words are the means of representing concepts in a language. Since reality provides the data from which we abstract and form concepts, reality is the source of all words--and of all languages. The very existence of translation demonstrates this fact. If there was no objective reality, there could be no similar concepts expressed in different verbal symbols. There could be no similarity between the content of different languages, and so, no translation. Translation is the transfer of conceptual knowledge from one language into another. It is the transfer of one set of symbols denoting concepts into another set of symbols denoting the same concepts. This process is possible because concepts have specific referents in reality. Even if a certain word and the concept it designates exist in one language but not in another, the referent this word and concept stand for nevertheless exists in reality, and can be referred to in translation by a descriptive phrase or neologism. Language is a means describing reality, and as such can and should expand to include newly discovered or innovated objects in reality. The revival of the ancient Hebrew language in the late 19th Century demonstrated the dependence of language on outward reality. Those who wanted to use Hebrew had to innovate an enormous number of words in order to describe the new objects that did not confront the ancient Hebrew speakers. On the other hand, those objects that existed 2000 years ago could be referred to by the same words. Ancient Hebrew could not by itself provide a sufficient image of modern reality for modern users.<br />

The organizer must be well organized himself so he can be comfortable in a disorganized situation, rational in a sea of irrationalities. It is vital that he be able to work with irrationalities for the purpose of change. With very rare exceptions, the right things are done for the wrong reasons. It is futile to demand that men do the right thing for the right reason - this is a fight with a windmill. The organizer should know and accept that the right reason is only introduced as a moral rationalization after the right end has been achieved, although it may have been achieved for the wrong reason - therefore he should search for and use the wrong reasons to achieve the right goals. He should be able, with skill and calculation, to use irrationality in his attempts to progress toward a rational world.<br />

Affirmative teams are often guilty of not presenting their arguments defending the topic at a resolutional level. In so doing, debaters rely on hasty generalizations and atypical examples of the resolution to justify the affirmative. Under the Spring 1986 resolution, Resolved: That membership in the United Nations is no longer beneficial to the United States, one atypical case might argue that the U.N. General Assembly's rhetoric condemning Israel undermines a staunch American ally. Granted, in this case, the specific example falls within topical bounds by illustrating a singular detrimental effect of the United Nations, but it does not justify the broader scope of the resolution which appears to obligate the affirmative to prove that the whole of the U.N. is no longer advantageous to the United States. The affirmative would be &quot;topical&quot; but would not justify adoption of the resolution as a truth. Without adequate reasons to justify the whole resolution, the affirmative has failed the test of the debate, to prove the probable truth of the whole resolutional hypothesis.<br />

The second implication is that arguments from subset are not prima facie. By this I mean that a part is not on its face logically self-sufficient to prove the whole. Subsets do not necessarily support the larger claim. Tolbert and Hunt (1985) argue that: An area of argumentation related to hasty generalization is &quot;topical justification.&quot; Topical justification suggests that should an affirmative present and win an example of the resolution, it still might not prove the resolution true. Rather, the affirmative example only would have been proven to be true and some subcategory of the resolution only might be true. In other words, the case could well be sub-topical (p. 23). This does not mean that examples cannot be used. What it does mean is that &quot;he who asserts&quot; that one can infer the general from a specific example, should be required to prove the reasonability of that inference. Until and unless such proof is offered, a subset should be presumed to be nothing more. How might an advocate establish the reasonability of his/her inference? Biggers (1985) suggested several requirements for advancing a valid inductive argument: The argument consists of evidence (examples from a particular class about which a particular conclusion can be made), a warrant (a statement to the effect that what is true of a sample from the class is also true of the class as a whale), support for the warrant (a belief that the examples in the evidence are germane to the claim, adequate in number and fairly selected), reservations (any instances that reduce our faith in the probability of the can- [end page 11] elusion) and a conclusion (the idea that what is true of the examples is also true of the class as a whole) (Toulmin, 1958). Each element in this chain of reasoning is critical and must be supported if the argument as a whole is to be accepted (p. 33). Biggers continued by noting that &quot;even if the warrant can be supported&quot; in this way that the argument should be defeated if the opposition &quot;offers examples that better meet the criteria outlined above and that support the countergeneralization&quot; (p. 36). That is, once the debater attempts to prove an argument from example, she/he opens the door to the opponent using the same inductive approach to disprove the argument. Hence, if one side utilizes &quot;example analysis,&quot; they legitimize the other side's use of the &quot;counterwarrant.&quot;<br />

Holistic resolutional focus is pedagogically preferable to the parametric approach. Academic debate is a powerful educational tool. In addition to the plethora of other process-based advantages, debaters are forced to learn a great deal substantively about significant contemporary topics in their world (Freeley, 1986). Once we accept that debaters will learn about the topics they debate, we must confront the question &quot;What is it that we want them to learn?&quot; Holistic topic focus promotes a more general education than relatively narrow parametric sub-topics. This stands to reason since the research, preparation, presentation, and analysis of more general arguments is encouraged by a more general focus. The pedagogical question becomes: &quot;Is a general or a specific educational focus pedagogically superior?&quot; Murty (1963) argues that &quot;unless a man is capable of thinking and planning for himself, and unless he is able to rise above the parochialism of his own time, race and society . . . he cannot lead a full and integrated life. General education alone can enable everyone to do this&quot; (p. 44). Murty lists holistic and synthetic thinking as well as recognition of pattern and perspective among the fruits of a general education. This author favors general education for a number of reasons.<br />

5. Reflecting on an ethic of care: the potentialities of human service work and state institutions<br />
The task of understanding and examining state institutions and human service practices has been undertaken in a myriad of ways, and the intimate account of care presented here is just one approach. Care may appear here as a rather simple and overly optimistic entry-point. Yet, in the human service spaces of Families First and SaCC, workers introduced the significance and vitality of care in their everyday negotiations, understandings and actions of human service provision. Too often state institutions and workers have been stabilised as the technical conduits or ‘automata’ through which (neoliberal) governing power is translated ([Larner and Butler, 2007] and [Robertson, 2007]). From such a strongly theorised perspective, the congested spaces and prosaic possibilities of state institutions are muted. The contribution of the intimate, ethnographic approach adopted in this research is an attention to the prosaic performances of state institutions—how policy is engaged by state workers, how governance agendas are understood, and how everyday individual actions, affects, decisions and ethics might shape state institutions and human service practice. It is in ‘mucking around’ in the prosaics of state institutions that everyday and formative practices such as care become difficult to ignore. The people of state institutions, the friendships, respect and trust, the care that they hold for each other and the communities they work with; all these features may exceed our common understandings of state institutions yet are already existing in diverse and formative ways as part of human service practices. As researchers, we too must surely engage in friendships with our colleagues, negotiate the prosaic politics of our workplaces, nurture care in our work practices and relationships, and value the decisive role of genuine and trusting relationships in our work and lives. So in our research we need to question why these energies seem untenable in state institutions, government settings and agency practices and how listening for these everyday energies might help in identifying and supporting effective human service practices. The potential for thinking about and performing state institutions and human service practice are indeed nurtured by the prosaic and hospitable perspectives of this research. Yet, the potentialities I describe undoubtedly arise, in part, from the particular settings and spaces of the research. The human service sector of state institutions has long been associated with policy activism, caring and dedicated workers, overrepresentation of women and commitment to social justice issues ([Watson, 1990], [Nyland, 1998], [Roberts, 2004] and [Larner and Butler, 2007]). Might other state institutions such as environmental agencies express similar energies? In what ways do those enrolled in the finance sectors of government work and interact in personal and ethical ways? How might people who are active in writing policy communicate the diversity, creativity and care innate to their lives? These questions of state institutions excite further research with the capacity to challenge fixed concepts of ‘the state’ and governance through attention to the diversity of people, understandings, affects, activities and ethics that infuse and shape state settings. We cannot expect that other state settings will reveal the same particularities of governing practice but, as Blomley (2005: p. 293) argues, we can expect “that other places will provide equally complex stories”. It is this challenge of re-thinking and re-vitalising state institutions that has been the subject of this paper, through a particular focus on human service agencies and care. I have argued for an everyday and hospitable (Gibson-Graham, 2006) orientation to state institutions; a perspective that widens from the myopic hold of overarching theories of governance to hopeful visions of prosaic human service practice and possibility. This deliberately welcoming and dynamic framing of state institutions provides a foundation to investigate how the diversity of human service practice comes to be and the ways in which these practices may be generative of both new and yet to be nurtured potential. Such an orientation does not necessitate the ‘doing away’ with ongoing debates around neoliberal governance and its interactions with human service practice. Rather it is in placing, activating and personalising state institutions and human service practice that a political-economic rationality, or “commonsense” (Peck and Tickell, 2002: p. 381) such as neoliberalism appears less certain, universal and controlling than we might expect. Moreover practices such as care can be welcomed as vital parts of human service spaces, challenging abstract expectations that such ‘peopled practices’ belong in private spaces rather than those concerned with governance and the political-economic sphere. Expectations and ideological categories soften in the congested spaces of everyday human service practice, disarmed by the interminable fluidities of negotiation, change and contingent political and peopled action. Neoliberal agendas are not always co-opting. Nor are caring practices forever progressive and generous. Care is a complex and multifarious practice, yet one that is ‘at home’ in the spaces of states institutions. Once we are able to think about state institutions in this way, then it is possible to identify potentialities and capture existing opportunities to support the people and caring practices that make ethical, effective and enjoyable human service work possible.<br />

India is hard at work building a series of solar power generation stations that it plans on sending into space to quench the country's ever increasing thirst for energy. “India’s hypersonic air and space transport activity are now sharp focussed on energy production through space solar power by having solar power stations in orbit. The era of expendable launch vehicles should end and reusable launch vehicles (RLV) are needed,” said V.K. Saraswatch, the Defense Research and Development Organization's chief controller.A two-day conference to discuss the best strategies to meet this ambitious objective was held a few weeks ago in which Saraswatch argued that RLVs should be used in concert with a hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HTDV), a fast transport vehicle, to put the stations in orbit. Dr. Gopalaswamy, the former chairman of Bharat Dynamic Ltd. (part of India's ministry of defense), and Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the country's president, were on hand to lend support to the proposed plans. “The era of conventional fuels is ending. The sun’s intensity in space is nearly twice what we feel here on the Earth’s surface. On Earth, there is sunlight fit for power generation for six to eight hours a day. In space, it’s 24 hours. We need to have our own solar power station in orbit. Even if one per cent of our nation’s land area is utilised for solar energy, we could have nearly 1,000 giga watts of electric power. Consider this as the projected demand in 2030 is 400 GW and the current consumption is 120 GW,&quot; said Gopalaswamy, adding that he envisaged possible collaborations with Brazil and South Africa. Although the technology isn't quite there yet, finding a way to directly absorb solar energy from space is a no-brainer. As Gopalaswamy mentioned, the sun's intensity there is almost twice what we get on Earth and, best of all, the energy could be continually harnessed 24 hours a day. If implemented on a wide scale, such a plan would go a long ways towards solving our oil crisis and providing us with a safe, sustainable source of alternative energy. Yet building and sending several large power stations into space is easier said than done: there are countless opportunities for errors to be made, the slightest of which could ruin the mission. We'll be keeping a close eye on India's progress as we approach their demonstration period next year.<br />

The National Science Board (Board) is composed of 25 Presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed Members, including the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF). The Board provides oversight for, and establishes the policies of, NSF within the framework of applicable national policies set forth by the President and the Congress. In this capacity, the Board identifies issues that are critical to NSF’s future, approves NSF’s strategic budget directions, approves annual budget submissions to the Office of Management and Budget, approves new programs and major awards, analyzes NSF’s budget to ensure progress and consistency along the strategic direction set for NSF, and ensures balance between initiatives and core programs. The Board also serves as an independent policy advisory body to the President and Congress on science and engineering research and education issues and has a statutory obligation to “...render to the President and to the Congress reports on specific, individual policy matters related to science and engineering and education in science engineering, as the Board, the President, or the Congress determines the need for such reports.” (42 U.S.C.

<strong>SECOND—THE COUNTERPLAN SOLVES BETTER THAN THE PLAN—THOROUGLY STUDYING THE PROBLEM AREA AND PROPOSED POLICY IDENTIFIED BY THE AFFIRMATIVE BEFORE ENACTING IT IS KEY TO ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE OUTCOME.</strong><br />
Michael W. <strong>SHELTON</strong>, Instructor in Communication and Director of Forensics at Seton Hall University, <strong>1985</strong><br />
[&quot;In Defense Of The Study Counterplan,&quot; Journal of the American Forensic Association, Volume 21, Number 3, Winter, p. 151-152]<br />
According to Mayer (1983), the study counterplan &quot;overestimates the scientist's ability to isolate problems and solutions&quot; (p. 262). He elaborated by noting &quot;there is not necessarily a 'best' answer to a problem&quot; (p. 262). This assumption, that the study counterplan is in the single-minded pursuit of some illusionary &quot;best&quot; solution, is the major flaw with this point of criticism. True, many advocates claim a &quot;best&quot; solution will result from study, but that is not the sole value of the approach. Whether a specific solution—“best” or otherwise—is produced or not, the study counterplan can still be of strategic and practical value. The negative advocate could demonstrate that the affirmative warrant is insufficient to justify adoption of any particular solution. As Patterson and Zarefsky (1983) have noted, advocates &quot;using the study counter-resolution usually feel that not enough is known about the affirmative's problem for any specific action to be undertaken&quot; (p. 219). Identification of one &quot;best&quot; solution is not the only aim of the study approach—[end page 151] confirming the inability to take any specific action is equally important. Representative Pat Williams (1983) has related the value of study to Congressional decision-making: It is only common sense that—before we take action of any kind to attempt to solve this country's problems, before we build up or tear down existing programs, before we create new initiatives—we take a moment to consider carefully the situation confronting us. We need to have access to as much information as possible. We need to hear more than one point of view (p. 72). In other words, it is inherently valuable to seek out information and alternatives before we endorse any particular solution, such as an affirmative plan. This does not mean that we should accept a state of perpetual inaction. Rather, it suggests that action should only be taken following careful, extensive examination and investigation.<br />

T<strong>HIRD—THE COUNTERPLAN IS KEY TO INJECT INDEPENDENT SCIENCE INTO FEDERAL POLICYMAKING—REVERSING THE TREND TOWARD SUPPRESSION OF SCIENCE IS VITAL TO SOLVE THE CASE AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS A MULTITUDE OF OTHER POLICY CHALLENGES.</strong><br />

A strong and sustained U.S. investment in independent science has brought the nation significant economic progress, science-based public policy, and unequaled global scientific leadership. As the country faces extraordinary challenges in the coming years, a robust federal scientific workforce and public trust in government decision making are even more critical. The federal government runs on vast amounts of information, and makes policy decisions every day that affect the health and well-being of all Americans. Although science is rarely the only factor driving public policy, scientific input should always be weighed from an impartial perspective. Unfortunately, numerous independent investigations have documented a pattern of suppression, manipulation, and distortion of federal science before it enters the policy process. Under the outgoing George W. Bush administration, political interference in science has indeed become pervasive. Furthermore, recent changes in the structure of the federal government impair the ability of federal scientists to fulfill their responsibility to serve their agencies and the public interest. Federal scientists find themselves under growing surveillance and control. Administration officials have curtailed public access to scientific information, and subtle systemic changes have sidelined scientists and advisory committees that previously helped inform the policy-making process. In too many cases, these officials have used tainted science to justify misguided policies. The consequences of these practices are profound. Policy makers cannot make informed decisions without access to the best available scientific information. Even worse, the misuse of science threatens our nation’s ability to respond to increasingly complex public health, environmental, and security challenges. Such interference significantly decreases the effectiveness of federal agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency. It risks demoralizing the federal scientific workforce and raises the possibility of lasting harm to the federal scientific enterprise. And it makes our government less accountable to the citizens it is supposed to serve.<br />

In recent years, the United States has been more a source of global instability than a source of global problem-solving. Examples include the war in Iraq, launched by the US on false premises, obstructionism on efforts to curb climate change, meager development assistance and the violation of international treaties such as the Geneva Conventions. While many factors contributed to America’s destabilizing actions, a powerful one is anti-intellectualism, exemplified recently by Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin’s surging popularity. By anti-intellectualism, I mean especially an aggressively anti-scientific perspective, backed by disdain for those who adhere to science and evidence. The challenges faced by a major power like the US require rigorous analysis of information according to the best scientific principles. Climate change, for example, poses dire threats to the planet that must be assessed according to prevailing scientific norms and the evolving capacity of climate science. The Nobel Prize-winning global scientific process called the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has set the gold standard for scientific rigor in analyzing the threats of human-induced climate change. We need scientifically literate politicians adept at evidence-based critical thinking to translate these findings and recommendations into policy and international agreements. In the US, however, the attitudes of President Bush, leading Republicans, and now Sarah Palin, have been the opposite of scientific. The White House did all it could for eight years to hide the overwhelming scientific consensus that humans are contributing to climate change. It tried to prevent government scientists from speaking honestly to the public. The Wall Street Journal has similarly peddled anti-science and pseudo-science to oppose policies to fight human-induced climate change. These anti-scientific approaches affected not only climate policy, but also foreign policy. The US went to war in Iraq on the basis of Bush’s gut instincts and religious convictions, not rigorous evidence. Likewise, Palin has called the Iraq War “a task from God.” These are not isolated albeit powerful individuals out of touch with reality. They reflect the fact that a significant portion of American society, which currently votes mainly Republican, rejects or is simply unaware of basic scientific evidence regarding climate change, biological evolution, human health and other fields. These voters generally do not reject the benefits of technologies that result from modern science, but they do reject the evidence and advice of scientists regarding public policies. Recent survey data by the Pew Foundation found that while 58 percent of Democrats believe that human beings are causing global warming, only 28 percent of Republicans do. Similarly, a 2005 survey found that 59 percent of self-professed conservative Republicans rejected any theory of evolution, while 67 percent of liberal Democrats accepted some version of evolutionary theory. To be sure, some of these deniers are simply scientifically ignorant, having been failed by the poor quality of science education in America. But others are biblical fundamentalists, who reject modern science because they take the word of the Bible as literally true. They reject geological evidence of climate change because they reject the science of geology itself. The issue here is not religion versus science. All of the great religions have traditions of fruitful interchange with -- and, indeed, support for -- scientific inquiry. The Golden Age of Islam a millennium ago was also the age in which Islamic science led the world. Pope John Paul II declared his support for the basic science of evolution, and Roman Catholic bishops are strongly in favor of limiting human-induced climate change, based on the scientific evidence. Several leading scientists, including one of the world’s greatest biologists, E.O. Wilson, have reached out to religious communities to support the fight against human-induced climate change and the fight for biological conservation, and those religious communities have reached back in harmony with science. The problem is an aggressive fundamentalism that denies modern science, and an aggressive anti-intellectualism that views experts and scientists as the enemy. It is those views that could end up getting us all killed. After all, that kind of extremism can even lead to war, based on perverted views that a particular war is God’s will rather than a failure of politics and cooperation. In many statements, Palin seems intent on invoking God in her judgments about war, an ominous sign for the future if she is elected. She would certainly stoke many enemies who will look to their own brands of fundamentalism to strike back at the US. Extremists on both sides end up putting at risk the vast majority of humans who are neither extremists nor anti-science fundamentalists. It is difficult to know for sure what is giving rise to fundamentalism in so many parts of the world. What is happening in the US, for example, is not happening in Europe, but it is of course characteristic of some parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. Fundamentalism seems to emerge in times of far-reaching change, when traditional social arrangements come under threat. The surge of modern American fundamentalism in politics dates to the civil rights era of the 1960s, and at least partly reflects a backlash among whites against the growing political and economic strength of non-white and immigrant minority groups in US society. Humanity’s only hope is that the vicious circle of extremism can be replaced by a shared global understanding of the massive challenges of climate change, food supplies, sustainable energy, water scarcity and poverty. Global scientific processes like the IPCC are critical, because they offer our best hope of forging a consensus based on the scientific evidence. The US must return to the global consensus based on shared science rather than anti-intellectualism. That is the urgent challenge at the heart of American society today.<br />

U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Wednesday expressed confidence that Congress has a bipartisan strategy in place to pass the long-overdue free trade agreements (FTAs) with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. But he stopped short of specifying when his administration will submit related bills to Capitol Hill. U.S. and South Korean officials apparently hope that the bilateral FTA will be ratified by Congress before South Korean President Lee Myung-bak makes an official state visit to Washington next month. In an interview with CNBC, Geithner admitted that the government wanted to get the bills passed over the summer. &quot;But I think we're more confident now -- that we have Republican and Democrat agreement for a strategy to get these three bills passed, Korea, Colombia and Panama,&quot; he said. He pointed out that U.S. movement on the FTAs, signed several years ago, is a test of its will to sign such trade pacts with other nations. &quot;When we demonstrate we can legislate agreements, then countries around the world will have an incentive to negotiate with us,&quot; he said. &quot;Until we demonstrate we can legislate them, they have no incentive to negotiate with us. We're trying to change that.&quot; The U.S. is pushing for an Asia-Pacific regional trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Obama administration wants assurance that Congress will quickly ratified the FTAs once they are submitted. Obama's efforts to renew the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), a worker aid program opposed by Republican lawmakers, have been a sticking point. The president has sought to renew the TAA along with the FTAs. There have been some signs of progress since Congress reconvened last week after a summer recess. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said he would bring up legislation on the TAA and the Generalized System of Preferences program as early as this week. If passed in the Senate, the bill will be forwarded to the House of Representatives. If it is passed in both chambers, it would clear the way for Congress to work on the FTAs. The Obama administration has announced an upcoming trip to Washington by the South Korean leader earlier than expected in an apparent bid to put pressure on Congress, according to diplomatic sources. Obama and Lee are scheduled to hold a summit on Oct. 13. &quot;This visit will highlight the strong alliance, the global partnership, and the deep economic ties between the United States and the Republic of Korea,&quot; the White House said in a press release on Tuesday. &quot;The visit will also celebrate the strong bonds of friendship between the American and Korean people.&quot; Whether the bilateral FTA will be ratified in the U.S. before Lee's trip will affect the summit agenda and joint message to the world.<br />

<strong>2. The plan causes the perception of new spending—guarantees backlash</strong><br />

The US space program remained focused, not on duplicating Apollo, but on achieving another difficult goal such as going to Mars, a logical extension truly of the Apollo effort. Twice, the presidents Bush provided the presidential rationale, if not support, for achieving great things. The Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) in 1989 and the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) in 2004 were announced with great fanfare but neither survived the realities of congressional and presidential budgeting. The VSE appeared on paper more realistic about funding, but its choices were draconian: the ISS and space shuttle were both to be sacrificed on the altar of the new program. The earlier SEI died quickly, so hard choices were not required, while the VSE in the form of the Constellation Program lingers on although its effective demise appears certain. The Obama Administration prefers another approach while the new Congress is likely more hostile to big ticket discretionary spending. If the Tea Party faction in the Republican House caucus means what it says, the future for Constellation or any other similar program is a dim one. The reality is that the Apollo program, the SEI, and the VSE are examples in space terms of the home run approach. Such efforts confront the cruel but obvious reality that the human spaceflight program is considered by the public and most of Congress to be a “nice to have,” but not a necessity when compared to other programs or national priorities. Congressional support is narrow and constituency-driven (i.e. protect local jobs), which means most in Congress only support the space program in the abstract. Big ticket items or programs are not a priority for most, given other priorities. What happens is what can be loosely termed normal politics: a situation where human spaceflight remains a low priority on the national agenda. Funding for bold new initiatives is going to be hard to come by even when the economy recovers and deficits are under control. The home run approach has run its course at least for a time; now the small ball approach becomes your mantra.<br />

Debates about trade and tariffs are a recurring element in U.S. history, and each time they have been resolved in favor of more freedom, Americans have enjoyed long periods of greater prosperity. Legislators should keep this history in mind and advance pending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea without delay or extraneous conditions. Our First 230 Years: More Trade, More Prosperity Before the Declaration of Independence mentioned taxation without representation, it accused the king of Great Britain of “cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world.” A few years later, the Founding Fathers drafted a Constitution that created the world’s most successful free trade area by strongly restricting the ability of state politicians to interfere with interstate commerce. Following the Great Depression and World War II, the United States led the way in creating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The U.S. economy continued to grow as the number of countries participating in GATT increased from 23 to more than 150, and average tariffs fell from 38 percent in 1947 to about 4 percent today.[1] In addition to declining trade barriers, improvements in transportation and technology have increased the role of trade in the U.S. economy tremendously. Since 1960, the volume of trade relative to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) has more than tripled, from 9.3 percent to 28.7 percent.[2] President Ronald Reagan made a succinct case for keeping U.S. trade robust in his 1988 State of the Union Address: One of the greatest contributions the United States can make to the world is to promote freedom as the key to economic growth. A creative, competitive America is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars that would close doors, create greater barriers, and destroy millions of jobs. We should always remember: protectionism is destructionism. America’s jobs, America’s growth, America’s future depend on trade—trade that is free, open, and fair.[3] President Reagan understood that reducing trade barriers fuels economic growth. This relationship between freedom and prosperity is illustrated every year in The Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom, which assigns each country a trade freedom rating from 0 to 100, with 100 being a perfect score. In the most recent Index, the world’s 10 poorest countries—those with the lowest per capita GDP—had an average trade freedom score of 64.5, while the world’s 10 richest countries had a much better average score of 87.[4]<br />

<strong>4. U.S. Economic Leadership Creates an incentives framework that prevents wars from going nuclear— Isolationism causes them</strong><br />

[Michael, The Case for Goliath: How America Acts As the World’s Government in the Twenty-First Century, p. 224]<br />
At best, an American withdrawal would bring with it some of the political anxiety typical during the Cold War and a measure of the economic uncertainty that characterized the years before World War II. At worst, the retreat of American power could lead to a repetition of the great global economic failure and the bloody international conflicts the world experienced in the 1930s and 1940s. Indeed, the potential for economic calamity and wartime destruction is greater at the outset of the new century than it was in the first half of the preceding one because of the greater extent of international economic interdependence and the higher levels of prosperity—there is more to lose now than there was then—and because of the presence, in large numbers, of nuclear weapons.<br />

 <strong>The affirmative is bound up in the drive to expand Capitalism’s scope and hegemony – They are trapped within the discourse of Global capitalism</strong><br />

There are two quite distinct ways in which the humanization of outer space is implicated in the maintenance of hegemony. The first is that space technology has become central to the process of spreading hegemony throughout the global society. Satellites serve as a medium for the transmission of hegemonic worldview, a form of electronic cultural imperialism, and for the surveillance of the population. As explored in Chapter 6, satellites transmit hegemonic worldviews to living rooms around the world. As Mowlana (2004) has argued with specific reference to satellites; 'The Western-fuelled system of &quot;communications, capitalism, consumerism and continuous change&quot; contains seeds of a new form of conquest. This now surging e-sphere of information, communications, and capitalism seems to be seeking to conquer the culture and diverse human capacities of the world' (p300). Hegemonic settlements made in the postwar period have been socially and spatially uneven. In the British case a bout of 'authoritarian populism' was mounted, with severe 'moral panics' being created by politicians such as Margaret Thatcher and sections of the media. The focus was on supposedly lawless and hedonistic groups of young people breaking the boundaries of respectable society and hence wrecking the entire social order (Hall 1978 op.cit.). Authoritarian populism has been retained in the twenty-first century. Its forms are again unevenly developed but in most advanced Western societies it is a combination of appeals to 'old values' such as religion, nation, home and duty with the neo-liberal values of possessive individualism. Moral panics over 'youth' have been supplemented by panics over immigrants, Muslims and, latterly, 'terrorists'. But dominant blocs and alliances can only remain dominant if subordinated classes actually adopt and internalise such values themselves. Subordinates must therefore be not only reconstituted but must reconstitute themselves as atomised individuals whose pressing priorities, like those in the dominant bloc, include consumerism, the acquisition of property and a dedication to hard work. Closely allied with these panics has been the increased surveillance of 'deviant' populations, and even deviant States. Subaltern groups are under pressure to accept as inevitable new forms of authoritarianism, and this is despite the massively increased social inequalities stemming from the neo-liberal experiment. Satellite technology is again central to this hegemonic project of surveillance, as again discussed in Chapter 6. Restoring class hegemony is a difficult and ongoing enterprise. It needs constant renegotiation and has no guarantee of success. The second way in which space is involved in hegemonic struggles is that space development and settlement are widely supported as hegemonic solutions to the economic and environmental contradictions of capitalism. It has been seen as 'common sense' that man (sic) should continue to explore and humanise the universe. But an organic intellectual is likely to demonstrate the ways in which it is actually being done. It entails capital accumulation, the maintenance of class-relations, the growth of a militarised industry, the withdrawal of funds from education and welfare, increased social inequalities and increased levels of nationalism. Bruce Gagnon and leading members of the 'Space4Peace' movement could be seen as 'organic' intellectuals. Nobody has forced a particular view of 'common sense' but it best serves the interests of dominant social orders. It is promoted and engaged in by [end page 14] 'traditional' intellectuals in the space industry who stick to their detached forms of knowledge which simply perpetuate the social order. Some commentators on science fiction have also argued that the stories told there about human exploration and settlement of space are distinctly hegemonic. There are those who see science fiction as exploring the conflicts of Western society, and highlight the problems with imperialism and with capitalism. Some science fiction clearly goes even further with narratives that attack the legitimacy of contemporary social relations through telling dystopian stories about how a human future in space might look. Kim Stanley Robinson's trilogy of books on a Martian mining colony explore the ethics of exporting capitalism to the rest of the cosmos, for example. In the trilogy, groups of Martian settlers break away from the capitalist mining operations to establish their own social order based on socialist, environmentalist and even nudist principles. As such, there is probably some truth to DeWitt Douglas Kilgore's assessment of the scope of science fiction and science writing about space (what he calls 'astrofuturism'); 'Astrofuturist speculation on space-based exploration, exploitation, and colonization is capacious enough to contain imperialist, capitalist ambitions and utopian, socialist hopes. [....] This [speculative] impulse has produced a strand of futurist thought that seeks an eternal extension of contemporary political and economic arrangements, albeit stripped of unpleasant resonances and rendered innocent. However, astrofuturism also carries within it an idealism, a liberal or utopian commitment that seeks alternatives and solutions to these problems and conflicts characterizing contemporary American life. It can imagine space frontiers predicated on experimental arrangements and the production of relationships uncommon or unknown in the old world.' (2003:1&amp;4). However, it is hard to deny that science fiction, and especially popular science fiction, is more often than not supportive of existing social practices. The futures imagined by most science fiction writers reflect a hegemonic worldview simply through their demonstrated inability to imagine anything other than an extension of contemporary social relations. This is a point made eloquently by Sardar &amp; Cubbitt; 'Science fiction shows us not the plasticity but the paucity of the human imagination that has become quagmired in the scientist industrial technological, cultural-socio-psycho babble of a single civilizational paradigm. Science fiction is the fiction of mortgaged futures' (2002, p1) Sardar &amp; Cubbitt, like Kilgore, retreat from this altogether critical position to discuss the ways in which science fiction can play out the conundrums of civilization. However, some writers influenced by the critical theory of the Frankfurt School have been much more outspoken against the duping effect that science fiction has on an audience which is encouraged to accept social relations as inevitable through witnessing them projected in time and space. Goulding (1985) has argued that science fiction shows like Star Trek 'preserve a &quot;halo of free choice&quot; within rigid rules and structured inequalities'. The Federation to which the Enterprise belongs promulgates male authority (preserved through the notion of the chain of command), capitalism (through military and diplomatic protection of mining colonies), possessive [end page 15] individualism and the Darwinian ethic. As Goulding argues, the narratives of the show are stories about the crew of the Enterprise teaching the various space colonies which they visit to be American. In one episode, he reports, the crew are disturbed upon visiting a planet on which people worked the minimum amount of time possible and spent all their free time high on drugs. This obvious transgression against the protestant ethic had to be redressed by the Enterprise crew. Our imagination as regards possible human futures in space is the product of hegemonic relations. Not only is the imagined spacefaring civilization one that continues to operate on neo-liberal principles, but, more importantly, alternative Earthly solutions to our social and environmental problems are ignored entirely in favour of exporting them to space. Whether or not the readers of science fiction have the ability to critically dissect the messages of the shows they watch and the books they read has been hotly debated. Goulding's position has been attacked by writers like Jenkins (Jenkins 1992, Tulloch &amp; Jenkins 1995), who has argued for a much more creative and reflexive science fiction audience. There is clearly some hope that critical science fiction writing and the critical reading of science fiction can contribute to the exploration of alterative futures to the extension of global capitalism into space, but this requires engagement in praxis. Sadly at the moment there is little indication amongst the general public that this is occurring. We asked the Mass Observation writers an open ended question about their thoughts on, first of all, humans living in outer space, and secondly, private companies mining asteroids for resources. The first thing to be noted is that the majority of respondents expressed no strong feelings about the desirability of these enterprises. Instead, in a number of ways, they deflected the question into a discussion of the practicality and likelihood of these possibilities. Amongst these people there was a fairly even split between those who considered it impossible, highly unlikely or so distant so as to be not worth discussing, and those who considered it necessary or inevitable. Those who dismissed the practicality of the idea mentioned such things as the ability of the body to survive in space, the insufficient quantities of valuable materials, and the cost of extracting them. It has often been suggested that such pragmatism has replaced traditional political ideologies (see Lyotard 1979). There were also a few who chose only to comment on the likely discomfort and boredom of life in space, without expanding further. Those that saw these developments as inevitable held equally depoliticised views. One said simply, 'the question implies that there could be some objection to this, but I cannot see why' [B1475]. For many, these ideas are natural commonsense (or, rather, hegemonic) solutions to the problems of overcrowding, pollution and resource deficiency on earth, and in some cases even global warming or nuclear destruction. One man said simply, 'I think it is an essential idea as the way we are leading our lives at the moment means that our planet's resources won't last forever' [B3133]. This un-reflexive acceptance of space development as a solution to Earth's problems is translated into a more positive ideology by pro-space advocates. Furthermore, it was even assumed by some writers that space settlement and private exploitation of resources would naturally go together [B1654]. Even though this was not seen as an altogether positive development, it was seen as an inevitability, 'The truth of it is that most people on this planet live in societies based on private enterprise and military strength, and there is nothing about [end page 16] space to convince us to change once we go there' [H3070]. The idea of society expanding into space complete with all the contradictions of our existence on this planet is a politically unquestioned component of Western hegemony.<br />

<strong>Capitalism makes environmental collapse inevitable, leading to extinction</strong><br />

The reigning capitalist system is bringing the planet’s inhabitants a long list of irreparable calamities. Witness: exponential growth of air pollution in big cities and across rural landscapes; fouled drinking water; global warming, with the incipient melting of the polar ice caps and the increase of “natural” extreme weather-related catastrophes; the deterioration of the ozone layer; the increasing destruction of tropical rain forests; the rapid decrease of biodiversity through the extinction of thousands of species; the exhausting of the soil; desertification; the unmanageable accumulation of waste, especially nuclear; the multiplication of nuclear accidents along with the threat of a new—and perhaps more destructive—Chernobyl; food contamination, genetic engineering, “mad cow,” and hormone-injected beef. All the warning signs are red: it is clear that the insatiable quest for profits, the productivist and mercantile logic of capitalist/industrial civilization is leading us into an ecological disaster of incalculable proportions. This is not to give in to “catastrophism” but to verify that the dynamic of infinite “growth” brought about by capitalist expansion is threatening the natural foundations of human life on the planet.<br />

It is time to try to describe, at first abstractly and later concretely, a strategy for destroying capitalism. This strategy, at its most basic, calls for pulling time, energy, and resources out of capitalist civilization and putting them into building a new civilization. The image then is one of emptying out capitalist structures, hollowing them out, by draining wealth, power, and meaning out of them until there is nothing left but shells. This is definitely an aggressive strategy. It requires great militancy, and constitutes an attack on the existing order. The strategy clearly recognizes that capitalism is the enemy and must be destroyed, but it is not a frontal attack aimed at overthrowing the system, but an inside attack aimed at gutting it, while simultaneously replacing it with something better, something we want. Thus capitalist structures (corporations, governments, banks, schools, etc.) are not seized so much as simply abandoned. Capitalist relations are not fought so much as they are simply rejected. We stop participating in activities that support (finance, condone) the capitalist world and start participating in activities that build a new world while simultaneously undermining the old. We create a new pattern of social relations alongside capitalist relations and then we continually build and strengthen our new pattern while doing every thing we can to weaken capitalist relations. In this way our new democratic, non-hierarchical, non-commodified relations can eventually overwhelm the capitalist relations and force them out of existence. This is how it has to be done. This is a plausible, realistic strategy. To think that we could create a whole new world of decent social arrangements overnight, in the midst of a crisis, during a so-called revolution, or during the collapse of capitalism, is foolhardy. Our new social world must grow within the old, and in opposition to it, until it is strong enough to dismantle and abolish capitalist relations. Such a revolution will never happen automatically, blindly, determinably, because of the inexorable, materialist laws of history. It will happen, and only happen, because we want it to, and because we know what we’re doing and know how we want to live, and know what obstacles have to be overcome before we can live that way, and know how to distinguish between our social patterns and theirs. But we must not think that the capitalist world can simply be ignored, in a live and let live attitude, while we try to build new lives elsewhere. (There is no elsewhere.) There is at least one thing, wage-slavery, that we can’t simply stop participating in (but even here there are ways we can chip away at it). Capitalism must be explicitly refused and replaced by something else. This constitutes War, but it is not a war in the traditional sense of armies and tanks, but a war fought on a daily basis, on the level of everyday life, by millions of people. It is a war nevertheless because the accumulators of capital will use coercion, brutality, and murder, as they have always done in the past, to try to block any rejection of the system. They have always had to force compliance; they will not hesitate to continue doing so. Nevertheless, there are many concrete ways that individuals, groups, and neighborhoods can gut capitalism, which I will enumerate shortly. We must always keep in mind how we became slaves; then we can see more clearly how we can cease being slaves. We were forced into wage-slavery because the ruling class slowly, systematically, and brutally destroyed our ability to live autonomously. By driving us off the land, changing the property laws, destroying community rights, destroying our tools, imposing taxes, destroying our local markets, and so forth, we were forced onto the labor market in order to survive, our only remaining option being to sell, for a wage, our ability to work. It’s quite clear then how we can overthrow slavery. We must reverse this process. We must begin to reacquire the ability to live without working for a wage or buying the products made by wage-slaves (that is, we must get free from the labor market and the way of living based on it), and embed ourselves instead in cooperative labor and cooperatively produced goods. Another clarification is needed. This strategy does not call for reforming capitalism, for changing capitalism into something else. It calls for replacing capitalism, totally, with a new civilization. This is an important distinction, because capitalism has proved impervious to reforms, as a system. We can sometimes in some places win certain concessions from it (usually only temporary ones) and win some (usually short-lived) improvements in our lives as its victims, but we cannot reform it piecemeal, as a system. Thus our strategy of gutting and eventually destroying capitalism requires at a minimum a totalizing image, an awareness that we are attacking an entire way of life and replacing it with another, and not merely reforming one way of life into something else. Many people may not be accustomed to thinking about entire systems and social orders, but everyone knows what a lifestyle is, or a way of life, and that is the way we should approach it. The thing is this: in order for capitalism to be destroyed millions and millions of people must be dissatisfied with their way of life. They must want something else and see certain existing things as obstacles to getting what they want. It is not useful to think of this as a new ideology. It is not merely a belief-system that is needed, like a religion, or like Marxism, or Anarchism. Rather it is a new prevailing vision, a dominant desire, an overriding need. What must exist is a pressing desire to live a certain way, and not to live another way. If this pressing desire were a desire to live free, to be autonomous, to live in democratically controlled communities, to participate in the self-regulating activities of a mature people, then capitalism could be destroyed. Otherwise we are doomed to perpetual slavery and possibly even to extinction. The content of this vision is actually not new at all, but quite old. The long term goal of communists, anarchists, and socialists has always been to restore community. Even the great peasant revolts of early capitalism sought to get free from external authorities and restore autonomy to villages. Marx defined communism once as a free association of producers, and at another time as a situation in which the free development of each is a condition for the free development of all. Anarchists have always called for worker and peasant self-managed cooperatives. The long term goals have always been clear: to abolish wage-slavery, to eradicate a social order organized solely around the accumulation of capital for its own sake, and to establish in its place a society of free people who democratically and cooperatively self-determine the shape of their social world. These principles however must be embodied in concrete social arrangements. In this sketch they are embodied in the following configuration of social forms: (a) autonomous, self-governing democratic Neighborhoods (through the practice of the Home Assembly); (b) self-managed Projects; (c) cooperatively operated Households; and (d) an Association, by means of treaties, of neighborhoods one with another. But how can this be achieved? Now we must turn to the task of fleshing out this strategy, but this time in concrete terms rather than abstractly.<br />

This line of argument is usually linked to technological capacities. By asserting that other countries operate in Space, that conflicts are &quot;natural&quot; between humans – which brings the obvious &quot;so why would it be different in Space&quot; – technologies of power take the lead and one is left with devising what space-control strategy will be best and what one wants &quot;to control, for how long, and for what purposes?/ (Lambakis 2001: 281). And in a context where one portrays the situation as one where US aerospace industry is held back by the rest of the world only for fear of potential not guaranteed conflicts that will evolve into Space warfighting because of a renewed arms race (Lambakis 2001: 282), the claim to let technology drive the policy and the political is not disinterested – albeit ill-advised – and definitely not a sure bet. For space warriors such as Dolmnan and Lambakis, space weaponization then appears not to be all related to the security issue but also very much to the maintenance of a strong defense and aerospace industry. The technological takes over as the political is eclipsed by the military professionals. In effect, for space warriors, because of national security, &quot;if a determination is made that space weapons would improve national security, further analysis would be required to map out a path to take to introduce these tools in the arsenal and military strategy and a time line from which to plan&quot; (Lambakis 2001: 282). Contrary to US astropolitical analysts, I find myself at fault with the logic of national security and securitization of space that drives US [end page 26] governmentality, especially with regard to Outer Space. I do not believe that arms control is given a fair trial by its opponents or even by some of its main defenders in US astropolitical discourse. For me, the security game is what seems so scary; and if we consider the one assumption of an astropolitical argument such as that of Lambakis that because of the 9/11 context, &quot;one thing is certain – we will not be able to bludgeon our enemies into cooperation. For those times, the United States needs to have in place more assertive means and doctrines to counter hostiles activities in space&quot; (Lambakis 2001: 282; my emphasis). When people are certain and need enemies to develop one strategy, then maybe some questions have not been raised. There are &quot;unknowns&quot; and we cannot be sure of how the events will unfold if the US goes further along a path to space weaponization. In any case, it gets even more problematic when security is trumped with technology for there is no way – so it seems – to argue against the desire of global (read absolute) security, especially when it comes from the strongest of power. You are brought back to the realities of the global homeland security state. One is doomed to either accept the logic of terror – that inexorably goes with the logic of global security – or reject it. I choose the latter.<br />

[“Anti-Astropolitik – outer space and the orbit of geography,” Progress in Human Geography, Volume 31, Number 5, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via SAGE Publications Online, p. 606-609]<br />
Two things should now be clear. First, outer space is no longer remote from our everyday lives; it is already profoundly implicated in the ordinary workings of economy and society. Second, the import of space to civilian, commercial and, in particular, military objectives, means there is a great deal at stake in terms of the access to and control over Earth's orbit. One cannot overstate this last point. The next few years may prove decisive in terms of establishing a regime of space control that will have profound implications for terrestrial geopolitics. It is in this context that I want to briefly introduce the emerging field of astropolitics, defined as 'the study of the relationship between outer space terrain and technology and the development of political and military policy and strategy' (Dolman, 2002: 15). It is, in both theory and practice, a geopolitics of outer space. Everett Dolman is one of the pioneers of the field. An ex-CIA intelligence analyst who teaches at the US Air Force's School of Advanced Airpower [end page 606] Studies, he publishes in journals that are perhaps unfamiliar to critical geographers, like the modestly titled Small Wars and Insurgencies. As what follows is uniformly critical of Dolman's work, I should say that his Astropolitik: classical geopolitics in the space age (Dolman, 2002) is unquestionably a significant book: it has defined a now vibrant field of research and debate. Astropolitik draws together a vast literature on space exploration and space policy, and presents a lucid and accessible introduction to thinking strategically about space. (In the previous section I drew heavily on Dolman's description of the astropolitical environment.) My critique is not founded on scientific or technical grounds but on Dolman's construction of a formal geopolitics designed to advance and legitimate the unilateral military conquest of space by the United States. While Dolman has many admirers among neoconservative colleagues in Washington think-tanks, critical engagements (eg, Moore, 2003; Caracciolo, 2004) have been relatively thin on the ground. Dolman's work is interesting for our purposes here precisely because he draw's on geography's back catalogue of strategic thinkers, most prominently Halford Mackinder, whose ideas gained particular prominence in America in the wake of the Russian Sputnik (Hooson, 2004: 377). But Dolman is not just refashioning classical geopolitics in the new garb of 'astropolitics'; he goes further and proposes an 'Astropolitik' – 'a simple but effective blueprint for space control' (p. 9) – modelled on Karl Hausofer's Geopolitik as much as Realpolitik. Showing some discomfort with the impeccably fascist pedigree of this theory, Dolman cautions against the 'misuse' of Astropolitik and argues that the term 'is chosen as a constant reminder of that past, and as a grim warning for the future' (Dolman, 2002: 3). At the same time, however, his book is basically a manual for achieving space dominance. Projecting Mackinder's famous thesis on the geographical pivot of history (Mackinder, 1904) onto outer space, Dolman argues that: 'who controls the Lower Earth Orbit controls near-Earth space. Who controls near-Earth space dominates Terra [Earth]. Who dominates Terra determines the destiny of humankind.' Dolman sees the quest for space as already having followed classically Mackinderian principles (Dolman, 2002: 87). Like Mackinder before him, Dolman is writing in the service of his empire. 'Astropolitik like Realpolitik' he writes, 'is hardnosed and pragmatic, it is not pretty or uplifting or a joyous sermon for the masses. But neither is it evil. Its benevolence or malevolence become apparent only as it is applied, and by whom' (Dolman, 2002: 4). Further inspiration is drawn from Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose classic volume The infl uence of seapower upon history, has been widely cited by space strategists (Mahan, 1890; Gray, 1996; see also Russell, 2006). Mahan's discussion of the strategic value of coasts, harbours, well-worn sea paths and chokepoints has its parallel in outer space (see France, 2000). The implication of Mahan's work, Dolman concludes, is that 'the United States must be ready and prepared, in Mahanian scrutiny, to commit to the defense and maintenance of these assets, or relinquish them to a state willing and able to do so' (Dolman, 2002: 37). The primary problem for those advancing Astropolitik is that space is not a lawless frontier. In fact the legal character of space has long been enshrined in the principles of the OST and this has, to some extent, prevented it from being subject to unbridled interstate competition. 'While it is morally desirable to explore space in common with all peoples', writes Dolman without conviction, 'even the thought of doing so makes weary those who have the means' (Dolman, 2002: 135). Thus, the veneer of transcendent humanism with regard to space gives way to brazen self-interest. Accordingly, Dolman describes the res communis consensus7 of the OST as 'a tragedy' that has removed any legal incentive for the exploitation of space (p. 137). Only a res nullius8 legal order could construct space as 'proper objects for which states may compete' (p. 138). Under the paradigm of res nullius and Astropolitik, the moon and [end page 607] other celestial bodies would become potential new territory for states. Here Dolman again parallels Karl Hausofer's Geopolitik. Just as Hausofer desired a break from the Versailles Treaty (Ó Tuathail, 1996: 45), Dolman wants to see the USA withdraw from the OST, making full speed ahead for the moon (see also Hickman and Dolman, 2002). Non-space-faring developing countries need not worry about losing out, says Dolman, as they 'would own no less of the Moon than they do now' (2002: 140). To his credit, Dolman does give some attention to the divisive social consequences of this concentrated power. Drawing on earlier currents of environmental determinism and on the terrestrial model of Antarctic exploration, he ponders the characteristics of those who will be first to colonize space. They will be 'highly educated, rigorously trained and psychologically screened for mental toughness and decision-making skills, and very physically fit'; 'the best and brightest of our pilots, technicians and scientists'; 'rational, given to scientific analysis and explanation, and obsessed with their professions' (p. 26). In other words, 'they are a superior subset of the larger group from which they spring' (p. 27). As if this picture is not vivid enough, Dolman goes on to say that colonizers of space 'will be the most capably endowed (or at least the most ruthlessly suitable, as the populating of America and Australia ... so aptly illustrate[s])' (p. 27; my emphasis). 'Duty and sacrifice will be the highest moral ideals' (p. 27). Society, he continues, must be prepared 'to make heroes' of those who undertake the risk of exploration (p. 146). At the same time, 'the astropolitical society must be prepared to forego expenditures on social programs ... to channel funds into the national space program. It must be embued with the national spirit' (p. 146). Dolman slips from presenting what would be merely a 'logical' outworking of Astropolitik to advocating that the United States adopt it as their space strategy. Along the way, he acknowledges the full anti-democratic potential of such concentrated power, detaching the state from its citizenry: the United States can adopt any policy it wishes and the attitudes and reactions of the domestic public and of other states can do little to challenge it. So powerful is the United States that should it accept the harsh Realpolitik doctrine in space that the military services appear to be proposing, and given a proper explanation for employing it, there may in fact be little if any opposition to a fait accompli of total US domination in space. (Dolman, 2002: 156) Although Dolman claims that 'no attempt will be made to create a convincing argument that the United States has a right to domination in space', in almost the next sentence he goes on to argue 'that, in this case, might does make right', 'the persuasiveness of the case' being 'based on the self-interest of the state and stability of the system' (2002: 156; my emphasis). Truly, this is Astropolitik: a veneration of the ineluctable logic of power and the permanent rightness of those who wield it. If it sounds chillingly familiar, Dolman hopes to reassure us with his belief that 'the US form of liberal democracy ... is admirable and socially encompassing' (p. 156) and it is 'the most benign state that has ever attempted hegemony over the greater part of the world' (p. 158). His sunny view that the United States is 'willing to extend legal and political equality to all' sits awkwardly with the current suspension of the rule of law in Guantanamo Bay as well as in various other 'spaces of exception' (see Gregory, 2004; Agamben, 2005). Dolman's astropolitical project is by no means exceptional. The journal Astropolitics, of which he is a founding editor, contains numerous papers expressing similar views. It is easy, I think, for critical geographers to feel so secure in the intellectual and political purchase of Ó Tuathailian critiques (Ó Tuathail, 1996), that we become oblivious to the undead nature of classical geopolitics. It is comforting to think that most geography undergraduates encountering geopolitics, in the UK at least, [end page 608] will in all likelihood do so through the portal of critical perspectives, perhaps through the excellent work of Joanne Sharp or Klaus Dodds (Dodds, 2005; Sharp, 2005). But the legacies of Mackinder and Mahan live on, and radical critique is as urgent as ever. While this is not the place for a thoroughgoing reappraisal of astropolitics in the manner of Gearòid Ó Tuathail, a few salient points from his critique can be brought out. (1) Astrography and astropolitics, like geography and geopolitics, constitute 'a political domination and cultural imagining of space' (Ó Tuathail, 1996: 28). While commentators like Colin Gray have posited an 'inescapable geography' (eg, 'of course, physical geography is politically neutral'), a critical agenda conceives of geography not as a fixed substratum but as a highly social form of knowledge (Gray, 1999: 173; Ó Tuathail, 1999: 109). For geography, read 'astrography'. We must be alert to the 'declarative' ('this is how the Outer Earth is') and 'imperative' ('this is what we must do') modes of narration that astropolitics has borrowed from its terrestrial antecedent (Ó Tuathail, 1999: 107). The models of Mackinder and Mahan that are so often applied to the space environment are not unchanging laws; on the contrary they are themselves highly political attempts to create and sustain particular strategic outcomes in specific historical circumstances. (2) Rather than actively supporting the dominant structures and mechanisms of power, a critical astropolitics must place the primacy of such forces always already in question. Critical astropolitics aims to scrutinize the power politics of the expert/think-tank/tactician as part of a wider project of deepening public debate and strengthening democratic accountability (Ó Tuathail, 1999: 108). (3) Mackinder's 'end of geography' thesis held that the era of terrestrial exploration and discovery was over, leaving only the task of consolidating the world order to fit British interests (Ó Tuathail, 1996: 27). Dolman's vision of space strategy bears striking similarities. Like Ó Tuathail's critique of Mackinder's imperial hubris, Astropolitik could be reasonably described as 'triumphalism blind to its own precariousness' (Ó Tuathail, 1996: 28). Dolman, for instance, makes little effort to conceal his tumescent patriotism, observing that 'the United States is awash with power after its impressive victories in the 1991 Gulf War and 1999 Kosovo campaign, and stands at the forefront of history capable of presiding over the birth of a bold New World Order'. One might argue, however, that Mackinder – as the theorist of imperial decline – may in this respect be an appropriate mentor (Ó Tuathail, 1999: 112). It is important, I think, to demystify Astropolitik: there is nothing 'inevitable' about US dominance in space, even if the USA were to pursue this imperial logic. (4) Again like Mackinder, Astropolitik mobilizes an unquestioned ethnocentrism. Implicit in this ideology is the notion that America must beat China into space because 'they' are not like 'us'. 'The most ruthlessly suitable' candidates for space dominance, we are told – 'the most capably endowed' – are like those who populated America and Australia (Dolman, 2002: 27). (5) A critical astropolitics must challenge the 'mythic' properties of Astropolitik and disrupt its reverie for the 'timeless insights' of the so-called geopolitical masters. For Ó Tuathail, 'geopolitics is mythic because it promises uncanny clarity ... in a complex world' and is 'fetishistically concerned with .... prophecy' (Ó Tuathail, 1999: 113). Ó Tuathail's critical project, by contrast, seeks to recover the political and historical contexts through which the knowledge of Mackinder and Mahan has become formalized.<br />

A Case for Technological Atheism and Resisting Space War,” Paper Presented At The Annual Meeting Of The International Studies Association 48th Annual Convention, February 28th, Available Online via All Academic at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1049:http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/" rel="nofollow">http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1049 --> 1/7/8/9/4/p178946_index.html, Accessed 10-26-2008, p. 23-26]<br />
If it is beyond challenge that technology is the medium that manages, produces, permits, and administers the daily life of modern societies, a common discourse of engineers and technocrats and security experts often tries to make believe and convince people that the technical and social spheres are separate – when in fact technologies are always already social institutions, devised by individuals and for something. This dualism is usually described as &quot;technological fetichism&quot;, where technology would act as an independent agent and force to which we as human beings could do nothing but surrender to. That follows Karl Marx's critique of the fetichism of commodities that made individuals think that commodities had an intrinsic price attributed to them by essence when it was rather a relational attribute part of the capitalist system of [end page 23] production and of market logic. With technology, the fetishization will mask the relational character of technology, negate that any technology is part of a social network, and describe technology as a non-social expression of pure technical rationality (Feenberg, 1999: 211). This trend goes along what is said to be an &quot;essentialist philosophy of technology&quot;, where it is stressed &quot;that technology reduces everything to functions and raw materials&quot; and that &quot;[g]oal oriented technological practices replace practices which embody a human meaning&quot; (Feenberg, 1999: viii). For philosopher of technology Andrew Feenberg, we need to develop an &quot;anti-essentialist philosophy of technology&quot;, which is very much in line with the ethos of critique I am pushing for here with regard to US space weaponization discourse. This view holds that if we are to change our relationship to technology, to military technology in outer Space, we must &quot;recognize the nature of our subordinate position in the technical systems that enrol us, and begin to intervene in the design process in the defense of the conditions of a meaningful life and a livable environment&quot; (Feenberg, 1999: xiv). This means we can raise our voice against the discourse of security experts and elites who are aiming towards the weaponization of Space for the sake of non-weaponizing it. My approach to activist resistance follows much of the argument developed by Michel de Certeau on strategies and tactics, especially for a project discussed and designed in closed circles such as Space weaponization and Space warfare. De Certeau explains that agents (individual or organized) use the capital of power they accumulated through their action as and on members of society. This capitalized power is linked to a social space occupied by elites (in our case, the strategic elites), where they are able to &quot;constitute themselves as such and from out of which they act on a social 'exteriority'&quot; (Feenberg, 1999: 112). This place is the elites' if they are to formulate strategies of action: &quot;Strategy presupposes a place that can be circumscribed as one's own and that can serve as the base from which to direct relations with an exteriority consisting of targets and threats (clients, competitors, enemies, the countryside around the town, research goals and objects, etc.&quot; (de Certeau, quoted in Feenberg, 1999: 112). In explaining how many social groups lack a strategic space/place that will allow them to act and that leaves them to only be able to &quot;react 'tactically' to strategies they cannot escape&quot;, de Certeau takes up the problem of resistance: [end page 24] Although they remain more or less within the framework of the dominant strategy, they respond to it with subtly deviant actions that alter its significance. Tactics thus differ from outright opposition in that they subvert the dominant codes from within by introducing various unexpected delays, combinations, and ironies into the application of strategies, &quot;a thousand ways of playing/outplaying the other's game, that is to say, the space other have instituted, characterize the subtle tenacious, resistant activity of groups which, for lack of a base, must maneuver in a network of established forces and representations&quot; (de Certeau, quoted in Feenberg and Feenberg, 1999: 113). In my case, I use my activist role as critical scholar of IR in order to take up the US discourse of Space weaponization and for Space warfare. The intervention strategy must indeed be aimed at the tactical level as I know that I will not be able to alter the dominant strategy of the reinvigorated US war machine, with its all-too-powerful military-industrial complex and scientists involved in weaponry and warfare technology: only through tactics publicly exposing the almost secret discourse regarding Space weaponization and Space warfare can a public debate be done and hopefully citizens concerned. This is why the arguments of papers such as this one must also be presented in general public forums (in the form of op-eds, public conferences, media interventions, testimonies in public hearing commissions, etc.). Guy Oakes wrote that nuclear war was an &quot;imaginary war&quot;, that a whole set of strategies and tactics were designed to prepare for a nuclear war that, luckily, never happened (Oakes, 1994). What is noteworthy about this imaginary war is that we did not want to actually imagine it. Nuclear war was far less represented in movie pictures, especially during the 1950s and 1960s (the height of nuclear war strategy). Only a handful of movies actually showed a nuclear attack, and even far less showed the aftermath of an attack or of a series of attacks (think of Dr. Strangelove, which ended with the nuclear mushroom cloud). In a way, this can be explained with the Cold War context, which made deterrence the defining strategy and which set an atmosphere of terror that did not require a fall-out attack to be represented to instil a climate of fear. However, in a post-September 11 context, where US strategists and leaders see deterrence as having failed and prevention and protection as the new strategic mantra, it seems that almost everything is thought possible. The leaders' rhetoric is aimed at making people aware of the new risks and they must accept them if they wish to survive – so fear must be maintained yet managed. This has for effect that even imaginary wars are now more easily pictured, as we are now able to represent the US recovering from a nuclear strike on its soil, as it is the case in the current season of Fox's hit series 24. So what about imagined wars such as Space wars? There, [end page 25] science-fiction has long been servicing the movie industry with intergalactic battles, the Star Trek and Star Wars productions being the most prominent examples. We have been imagining them for so long. But, should that become reality? In this sense, it is still time to claim that Space war is the utmost &quot;imagined war&quot;, as it is not strategically and tactically fully conceived (in the US strategic circles, we are however slowly getting there), and that it should remain an imagined one. There is a space for resisting Space weaponization and Space warfare. Arms control and disarmament can and must be brought back to the political agenda of global security. It is late enough now, but, ultimately, it seems time to reassess and reinforce arms control and disarmament initiatives before the outer Space Treaty meets the same end as the ABM Treaty. There is no need to wait for a &quot;Space Pearl Harbor&quot; if you do not prepare for it and decide not to deploy the destructive technology required to be developed. But for that to happen, the scholarship on the international politics of outer Space must get more public space – more media coverage – and try to get its voice to be heard in US policymaking circles. It is not too late to hope for an atheist vision of technology in US space power politics<br />

<strong>Deterrence Is A State Of Mind:</strong><br />

The advent of nuclear weapons poses a terrible dilemma for humanity. Is security-real and enduring-possible in the nuclear age? On one side are those who say we have no choice but to &quot;live with nuclear weapons&quot; and that it is possible to do so with confidence. Just as we have lived with other kinds of weapons and continue to strive more or less successfully for security, especially national security, we can do the same with nuclear weapons. On the other side are those who insist there can never be enduring or adequate security except by &quot;living without nuclear weapons&quot; and that therefore there is no choice but to bring about complete, universal, and permanent nuclear disarmament. What has been done by humans, can be undone; indeed, must be undone. Moreover, we must do this as rapidly as possible. The longer nuclear weapons exist, the greater the chances of their being used, and the greater the possibility of a nuclear holocaust. To understand why genuine, authentic security is possible only in a world without nuclear weapons, it is essential to grasp the fundamental difference between conventional and nuclear weapons. Conventional weapons, if peace breaks down, can be used to protect oneself or one's country. But nuclear weapons can never actually be used to directly protect a country or achieve security. One can only hope that possessing nuclear weapons will frighten a rival into not using its own nuclear arsenal. Such is the hope of deterrence thinking. A state of deterrence is simply a &quot;state of mind,&quot; a psychological condition. That is all it is. To believe that deterrence will always work, is to believe in a myth. It is to believe that the people you want deterred, the &quot;enemy&quot; nuclear elite-the people in and out of government who shape or make the decisions regarding nuclear weapons-related activity (including the pressing of the nuclear button)-will always behave as your own national nuclear elite will want them to behave. It is to ignore that the opposing elite is subject to a whole host of military, economic, social, political, and cultural factors, as well as a variety of external and internal tensions and confusions whose effects are never under the control of the supposed deterrer. Nuclear weapons may deter because of their frightening character. But they can never deter certainly, confidently, and enduringly. Those who believe we must always live with nuclear weapons (perhaps because we can never again become technologically innocent of how to make them) are even prepared to claim that nuclear weapons can deter permanently. Deterrence advocates make any or all of these claims. To deter is not the same as deterrence, which is a conceptualization, a rationalization or theorization about what nuclear weapons are supposed to be capable of achieving. Nuclear weapons did not create the reality of deterrence; instead, deterrence was invented to cope with the reality of nuclear weapons. The spread of nuclear weapons does not lead to the spread of deterrence-based security, but only to the spread of rationalizations and claims that security has increased. Deterrence doctrines legitimize the [end page 163] existence of nuclear weapons as well as desensitive the public to the reality and dangers of nuclear competition. Deterrence makes nuclear weapons both perdition and salvation, peril and hope. The peril is real; the hope, an illusion. To rely on deterrence of any sort is to seek peace or stability by generating fear and hostility in the opponent. This heightens mutual tensions. It is not an attempt to bring about greater peace through cooperation or reduction of mutual threats or hostilities but through the very opposite route. That is why efforts at deterring so often break down. The contradiction inherent in deterrence-of tying war avoidance to war preparation, of seeking security through promoting hostility-is not necessarily fatal in the case of conventional weapons and warfare. One can sometimes use conventional weapons to protect oneself and one's country. But security can never be generated if nuclear deterrence breaks down and a nuclear attack or exchange takes place. If the country that suffers a first nuclear strike decides to launch a retaliatory nuclear attack on the aggressor country, this would only he an act of revenge, not of security. It could even push the initiator to launch further attacks. Whatever security value nuclear weapons may be said to possess resides only in the threat of their use, not in their actual use. But the contradiction inherent in deterrence always raises the prospect of a breakdown and of actual use of nuclear weapons. To rely on nuclear deterrence is thus to place a burden of expectations and hope on nuclear weapons and their possession that is never similarly placed on conventional weapons. It is to believe that nuclear deterrence will always hold for as long as one wants it to, although one can never control fully the conditions in which deterrence is supposed to successfully operate. That is why to subscribe to nuclear deterrence as a doctrine or belief system and to pin ones hopes for security on it, is nothing but an irrational act of faith.<br />

<strong>The Psychopathology of Mega-Death:</strong><br />
<strong>The violence of nuclear weapons embodied in the affirmative’s call for enhancing the United States’ deterrent capability permeates every aspect of our lives and institutionalizes a regime of fear that inhibits our ability to live and to love. This constitutes psychological violence and negates the value to life.</strong><br />

Nuclearism does not remain confined to the nuclear establishment or the nuclear community. It introduces other psychopathologies in a society. For instance, as it seeps into public consciousness, it creates a new awareness of the transience of life. It forces people to live with the constant fear that, one day, a sudden war or accident might kill not only them, but also their children and grandchildren, and everybody they love. This awareness gradually creates a sense of the hollowness of life. For many, life is denuded of substantive meaning. The psychological numbing I have mentioned completes the picture. While the ordinary citizen leads an apparently normal life, he or she is constantly aware of the transience of such life and the risk of mega-death for the entire society. Often this finds expression in unnecessary or inexplicable violence in social life or in a more general, high state of anxiety and a variety of psychosomatic ailments. In other words, nuclearism begins to brutalise ordinary people and vitiates everyday life. Studies by the likes of William Beardslee, J. E. Mach and Eleonora Masini show that these traits express themselves even in adolescents and children. Even children barely eight or ten years old begin to live in what they consider to be a world without a future; they are fearful and anxious about their life, but unable to express that fear and anxiety directly, because in a nuclearised society the fear of nuclear death is made to look like an abnormal psychoneurotic state. Many neurotics and psychotics at first look like charming eccentrics. To start with, nuclearism may appear a smart game and the partisans of nuclear weaponry may look like normal politicians, scholars, or defence experts. After all, the Nazis killers, too, were usually loving fathers, connoisseurs of good music, and honest citizens. However, beneath those facade lies a personality that is insecure, doubtful about one's masculinity, fearful of the interpersonal world, and unable to love. The mindless violence such a personality anticipates or plans is a pathetic attempt to fight these inner feelings of emptiness, and the suspicion and the fear that one's moral self might already be dead within. You father the unthinkable because you have already psychologically orphaned your-self. You make contingency plans to kill millions because you fear that your inner-most core has already been cauterised against all normal feelings and human relations. Acquiring the power to inflict the death on millions, and by living with the fantasy of that power, you pathetically try to get some confirmation that you are still alive. However, that confirmation never comes. For in the process of acquiring that power, you may not be not dead physically, but you are already dead morally, socially and psychologically.<br />

<strong>The Rationality of Irrationality</strong><br />
<strong>First, the affirmative’s defenses of deterrence rely on a flawed devotion to rationality – in reality deterrence breaks down because of miscalculation.</strong><br />

[“The Irrationality of Deterrence: A Modern Zen Koan,” April 7, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1051:http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2000/04/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2000/04/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2000/04/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1051 --> 07_krieger_irrationality.htm, Accessed 01-20-2006]<br />
The concept of deterrence, which underlies the nuclear weapons policies of the United States and other nuclear weapons states, presupposes human rationality in all cases. It is based upon the proposition that a rational person will not attack you if he understands that his country will be subject to unacceptable damage by retaliation. What rational person would want his country to be exposed to unacceptable damage? Perhaps one who miscalculates. A rational person could believe that he could take action X, and that would not be sufficient for you to retaliate. Saddam Hussein, for example, believed that he could invade Kuwait without retaliation from the United States. He miscalculated, in part because he had been misled by the American Ambassador to Iraq who informed him that the US would not retaliate. Misinformation, misunderstanding, or misconstruing information could lead a rational person to miscalculate. We don't always get our information straight, and we seldom have all of the facts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second, the affirmative’s scenario planning and claims to improve the quality of the United States’ deterrent capability requires us to contemplate and plan for the extermination of hundreds of millions of people – this is patently immoral and sets a precedent that other countries will use to justify their own genocidal policies. The only hope is for individuals in the U.S. to reject nuclearist policies like the plan.</strong><br />

Even more detrimental to the theory of deterrence is irrationality. Can anyone seriously believe that humans always act rationally? Of course not. We are creatures who are affected by emotions and passions as well as intellect. Rationality is not to be relied upon. People do not always act in their own best interests. Examples abound. Almost everyone knows that smoking causes terrible diseases and horrible deaths, and yet hundreds of millions of people continue to smoke. We know that the stock markets are driven by passions as much as they are by rationality. The odds are against winning at the gambling tables in Las Vegas, and yet millions of people accept the odds, believing that they can win despite the odds. Nuclear deterrence is based on rationality -- the belief that a rational leader will not attack a country with nuclear weapons for fear of retaliation. And yet, it is clearly irrational to believe that rationality will always prevail. Let me put it another way. Isn't it irrational for a nation to rely upon deterrence, which is based upon humans always acting rationally (which they don't), to provide for its national security? Those who champion deterrence appear rational, but in fact prove their irrationality by their unfounded faith in human rationality. With nuclear deterrence, the deterring country threatens to retaliate with nuclear weapons if it is attacked. What if a country is attacked by nuclear weapons, but is unable to identify the source of the attack? How does it retaliate? Obviously, it either guesses, retaliates against an innocent country, or doesn't retaliate. So much for deterrence. What if a national leader or terrorist with a nuclear weapon believed he could attack without being identified? It doesn't matter whether he is right or wrong. It is his belief that he is unidentifiable that matters. So much for deterrence. What if a leader of a country doesn't care if his country is retaliated against? What if he believes he has nothing more to lose, like a nuclear-armed Hitler in his bunker? So much for deterrence! It takes only minimal analysis to realize that nuclear deterrence is a fool's game. The unfortunate corollary is that those who propound nuclear deterrence are fools in wise men's garb. The further corollary is that we have entrusted the future of the human species to a small group of fools. These include the political and military leaders, the corporate executives who support them and profit from building the weapons systems, and the academics and other intellectuals like Henry Kissinger, who provide the theoretical underpinnings for the concept of deterrence. The Immorality of Nuclear Weapons Eleven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, we continue to live in a world in which a small number of nations rely upon the theory of deterrence to provide for their national security. In doing so, they threaten to kill tens of millions or perhaps hundreds of millions of innocent people by retaliation should deterrence fail. To perhaps state what should be obvious, but doesn't appear to our leaders to be: This is highly immoral. It also sets an extremely bad example for other states, whose leaders just might be thinking: If the strongest nations in the world are continuing to rely upon nuclear weapons for their national security, shouldn't we be doing so also? Fortunately, most leaders in most countries are concluding that they should not. There is only one way out of the dilemma we are in, and that is to begin immediately to abolish nuclear weapons. This happens also to be required by international law as stated in Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and as decided unanimously in the 1996 opinion of the International Court of Justice: &quot;There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control.&quot; Morality, the law, and rationality converge in the need to rid the world of nuclear weapons. This is the greatest challenge of our time. The will of the people on this issue is being blocked by only a few leaders in a few countries. As the world's most powerful nation, leadership should fall most naturally to the United States. Unfortunately, the policies of the United States have been driven by irrationality to the detriment of our own national security and the future of life on our planet. This is unlikely to change until the people of the United States exercise their democratic rights and demand policies that will end the nuclear threat to humanity. These include: negotiating a multilateral treaty for the phased elimination of nuclear weapons under strict and effective international control; de-alerting nuclear weapons and separating warheads from delivery vehicles; making pledges of No First Use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances; stopping all nuclear testing and ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; reaffirming the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty; and applying strict international safeguards to all weapons-grade fissile materials and agreeing to no further production of such materials.<br />

The sound of one hand clapping is silence. That is the sound of most people in most places in response to the nuclear weapons policies of the nuclear weapons states. While they do not applaud these policies with both hands, they also do not raise their voices to oppose them. The sound of one finger pressing the button is the sound of a deeper silence, brought about by unrelenting apathy. It is the sound of the silence before a more final silence. It is an unbearable silence `for its consequences are beyond our power to repair. It is a silent death knell for humanity. We must raise our voices now with passion and commitment to prevent this pervasive silence from becoming the sound of our world.<br />

There are other serious problems with the mere possession of nuclear weapons, even before anybody uses them. One of them is that a person's character is defined not just by deeds after the fact, but largely by what a person is willing to do, plans to do, and will refrain from doing. If I am willing to infect a city with smallpox, or release nerve gas in a subway, and I plan to do so, I am morally depraved as a person, even if I have not yet gotten around to actually performing those actions. With a heavy heart I must confess that I have become convinced the same holds true for our planning to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons make it impossible to protect civilians from injury and death, as required by the Nuremberg Principles and any normal person's sense of restraint. Nuclear weapon explosions release massive amounts of radioactive poisons, which rain down on thousands of square miles of the surrounding land, cities, towns and people. Our readiness to use them is thus, God help us, our readiness to commit mass murder and poisoning. What is left of our character after that? This is another of the many reasons why I have decided to say no to the use of nuclear weapons on my behalf under any circumstances. The moral issue just described points to the public side of character. There is also the subjective side of life. How do I feel about being alive? How do I feel about being me? How do I feel about people planning to commit mass murder on my behalf? If I have qualms of conscience, I am sure that I can blot them out of awareness with sufficient quantities of drugs, alcohol and/or violent entertainment. Or perhaps just get very buried in my work, buried enough that I don't feel much about the world around me. The question is, what is left of my life after I do that? So, what is an ordinary citizen to do? Nuclear weapons programs began in secrecy and continue to this day to be shrouded in secrecy and far from citizen influence. And yet, as citizens in a democracy, we have an open-ended responsibility for all that is done in our names. It occurred to me that one beginning step I could take to fulfill that responsibility would be to very publicly withdraw my consent from this process, and to do this in a way that is consistent with the seriousness of the issue. Hence the documents on the following pages, and suggestions for signing them and sending them to your elected representatives. (Please feel free to compose your own.) I may not individually be able to stop the United States from its nuclear folly, but I can at least tell public officials not to invoke my name as a justification for it. Yes, I am trying to save my own soul, trying to hang on to some personal integrity as a citizen of a country that denounces weapons of mass destruction while secretly planning to use them in expanding ways. Perhaps if many people take this personal responsibility for what is being done in their name, the soul of our world might be saved. I know one thing for sure. If I die in a mass murder attack on the United States, I do not want additional mass murders committed in my name. Someone, somewhere must say stop, turn, turn toward life, turn away from the instruments of death. I invite you to study, reflect, pray and join me in making such a statement.<br />

 <strong>SUBPOINT A: GUNS DON’T KILL PEOPLE, PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>THE ASSUMPTION THAT CIRCUMSTANCES CAUSE VIOLENCE IS MISGUIDED – EVERY VIOLENT ACT REQUIRES AN INDIVIDUAL TO CHOOSE TO COMMIT VIOLENCE.</strong><br />

Violence is a ubiquitous reality in our society. Violence is also a topic of public debate, although context and manner of discussion vary — from racist violence, sexual violence, the violence of youth and youth culture, the increase of violence in society, to the violence of war and the question whether it could be stopped by the use of greater violence. Violence is categorized into acts of violence, to be listed and prosecuted by the law. Violence is named after its victims: violence against women, sexual abuse of children, exploitation of animals, attacks on old people, hatred of foreigners, anti-Semitism — except where the violence is attributed to such marginal groups of society that any association with those naming it seems out of the question: the violence of today’s youth, right extremism and neo-Nazi violence, hooliganism, or racist attacks where this means attacks by ‘racist groups’. What is striking is that the violence which is talked about is always the violence committed by someone else: women talk about the violence of men, adults about the violence of young people; the left, liberals and the centre about the violence of right extremists; the right, centre and liberals about the violence of leftist extremists; political activists talk about structural violence, police and politicians about violence in the ‘street’, and all together about the violence in our society. Similarly, Westerners talk about violence in the Balkans, Western citizens together with their generals about the violence of the Serbian army. Violence is recognized and measured by its visible effects, the spectacular blood of wounded bodies, the material destruction of [end page 1] objects, the visible damage left in the world of ‘objects’. In its measurable damage we see the proof that violence has taken place, the violence being reduced to this damage. The violation as such, or invisible forms of violence — the non-physical violence of threat and terror, of insult and humiliation, the violation of human dignity — are hardly ever the issue except to some extent in feminist and anti-racist analyses, or under the name of psychological violence. Here violence is recognized by the victims and defined from their perspective — an important step away from the catalogue of violent acts and the exclusive evidence of material traces in the object. Yet even here the focus tends to be on the effects and experience of violence, either the objective and scientific measure of psychological damage, or the increasingly subjective definition of violence as experience. Violence is perceived as a phenomenon for science to research and for politics to get a grip on. But violence is not a phenomenon: it is the behaviour of people, human action which may be analysed. What is missing is an analysis of violence as action — not just as acts of violence, or the cause of its effects, but as the actions of people in relation to other people and beings or things. Feminist critique, as well as other political critiques, has analysed the preconditions of violence, the unequal power relations which enable it to take place. However, under the pressure of mainstream science and a sociological perspective which increasingly dominates our thinking, it is becoming standard to argue as if it were these power relations which cause the violence. Underlying is a behaviourist model which prefers to see human action as the exclusive product of circumstances, ignoring the personal decision of the agent to act, implying in turn that circumstances virtually dictate certain forms of behaviour. Even though we would probably not underwrite these propositions in their crass form, there is nevertheless a growing tendency, not just in social science, to explain violent behaviour by its circumstances. (Compare the question, ‘Does pornography cause violence?’) The circumstances identified may differ according to the politics of the explainers, but the method of explanation remains the same.<br />
<br />
<strong>SUBPOINT B: THE DISPLACEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>THE AFFIRMATIVE’S APPROACH IS A FORM OF COLLECTIVE VICTIM-BLAMING THAT STIGMATIZES ENTIRE GROUPS IN ORDER TO EXONERATE INDIVIDUAL PERPETRATORS – THEIR FLAWED METHODOLOGY DISPLACES RESPONSIBILITY AND TURNS THE CASE – THEY HAVE MISIDENTIFIED THE CAUSE OF THEIR HARMS.</strong><br />

While consideration of mitigating circumstances has its rightful place in a court of law trying (and defending) an offender, this does not automatically make it an adequate or sufficient practice for political analysis. It begs the question, in particular, ‘What is considered to be part of the circumstances (and by whom)?’ Thus in the case of sexual [end page 2] offenders, there is a routine search — on the part of the tabloid press or the professionals of violence — for experiences of violence in the offender’s own past, an understanding which is rapidly solidifying in the scientific model of a ‘cycle of violence’. That is, the relevant factors are sought in the distant past and in other contexts of action, while a crucial factor in the present context is ignored, namely the agent’s decision to act as he did. Even politically oppositional groups are not immune to this mainstream sociologizing. Some left groups have tried to explain men’s sexual violence as the result of class oppression, while some Black theoreticians have explained the violence of Black men as the result of racist oppression. The ostensible aim of these arguments may be to draw attention to the pervasive and structural violence of classism and racism, yet they not only fail to combat such inequality, they actively contribute to it. Although such oppression is a very real part of an agent’s life context, these ‘explanations’ ignore the fact that not everyone experiencing the same oppression uses violence, that is, that these circumstances do not ‘cause’ violent behaviour. They overlook, in other words, that the perpetrator has decided to violate, even if this decision was made in circumstances of limited choice. To overlook this decision, however, is itself a political decision, serving particular interests. In the first instance it serves to exonerate the perpetrators, whose responsibility is thus transferred to circumstances and a history for which other people (who remain beyond reach) are responsible. Moreover, it helps to stigmatize all those living in poverty and oppression; because they are obvious victims of violence and oppression, they are held to be potential perpetrators themselves.1 This slanders all the women who have experienced sexual violence, yet do not use violence against others, and libels those experiencing racist and class oppression, yet do not necessarily act out violence. Far from supporting those oppressed by classist, racist or sexist oppression, it sells out these entire groups in the interest of exonerating individual members. It is a version of collective victim-blaming, of stigmatizing entire social strata as potential hotbeds of violence, which rests on and perpetuates the mainstream division of society into so-called marginal groups — the classic clienteles of social work and care politics (and of police repression) — and an implied ‘centre’ to which all the speakers, explainers, researchers and carers themselves belong, and which we are to assume to be a zone of non-violence.<br />
<br />
<strong>SUBPOINT C: THE MOMENT OF DECISION</strong><br />
<strong>THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO ADOPT A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO VIOLENCE. INSTEAD OF VIEWING VIOLENCE AS A PRODUCT OF CIRCUMSTANCES, WE SHOULD INTERROGATE THE MOMENT OF DECISION WHEN INDIVIDUALS CHOOSE TO COMMIT VIOLENCE. THIS METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH ENABLES EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE TO THE VIOLENT IDEOLOGY OF THE AFFIRMATIVE AND IS A NECESSARY PRECONDITION TO REMEDYING THE HARMS THEY HAVE OUTLINED.</strong><br />

[&quot;Violence and the will to violence,&quot; The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, Published by Polity Press (Cambridge, UK), ISBN 0745613047, p. 5-7]<br />
A politics aiming at a change in people’s behaviour would require political work that is very much more cumbersome and very much less promising of success than is the use of state power and social control. It would require political consciousness-raising — politicizing the way we think — which cannot be imposed on others by force or compulsory educational measures. It would require a view of people which takes seriously and reckons with their will, both their will to violence or their will to change. To take seriously the will of others however would mean recognizing one’s own, and putting people’s will, including our own, at the centre of political reflection. A political analysis of violence needs to recognize this will, the personal decision in favour of violence — not just to describe acts of violence, or the conditions which enable them to take place, but also to capture the moment of decision which is the real impetus for violent action. For without this decision there will be no violent act, not even in circumstances which potentially permit it. It is the decision to violate, not just the act itself, which makes a person a perpetrator of violence — just as it is the decision not to do so which makes people not act violently and not abuse their power in a situation which would nevertheless permit it. This moment of decision, therefore, is also the locus of potential resistance to violence. To understand the structures of thinking and the criteria by which such decisions are reached, but above all to regard this decision as an act of choice, seems to me a necessary precondition for any political struggle against violence and for a non-violent society. My focus, then, is on the decision to violate — not just in circumstances where violence is conspicuous by its damage, but in every situation where the choice to violate presents itself. This means a change from the accustomed perspective on violence to the context where decisions for actions are being made, as it were ‘before’ their consequences become apparent, and which we may not recognize as [end page 5] contexts of violence. Our political analyses of sexual or racist violence have necessarily concentrated on situations where the power disequilibrium between perpetrator and victim is extreme, where, in particular, it is supported by social power structures such as male and/or white supremacy, so that not only is the violence unlikely to receive sanctions, but on the contrary, the perpetrator will find support rather than the victim. Violence, however, is a possibility wherever there is freedom of action, however limited. Such violence may ‘look’ different, not least because the possibilities for resistance may also be greater in situations where there is relative freedom of action also on the part of the other agent, that is, the violator’s envisaged victim. The feminist critique of sexism, together with our early recognition of the necessity of raising our own consciousness, constitutes an understanding that ideology itself is a site of power and the abuse of power — that is, that our own thinking and, by extension, our own behaviour are already a primary area for a liberatory politics. Moreover, a politics aiming at social equality and relations between equals should make it its central concern to reflect upon the structure of such relations — what it means to relate to others as equals. We have analysed and made a critique of abusive behaviour, where men choose to treat women as unequals, or whites to treat Black people as unequals, being able to do so with sanctioned impunity. This would imply an analysis also of action and behaviour which by contrast is based on choosing equality — in particular, choosing to grant equality to others, choosing not to violate others in situations which permit that choice, all the more so as it is our conviction that it is not people who are (by virtue of their ‘identity’) unequal, whom we then necessarily relate to as ‘unequals’, but that inequality is a matter of treating and being treated unequally. Conversely, we cannot assume that if there are two ‘equals’, their relations will necessarily be (or remain) equal. Rather, we should investigate how relationships of potential equality may, through the action of one or the other or both agents involved, be restructured into relations of dominance and submission. Action — and especially the will to power and violence — is a vital factor in the continually changing ‘structure’ of a relationship, combining with those factors we normally consider to constitute the structural context of the relation. This means engaging also with the discourses which construct violence as a phenomenon but obliterate the agent’s decision to [end page 6] violate. Our unwillingness to recognize the will of those who act violently as their will to act violently, our readiness to exonerate violent behaviour by means of spurious explanations, not only betrays our primary identification with the subjects of violence and our lack of solidarity with the victims. It is itself an act of violence: the exercise of ideological violence, of the power of a discourse which legitimates violence, stigmatizes the victims, and treats people not as the agents of their own actions but as material for (‘our’) social policy. Ideology, however, is not just made by others; we are all of us subjects of ideology — as the producers of our own thinking and as the recipients of other people’s discourse — unless we resist such ideological structures of thought and discourse in a continual critique of ideology itself.<br />

[Superpower Syndrome: America’s Apocalyptic Confrontation With The World, Published by Thunder’s Mouth Press / Nation Books, ISBN 1560255129, p. 1-4]<br />
The apocalyptic imagination has spawned a new kind of violence at the beginning of the twenty-first century. We can, in fact, speak of a worldwide epidemic of violence aimed at massive destruction in the service of various visions of purification and renewal. In particular, we are experiencing what could be called an apocalyptic face-off between Islamist* forces, overtly visionary in their willingness to kill and die for their religion, and American forces claiming to be restrained and reasonable but no less visionary in their projection of a cleansing war-making and military power. Both sides are [end page 1] energized by versions of intense idealism; both see themselves as embarked on a mission of combating evil in order to redeem and renew the world; and both are ready to release untold levels of violence to achieve that purpose. The war on Iraq—a country with longstanding aspirations toward weapons of mass destruction but with no evident stockpiles of them and no apparent connection to the assaults of September 11—was a manifestation of that American visionary projection. The religious fanaticism of Osama bin Laden and other Islamist zealots has, by now, a certain familiarity to us as to others elsewhere, for their violent demands for spiritual purification are aimed as much at fellow Islamics as at American “infidels.” Their fierce attacks on the defilement that they believe they see everywhere in contemporary life resemble those of past movements and sects from all parts of the world; such sects, with end-of-the-world prophecies and devout violence in the service of bringing those prophecies about, flourished in Europe from the eleventh through the sixteenth century. Similar sects like the fanatical Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo, which released sarin gas into the Tokyo subways in 1995, have existed—even proliferated—in our own time. The American apocalyptic entity is less familiar to us. Even if its urges to power and domination seem historically recognizable, it nonetheless represents a new constellation of forces bound up with what I’ve come to think of [end page 2] as “superpower syndrome.” By that term I mean a national mindset—put forward strongly by a tight-knit leadership group—that takes on a sense of omnipotence, of unique standing in the world that grants it the right to hold sway over all other nations. The American superpower status derives from our emergence from World War II as uniquely powerful in every respect, still more so as the only superpower left standing at the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s. More than merely dominate, the American superpower now seeks to control history. Such cosmic ambition is accompanied by an equally vast sense of entitlement, of special dispensation to pursue its aims. That entitlement stems partly from historic claims to special democratic virtue, but has much to do with an embrace of technological power translated into military terms. That is, a superpower—the world’s only superpower—is entitled to dominate and control precisely because it is a superpower. The murderous events of 9/11 hardened that sense of entitlement as nothing else could have. Superpower syndrome did not require 9/11, but the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon rendered us an aggrieved superpower, a giant violated and made vulnerable, which no superpower can permit. Indeed, at the core of superpower syndrome lies a powerful fear of vulnerability. A superpower’s victimization brings on both a sense of humiliation and an angry determination to restore, or even [end page 3] extend, the boundaries of a superpower-dominated world. Integral to superpower syndrome are its menacing nuclear stockpiles and their world-destroying capacity. Throughout the decades of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union both lived with a godlike nuclear capacity to obliterate the cosmos, along with a fear of being annihilated by the enemy power. Now America alone possesses that world-destroying capacity, and post-Soviet Russia no longer looms as a nuclear or superpower adversary. We have yet to grasp the full impact of this exclusive capacity to blow up anyone or everything, but its reverberations are never absent in any part of the world. The confrontation between Islamist and American versions of planetary excess has unfortunately tended to define a world in which the vast majority of people embrace neither. But apocalyptic excess needs no majority to dominate a landscape. All the more so when, in their mutual zealotry, Islamist and American leaders seem to act in concert. That is, each, in its excess, nurtures the apocalypticism of the other, resulting in a malignant synergy. * In keeping with general usage, Islamist refers to groups that are essentially theocratic and fundamentalist, and at times apocalyptic. Islamic is a more general ethnic as well as religious term for Muslims. The terms can of course overlap, and “Islamic state” can mean one run on Islamist principles.<br />

<strong>SUBPOINT B: THE MYTH OF INVULNERABILITY</strong><br />
<strong>THIS PURSUIT OF CONTROL IS A PRODUCT OF DEATH ANXIETY – THE ILLUSION OF INVULNERABILITY IS AN ATTEMPT TO COPE WITH THE REALITY OF OUR EXISTENCE IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD.

It is almost un-American to be vulnerable. As a people, we pride ourselves on being able to stand up to anything, solve all problems. We have long had a national self-image that involves an ability to call forth reservoirs or strength when we need it, and a sense of a protected existence peculiar to America in an otherwise precarious world. In recent times we managed, after all, to weather the most brutal century in human history relatively unscathed. THE BLESSED COUNTRY Our attitude stems partly from geography. We have always claimed a glorious aloneness thanks to what has been called the “Free security” of the two great oceans which separate us from dangerous upheavals in Europe and Asia. While George Washington was not the isolationist he is sometimes represented to be, he insisted on his celebrated Farewell Address of 1796, “’Tis our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world.” That image has been embraced, and often simplified or distorted, by politicians ever since. (He warned against permanent alliances, not alliances in general). The idea of our separateness and safety from faraway conflicts has had importance from the time of the early settlers, many of whom left Europe to escape political religious, or legal threats or entanglements. Even if one came as an adventurer or an empire-builder, one was leaving a continent of complexity and conflict for a land whose remoteness could support new beginnings. Abraham Lincoln absolutized that remoteness and security from outside attack in order to stress that our only danger came from ourselves: “All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest; with a Buonaparte for a commander, could not by force, take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years.” However much the world has shrunk technologically in the last half century, and however far-ranging our own superpower forays, that sense of geographic invulnerability has never left us. We have seen ourselves as not only separate from but different from the rest of the world, a special nation among nations. That sense of American exceptionalism was intensely observed by Alexis de Tocqueville, the brilliant French politician and writer, in the early nineteenth century. In de Tocqueville’s view of America, “A course almost without limits, a field without horizon, is revealed: the human spirit rushes forward and traverses [it] in every direction.” American exceptionalism has always been, as the sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset has pointed out, “a double-edged sword.” In the psychological life of Americans it has been bound up with feelings of unique virtue, strength, and success. But this has sometimes led Americans to be “utopian moralists, who press hard to institutionalize virtue, to destroy evil people, and eliminate wicked institutions and practices.” That subjective exceptionalism has been vividly expressed in the historian Richard Hofstadter’s observation, “It has been our fate as a nation not to have ideologies, but to be one.” At the time of the Puritans, sentiments of exceptionalism were expressed in biblical terms: America was an “Arcadian image of the New World … an Eden from which the serpent and forbidden trees had been thoroughly excluded,” and “a new Promised Land and a New Jerusalem.” The language was that of a postapocalyptic utopia, and remnants of such sentiments persist whenever we speak of ourselves in more secular terms as the “new world.” Important to this feeling of exceptionalism has been a deep sense that America offered unparalleled access to regenerative power. As Richard Slotkin explains: “The first colonists saw in America an opportunity to regenerate [end page 127] their fortunes, their spirits, and the power of their church and nation,” though “the means to that regeneration ultimately became the means of violence.” Even when Americans played what has been called a “shell game of identity,” they could experience an unlimited capacity for renewal—endless new beginnings as individuals or as a nation. Slotkin speaks of a new relationship to authority in this new world. While “in Europe all men were under authority; in America all men dreamed they had the power to become authority.” These claims of new authority extended to the country as a whole, to America’s authority among nations—a claim to new national authority that was expanded over time thanks to America’s considerable achievements—economic, technological, scientific, and cultural. American exceptionalism has often had the overall psychological quality of a sense of ourselves as a blessed people, immune from the defeats and sufferings of others. But underneath that sense there had to be a potential chink in our psychological armor—which was a deep-seated if hidden sense of vulnerability. OMNIPOTENCE AND VULNERABILITY Ironically, superpower syndrome projects the problem of American vulnerability onto the world stage. A superpower is perceived as possessing more than natural power. [end page 128] (In this sense it comes closer to resembling the comic-strip hero Superman than the Nietzschean Superman.) For a nation, its leaders, or even its ordinary citizens to enter into the superpower syndrome is to lay claim to omnipotence, to power that is unlimited, which is ultimately power over death. At the heart of the superpower syndrome then is the need to eliminate a vulnerability that, as the antithesis of omnipotence, contains the basic contradiction of the syndrome. For vulnerability can never be eliminated, either by a nation or an individual. In seeking its elimination, the superpower finds itself on a psychological treadmill. The idea of vulnerability is intolerable, the fact of it irrefutable. One solution is to maintain an illusion of invulnerability. But the superpower then runs the danger of taking increasingly draconian actions to sustain that illusion. For to do otherwise would be to surrender the cherished status of superpower. Other nations have experiences in the world that render them and their citizens all too aware of the essential vulnerability of life on earth. They also may be influenced by religious and cultural traditions (far weaker in the United States) that emphasize vulnerability as an aspect of human mortality. No such reality can be accepted by those clinging to a sense of omnipotence. At issue is the experience of death anxiety, which is the strongest manifestation of vulnerability. Such a deep-seated [end page 129] sense of vulnerability can sometimes be acknowledged by the ordinary citizens of a superpower, or even at times by its leaders, who may admit, for instance, that there is no guaranteed defense against terrorist acts. But those leaders nonetheless remain committed to eliminating precisely that vulnerability—committed, that is, to the illusory goal of invulnerability. When that goal is repeatedly undermined—whether by large-scale terrorist acts like 9/11, or as at present by militant resistance to American hegemony in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East—both the superpower and the world it acts upon may become dangerously destabilized.<br />

<strong>SUBPOINT C: STEPPING OFF THE TREADMILL</strong><br />

We can do better. America is capable of wiser, more measured approaches, more humane applications of our considerable power and influence in the world. These may not be as far away as they now seem, and can be made closer by bringing our imaginations to bear on them. Change must be political, of course, but certain psychological contours seem necessary to it. As a start, we do not have to collude in partitioning the world into two contending apocalyptic forces. We are capable instead of reclaiming our moral compass, of finding further balance in our national behavior. So intensely have we embraced superpower syndrome that emerging from it is not an easy task. Yet in doing so we would relieve ourselves of a burden of our own creation—the psychic burden of insistent illusion. For there is no [end page 189] greater weight than that one takes on when pursuing total power. We need to draw a new and different lesson from Lord Acton's nineteenth-century assertion: &quot;Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot; Acton was not quite right. The corruption begins not with the acquisition of power but with the quest for and claim to absolute power. Ever susceptible to the seductive promise that twenty-first-century technology can achieve world control, the superpower can best resist that temptation by recognizing the corruption connected with that illusion. STEPPING OFF THE TREADMILL To renounce the claim to total power would bring relief not only to everyone else, but, soon enough, to citizens of the superpower itself. For to live out superpower syndrome is to place oneself on a treadmill that eventually has to break down. In its efforts to rule the world and to determine history, the United States is, in actuality, working against itself, subjecting itself to constant failure. It becomes a Sisyphus with bombs, able to set off explosions but unable to cope with its own burden, unable to roll its heavy stone to the top of the hill in Hades. Perhaps the crucial step in ridding ourselves of superpower syndrome is recognizing that history cannot be controlled, fluidly or otherwise. Stepping off the superpower treadmill would also enable us to cease being a nation ruled by fear. [end page 190] Renouncing omnipotence might make our leaders—or at least future leaders—themselves less fearful of weakness, and diminish their inclination to instill fear in their people as a means of enlisting them for military efforts at illusory world hegemony. Without the need for invulnerability, everyone would have much less to be afraid of. What we call the historical process is largely unpredictable, never completely manageable. All the more so at a time of radical questioning of the phenomenon of nationalism and its nineteenth- and twentieth-century excesses. In addition, there has been a general decline in confidence in the nation state, and in its ability to protect its people from larger world problems such as global warming or weapons of mass destruction. The quick but dangerous substitute is the superpower, which seeks to fill the void with a globalized, militarized extension of American nationalism. The traditional nation state, whatever its shortcomings, could at least claim to be grounded in a specific geographic area and a particular people or combination of peoples. The superpower claims to &quot;represent&quot; everyone on earth, but it lacks legitimacy in the eyes of those it seeks to dominate, while its leaders must struggle to mask or suppress their own doubts about any such legitimacy. The American superpower is an artificial construct, widely perceived as illegitimate, whatever the acquiescence it coerces in others. Its reign is therefore inherently unstable. Indeed, its reach for full-scale world domination [end page 191] marks the beginning of its decline. A large task for the world, and for Americans in particular, is the early recognition and humane management of that decline.<br />

<strong>FINALLY, THIS CALL TO EMBRACE OUR VULNERABILITY IS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WITH THE AFFIRMATIVE’S CALL TO AFFIRM AMERICAN HEGEMONY. RATHER THAN ATTEMPT TO DICTATE THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD IN OUR IMAGE, WE SHOULD EMBRACE VULNERABILITY AND THE AMBIGUITY INHERENT IN LIFE ON EARTH.

Stepping out of that syndrome would also include surrendering the claim of certainty, of ownership of truth and reality. That ownership gives rise to deadly righteousness, with a claim to illumination so absolute as to transcend ordinary restraints against mass violence. The healthier alternative is an acceptance of some measure of ambiguity, of inevitable elements of confusion and contradiction, [end page 196] whether in relation to large historical events or in matters of personal experience. This would include a more nuanced approach to Islam and Islamist thought and behavior that allows for the possibility of evolution and change. It is often claimed that no such acceptance of ambiguity is possible because superpowers, like nations, like people, are uncomfortable with it, that the tendency is always to seek clarity and something close to certainty. But this assumption may well underestimate our psychological capabilities. Ambiguity, in fact, is central to human function, recognized and provided for by cultural institutions and practices everywhere. American society in particular has cultivated the kinds of ambiguity that go with multiplicity and with shifting populations and frontiers. I have tried in my past work to formulate a version of the self as many-sided, flexible, and capable of change and transformation. This protean self (named after Proteus, the Greek sea god who was capable of taking on many shapes) stands in direct contrast to the fundamentalist or apocalyptic self. Indeed, the closed fundamentalist self and its apocalyptic impulses can be understood as a reaction to protean tendencies, which are widely abroad in our world as a response to the complexities of recent history. Any contemporary claim to absolute certainty, then, is compensatory, an artificial plunge into totalism that seeks an escape from the ambiguity that so pervades our historical legacy. American society is more volatile on these matters than [end page 197] many suspect. Over the previous century and at the beginning of a new one, we have been undergoing waves of contending forms of populism—pendulum swings between totalistic impulses and more open, if less clearly formulated, protean principles. How this psychohistorical struggle will develop we have no way of knowing, but we need hardly give up on ambiguity, or on our capacity to combine it with strongly held ethical principles. There is a real sense in which elements of ambiguity are necessary to our well-being. They certainly are necessary to the well-being of our nation, and of the world. To live with ambiguity is to accept vulnerability. American aspirations toward superpower invulnerability have troubling parallels in Islamist visions of godly power. Surrendering the dream of invulnerability, more enlightened American leaders could begin to come to terms with the idea that there will always be some danger in our world, that reasonable and measured steps can be taken to limit that danger and combat threats of violence, but that invulnerability is itself a perilous illusion. To cast off that illusion would mean removing the psychological pressure of sustaining a falsified vision of the world, as opposed to taking a genuine place in the real one. Much of this has to do with accepting the fact that we die, a fact not altered by either superpower militarism or religious fanaticism. A great part of apocalyptic violence is in the service of a vast claim of immortality, a claim that [end page 198] can, in the end, often be sustained only by victimizing large numbers of people. Zealots come to depend upon their mystical, spiritual, or military vision to protect themselves from death, and to provide immortality through killing.<br />

Optimistic projects suggest that it should be possible, with the low cost rockets currently under development, to maintain a Lunar presence for a transportation cost of roughly $15,000 per kilogram. Some extreme projections suggest that if the cost can be cut to roughly triple the cost of fuel and oxidizer (meaning, the spacecraft concerned will be both largely reusable and very cheap) then we might even get as low as $165/kilogram to the lunar surface. At that price, sending a 100Kg astronaut to Moon Base One looks as if it ought to cost not much more than a first-class return air fare from the UK to New Zealand ... except that such a price estimate is hogwash. We primates have certain failure modes, and one of them that must not be underestimated is our tendency to irreversibly malfunction when exposed to climactic extremes of temperature, pressure, and partial pressure of oxygen. While the amount of oxygen, water, and food a human consumes per day doesn't sound all that serious — it probably totals roughly ten kilograms, if you economize and recycle the washing-up water — the amount of parasitic weight you need to keep the monkey from blowing out is measured in tons. A Russian Orlan-M space suit (which, some would say, is better than anything NASA has come up with over the years — take heed of the pre-breathe time requirements!) weighs 112 kilograms, which pretty much puts a floor on our infrastructure requirements. An actual habitat would need to mass a whole lot more. Even at $165/kilogram, that's going to add up to a very hefty excess baggage charge on that notional first class air fare to New Zealand — and I think the $165/kg figure is in any case highly unrealistic; even the authors of the article I cited thought $2000/kg was a bit more reasonable. Whichever way you cut it, sending a single tourist to the moon is going to cost not less than $50,000 — and a more realistic figure, for a mature reusable, cheap, rocket-based lunar transport cycle is more like $1M. And that's before you factor in the price of bringing them back ...The moon is about 1.3 light seconds away. If we want to go panning the (metaphorical) rivers for gold, we'd do better to send teleoperator-controlled robots; it's close enough that we can control them directly, and far enough away that the cost of transporting food and creature comforts for human explorers is astronomical. There probably are niches for human workers on a moon base, but only until our robot technologies are somewhat more mature than they are today; Mission Control would be a lot happier with a pair of hands and a high-def camera that doesn't talk back and doesn't need to go to the toilet or take naps. When we look at the rest of the solar system, the picture is even bleaker. Mars is ... well, the phrase &quot;tourist resort&quot; springs to mind, and is promptly filed in the same corner as &quot;Gobi desert&quot;. As Bruce Sterling has puts it: &quot;I'll believe in people settling Mars at about the same time I see people settling the Gobi Desert. The Gobi Desert is about a thousand times as hospitable as Mars and five hundred times cheaper and easier to reach. Nobody ever writes &quot;Gobi Desert Opera&quot; because, well, it's just kind of plonkingly obvious that there's no good reason to go there and live. It's ugly, it's inhospitable and there's no way to make it pay. Mars is just the same, really. We just romanticize it because it's so hard to reach.&quot; In other words, going there to explore is fine and dandy — our robots are all over it already. But as a desirable residential neighbourhood it has some shortcomings, starting with the slight lack of breathable air and the sub-Antarctic nighttime temperatures and the Mach 0.5 dust storms, and working down from there. Actually, there probably is a good reason for sending human explorers to Mars. And that's the distance: at up to 30 minutes, the speed of light delay means that remote control of robots on the Martian surface is extremely tedious. Either we need autonomous roots that can be assigned tasks and carry them out without direct human supervision, or we need astronauts in orbit or on the ground to boss the robot work gangs around. On the other hand, Mars is a good way further away than the moon, and has a deeper gravity well. All of which drive up the cost per kilogram delivered to the Martian surface. Maybe FedEx could cut it as low as $20,000 per kilogram, but I'm not holding my breath. Let me repeat myself: we are not going there with rockets. At least, not the conventional kind — and while there may be a role for nuclear propulsion in deep space, in general there's a trade-off between instantaneous thrust and efficiency; the more efficient your motor, the lower the actual thrust it provides. Some technologies such as the variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket show a good degree of flexibility, but in general they're not suitable for getting us from Earth's surface into orbit — they're only useful for trucking things around from low earth orbit on out. Again, as with interstellar colonization, there are other options. Space elevators, if we build them, will invalidate a lot of what I just said. Some analyses of the energy costs of space elevators suggest that a marginal cost of $350/kilogram to geosynchronous orbit should be achievable without waving any magic wands (other than the enormous practical materials and structural engineering problems of building the thing in the first place). So we probably can look forward to zero-gee vacations in orbit, at a price. And space elevators are attractive because they're a scalable technology; you can use one to haul into space the material to build more. So, long term, space elevators may give us not-unreasonably priced access to space, including jaunts to the lunar surface for a price equivalent to less than $100,000 in today's money. At which point, settlement would begin to look economically feasible, except ...We're human beings. We evolved to flourish in a very specific environment that covers perhaps 10% of our home planet's surface area. (Earth is 70% ocean, and while we can survive, with assistance, in extremely inhospitable terrain, be it arctic or desert or mountain, we aren't well-adapted to thriving there.) Space itself is a very poor environment for humans to live in. A simple pressure failure can kill a spaceship crew in minutes. And that's not the only threat. Cosmic radiation poses a serious risk to long duration interplanetary missions, and unlike solar radiation and radiation from coronal mass ejections the energies of the particles responsible make shielding astronauts extremely difficult. And finally, there's the travel time. Two and a half years to Jupiter system; six months to Mars. Now, these problems are subject to a variety of approaches — including medical ones: does it matter if cosmic radiation causes long-term cumulative radiation exposure leading to cancers if we have advanced side-effect-free cancer treatments? Better still, if hydrogen sulphide-induced hibernation turns out to be a practical technique in human beings, we may be able to sleep through the trip. But even so, when you get down to it, there's not really any economically viable activity on the horizon for people to engage in that would require them to settle on a planet or asteroid and live there for the rest of their lives. In general, when we need to extract resources from a hostile environment we tend to build infrastructure to exploit them (such as oil platforms) but we don't exactly scurry to move our families there. Rather, crews go out to work a long shift, then return home to take their leave. After all, there's no there there — just a howling wilderness of north Atlantic gales and frigid water that will kill you within five minutes of exposure. And that, I submit, is the closest metaphor we'll find for interplanetary colonization. Most of the heavy lifting more than a million kilometres from Earth will be done by robots, overseen by human supervisors who will be itching to get home and spend their hardship pay. And closer to home, the commercialization of space will be incremental and slow, driven by our increasing dependence on near-earth space for communications, positioning, weather forecasting, and (still in its embryonic stages) tourism. But the domed city on Mars is going to have to wait for a magic wand or two to do something about the climate, or reinvent a kind of human being who can thrive in an airless, inhospitable environment.<br />

Dangerous it will be. Detailed exploration, let alone settlement, of nearby worlds will be the single most difficult task humanity has ever tackled. Most likely, it will take many hundreds, or even thousands, of years. Our first attempts to establish a base on Earth's Moon or Mars may well fail. As on the oceans, many people will die: we cannot insist on levels of safety that make the exercise technically impractical or unaffordable.<br />

<strong>SPACE EXPLORATION CAUSES SPACE DISEASES THAT WIPE OUT LIFE ON EARTH</strong><br />
Leslie <strong>MULLEN, 2003</strong><br />
[“Alien Infection,” August 25th, Astrobiology Magazine, Available Online athttp://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=570]<br />
Chris Chyba, who holds the Carl Sagan Chair for the Study of Life in the Universe at the SETI Institute, says there are two types of potential alien pathogens: toxic and infectious. Toxic pathogens act as a poison on other organisms. Infectious pathogens are viruses or bacteria that are passed between organisms, causing sickness. Some viruses and microbes rely on specific biological systems in order to replicate and infect their host, so not all pathogens affect all organisms the same way. Chicken farmers, for instance, can remain untouched by a disease that decimates their flocks. It could be that a martian microbe would enter the human body, but is rendered harmless because it is incompatible with human physiology. &quot;After living in the dirt of Mars, a pathogen could see our bodies as a comparable host; they could treat us 'like dirt,'&quot; says John Rummel, NASA's Planetary Protection Officer. &quot;But, to quote Donald Rumsfeld, we're dealing with the unknown unknowns. It could be that even if the microbes lived inside us, they wouldn't do anything, it would just be this lump living inside you.&quot; The conditions on Mars are much different than those in the human body, so an inert pathogen seems the most likely scenario -- especially since any life on Mars would have evolved without humans being present. Co-evolution is why some pathogens only affect certain organisms. Infectious pathogens evolve based on the reactions of their hosts. As the host develops defenses against a predatory pathogen, the pathogen has to devise new means of sustaining itself within the host (or risk its own extinction). Some toxins also developed through co-evolution. As predatory organisms seek food, their prey develop ever more sophisticated means to escape being eaten. Many organisms developed specially targeted toxins as part of this evolutionary arms battle. Rummel says that humans have evolved a complex defense system to prevent us from getting sick from a whole host of disease and pathogens. But non-specific microbes - where human physiology did not influence their evolution - may evade our defense mechanisms. The best way to understand the spread of potential alien pathogens is to examine the spread of such non-specific pathogens on Earth. One example of a non-specific toxic pathogen is cyanobacteria that produce hepatotoxins (toxins affecting the liver) and neurotoxins. According to Chyba, cyanobacteria living in lakes on the alpine pastures of Switzerland have been implicated in a hundred cattle poisonings over the past 25 years. Chyba says the cyanobacteria most likely did not develop their toxins in order to escape predation from cows (or to kill the cows in order to eat them!). &quot;Rather, the susceptibility of cattle to these toxins seems simply to be an unfortunate coincidence of a toxin working across a large evolutionary distance,&quot; Chyba writes. An example of an infectious pathogen working across large evolutionary distances is the bacterium Serratia marcescens. It is found in a variety of animal species, and also can be found free-living in water and soil. Its transmission from human sewage has resulted in the decimation of Caribbean elkhorn coral. &quot;The distance between humans and corals emphasizes the possibility that certain organisms may prove pathogenic across a wide evolutionary divide,&quot; Chyba writes. Of course, the evolutionary divide between humans and coral would not be as wide a gulf as between any martian organisms and human beings. Yet one theory for the origin of life on Earth is that it was transferred here from Mars by meteorites. This variant of the &quot;Panspermia&quot; theory suggests that life on Earth and any life on Mars might be closely related. If Mars and Earth share the basis for life, this life would presumably have evolved well beyond the original form. Such a large evolutionary divide could provide protection from infection. But it could also mean that if infection does occur, it might be related closely enough to some Earth life to blaze through that population unchecked. Human infection is not the only concern of planetary protection. Life on Earth forms an interconnected, highly dependent web, so a pathogen affecting any life on Earth could have serious repercussions for the health and environment of our planet.<br />

 <strong>First—economic growth is fundamentally unsustainable – resource depletion, consumption levels, and environmental destruction prove that attempts to maintain growth are futile.</strong><br />
Ted <strong>TRAINER</strong>, Visiting Fellow in the Faculty of Arts at the University of New South Wales, <strong>2007</strong><br />
[“We can't go on living like this,” On Line Opinion - Australia's e-journal of social and political debate, April 20th, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1057:http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1057 -->? article=5754, Accessed 07-15-2008]<br />
We say we want to save the environment, and to have peace, and to eliminate poverty. And we do - but only until we see what this requires. The fundamental cause of the big global problems threatening us now is simply over-consumption. The rate at which we in rich countries are using up resources is grossly unsustainable. It’s far beyond levels that can be kept up for long or that could be spread to all people. Yet most people totally fail to grasp the magnitude of the over-shoot. The reductions required are so big that they cannot be achieved within a consumer-capitalist society. Huge and extremely radical change to very systems and culture are necessary. Several lines of argument lead to this conclusion, but I’ll note only three. Some resources are already alarmingly scarce, including water, land, fish and especially petroleum. Some geologists think petroleum supply will peak within a decade. If all the world’s people today were to consume resources at the per capita rate we in rich countries do, the annual supply rate would have to be more than six times as great as at present, and if the population of 9 billion we will have on earth soon were to do so it would have to be about ten times as great. Second, the per capita area of productive land needed to supply one Australian with food, water, settlements and energy, is about 7-8 ha. The US figure is closer to 12 ha. But the average per capita area of productive land available on the planet is only about 1.3 ha. When the world population reaches 9 billion the per capita area of productive land available will be only 0.8 ha. In other words in a world where resources were shared equally we would all have to get by on about 10 per cent of the present average Australian footprint. Third, the greenhouse problem is the most powerful and alarming illustration of the overshoot. The scientists are telling us that if we are to stop the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere from reaching twice the pre-industrial level we must cut global carbon emissions, and thus fossil fuel use, by 60 per cent in the short term, and more later. If we cut it 60 per cent and shared the remaining energy among 9 billion people each Australian would have to get by on less than 5 per cent of the fossil fuel now used. And that target, a doubling of atmospheric CO2, is much too high to be safe. We’re now 30 per cent above pre-industrial levels and already seeing disturbing climatic effects. These lines of argument show we must face up to enormous reductions in rich world resource use, perhaps by 90 per cent, if we’re to solve the big global problems. This is not possible in a society that’s committed to the affluent lifestyles that require high energy and resource use. Now all that only makes clear that the present situation is grossly unsustainable. But this society is fundamentally and fiercely obsessed with raising levels of production and consumption all the time, as fast as possible, and without any limit. In other words our supreme, sacred, never-questioned goal is economic growth. We’re already at impossible levels of production and consumption but our top priority is to go on increasing them all the time.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second—attempts to maintain growth spark global conflict – the root cause of war is the pursuit of economic expansion.</strong><br />
Ted <strong>TRAINER</strong>, Lecturer in Sociology at the University of New South Wales, <strong>1998</strong><br />
[&quot;Our Unsustainable Society: Basic Causes, Interconnections, and Solutions,&quot; The Coming Age of Scarcity: Preventing Mass Death and Genocide in the Twenty-first Century, edited by Michael N. Dobkowski and Isidor Wallimann, Published by Syracuse University Press, ISBN 0815627440, p. 91-92]<br />
Some of the most disturbing implications of the limits-to-growth analysis of the global situation arise regarding the problems of peace and conflict. The foregoing argument has been that only a few can have the life-styles that we in rich countries have, and we can have them only for a historically short period, because there are not enough resources for all to rise to anything like the living standards we take for granted. But we who have per capita incomes averaging sixty times those of the poorest half of the world’s people are obsessed with getting richer as fast as possible and without end. Now, if we and all others continue to pursue that goal, as population doubles, and resources become scarcer, there can be no other conceivable outcome than increasing levels of conflict in the world. Much of the foregoing argument has been that we have an empire, a sphere of influence, without which our living standards could not be as high as they are. We have to be extensively involved in military activity to secure our lines of supply from the empire. We could not be sure of getting all that oil from the Middle East if we did not have aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean, rapid deployment forces specially trained and ready to fly into trouble spots, minesweepers able to clear vital shipping lanes, the military presence that stands as a warning to others that they had better not interfere with “our” oil fields, and the contingency plans for dealing with any rebel tribesmen or any sectional uprising that might cut the pipelines. We must be able to protect our allies, interests, trading arrangements, and clients. United States Army Gen. M. D. Taylor said that “U.S. military priorities must be shifted. . . towards insuring a steady flow of resources from the Third World.” He referred to “a fierce competition among industrial powers for the same raw materials markets sought by the United States” and “growing hostility displayed by have-not nations towards their affluent counterparts” (Cypher 1981). Speaking to American soldiers at Camp Stanly, Korea, President Johnson said, “Don’t forget, there are two hundred million of us in a world of three billion. They want what we’ve got—and we’re not going to give it to them!” Ashley says that “expansion is a prime source of conflict. War is mainly explicable in terms of differential growth in a world of scarce and unevenly distributed resources” (1980, 3, 126). Nettleship makes the same point: “War is an inevitable result of the struggle between [end page 91] economies for expansion” (1975, 497). Chase-Dunn says that “warfare appears as a normal and periodic form of competition within the capitalist world economy.. . . World wars regularly occur during a period of economic expansion” (1989, 108, 163). In other words, the main source of conflict and war in the world is the ceaseless quest for greater wealth and power. We have no chance of achieving a peaceful world until nations stop being greedy and work out how to live without constantly striving to grow richer. Yet, the supreme commitment in our economy is to rapid and ceaseless growth!<br />

<strong>Third—economic collapse is inevitable – growth can only delay the collapse of modern industrial civilization, not prevent it.</strong><br />

Thus, the rapid expansion of modern industrial civilization since the 1600s, which modern peoples understand as progress, is destroying the earth and threatening the human future (Hauchier and Kennedy 1994). Since the birth of the modern world, we have witnessed accelerating global population growth, air and water pollution, destruction of forests, farmland, and fisheries, depletion of nonrenewable natural resources, loss of biodiversity, and increasing poverty and misery throughout the nonmodern world (Brown and Kane 1994). In Worldwatch’s State of the World 1995, Hilary French (1995, 171) concludes: “The relentless pace of global ecological decline shows no signs of letting up. Carbon dioxide concentrations are mounting in the atmosphere, species loss continues to accelerate, fisheries are collapsing, land degradation frustrates efforts to feed hungry people, and the earth’s forest cover keeps shrinking.” And in his introduction to State of the World 1995, Lester Brown (1995) warns that eroding soils, shrinking forests, deteriorating rangelands, expanding deserts, acid rain, stratospheric ozone depletion, the buildup of greenhouse gases, air pollution, and the loss of biological diversity threatens global food production and future economic growth. How could this rapid growth in wealth, population, science and technology, and human control over the natural world have produced such catastrophic results? Progress is proving to be a dangerous delusion, which modern peoples continue to support despite the overwhelming evidence that it has led to an escalating war against the earth. Ironically, the modern world’s relentless pursuit of victory in this centuries-old war against nature will be the principal cause of its defeat and collapse. In The Vanishing White Man, Stan Steiner (1976, 277) argued: The ruins of the Roman Empire, and the Mayan and Byzantine and Ottoman and Inca and Islamic and Egyptian and Ghanaian and Nigerian and Spanish and Aztec and English and Grecian and Persian, and the Mongolian civilization of the great Khans are visible for all to see. Is it heresy to say that the civilization of the white man of Western Europe, which has dominated much of the earth for four hundred years, is about to become one more magnificent ruin? Not because it has failed to accomplish its goals, but because it has succeeded so well, its time on earth may be done. The paradox of development is that the tremendous success of modern industrial civilization will be the cause of its [end page 45] collapse and ruin. To understand this paradox, we need to understand how modern economic and political institutions are creating both the so-called developed and underdeveloped worlds, which I will refer to as the First and Third worlds (Escobar 1995).<br />
<br />
<strong>Fourth—collapse now is better – it spurs a transition to sustainable societies.</strong><br />

I will argue that we are witnessing the collapse of global industrial civilization. Driven by individualism, materialism, and the endless pursuit of wealth and power, the modern industrialized world’s efforts to modernize and integrate the world politically, economically, and culturally since World War II are only accelerating this global collapse. In the late-twentieth century, global development leaves 80 percent of the world’s population outside the industrialized nations’ progress and affluence (Wallimann 1994). When the modern industrialized world collapses, people in the underdeveloped world will continue their daily struggle for dignity and survival at the margins of a moribund global industrial civilization. With the collapse of the modern world, smaller, autonomous, local and regional civilizations, cultures, and polities will emerge. We can reduce the threat of mass death and genocide that will surely accompany this collapse by encouraging the creation and growth of sustainable, self-sufficient regional polities. John Cobb has already made a case for how this may work in the United States and how it is working in Kerala, India. After the collapse of global civilization, modern peoples will not have the material resources, biological capital, and energy to reestablish global civilization. Forced by economic necessity to become dependent on local resources and ecosystems for their survival, peoples throughout the world will work to conserve and restore their [end page 44] environments.

The only alternative we now have is to recognize the very real imminent collapse of global industrial civilization. Instead of seeing this collapse as a tragedy, and trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together again, we must see it as a real opportunity to solve some of the basic economic, political, and social problems created and exacerbated by the development of modern industrial civilization. Instead of insisting on coordinated global actions, we should encourage self-sufficiency through the creation of local and regional economies and trading networks (Norgaard 1994). We must help political and economic leaders understand that the more their countries are tied to the global economic system, the more risk there is of serious economic and political collapse. In the case of the collapse of Mayan civilization, the city-states and regions in Central America that were not as dependent on the central [end page 58] Mayan civilization, economy, and trade were more likely to survive its collapse. The city-states that were heavily dependent on Mayan hegemony destroyed themselves by fighting bitter wars with other powerful city-states to maintain their declining economic and political dominance (Weatherford 1994). Like the collapse of Mayan and Roman civilization, the collapse of global civilization will cause mass death and suffering as a result of the turmoil created by economic and political collapse. The more dependent nations are on the global economy, the more economic, political, and social chaos they will experience when it breaks down. Once global civilization collapses, humanity will not have the material, biological, and energy resources to rebuild it. This must be the real lesson that nations and polities learn from this global collapse. If they try to rebuild unsustainable regional or even international economies, it will only cause more suffering and mass death. In conclusion, the only solution to the growing political and economic chaos caused by the collapse of global industrial civilization is to encourage the uncoupling of nations and regions from the global economy. Efforts to integrate the underdeveloped countries with this global economy through sustainable development programs such as Agenda 21 will only further undermine the global economy and industrial civilization. Unfortunately, millions will die in the wars and economic and political conflicts created by the accelerating collapse of global civilization. But we can be assured, on the basis of the past history of the collapse of regional civilizations such as the Mayan and the Roman empires, that, barring global nuclear war, human societies and civilizations will continue to exist and develop on a smaller, regional scale. Yes, such civilizations will be violent, corrupt, and often cruel, but, in the end, less so than our current global industrial civilization, which is abusing the entire planet and threatening the mass death and suffering of all its peoples and the living, biological fabric of life on earth. The paradox of global economic development is that although it creates massive wealth and power for modern elites, it also creates massive poverty and suffering for underdeveloped peoples and societies. The failure of global development to end this suffering and destruction will bring about its collapse. This collapse will cause millions of people to suffer and die throughout the world, but it should, paradoxically, ensure the survival of future human societies. The collapse of global civilization is necessary for the future, long-term survival of human [end page 59] beings. Although this future seems hopeless and heartless, it is not. We can learn much from our present global crisis. What we learn will shape our future and the future of the complex, interconnected web of life on earth.<br />

 <strong>Complete collapse of primacy is inevitable by 2030.</strong><br />

[&quot;The Case Against the American Empire,&quot; American Empire: A Debate, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415952034, p. 64-65]<br />
Can the United States Be Caught? Up to a point, the primacists are correct. In terms of hard power, there is a yawning gap between the United States and the next-ranking powers. It will take some time before any other state emerges as a true “peer competitor” of the United States. Nevertheless, at some point within the next decade or two, new great power rivals to the United States will emerge. To put it slightly differently, American primacy cannot be sustained indefinitely. The relative power position of great powers is dynamic, not static, which means that at any point in time some states are gaining in relative power while others are losing it. Thus, as Paul Kennedy has observed, no great power ever has been able “to remain permanently ahead of all others, because that would imply a freezing of the differentiated pattern of growth rates, technological advance, and military developments which has existed since time immemorial.”36 Even the most ardent primacists know this to be true, which is why they concede that American primacy won’t last forever. Indeed, the leading primacists acknowledge, that—at best—the United States will not be able to hold onto its primacy much beyond 2030. There are indications, however, that American primacy could end much sooner than that. Already there is evidence suggesting that new great powers are in the process of emerging. This is what the current debate in the United States about the implications of China’s rise is all about. But China isn’t the only factor in play, and transition from U.S. primacy to multipolarity may be much closer than primacists want to admit. For example, in its survey of likely international developments up until 2020, the CIA’s National Intelligence Council’s report Mapping the Global Future notes: The likely emergence of China and India as new major global players—similar to the rise of Germany in the 19th century and the United States in the early 20th century—will transform the geopolitical landscape, with impacts potentially as dramatic as those of the previous two [end page 64] centuries. In the same way that commentators refer to the 1900s as the American Century, the early 21st century may be seen as the time when some in the developing world led by China and India came into their Own. In a similar vein, a recent study by the CIA’s Strategic Assessment Group projects that by 2020 both China (which Mapping the Global Future pegs as “by any measure a first-rate military power” around 2020) and the European Union will come close to matching the United States in terms of their respective shares of world power.38 For sure, there are always potential pitfalls in projecting current trends several decades into the future (not least is that it is not easy to convert economic power into effective military power). But if the ongoing shift in the distribution of relative power continues, new poles of power in the international system are likely to emerge during the next decade or two. The real issue is not if American primacy will end, but how soon it will end.<br />

<strong>A transition to offshore balancing is inevitable – the only question is whether the U.S. will accept limits on its power or if it will go down fighting.

The United States has a hegemony problem because it wields hegemonic power. To reduce the fear of U.S. power, the United States must accept some reduction in its relative hard power by adopting a multipolar—and essentially unilateral—offshore balancing strategy that accommodates the rise of new great powers. 130 It also must rein in the scope of its extravagant ambitions to shape the international system in accordance with its Wilsonian ideology. The United States does not need to be an extraregional hegemon to be secure. Its quest for hegemony is driven instead by an ideational, deterritorialized conception of security divorced from the traditional metrics of great power grand strategy: the distribution of power in the international system and geography. 131 Thus, to reduce others' concerns about its power, the United States must practice self-restraint (which is different from choosing to be constrained by others by adopting a multilateral approach to grand strategy). An America [End Page 40] that has the wisdom and prudence to contain itself is less likely to be feared than one that begs the rest of the world to stop it before it expands hegemonically again. If the United States fails to adopt an offshore balancing strategy based on multipolarity and military and ideological self-restraint, it probably will, at some point, have to fight to uphold its primacy, which is a potentially dangerous strategy. Maintaining U.S. hegemony is a game that no longer is worth the candle, especially given that U.S. primacy may already be in the early stages of erosion. Paradoxically, attempting to sustain U.S. primacy may well hasten its end by stimulating more intensive efforts to balance against the United States, thus causing the United States to become imperially overstretched and involving it in unnecessary wars that will reduce its power. Rather than risking these outcomes, the United States should begin to retrench strategically and capitalize on the advantages accruing to insular great powers in multipolar systems. Unilateral offshore balancing, indeed, is America's next grand strategy.<br />

Finally, those who argue that America should emulate the 19th-century British Empire ignore the fact that today’s world bears little resemblance to the one over which Britain once presided. Two differences should be obvious: First, the world is far more interconnected today, which makes the consequences of sanctimonious, arrogant, or clumsy international behavior riskier politically, diplomatically, and economically. Second, the potential costs associated with making enemies today are far greater than they were for empires past. Indeed, the British and Romans were the targets of assassinations, arson, and other forms of anti-imperial backlash, but that activity was typically small-scale and took place far away from the mother country. In contrast, forms of backlash against the U.S. role as globocop today could be large-scale and long-range and may be directed at America’s homeland—as shown by the attacks on September 11, which were launched by Osama bin Laden in retaliation for the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia, U.S. support for Israel, U.S.-led economic sanctions against Iraq, and U.S. backing of corrupt regimes in the Middle East. In the future, terrorists retaliating for U.S. actions overseas could use more powerful weapons against the U.S. homeland—for example, nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Thus, the resentment of U.S. neoimperialism could provoke catastrophic terrorism against the United States itself—thereby dramatically reducing U.S. security.<br />

The potential consequences of the unchecked spread of nuclear knowledge and material to terrorist groups that seek to cause mass destruction in the United States are truly horrifying. A terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon would be devastating in terms of immediate human and economic losses. 49 Moreover, there would be immense political pressure in the United States to discover the perpetrators and retaliate with nuclear weapons, massively increasing the number of casualties and potentially triggering a full-scale nuclear conflict. 50 In addition to the threat posed by terrorists, leakage of nuclear knowledge and material from Russia will reduce the barriers that states with nuclear ambitions face and may trigger widespread proliferation of nuclear weapons. 51 This proliferation will increase the risk of nuclear attacks against the United States [*1440] or its allies by hostile states, 52 as well as increase the likelihood that regional conflicts will draw in the United States and escalate to the use of nuclear weapons. 53<br />

To be sure, the United States should not ignore the potential strategic ramifications of China’s arrival on the world stage as a great power. After all, the lesson of history is that the emergence of new great powers in the international system leads to conflict, not peace. On this score, the notion—propagated by Beijing—that China’s will be a “peaceful rise” is just as fanciful as claims by American policy-makers that China has no need to build up its military capabilities because it is unthreatened by any other state. Still, this does not mean that the United States and China inevitably are on a collision course that will culminate in the next decade or two in a war. Whether Washington and Beijing actually come to blows, however, depends largely on what strategy the United States chooses to adopt toward China, because the United States has the “last clear chance” to adopt a grand strategy that will serve its interests in balancing Chinese power without running the risk of an armed clash with [end page 73] Beijing. If the United States continues to aim at upholding its current primacy, however, Sino-American conflict is virtually certain.<br />

<strong>B. The impact is extinction—escalation is guaranteed.</strong><br />
<strong>STRAITS TIMES</strong> (Singapore), <strong>2000</strong><br />
[“Regional Fallout: No one gains in war over Taiwan,” June 25, Available Online via Lexis-Nexis]<br />
THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -- horror of horrors -- raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.<br />

<strong>Turn – Iran:</strong><br />

Iran Because of the strategy of primacy and empire, the United States and Iran are on course for a showdown. The main source of conflict—or at least the one that has grabbed the lion’s share of the headlines—is Tehran’s evident determination to develop a nuclear weapons program. Washington’s policy, as President George W. Bush has stated on several occasions—in language that recalls his prewar stance on Iraq—is that a nuclear-armed Iran is “intolerable.” Beyond nuclear weapons, however, there are other important issues that are driving the United States and Iran toward an armed confrontation. Chief among these is Iraq. Recently, Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, has accused Tehran of meddling in Iraqi affairs by providing arms and training to Shiite militias and by currying favor with the Shiite politicians who dominate Iraq’s recently elected government. With Iraq teetering on the brink of a sectarian civil war between Shiites and Sunnis, concerns about Iranian interference have been magnified. In a real sense, however, Iran’s nuclear program and its role in Iraq are merely the tip of the iceberg. The fundamental cause of tensions between the United States and Iran is the nature of America’s ambitions in the Middle East and Persian Gulf. These are reflected in current U.S. grand strategy—which has come to be known as the Bush Doctrine. The Bush Doctrine’s three key components are rejection of deterrence in favor of preventive/preemptive military action; determination to effectuate a radical shake-up in the politics of the Persian Gulf and Middle East; and gaining U.S. dominance over that region. In this respect, it is hardly coincidental that the administration’s policy toward Tehran bears a striking similarity to its policy [end page 76] during the run-up to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, not only on the nuclear weapons issue but—ominously—with respect to regime change and democratization. This is because the same strategic assumptions that underlay the administration’s pre-invasion Iraq policy now are driving its Iran policy. The key question today is whether these assumptions are correct.<br />

Iran is likely to respond to any US attack using its considerable missile arsenal against US forces in Iraq and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. Israel may attempt to stay out of the conflict, it is not clear whether Iran would target Israel in a retaliatory strike but it is certainly possible. If the US attack includes nuclear weapons use against Iranian facilities, as I believe is very likely, rather than deterring Iran it will cause a much more violent response. Iranian military forces and militias are likely to storm into southern Iraq and the US may be forced to use nuclear weapons against them, causing large scale casualties and inflaming the Muslim world. There could be popular uprisings in other countries in the region like Pakistan, and of course a Shiite uprising in Iraq against American occupiers. Finally I would like to discuss the grave consequences to America and the world if the US uses nuclear weapons against Iran. First, the likelihood of terrorist attacks against Americans both on American soil and abroad will be enormously enhanced after these events. And terrorist's attempts to get hold of &quot;loose nukes&quot; and use them against Americans will be enormously incentivized after the US used nuclear weapons against Iran. Second, it will destroy America's position as the leader of the free world. The rest of the world rightly recognizes that nuclear weapons are qualitatively different from all other weapons, and that there is no sharp distinction between small and large nuclear weapons, or between nuclear weapons targeting facilities versus those targeting armies or civilians. It will not condone the breaking of the nuclear taboo in an unprovoked war of aggression against a non-nuclear country, and the US will become a pariah state. Third, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will cease to exist, and many of its 182 non-nuclear-weapon-country signatories will strive to acquire nuclear weapons as a deterrent to an attack by a nuclear nation. With no longer a taboo against the use of nuclear weapons, any regional conflict may go nuclear and expand into global nuclear war. Nuclear weapons are million-fold more powerful than any other weapon, and the existing nuclear arsenals can obliterate humanity many times over. In the past, global conflicts terminated when one side prevailed. In the next global conflict we will all be gone before anybody has prevailed.<br />

Counterpoised against offensive realism is another variant of realist theory: balance of power realism. Balance of power theorists argue that in one way, at least, international politics is like physics: every action triggers a reaction. Specifically, when one great power becomes too powerful—that is, verges on, or gains, primacy—other great powers respond by “balancing” against it. That is, they build up their military capabilities (internal balancing) and/or enter into alliances with other great powers (external balancing) to stop it. The reason is simple: when one state becomes too powerful, it threatens other states’ security. States are ever-vigilant when it comes to maintaining their security because they want to survive as independent players in international politics. Up to a point, therefore, it is a good thing for a state to be powerful. But when a state becomes too powerful, it frightens others; in self-defense, they seek to offset and contain those great powers that aspire to primacy. And the ironclad lesson of history is clear: states that bid for hegemony (primacy) invariably fail. As Henry A. Kissinger has said, “hegemonic empires almost automatically elicit universal resistance, which is why all such claimants have sooner or later exhausted themselves.”34 Indeed, the history of modern international politics is strewn with the geopolitical wreckage of states that bid unsuccessfully for primacy: The Hapsburg Empire under Charles V, France under Louis XIV and Napoleon, Victorian Britain, Germany under Hitler. By pursuing a strategy of primacy, the United States today risks the same fate that has befallen other great powers that have striven to dominate the international political system.

<strong>A. The pursuit of primacy causes global savage wars for peace – it makes conflict inevitable.</strong><br />

In this chapter, I argue that primacy and empire is a strategy that will lead to bad consequences for the United States. Rather than bringing the United States peace and security, the pursuit of primacy and empire will result in a geopolitical backlash against the United States. It already has. The 9/11 attacks were a violent reaction against America’s primacy—and specifically against its imperial ambitions in the Middle East. Similarly, the quagmire in Iraq also is a direct consequence of U.S. imperial aspirations. And it will not end there. Because it is premised on the belief that the United States must embark on assertive policies to bring about regime change by imposing democracy abroad, the pursuit of primacy and empire will drag the United States into otherwise avoidable wars—what one proponent of the strategy has termed &quot;savage wars for peace.&quot; Looking ahead, if the United States continues to follow its current strategy of primacy and empire, it almost certainly will find [end page 54] itself on a collision course with Iran (and possibly North Korea and Syria) and—more importantly—China.<br />

Because the strategy of empire equates national security with maintaining what some people have called &quot;the functional equivalent of global containment,&quot; the emergence of balance-prone powers threatens a hegemon implicitly. 61 As such, a hegemon must take escalating steps to both ward off potential challenges and persuade security dependents that they are still protected. The chief danger here is strategic overextension because the maintenance of what is in essence a military protectorship is open-ended and requires an empire to continually enlarge the geographic scope of its security responsibilities. Indeed, stabilizing one region logically necessitates the stabilization of the neighbouring region to safeguard the first. For example, much of the impetus for the U.S.-led war in Kosovo was to protect investment in the fragile peace that the West imposed in Bosnia. The process of strategic overextension becomes self-reinforcing because, each time a hegemon expands its perimeter, new potential threats are encountered that demand further expansion. As political scientist Robert H. Johnson explains, political &quot;uncertainty leads to self-extension, which leads in turn to new uncertainty and self-extension.&quot; 62 Maintaining empire, in other words, requires perpetually widening commitments. Afghanistan is already an obvious example of this process of self-extension. The fate of Hamid Karzai's government in Kabul, it is argued, now requires Washington to stabilize Central Asia, disentangle the Kashmir conflict, and resolve conflicts in the Middle East. 63 What is most alarming about this idea is that it leads to a virtually limitless foreign policy and a potentially exhausting proliferation of American security concerns. 64 The reason is that the consolidating logic of empire ultimately gives way to a universalistic conclusion. During the Vietnam War, Secretary of State Dean Rusk anticipated this view when he said that the United States &quot;is safe only to the extent that its total environment is safe.&quot; 65 More than 100 years ago, British diplomat Lord Archibald Primrose of Rosebery recognized the basic unsoundness of such thinking: Scarcely any question can arise in any part of the world without involving British interests. This consideration, instead of widening, rather circumscribes the field of our actions. For did we not strictly limit the principle of intervention we should always be simultaneously engaged in some forty wars. 66 It would be an exaggeration to suggest that the United States will soon be drawn [end page 9] simultaneously into &quot;some forty wars,&quot; but the logic of empire points in the direction of ever-increasing commitments and security burdens. Nineteenth-century British policy-makers, for example, believed India was vital to their interests. The British government, therefore, felt it necessary to safeguard land and sea routes to India, which necessitated propping up the Ottoman Empire; stabilizing the Mediterranean, Egypt, and South Africa; and assuming responsibility for the Persian Gulf. The result, says British military historian Correlli Barnett, &quot;was a classic example of strategic overextension. Far from being a source of strength to England, India served only to weaken and distract her.&quot; 67<br />

Some Western commentators are blaming Moscow for initiating a new Cold War. But it is the US which, in order to retain its pre-eminent role in world politics, is preventing other states from challenging Washington’s leadership. Washington has begun to realise that its arrogance of power has severe constraints. Its policy of deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role has miserably failed. Kosovo and South Ossetia have opened up a new Pandora’s Box. When is a movement ripe enough to merit independence? The world is yet to find an ideal formula. There is still no consensus on what constitutes well-defined borders, respect for minority and ethnic rights or the ideal barometer to judge if the population genuinely wants independence without manipulation or interference from a hostile neighbour or regional power. Till that happens, there will be an element of ad hocism and arbitrariness in supporting a movement for independence. Each case will therefore be treated as special. All said, with Georgian President Saakashvili scoring a self-goal in South Ossetia, President Medvedev has marked an end to America’s unipolar moment. Russia, the world’s first energy superpower, has drawn a red line no one dare cross, not even the US, the world’s only superpower.<br />

Hegemony, however, is not omnipotence. There are several reasons why the US can successfully apply its power to some objectives but not to others. First, the US is better at deterrence - preventing other states from attacking the US or its allies militarily - than it is at &quot;compellence&quot; - using its power coercively to force other states to adopt policies that run counter to their preferences and to act in accordance with Washington's dictates. The fact that compellence is difficult explains why the US has been unsuccessful in persuading Iran and North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons programmes. Second - as the Iraq morass illustrates - in &quot;asymmetric&quot; conflicts such as insurgencies, outside forces are at a big political and psychological disadvantage notwithstanding their superiority in conventional military power over indigenous fighters. The US should have learnt from its own experience in Vietnam (or the French experiences in Indochina and Algeria) that there are good reasons why big states lose small wars (as Professor Andrew Mack of the University of British Columbia put it in a widely cited article). In these wars, the balance of motivation invariably lies with the insurgents who, instead of needing to prevail militarily, need only to survive and prolong the conflict sufficiently to chip away at the outside power's political will. As counter-insurgent wars drag on, and the costs rise, political debate in the external power inevitably focuses on why it should continue to expend blood and treasure in a war that is not vital to security. Also, in such conflicts, occupying powers invariably find themselves on the wrong side of one of the most powerful forces in international politics: nationalism. In Iraq and Afghanistan, Washington's ability to attain its objectives is also limited by the religious and cultural divides separating the Islamic world from the west. Third, America's own ideological militancy, rooted in the Wilsonian tradition of liberal internationalism, hamstrings the effectiveness of US diplomacy by dividing the world neatly into good guys and bad guys - or, as the Bush administration would have it, between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. One reason why the US has failed in the Middle East is because of its refusal to engage in direct diplomacy with Syria and Iran - both of which have important stakes in the outcome of security issues in the Middle East, including those involving Israel's relations with the Palestinians and with Hizbollah in Lebanon. Ending evil may be a worthy ambition for ministers of the cloth, but it is a foolish one for ministers of state. There is much more to diplomacy than simply talking to one's friends. The art of diplomacy lies in dealing with those who are rivals and adversaries, and finding ways of resolving outstanding differences. By preferring regime change to diplomatic engagement with &quot;evil&quot; states such as Iran and Syria, the US has tied its own hands in exercising hegemonic power to resolve - or at least ameliorate - the conflicts in the Middle East. Finally, America's hegemonic power often seems illusory because it is applied to unattainable objectives such as nation-building and promotion of democracy. US neo-conservatives and liberal imperialists alike seem to think that the world is a piece of clay and that the US can mould other nations and cultures in its own image. It is naive to think that America's democratic values can be transplanted to flourish in countries that have no indigenous democratic tradition and that lack the social, economic and political foundations on which America's domestic political system rests. Although the US has failed repeatedly in such efforts, it keeps trying - most recently in Iraq (and Afghanistan). In both countries it is failing yet again. Although the US remains dominant in international politics, its power is not infinite. What is needed in Washington is the wisdom to differentiate between those foreign policy goals that are attainable and those that are not. The US must be careful not to overreach itself, and Washington needs to understand that a wise grand strategy must balance ends and means, and distinguish between desirable objectives and attainable ones. If the US is to be perceived as powerful rather than powerless, it must refrain from intervening abroad in pursuit of unrealisable goals, and will have to learn that the intricacies of international politics cannot be reduced to a simplistic Manichean struggle between good and evil.<br />

 <strong>U.S. HEGEMONY IS KEY TO PREVENT MULTIPLE SCENARIOS FOR GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR – ANY ALTERNATIVE TO UNRIVALED PRIMACY WOULD COLLAPSE THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM INTO VIOLENT CONFLICT.</strong><br />
Bradley A. <strong>THAYER</strong>, Associate Professor in the Department of Defense and Strategic Studies at Missouri State University, <strong>2006</strong><br />
[“In Defense of Primacy,” National Interest, Issue 86, November/December, Available Online via Academic Search Premier]<br />
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power--Rome, Britain or the United States today. Scholars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. Everything we think of when we consider the current international order--free trade, a robust monetary regime, increasing respect for human rights, growing democratization--is directly linked to U.S. power. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it. In that they are dead wrong and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons: Appalling things happen when international orders collapse. The Dark Ages followed Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles. Without U.S. power, the liberal order created by the United States will end just as assuredly. As country and western great Ral Donner sang: &quot;You don't know what you've got (until you lose it).&quot; Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washington and the world. The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists, most notably France and West Germany. Today, American primacy helps keep a number of complicated relationships aligned--between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia. This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war. Wars still occur where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, but a Pax Americana does reduce war's likelihood, particularly war's worst form: great power wars. Second, American power gives the United States the ability to spread democracy and other elements of its ideology of liberalism: Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because, as John Owen noted on these pages in the Spring 2006 issue, liberal democracies are more likely to align with the United States and be sympathetic to the American worldview.( n3) So, spreading democracy helps maintain U.S. primacy. In addition, once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced. This is not because democracies do not have clashing interests. Indeed they do. Rather, it is because they are more open, more transparent and more likely to want to resolve things amicably in concurrence with U.S. leadership. And so, in general, democratic states are good for their citizens as well as for advancing the interests of the United States. Critics have faulted the Bush Administration for attempting to spread democracy in the Middle East, labeling such aft effort a modern form of tilting at windmills. It is the obligation of Bush's critics to explain why :democracy is good enough for Western states but not for the rest, and, one gathers from the argument, should not even be attempted. Of course, whether democracy in the Middle East will have a peaceful or stabilizing influence on America's interests in the short run is open to question. Perhaps democratic Arab states would be more opposed to Israel, but nonetheless, their people would be better off. The United States has brought democracy to Afghanistan, where 8.5 million Afghans, 40 percent of them women, voted in a critical October 2004 election, even though remnant Taliban forces threatened them. The first free elections were held in Iraq in January 2005. It was the military power of the United States that put Iraq on the path to democracy. Washington fostered democratic governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Caucasus. Now even the Middle East is increasingly democratic. They may not yet look like Western-style democracies, but democratic progress has been made in Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, Kuwait, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt. By all accounts, the march of democracy has been impressive. Third, along with the growth in the number of democratic states around the world has been the growth of the global economy. With its allies, the United States has labored to create an economically liberal worldwide network characterized by free trade and commerce, respect for international property rights, and mobility of capital and labor markets. The economic stability and prosperity that stems from this economic order is a global public good from which all states benefit, particularly the poorest states in the Third World. The United States created this network not out of altruism but for the benefit and the economic well-being of America. This economic order forces American industries to be competitive, maximizes efficiencies and growth, and benefits defense as well because the size of the economy makes the defense burden manageable. Economic spin-offs foster the development of military technology, helping to ensure military prowess. Perhaps the greatest testament to the benefits of the economic network comes from Deepak Lal, a former Indian foreign service diplomat and researcher at the World Bank, who started his career confident in the socialist ideology of post-independence India. Abandoning the positions of his youth, Lal now recognizes that the only way to bring relief to desperately poor countries of the Third World is through the adoption of free market economic policies and globalization, which are facilitated through American primacy.( n4) As a witness to the failed alternative economic systems, Lal is one of the strongest academic proponents of American primacy due to the economic prosperity it provides. Fourth and finally, the United States, in seeking primacy, has been willing to use its power not only to advance its interests but to promote the welfare of people all over the globe. The United States is the earth's leading source of positive externalities for the world. The U.S. military has participated in over fifty operations since the end of the Cold War--and most of those missions have been humanitarian in nature. Indeed, the U.S. military is the earth's &quot;911 force&quot;--it serves, de facto, as the world's police, the global paramedic and the planet's fire department. Whenever there is a natural disaster, earthquake, flood, drought, volcanic eruption, typhoon or tsunami, the United States assists the countries in need. On the day after Christmas in 2004, a tremendous earthquake and tsunami occurred in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, killing some 300,000 people. The United States was the first to respond with aid. Washington followed up with a large contribution of aid and deployed the U.S. military to South and Southeast Asia for many months to help with the aftermath of the disaster. About 20,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines responded by providing water, food, medical aid, disease treatment and prevention as well as forensic assistance to help identify the bodies of those killed. Only the U.S. military could have accomplished this Herculean effort. No other force possesses the communications capabilities or global logistical reach of the U.S. military. In fact, UN peacekeeping operations depend on the United States to supply UN forces. American generosity has done more to help the United States fight the War on Terror than almost any other measure. Before the tsunami, 80 percent of Indonesian public opinion was opposed to the United States; after it, 80 percent had a favorable opinion of America. Two years after the disaster, and in poll after poll, Indonesians still have overwhelmingly positive views of the United States. In October 2005, an enormous earthquake struck Kashmir, killing about 74 000 people and leaving three million homeless. The U.S. military responded immediately, diverting helicopters fighting the War on Terror in nearby Afghanistan to bring relief as soon as possible To help those in need, the United States also provided financial aid to Pakistan; and, as one might expect from those witnessing the munificence of the United States, it left a lasting impression about America. For the first time since 9/11, polls of Pakistani opinion have found that more people are favorable toward the United States than unfavorable, while support for Al-Qaeda dropped to its lowest level. Whether in Indonesia or Kashmir, the money was well-spent because it helped people in the wake of disasters, but it also had a real impact on the War on Terror. When people in the Muslim world witness the U.S. military conducting a humanitarian mission, there is a clearly positive impact on Muslim opinion of the United States. As the War on Terror is a war of ideas and opinion as much as military action, for the United States humanitarian missions are the equivalent of a blitzkrieg. THERE IS no other state, group of states or international organization that can provide these global benefits. None even comes close. The United Nations cannot because it is riven with conflicts and major cleavages that divide the international body time and again on matters great and trivial. Thus it lacks the ability to speak with one voice on salient issues and to act as a unified force once a decision is reached. The EU has similar problems. Does anyone expect Russia or China to take up these responsibilities? They may have the desire, but they do not have the capabilities. Let's face it: for the time being, American primacy remains humanity's only practical hope of solving the world's ills. While the benefits of American primacy are considerable, no country can ever escape from the iron law of Economics 101--there is no free lunch. American primacy is no exception. Leadership requires that the United States incur costs and run risks not borne by other countries. These costs can be stark and brutal, and they have to be faced directly by proponents of primacy. It means that some Americans will die in the service of their country. These are the costs, and they are significant. Americans should be conscious of them and use them in their contemplation of the value of primacy. Additionally, the costs of primacy must impose upon American policy-makers a sharp focus and prudence concerning how they wield American power. Equally, all Americans should be aware of the benefits that flow from primacy and that they enjoy. While primacy's advantages and costs must be weighed objectively and solemnly, the scholars who are proclaiming that the sky is falling, primacy is doomed and America must retrench have to confront the reality of U.S. power. The world is a long way from seeing the end of American primacy, and it is in America's interest--and the world's--to have it last as long as possible.<br />

<strong>Turn- East Asia</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>US PRESENCE IS KEY TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL STABILITY IN EAST ASIA</strong><br />
<strong>SCHWARZ</strong> – Correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly – <strong>1996</strong><br />
[Benjamin, “Why America thinks it has to run the world,” The Atlantic Monthly, Vol.277, Iss. 6, pg. 92-100, June, Proquest]<br />
All these benefits would be lost, according to Coll, if the &quot;traditional rivalries among Asian powers .. . unravel into unrestrained military competition, conflict and aggression.&quot; In the same vein the author of the Clinton Administration's security strategy for East Asia, Joseph Nye, then the assistant secretary of defense, asserted last year that the U.S. military protectorate is &quot;the basis for stability and prosperity in the region&quot;; if the United States were to forsake its &quot;leadership role&quot; in East Asia, &quot;the stable expectations of entrepreneurs and investors would be subverted.&quot; Although the United States committed forces to Japan ostensibly to protect it from the Soviets, and to South Korea to protect it from the North, in 1993 the deputy defense secretary, William Perry (now the Secretary of Defense), declared that America would continue to reassure and stabilize East Asia by maintaining troops &quot;permanently&quot; in Japan and even in a future unified Korea.<br />
<br />
<strong>And- EAST ASIAN INSTABILITY LEADS TO NUCLEAR WAR</strong><br />
<strong>LANDY, 2000</strong> (Jonathon, National Security and International Correspondent, Knight Ridder, March 10, L/N)<br />
Few if any experts think China and Taiwan, North Korea and South Korea, or India and Pakistan are spoiling to fight. But even a minor miscalculation by any of them could destabilize Asia, jolt the global economy, and even start a nuclear war. India, Pakistan, and China all have nuclear weapons, and North Korea may have a few, too. Asia lacks the kinds of organizations, negotiations, and diplomatic relationships that helped keep an uneasy peace for five decades in Cold War Europe. “Nowhere else on Earth are the stakes as high and relationships so fragile,” said Bates Gill, director of northeast Asian policy studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. “We see the convergence of great power interest overlaid with lingering confrontations with no institutionalized security mechanism in place. There are elements for potential disaster. In an effort to cool the region’s tempers, President Clinton, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger all will hopscotch Asia’s capitals this month. For America, the stakes could hardly be higher. There are 100,000 U.S. troops in Asia committed to defending Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, and the United States would instantly become embroiled if Beijing moved against Taiwan or North Korea attacked South Korea. While Washington has no defense commitments to either India or Pakistan, a conflict between the two could end the global taboo against using nuclear weapons and demolish the already shaky international nonproliferation regime.<br />

<strong>Turn- Middle East</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS KEY TO PREVENTING FUTURE CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST</strong><br />
<strong>CHRISTOPHER, 2004</strong> (December 30, Warren, New York Times staff writer, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1063:http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=FB0B14F93C5D0C738FDDAB0994DC404482 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=FB0B14F93C5D0C738FDDAB0994DC404482" rel="nofollow">http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=FB0B14F93C5D0C738FDDAB0994DC404482</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1063 -->)<br />
America has always been the indispensable party for progress in the Middle East. The brilliant efforts of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1974 and 1975 brought about Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai and the peninsula's return to Egypt. President Jimmy Carter's legendary endeavors at Camp David in 1978 produced the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, which was supported by American financial assistance to both countries. That aid continues to yield returns today. And when Israel and Jordan negotiated a peace accord in July 1994, King Hussein, the present King's father, told me that the negotiations could not have succeeded without tangible support from the United States, which was forthcoming in the form of debt forgiveness and military equipment. But meaningful American involvement at this critical time will require more than words and dollars -- it must take the form of action. It will not be enough for President Bush to make broad policy statements, however eloquent. It will also require something beyond telephone diplomacy by Secretary of State-designate Condoleezza Rice. Reliance on these hands-off methods promises a continuation of the past four years' failures.<br />
<br />
<strong>And- MIDDLE EAST INSTABILITY CAUSES NUCLEAR ESCALATION</strong><br />
<strong>EVRON, 1994</strong> (Yair, Professor of International Relations at Tel Aviv University, “Israel’s Nuclear Dilemma”, p. 123-124)<br />
The potential risks involved in the functioning of the superpowers’ C3 may recur in the Middle East and, in some cases, with apparently greater intensity. The probability of erroneous decisions is therefore higher. These factors center on technical failures of warning systems, or the combination of technical failure and human error, deriving from misperception of the enemy’s behavior. There also exist processes of escalation that are totally distinct from technical failure, and which derive exclusively from human error. The latter case is most often the function of the erroneous interpretation of various enemy actions. These factors are liable to yield disastrous outcomes. The outcomes can be divided into two major categories of events: misperception of an enemy action that is mistakenly understood as a conventional or nuclear attack on the state’s nuclear bases or on the state in its entirety. Such a misperception could cause a rapid escalation. The second category comprises the escalation from a conventional war to the use of nuclear weapons. The persistence of intense conflicts in the Middle East will of course contribute to the potential danger of misperceptions. Hence, for example, if the Arab-Israeli peace process fails to advance and in particular were the situation to return to the level of conflict that preceded the Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement, the intensity of the conflict could reinforce the potential for errors of perception among decision-makers. A high level of conflict tends to promote the tendency of decision-makers to view the other side’s actions with great concern.<br />
<br />
<strong>Turn-Balkans</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>US HEGEMONY IS KEY TO STABILITY IN THE BALKANS – POWER NOW CHECKS EXTREMISTS</strong><br />
<strong>BARDOS, 2006</strong>— (Assistant director of the Harriman Institute at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. He also serves as a Balkans analyst for Freedom House.—Gordon N., ”Balkan Gains in Peril”, Editorial; B07, Final Edition, The Washington Post, June 25, 2006, lexis.)<br />
All of this suggests how easy it would be, absent strong U.S. leadership, for events to spin out of control and erase 10 years of efforts to stabilize the region. In such an unstable political climate, statements by U.S. policymakers about their eagerness to pull U.S. troops out of the Balkans and turn the job over to the Europeans only embolden extremists. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Serbia are all gearing up for elections, and moderate political forces in these countries need U.S. support now to convince their electorates that the difficult choices being made to adopt economic and political reforms will pay off in the near future, not two or three electoral cycles down the line. The assassination of former Serbian prime minister Zoran Djindjic in March 2003 is a tragic reminder of the great personal risks reformers throughout southeastern Europe are taking. They need and deserve U.S. understanding and support.<br />
By visiting Baghdad this month, President Bush sent a strong personal message to Iraqis that the United States intends to support their country until its transition to democracy is completed. The administration should send a similar message to both extremists and moderates in the Balkans that the United States will actively lead the effort to integrate all the countries of southeastern Europe into both NATO and the European Union -- and that it won't pull out until the job is done.<br />
<br />
<strong>AND- BALKANS INSTABILITY LEADS TO WWIII</strong><br />
<strong>PARIS, 2002</strong> (Roland, Assistant Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at University of Colorado, Political Science Quarterly, “Kosovo and the metaphor war”, Volume 117, Issue 3, Fall, Proquest)<br />
At this early stage in the Kosovo crisis, Clinton's language was still somewhat coded and suggestive; in the months to come, he would spell out the implications of his historical allusions with much greater clarity. Nevertheless, the phrase &quot;powderkeg in the Balkans&quot; would have carried historical significance for listeners who possessed even a casual knowledge of European history. Since the early part of the twentieth century, when instability in the Balkans drew in the great powers and provided the spark that ignited World War I, the region has been widely known as a powderkeg. In 1947, for instance, members of the International Court of Justice noted that the Balkans had been &quot;so often described as the `powder-keg' of Europe.&quot;51 Today, the term continues to be attached to the region's politics, conjuring up memories of the origins of World War I.52<br />
The meaning of the powderkeg metaphor is straightforward: the Balkans can explode at any time, and the resulting conflagration can spread to the rest of Europe; preventing such an explosion is vital to the continent's, and perhaps even to American, security. When Clinton described Kosovo as a powderkeg, he warned that the Kosovo conflict might spill over not only to surrounding Balkan states, but to Europe as a whole; and he insinuated that the United States could be compelled to fight in such a pan-European conflict, just as it did in World Wars I and II. &quot;As we approach the next century,&quot; he stated on 12 October, during a discussion of the Kosovo situation, &quot;we must never forget one of the most indelible lessons of this one we're about to leave-that America has a direct stake in keeping the peace in Europe before isolated acts of violence turn into large-scale wars.&quot;53 Translation: if you want to make sure American boys will not have to fight another world war, then support me in my efforts to extinguish the smoldering fire in the Balkan powderkeg, before it is too late.<br />
<br />
<strong>Turn- Indo Pak</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>US PRESENCE IS KEY TO INDIA-PAKISTAN PEACE</strong><br />
<strong>KHALILZAD AND LESSER,1998</strong> (Zalmay and Ian, Ambassador to Afghanistan and Sr. analyst at RAND, Sources of Conflict in the 21st Century, page 161)<br />
The fifth driver is Indian, Pakistani, and Chinese perceptions of the role of extraregional powers in any future conflict. Although extraregional powers such as the United States will remain critical and influential actors in South Asia, the nature of their presence and the way their influence is exercised will remain important factors for stability in South Asia. The United States, in particular, contributes to stability insofar as it can creatively use both its regional policy and its antiproliferation strategies to influence the forms of security competition on the subcontinent, the shape and evolution of Indian and Pakistani nuclear programs, and the general patterns of political interaction between India and Pakistan. The nominally extraregional power, China, also plays a critical role here both because of its presumed competition with India and because Beijing has evolved into a vital supplier of conventional and nuclear technologies to Pakistan.<br />

<strong>CAUSES EXTINCTION – MAJOR POWERS GET DRAWN IN</strong><br />
<strong>CALDICOTT, 2002</strong> (Helen, Founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and Nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize, “The New Nuclear Danger: George W. Bush’s Military-Industrial Complex”, p. xiii)<br />
The use of Pakistani nuclear weapons could trigger a chain reaction. Nuclear-armed India, an ancient enemy could respond in kind. China, India’s hated foe, could react if India used her nuclear weapons, triggering a nuclear holocaust on the subcontinent. If any of either Russia or America’s 2,250 strategic weapons on hair-trigger alert were launched either accidentally or purposefully in response, nuclear winter would ensue, meaning the end of most life on earth.<br />

 <strong>MILITARIZING SPACE CAUSES WMD PROLIFERATION AND NUCLEAR WAR</strong><br />
<strong>CHOMSKY, 2001</strong><br />
[Noam, Institute Professor of Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, July-August, International Socialist Review Issue 19. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1064:http://isreview.org/issues/19/NoamChomsky.shtml --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://isreview.org/issues/19/NoamChomsky.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://isreview.org/issues/19/NoamChomsky.shtml</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1064 -->]<br />
The answer is, as I said, full-spectrum dominance, such total dominance of space that no adversary will even come close. Nobody really seriously thinks they can achieve that. But it doesn’t matter. It sets in motion a new age of warfare in which the U.S. happens to be technologically so far in the lead that no potential adversary is going to say, Fine, have a nuclear first strike if you like. They’re going to proceed, and they will proceed in predictable ways, namely by developing anti-satellite weapons, to which the U.S. will have to respond with even more massive militarization. Furthermore, it is pretty well understood that it’s going to lead to proliferation. China is going to respond. Russia is going to respond. If China develops its at the moment very minimal deterrent into one that’s capable of responding to this extended system, India is going to respond out of concern over China. Pakistan will react to India developments. Israel will react to Pakistan developments. Other countries will get into the game. It will pretty clearly have the effect of proliferating weapons of mass destruction. Nobody seriously believes that any potential adversary of the U.S. is going to be nutty enough to try to send a missile. So the missile defense system isn’t intended to do anything defensive. What it’s intended to be is a protection for U.S. forces on the ground or in the air. It’s supposed to give room for a first strike with relative confidence that there can’t be a reaction. This is known. The Canadian military advised the government of Canada in papers that were leaked that the purpose of the missile defense is not any kind of defense. It’s to create a cover for offensive military actions, including possibly a first strike. The Star Wars program, SDI, was understood in the same way. So it’s basically an offensive weapon. A lot of debate now is whether national missile defense is technically possible. Is it going to work? That’s kind of missing the point. If it looks like it’s not going to work, then it’s not a big problem. If there’s any hint that it might work, potential adversaries have to take that seriously. When you’re talking about weapons of total destruction–the likelihood and confidence of total destruction–minimal probability has to be assumed to be reality. You can’t take chances. The Space Command isn’t really concerned about the danger that we might blow up the world. That’s a small problem. What they’re interested in is something different. They’re interested in providing a basis for U.S. military action, including first strike if needed. But more important, they’re protecting U.S.-based investments and commercial interests. And they give an analogy. They say that the militarization of space is very much like the development of navies. The British navy ruled the seas in order to protect British investments and commercial interests. And then, of course, other navies responded, like the German navy. You go on and get into the First World War.<br />

<strong>US SPACE DOMINANCE WILL TANK CHINESE RELATIONS</strong><br />
<strong>MARTEL AND YOSHIHARA, 2003</strong><br />
[William C. and Toshi, ‘Averting a Sinp-U.S. Space Race’, The Washington Quarterly, The Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1065:http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/washington_quarterly/v026/26.4martel.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/washington_quarterly/v026/26.4martel.html" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/washington_quarterly/v026/26.4martel.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1065 -->]<br />
At the same time that the United States views space dominance as a fundamental tenet of its national security, China evidently views U.S. space dominance as a major threat to its geostrategic interests. These views inevitably breed a zero-sum competition, in which one side perceives any loss as a gain for the other, and could ultimately prove destabilizing for Sino-U.S. relations. First, Beijing perceives the proposed U.S. missile defense system, which will be supported by an array of space systems and sensors, as a strategic menace to China and to international security Many China watchers contend that this perception stems from anxietiesthat any conceivable system of missile defenses being developed by the Bush administration will undermine China's small nuclear deterrent. Beijing remains wary of the joint research program on missile defense by the U.S.-Japanese alliance, which the PRC sees as a potential partnership for blocking Chinese regional aspirations or, in broader terms, for containing China. Of particular concern for Beijing is the possibility that Tokyo's decision formally to join U.S. plans for deploying missile defense in Northeast Asia will significantly increase Japan's military capabilities by providing an opportunity for Japanese forces to enjoy unprecedented military integration with U.S. forces in the areas of space-based intelligence and communications. Second, the military use of space has profound implications for the uneasy stalemate in the Taiwan Strait, which has always presented the possibility of a major confrontation between Washington and Beijing. One argument is that U.S. capabilities allow the United States to project power near Taiwan, while the space-based sensors and weapons for missile defense could blunt China's arsenal of ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan. Moreover, the prospect of transfers of missile defense systems to Taiwan, which could usher in a period of unprecedented military cooperation between Taipei and Washington, no doubt deeply troubles Beijing. China, for its part, will increasingly need military space capabilities if it is to improve its ability to coerce Taiwan in a conflict and counter U.S. intervention to defend the island in a crisis or conflict.<br />

<strong>THIS ESCALATES TO NUCLEAR WAR</strong><br />
<strong>THE STRAITS TIMES, 2000</strong><br />
[June 25th, Singapore, “No-one gains in war over Taiwan”]<br />
THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -horror of horrors -raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else. Gen Ridgeway recalled that the biggest mistake the US made during the Korean War was to assess Chinese actions according to the American way of thinking. &quot;Just when everyone believed that no sensible commander would march south of the Yalu, the Chinese troops suddenly appeared,&quot; he recalled. (The Yalu is the river which borders China and North Korea, and the crossing of the river marked China's entry into the war against the Americans). &quot;I feel uneasy if now somebody were to tell me that they bet China would not do this or that,&quot; he said in a recent interview given to the Chinese press.<br />

<strong>SPACE MILITARIZATION INCREASES PROLIFERATION</strong><br />
<strong>KATZ-HYMAN AND KREPON, 2005</strong><br />
[Michael and Michael, July, &quot;Viewpoint: Space Weapons and Proliferation.&quot; Non Proliferation Review. Vol. 12, No. 2, online version: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1066:http://spacedebate.org/evidence/2390/# --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://spacedebate.org/evidence/2390/#" rel="nofollow">http://spacedebate.org/evidence/2390/#</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1066 -->]<br />
We argue that additional proliferation of nuclear weapons, rather than new arms races, is the most likely outcome of a renewed interest in space warfare. Proliferation will be a natural consequence of more nations feeling less secure as a result of space weapons. Adverse proliferation consequences could be both direct and indirect. China and Russia will likely feel most directly threatened by U.S. space warfare initiatives. Beijing will likely increase its nuclear weapon requirements to counter increased threat perceptions without engaging in an arms race, while Moscow will probably seek to adjust the contraction of its nuclear arsenal to the extent the Kremlin believes that its deterrent might be challenged by U.S. initiatives. Indirect, horizontal proliferation is likely to result from greater strains in major power relations and in U.S.-alliance ties triggered by U.S. initiatives to dominate space. In the absence of united fronts against proliferation by major powers and by America's friends and allies, international efforts to strengthen nonproliferation and disarmament norms are likely to fail, and hedging strategies against a more worrisome future are likely to multiply.<br />

 <strong>SPACE MILITARIZATION NOW</strong><br />
<strong>MEYERS, 2008</strong><br />
[Steven Lee, Staff writer for the new your times and PHd in international relations, March 9th, “Look Out Below. The Arms Race in Space May Be On”, Lexis Nexis]<br />
The consequences of war in space are in fact so cataclysmic that arms control advocates like Mr. Kimball would like simply to prohibit the use of weapons beyond the earth's atmosphere. But it’s already be too late for that. In the weeks since an American rocket slammed into an out-of-control satellite over the Pacific Ocean, officials and experts have made it clear that the United States, for better or worse, is already committed to having the capacity to wage war in space. And that, it seems likely, will prompt others to keep pace. What makes people want to ban war in space is exactly what keeps the Pentagon's war planners busy preparing for it: The United States has become so dependent on space that it has become the country's Achilles' heel. ''Our adversaries understand our dependence upon space-based capabilities,'' Gen. Kevin P. Chilton, commander of the United States Strategic Command, wrote in Congressional testimony on Feb. 27, ''and we must be ready to detect, track, characterize, attribute, predict and respond to any threat to our space infrastructure.'' Whatever Pentagon assurances there have been to the contrary, the destruction of a satellite more than 130 miles above the Pacific Ocean a week earlier, on Feb. 20, was an extraordinary display of what General Chilton had in mind -- a capacity that the Pentagon under President Bush has tenaciously sought to protect and enlarge. Is war in space inevitable? The idea or such a war has been around since Sputnik, but for most of the cold war it remained safely within the realm of science fiction and the carefully proscribed American-Soviet arms race. That is changing. A dozen countries now can reach space with satellites -- and, therefore, with weapons. China strutted its stuff in January 2007 by shooting down one of its own weather satellites 530 miles above the planet. ''The first era of the space age was one of experimentation and discovery,'' a Congressional commission reported just before President Bush took office in 2001. ''We are now on the threshold of a new era of the space age, devoted to mastering operations in space.''<br />

<strong>SPACE WEAPONS WON’T LEAD TO AN ARMS RACE – THEY’RE ONLY A DETERRENT. OTHER COUNTRIES WILL REALIZE WE’RE NOT A THREAT.</strong><br />

Hence, the argument that the unilateral deployment of space weapons will precipitate a disastrous arms race is misplaced. To be sure, space weapons are offensive by their very nature. They deter violence by the omnipresent threat of precise, measured, and unstoppable retaliation. They offer no advantage if the target set considered is not global. But they also offer no advantage in the mission of territorial occupation. As such, they are far less threatening to the international environment than any combination of weapons employed in their stead. A state employing offensive deterrence through space-weapons can punish a transgressor state, but is in a poor position to challenge its sovereignty. The transgressor state is less likely to succumb to the security dilemma if it perceives its national survival is not at risk. Moreover, the tremendous expense of space weapons inhibits their indiscriminate use. Over time, the world of sovereign states will recognize that the US does not threaten self-determination internally, though it challenges any attempts to intervene militarily in the politics of others, and has severely restricted its own capacity to do so.<br />

And America would respond -- finally. But would another state? If America were to weaponize space today, it is unlikely that any other state or group of states would find it rational to counter in kind. The entry cost to provide the infrastructure necessary is too high; hundreds of billions of dollars, at minimum. The years of investment it would take to achieve a minimal counter-force capability -- essentially from scratch -- would provide more than ample time for the US to entrench itself in space, and readily counter preliminary efforts to displace it. The tremendous effort in time and resources would be worse than wasted. Most states, if not all, would opt not to counter US deployments in kind. They might oppose US interests with asymmetric balancing, depending on how aggressively America uses its new power, but the likelihood of a hemorrhaging arms race in space should the US deploy weapons there -- at least for the next few years -- is extremely remote.<br />

<strong>SPACE WEAPONIZATION KEY TO MILITARY READINESS</strong><br />

With such demonstrated utility and reliance, there is no question the US must guarantee space access if it is to be successful in future conflicts. Its military has stepped well over the threshold of a new way of war. It is simply not possible to go back to the violently spasmodic mode of combat typical of pre-space intervention. The United States is now highly discriminating in the projection of violence, parsimonious in the intended breadth of its destruction. For the positive process of transformation to continue, however, space weapons must enter the combat inventory of the United States.<br />

<strong>MILITARY READINESS DETERS GLOBAL WAR</strong><br />
<strong>SPENCER, 2000</strong><br />
[Jack, Research fellow at the Thomas A.

Military readiness is vital because declines in America's military readiness signal to the rest of the world that the United States is not prepared to defend its interests. Therefore, potentially hostile nations will be more likely to lash out against American allies and interests, inevitably leading to U.S. involvement in combat. A high state of military readiness is more likely to deter potentially hostile nations from acting aggressively in regions of vital national interest, thereby preserving peace.<br />
