**__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Contention one: The Race for Space</span>__**
**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Space is imprinted with the characterizations of sub persons inhabiting it and vice versa. Thus racing space in type of a checker board mentality which distinguishes the space inhabited by whites and nonwhites.</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">MILLS Associate Prof of Philosophy @ U Illinois, Chicago 1997</span>**
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Charles-; //The Racial Contract//; p. 1-3</span>
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Neither space nor the individual is usually an object of explicit and detailed norming for the mainstream social contract. **__Space is__** just //there//, **__taken for granted, and the individual is tacitly posited as the white adult male, so that all individuals are obviously equal.__** But for the Racial Contract, space itself and the individuals therein are not homogenous; so explicit normative distinctions necessarily have to be made. I will treat the norming of space and the person separately, though exegesis is complicated by the fact that they are bound up together. **__The norming of space is partially done in terms of the //racing// of space, the depiction of space as dominated by individuals__** (whether persons or subpersons) **__of a certain race. At the same time, the norming of the individual is partially achieved by //spacing// it, that is, representing it as imprinted with the characteristics of a certain kind of space.__** So this is a mutually supporting characterization that, for subpersons, becomes a circular indictment: “You are what you are in part because you originate from a certain kind of space, and that space has those properties because it is inhabited by creatures like yourself.”</span>

It **__will introduce you to__** </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">notions of aristocracy, democracy, absolutism, liberalism, representative government, socialism, welfare capitalism, and libertarianism. But though it covers</span>**__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">more</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">than two thousand years of Western political thought and runs the ostensible gamut of political systems, there will be no mention of the basic political system that has shaped the world for the past several hundred years. </span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">And </span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">this omission is not accidental</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">. </span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Rather</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">, it reflects</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">the fact</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">that</span>__**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">standard textbooks and courses have for the most part been written and designed by</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> **__whites__** who **__take their racial privilege so much for granted that they do not even see it as //political//, as a form of domination.__** </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Ironically, the most important political system of recent global history-</span>**__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the system of dominationby which white people have</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">historically</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">ruled over</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">and, in certain important ways, continue </span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">to rule over nonwhite people</span>__**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">-</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">is not seen as a political system at all. It is just taken for granted, it is the background against which other systems, which we are to see as political are highlighted. This book is an attempt to redirect your vision, to make you see what, in a sense, has been there all along.</span>
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Philosophy has remained remarkably untouched by the debates over multiculturalism, cannon reform, and ethnic diversity racking the academy; both demographically and conceptually, it is one of the “whitest” of the humanities. Blacks, for example, constitute only about 1 percent of philosophers in North American universities-a hundred or so people out of more than ten thousand-and there are even fewer Latino, Asian American, and Native American philosophers. Surely this underrepresentation itself stands in need of an explanation, and in my opinion it can be traced in part to a conceptual array and a standard repertoire of concerns whose abstractness typically elides, rather than genuinely includes, the experience of racial minorities. Since (white) women have the demographic advantage of numbers, there are of course far more female philosophers in the profession than nonwhite philosophers (though still not proportionate to women’s percentage of the population), and they have made far greater progress in developing alternative conceptualizations. Those African American philosophers who do work in moral and political theory tend either to produce general work indistinguishable from that of their white peers or to focus on local issues (affirmative action, the black “underclass”) or historical figures (W.E.B Du Bois, Alain Locke) in a way that does not aggressively engage the broader debate.</span>
**__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">What is needed is a global theoretical framework for situating discussions of race and white racism, and</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">thereby challenging the assumptions of white political philosophy, which</span>__**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">would correspond to feminist theorists’ articulation of the centrality of gender, patriarchy, and sexism to traditional moral and political theory. What is needed, in other words,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> **__is a recognition that racism__** (**__or,__** as I will argue, **__global white supremacy__**) **__is //itself// a political system, a__** </span>**__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">particular</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">power structure of formal or informal rule, </span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">socioeconomic privilege, and norms for the differential distribution of material wealth and opportunities, benefits and burdens , rights and duties.</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> The notion of the Racial Contract is</span>__**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">, I suggest, **__one__** </span>**__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">possible</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">way of making this connection with mainstream theory, </span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">since</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">it uses the vocabulary and apparatus already developed for contractarianism to map this unacknowledged system. </span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Contract talk is, after all, the political lingua franca of our times.</span>__**

Yet even **__t__**</span>**__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">hat formulation of superiority demanded a new structure of thought, a new way of assimilating puzzling questions and new realities.

A century and a half after Columbus’s voyage, America was still the great unknown. Cyrano de Bergerac’s //Histoire comique des Etats et Empires de la Lune et du Soleil// was published in two parts in 1657 and 1662, and</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> **__this early version of H.G.

**__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">It has been argued that forensics is</span>__**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> (or should be) **__primarily an educational enterprise, rooted in pedagogy, rhetoric, and research.

Recruitment of forensics competitors through on campus multicultural clubs and organizations. b. Development of non-traditional forensics programs.

Adoption of debate topics centered on global rather than national concerns. d. Expository speeches geared to inform about other cultures. e. Interpretive programs adopted from another culture's canons of literature. f. Creation of new events or a return to old ones (such as oratorical speeches which harmonize with African speaking styles). g. Experiential activities designed to expose individuals in forensics to other cultural views. h. Research assessing current forensic multiculturalism.</span>
**__CONTENTION THREE: SOLVENCY__**
**WE MUST ENGAGE IN A CRITICAL PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH IN ORDER TO UNVEIL THE KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION OF THE OPPRESSED**
Paulo **Freire**. Educational Revolutionary. “Pedagogy of the Oppressed”. Pg 139-140
__The desire for conquest (__or rather the necessity of conquest) __is at all times present in antidialogical action.__ To this end the oppressors attempt to destroy in the oppressed their quality as “considerers” of the world. __Since the oppressors cannot totally achieve this destruction, they must mythicize the world. In order to present for the consideration of the oppressed and subjugated a world of deceit designed to increase their alienation and passivity, the oppressors develop a series of methods precluding any presentation of the world as a problem and showing it rather as a fixed entity, as something given—something to which people as mere spectators, must adapt.__
**__It is necessary for the oppressors to approach the people in order, via subjugation, to keep them passive. This approximation, however, does not involve being with the people, or require true communication. It is accomplished by the oppressors’ depositing myths indispensible to the preservation of the status quo: for example, the myth that the oppressive order is a ‘free society’; the myth that all persons are free to work where they wish, that if they don’t like their boss they can leave him and look or another job; the myth that this order respects human rights and is therefore worthy of esteem; the myth that anyone who is industrious can become an entrepreneur—worse yet, the myth that the street vendor is as much an entrepreneur as the owner of a large factory; the myth of the universal rights of education, when all the Brazilian children who enter primary schools only a tiny faction ever reach the university; the myth of the equality of all individuals, then the question, “Do you know who you’re talking to?” is still current among us; the myth of the heroism of the oppressor classes as defenders of “Western Christian civilization” against “materialist barbarism”; the myth of the charity and generosity of the elites, when what they really do as a class is to foster selective ‘good deeds’ (subsequently elaborates into the myth of ‘disinterested aid”, which on the international level was severely criticized by Pope John XXIII).; the myth that the dominant elites, “recognizing their duties”, promote the advancement of the people, so that the people, in a gesture of gratitude, should accept the words of the elites and be conformed to them; the myth that rebellions in a sin against God; the myth of private property as fundamental to personal human development (so long as oppressors are the only true human beings); the myth of the industriousness of the oppressors and the laziness and dishonesty of the oppressed, as well as the myth of the natural inferiority of ht latter and the superiority of the former.__**
**__All these myths (and others the reader could list), the internalization of which is essential to the subjugation of the oppressed, are presented to them by well organized propaganda and slogans, via the mass “communications” media—as if such alienation constituted real communication.__**

**THE ROLL OF THE BALLOT IS TO ENDORSE THE BEST ADVOCACY THAT REJECTS THE COLONIZED EDUCATIONAL APPARATUS WHICH GUISES WHITE SUPREMACY.**

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">To think about decolonizing the revolutionary imagination, we must reference the history of colonization. Through colonization, Western civilization ("a disease historically spread by sharp swords"[1]) has been violently imposed upon the entire world. __Colonialism is not just the process of establishing physical control over territory, it is the process of establishing the ideologies and the identities -- colonies in the mind -- that perpetuate control. Central to this process has been the manufacture of attitudes of racism, nationalism, patriarchal manhood, and the division of society into economic classes.__ If we are to take seriously the prospect of decolonizing the revolutionary imagination then we must examine how these attitudes shape the way we conceive of social change. Likewise, we must remember that analysis is shaped by experience, and that those who suffer directly as targets of these oppressive attitudes often live the experiences that create clear analysis. Let us not forget that effective revolutions are based on listening.__In facing the global crisis,__ the most powerful weapon that we have is our imagination. But first __we must liberate ourselves from the conceptual limitations we place on social change. As we expand the realm of the possible we shape the direction of the probable. This means directly confronting the myths and assumptions that make a better world seem unattainable__. To that end, this essay endeavors to explore some tools to help us unshackle our imaginations and increase the momentum of the global justice movements' process of creating a political space to fundamentally redesign the global system.</span>
