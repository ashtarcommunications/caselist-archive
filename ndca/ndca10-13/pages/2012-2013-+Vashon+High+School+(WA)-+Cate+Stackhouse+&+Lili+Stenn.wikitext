Aff lyfe: cate.stackhousedeb@gmail.com
Neg Cites/ for a good time: lili.stenndeb@gmail.com

Comments or concerns about our in-round sassy high-fiving should go to Cate

I've posted most neg cites. If there's some missing, feel free to email me and I'll send them to you along with a complimentary video of your choice: Cate physically beating the novices, or Elliot crying because his Privatization blocks were terrible.

Side note we (Lili) are sorry for being cross ex fascists (quarters at UPS- don't worry she had quiet time to think about the things she did) and plan on working on it

We'd also like to apologize for any spontaneous weave flipping. Sometimes, we just can't keep it in~~

Things we learned at State:
-"Reject the Aff" is a reason to reject the neg in the 1nc
-Congress will be partying too hard on their "spring break" to do CIR ~
-The Vatican can fund NIB


**Notes-
Lili will be debating with Callan Foster at nationals because Cate has to graduate which is dumb. But please field Aff-based cite requests to Cate because Lili doesn't know about the Aff lyfe and had to give her first 2AC ever at nat quals.

Narratives help us understand the epistemology of the inherent ableism in debate and society – our use of the narrative relating to disability studies is crucial to disrupting abelist modes of thought.

Traditional approaches to the problem of ablenormative modes of transportation will attempt to “solve” the problem using a macro-level change in national policy. History proves that this approach will do nothing. The Americans with Disabilities Act passed in the 1990s attempted to apply regulations to the industry in order to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities, but did very little to actually “solve” the problem – in fact, this change in policy only perpetuated ableist modes of thought in transportation policy

Society constructs an ideal image of what the world should look like and how this ideal image is inherent in transportation infrastructure. We disregard difference and that maybe some people can’t access the very infrastructure we invest in. Disability continues to be examined from the perspective of the Other. This traditional approach needs to be reversed and shift our gaze to why these assumptions have come about.

===NIB (1AC):=== 
Same as @ UPS
===Ableism 1AC:=== 
This year’s debate topic tasks us with devising new ways to invest in America’s transportation infrastructure. Unfortunately, most traditional debate teams will approach the topic in an inherently ableist way through modes of transportation infrastructure that are inherently ablenormative in the status quo.

Society constructs an ideal image of what the world should look like and how this ideal image is inherent in transportation infrastructure. We disregard difference and that maybe some people can’t access the very infrastructure we invest in. Disability continues to be examined from the perspective of the Other. This traditional approach needs to be reversed and shift our gaze to why these assumptions have come about.
This ablenormativity fails to theorize difference-it idealizes a conception of “able-bodiedness”

Traditional approaches to the problem of ablenormative modes of transportation will attempt to “solve” the problem using a macro-level change in national policy. History proves that this approach will do nothing. The Americans with Disabilities Act passed in the 1990s attempted to apply regulations to the industry in order to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities, but did very little to actually “solve” the problem – in fact, this change in policy only perpetuated ableist modes of thought in transportation policy

**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">And thus: We ask the judge to affirm an increase in transportation infrastructure investment in the United States through our investigation of the epistemology of Ablenormativity inherent in transportation infrastructure through the life writings of the 1AC</span>**

We need to interrogate the underlying ableist assumptions that are inherent in the federal government in the status quo. Policy making in the status quo only re-entrenches ableist binaries. In order to change debate we need to re-assess how we both judge rounds, and how we are told (by debaters) to judge rounds.
