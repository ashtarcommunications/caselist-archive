And, there’s a high risk of impact - Perception that U.S. Naval forces are constrained in central Asia coupled with Chinese nationalism makes even a minor maritime conflict escalate

Removing U.S. Naval presence from Japan is critical to prevent miscalculation and escalation between U.S. and China - Chinese forces directly perceive Yokosuka
