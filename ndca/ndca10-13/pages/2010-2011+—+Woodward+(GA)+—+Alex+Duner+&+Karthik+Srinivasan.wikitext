Notes:

1. This team has debated together only sporadically. At Emory, Alex debated with Nasir Nanjee and Karthik debated with Zoi Rosado. At Fayette County, Alex debated with Nasir and Karthik did not debate. Their last tournament together was the Glenbrooks. 

2. Both debaters have only read an Afghanistan affirmative. For recent versions, see the wiki pages of other Woodward teams—the most up-to-date information is on SS's page.

3. We will provide the full text of evidence upon request but will only post first-and-last words on the wiki for organizational reasons. For affirmative questions or cites, email Alex Duner at [[mailto:asduner13@st.woodward.edu|asduner13@st.woodward.edu]]. For negative questions or cites, email Karthik Srinivasan at [[mailto:karthiks.625@gmail.com|karthiks.625@gmail.com]].

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">**Third, now is the key time for Obama to reassert control and reject the Petraeus Lobby’s pleas for more time to continue COIN—this is vital to reassure allies and restore America’s international credibility.**</span>

===<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">The Plan</span>=== 

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**Thus, the plan:**</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> The President of the United States should direct the Department of Defense to substantially draw down the United States military presence in Afghanistan by shifting from a counter-insurgency strategy to a counter-terrorism strategy including a decrease to 68,000 troops or less by October 2011 and 30,000 or less by July 2012.
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We’ll clarify.</span></span><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> </span>
===<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Contention 4 - Solvency</span>=== 

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**First, the plan is a substantial reduction in military presence—this saves billions and reduces resentment.**</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**The Afghanistan Study Group, 8/16/10** (an ad hoc group of public policy practitioners, former U.S. government officials, academics, business representatives, policy-concerned activists and association leaders concerned with the Obama administration’s policy course in Afghanistan “What’s Wrong With The Current U.S Strategy,” A New Way Forward: Rethinking U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan, August 16, [[http://www.afghanistanstudygroup.org/NewWayForward_report.pdf]]) </span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">//2. Scale back and eventually Suspend Combat operations in the South and Reduce the U.S. Military footprint. … This step would save the U.S. at least $60 billion to $80 billion per year and reduce local resentment at our large and intrusive military presence.//</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**Second, shifting to counter-terrorism is the most effective strategy—it reduces casualties, reassures allies, and keeps the pressure on extremists.**</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">//The lesson learned from history must be to do what we know to be doable and to avoid what we have learned is not. … A "stable" Afghan government under Hamid Karzai is a losing proposition that should be carefully abandoned as inconspicuously and quickly as possible.//</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">//Officials say a shift in U.S. war strategy has begun to take place in Afghanistan, away from classic counterinsurgency (protecting the population, providing basic services, promoting good government) and toward the traditional business of killing and capturing bad guys. … However, it is now calculated, even by many COIN advocates, that this process would take too long—and be too corrupted by Afghan politics—to work in any practical sense.// </span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**Fourth, the plan is key to prevent precipitous withdrawal—public support makes a long-term counter-insurgency posture politically untenable.**</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**Fifth, the best case scenario for the current strategy in Afghanistan is even worse than outright failure—staying the course is delusional.**</span>

Let’s not wait a year to discover that there’s an even worse fate ahead, a “success” that leaves us mired there for years to come as our troubles at home only grow. With everything else Americans have to deal with, who needs a future Petraeus Syndrome?//</span>

**First, the Obama Administration is conducting a strategic review of its Afghanistan policy in December—this has set in motion a political streetfight between the President and his military commanders.**

//The war in Afghanistan is at a crossroads, as it is at all times… In short order, military intelligence officials quietly pushed back, feeding their beliefs that the very high-profile attempts to kill or negotiate with the mid-level Taliban leadership haven’t noticeably affected the insurgency to still more reporters.//

**Unfortunately, Obama will cave to the military brass in the status quo and recommit to Petraeus’s COIN strategy.**

//As the public leaking and pundit-wrangling has crested, the Obama administration has also hinted strongly that it will simply disregard the July 2011 deadline for drawdown. ….At the same time, because of the bizarre politics over Obama’s firing of General McChrystal this past summer, it’s unlikely Obama will feel comfortable or politically strong enough to contravene Petraeus’ public bidding for more time to accomplish something.//

**This is an unacceptable outcome—caving to the generals will cement the DOD’s control of U.S. foreign policy and eviscerate civilian control of the military.**

//And what to make of all the public and contradictory wrangling over positions, troops and strategy? …To reset the civ-mil balance, as its called, requires strong leadership at the top: the president, the secretary of defense, and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff.//

//One of the maladies plaguing US foreign policy creation is the over-reliance on, and undue deference shown to, the military when shaping that policy. … Given the ascendancy of the military, it should come as no surprise the extent to which conventional wisdom has hardened around the preferred narrative of the “can-do” crowd – as we are treated to optimistic assessments of what the military can achieve in a given setting, tales of turned corners, new hope, “the next six months,” deus ex machina like doctrine, mythically endowed “surges” etc.//

**The impact is widespread conflict and suffering—military activism makes every impact worse.**
Jeffrey D. **Sachs**, Director of The Earth Institute, Quetelet Professor of Sustainable Development, and Professor of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University, Special Advisor to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, former Director of the UN Millennium Project and Special Advisor to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the Millennium Development Goals, widely considered to be the leading international economic advisor of his generation, holds a Ph.D. from Harvard University, **2007** (“America’s Failed Militarized Foreign Policy,” Project Syndicate, November 22nd, Available Online at http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs135/English, Accessed 11-18-2010)
//Many of today’s war zones – including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, and Sudan – share basic problems that lie at the root of their conflicts. … We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.”//

**And, military activism is an unsustainable strategy—reclaiming civilian control of foreign policy is vital to contain threats while maintaining American power.**
Patrick **Porter**, Senior Lecturer in the Defence Studies Department at King’s College London, former Fairfax Oxford Australia Scholar and Fellow of the Institute of Historical Research in London, holds a Ph.D. in Cultural and Religious History from Oxford University, **11-15-2010** (“The military is not a surgical tool of political engineering,” Guardian, November 15th, Available Online at http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/15/we-may-never-destroy-al-qaida, Accessed 11-18-2010)
//The road to strategic hell is paved with good intentions. …If we want to contain own worst enemy, it is time to look in the mirror.//

**Now is the key time for Obama to reassert control and reject the Petraeus Lobby’s pleas for more time to continue COIN—this is vital to reassure allies and restore America’s international credibility.**
Andrew J. **Bacevich**, Professor of History and International Relations at Boston University, graduated from West Point, former Colonel in the United States Army, holds a Ph.D. in American Diplomatic History from Princeton University, **10-05-2010** (“Obama Must Defy His Generals,” The New Republic, October 5th, Available Online at http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130346439, Accessed 10-12-2010)
//"The President is an elected king," wrote Randolph Bourne nearly a century ago, "but the fact that he is elected has proved to be of far less significance ... than the fact that he is pragmatically a king." … Should he squander this last opportunity, however, the king is likely to find himself soon thereafter seeking new employment.//

**Finally, military leaders are engaged in an explicit campaign to manipulate the December Review in order to maintain the current strategy—negative evidence should be assessed with extreme skepticism.**
Michael A. **Cohen**, former Senior Research Fellow at the New America Foundation, B.A. in International Relations from American University and M.A. in International Relations from Columbia University, served in the Department of State as chief speechwriter for U.S. Representative to the United Nations Bill Richardson and Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, currently serves on the board of the National Security Network and has taught at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, **10-29-2010** (“Petraeus Versus Obama,” Foreign Policy, October 29th, Available Online at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/29/petraeus_versus_obama, Accessed 11-10-2010)
//There are important implications here for Obama.… But that doesn't mean anyone—least of all the White House or the American people—should confuse the military's assessment of the situation in Afghanistan with the truth.//

===The War in Afghanistan (Solvency)=== 
**First, claims of military progress do not reflect reality—negative authors are describing a war that only exists in the military’s imagination.**
Michael A. **Cohen**, former Senior Research Fellow at the New America Foundation, B.A. in International Relations from American University and M.A. in International Relations from Columbia University, served in the Department of State as chief speechwriter for U.S. Representative to the United Nations Bill Richardson and Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, currently serves on the board of the National Security Network and has taught at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, **10-29-2010** (“Petraeus Versus Obama,” Foreign Policy, October 29th, Available Online at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/29/petraeus_versus_obama, Accessed 11-10-2010)
//Today there are two wars taking place in Afghanistan….This growing divide is increasingly bringing into question the very credibility of U.S. military statements about military progress in Afghanistan.//

**Second, shifting to counter-terrorism is the most effective strategy—it reduces casualties, reassures allies, and keeps the pressure on extremists.**
Thomas **Snodgrass**, Retired Colonel in the U.S. Air Force, Director of Military Affairs for The Society of Americans for National Existence, Former Adjunct Professor of History at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, **08-05-2010** (“Conservatives: Abandoning Counterinsurgency,” The American Thinker, August 5th, Available Online at http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/08/conservatives_abandoning_count.html, Accessed 08-30-2010)
//The lesson learned from history must be to do what we know to be doable and to avoid what we have learned is not. … A "stable" Afghan government under Hamid Karzai is a losing proposition that should be carefully abandoned as inconspicuously and quickly as possible.//

**Third, the war continues to go badly—every COIN metric shows epic failure: governance is hopeless, the elections were a joke, and corruption is rampant.**
Michael A. **Cohen**, former Senior Research Fellow at the New America Foundation, B.A. in International Relations from American University and M.A. in International Relations from Columbia University, served in the Department of State as chief speechwriter for U.S. Representative to the United Nations Bill Richardson and Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, currently serves on the board of the National Security Network and has taught at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, **10-29-2010** (“Petraeus Versus Obama,” Foreign Policy, October 29th, Available Online at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/29/petraeus_versus_obama, Accessed 11-10-2010)
//What seems most backwards about the military's congenital optimism is that even by the key metrics of their own counterinsurgency (COIN) strategy there has been almost no change for the better in Afghanistan. Governance in Afghanistan remains as hopeless as ever. September's parliamentary elections now appear to have been so fraud-ridden that the entire vote is in question. U.S. efforts to curb incessant government corruption have not led to any real crackdown on graft; instead it has heightened tensions with the Karzai government, and reports that Afghan government officials receive bags of cash from the Iranian government have been met with official shrugs in Kabul.//

**Finally, the plan is a substantial reduction in military presence—this saves billions and reduces resentment.**
**The Afghanistan Study Group**—an ad hoc group of public policy practitioners, former U.S. government officials, academics, business representatives, policy-concerned activists and association leaders concerned with the Obama administration’s policy course in Afghanistan, **08-16-2010** (“The Way Forward: A Five-Point Approach,” A New Way Forward: Rethinking U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan, August 16th, Available Online at http://www.afghanistanstudygroup.org/NewWayForward_report.pdf, Accessed 08-29-2010)
//2. Scale back and eventually Suspend Combat operations in the South and Reduce the U.S. Military footprint. … This step would save the U.S. at least $60 billion to $80 billion per year and reduce local resentment at our large and intrusive military presence.//

[THE FIRST/NEXT OFF-CASE POSITION IS THE HERD MENTALITY CRITIQUE]
We’ll isolate several links:

__First__, __democracy__—the 1AC’s commitment to “democracy” in the Middle East relies on __a bankrupt commitment to liberalism__—their extension of “tolerance” to the Other justifies __rampant global violence__ in the name of __protecting liberal civilization__.
