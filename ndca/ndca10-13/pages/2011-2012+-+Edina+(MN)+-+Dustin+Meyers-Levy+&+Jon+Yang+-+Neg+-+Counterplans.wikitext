==Author Cites PIC==

**We advocate the 1AC absent their author citations.**

**Our plagiarism of the 1AC solves the case better – their reliance on traditional authors ensures that class and society’s hierarchies remain in place, turning their impacts. Our advocacy divorces the text from the author – this allows the formation of new ideas**

The Department of Defense should replace current spending on fossil fuels by agreeing to pay at least one dollar per kilowatt-hour for space-based solar power services developed by the private sector.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Although there is some substance to arguments that </span>__the OST__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">only precludes those military activities that were of little interest to the superpowers and does not bring much clarity or direction to many of the most important potential space activities, the treaty nonetheless </span>__provides a solid and comprehensive foundation upon which to build additional legal structures needed to advance spacepower.____Spacefaring actors can most effectively improve on this foundation through__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a number of actions including </span>__further developing and refining the OST regime, adapting the most useful parts of analogous regimes__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> such as the Law of the Sea and Seabed Authority mechanisms, </span>__and rejecting standards that stifle innovation, inadequately address threats to humanity's survival, or do not provide opportunities for rewards__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> commensurate with risks undertaken.
