<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Trigger warning: Discourse is my gun and I’m about to pull the trigger.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">First is the narrative</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">I have been a victim of sexual harassment during my time in debate. I’m not going to tell you that story; I’m not going to make you sit through my pain. However, I will use the debate space to try to create some positive change. Our LD community isn’t perfect – it’s not even close – and it’s in trouble. Inspired by the resolution, I seek to rehabilitate the debate community.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Starting at Columbia, I have been reading a micropolitical position regarding sexism and sexual harassment in the debate community. In the original case, I said “I must occupy. I am but one face of the anonymous movement, and our struggle is against an anonymous oppression.” I am a woman. I am a lone wolf. I am a minority in debate. Therefore I am anonymous. I am invisible. We are all invisible until we make noise, until we disturb the peace. I disturbed the peace at Columbia and started a community-wide discussion, until I was relegated back into the shroud of anonymity.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Aside from constant heckling and derision from judges, coaches, and my fellow debaters, there have also been several attempts to silence me. Tournament staff have detained me and told me to channel my angst elsewhere. One coach took the rather extreme measures of contacting tournament staff, my coach, and even my school administration in an effort to have me punished or excluded. I’ve had several judges refuse to flow my case and give me L24’s because they thought my non-topical discourse was inappropriate. And in every single debate round I’ve had on my micropolitical postion, my opponents have never failed to tell me that my arguments don’t belong in the round.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">I know that micropolitical positions are not the norm in debate. I know that my non-topical discourse goes against the imaginary rules that the privileged, white males of this game created. But I never agreed to comply with the debate community’s rules or wishes for me to stop. Like the martyrs of the Occupy movement, I am rebelling. This is my “movement’s performative resistance to a system that refuses to reward action.”</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">And, narratives are important for critically examining our activity. No ivory tower philosopher or debate theorist can tell us what’s best for us.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Debaters are constantly fighting for recognition. The ballot is a tool of reward, punishment, and ultimately <strong>power</strong>. The object of this game is to win ballots. Ballots and bids are the currency of visibility in the contemporary debate culture. In order to “speak” I have to become visible as an individual. <strong>The name on the ballot is a voice, visibility, endorsement by authority and backing by normative force.</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The judge is in a position of privilege by virtue of being the judge but also because most judges are white males. They decide who’s experience deserves to be reproduced. When the judge signs the ballot for the debater, they are giving them power, a voice, a home. They’re the director who chooses callback, giving the oppressed a weapon to fight back, and a megaphone to yell Truth at a raucous crowd. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">To clarify, the role of the ballot is not about arbitrarily punishing people. The ballot with my name on it is uniquely important - the experience of marginalized voices cannot be replicated by others since you will not find better evidence about discrimination in debate than you will from a lone wolf and woman. Also, if I’m winning that topical debate masks the real issues in the debate community, then it’s not arbitrary to vote against the person in favor of topical debate and silence.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Here are my justifications:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">First, critiques of the context of debate - of debate norms, topical debate, and of debate practices comes logically prior to any argument substantive or theoretical. These are functionally incomparable arguments; mine is about real effects of speech acts and conduct.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">The Transformation of Silence Into Language and Action (excerpt) by Audre Lorde 26-06-2007 (Originally delivered at the Modern Language Association’s “Lesbian and Literature Panel,” Chicago, Illinois, December 28, 1977.

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">I have come to believe </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">over and over again that what is most important to me must be spoken, made verbal and shared, even at the risk of having it bruised or misunderstood.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">That the speaking profits me, beyond any other effect. I was forced to look upon myself and my living with a harsh and urgent clarity that has left me still shaken but much stronger. Some of what I experienced during that time has helped elucidate for me much of what I feel concerning the transformation of silence into language and action. In becoming forcibly and essentially aware of my mortality, and of what I wished and wanted for my life, however short it might be, priorities and omissions became strongly etched in a merciless light, and what I most regretted were my silences. Of what had I ever been afraid? To question or to speak as I believed could have meant pain, or death. But we all hurt in so many different ways, all the time, and pain will either change or end. Death, on the other hand, is the final silence. And that might be coming quickly now, without regard for whether I had ever spoken what needed to be said, or had only betrayed myself into small silences, while I planned someday to speak, or waited for someone else’s words. I was going to die, if not sooner then later, whether or not I had ever spoken myself. My silences had not protected me. Your silence will not protect you. What are the words you do not yet have? What do you need to say? What are the tyrannies you swallow day by day and attempt to make your own, until you will sicken and die of them, still in silence? Perhaps for some of you here today, I am the face of one of your fears. Because I am a woman, because I am Black, because I am lesbian, because I am myself — a Black woman warrior poet doing my work — come to ask you, are you doing yours? And</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">of course I am afraid, because the transformation of silence into language and action is an act of self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">But my daughter, when I told her of our topic and my difficulty with it, said, “Tell them about how you’re never really a whole person if you remain silent, because there’s always that one little piece inside you that wants to be spoken out, and if you keep ignoring it, it gets madder and madder and hotter and hotter, and if you don’t speak it out one day it will just up and punch you in the mouth from the inside</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">.”</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">In the cause of silence, each of us draws the face of her own fear — fear of contempt, of censure, of some judgment, or recognition, of challenge, of annihilation</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">But most of all, I think, we fear the visibility without which we cannot truly live. And</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">[Yet] that visibility which makes us most vulnerable is that which also is the source of our greatest strength</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">Because the machine will try to grind you into dust anyway, whether or not we speak. We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and our selves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid. Each of us is here now because in one way or another</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">we share a commitment to</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> language and to </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the power of language</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">and to the reclaiming of that language which has been made to work against us. In the transformation of silence into language and action,</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">it is vitally necessary for each one of us to establish or examine her function in that transformation and to recognize her role as vital within that transformation. </span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">For those of us who write, it is necessary to scrutinize not only the truth of what we speak, but the truth of that language by which we speak it. For others, it is to share and spread also those words that are meaningful to us. But primarily for us all, it is necessary to teach by living and speaking those truths which we believe and know beyond understanding. Because in this way alone can we survive,</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">by taking part in a process of life that is creative and continuing, that is growth. </span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">And it is never without fear — of visibility, of the harsh light of scrutiny and perhaps judgment, of pain, of death. But we have lived through all of those already, in silence, except death. And I remind myself all the time now that if I were to have been born mute, or had maintained an oath of silence my whole life long for safety, I would still have suffered, and I would still die. It is very good for establishing perspective. We can learn to work and speak when we are afraid in the same way we have learned to work and speak when we are tired. For we have been socialized to respect fear more than our own needs for language and definition, and while we wait in silence for that final luxury of fearlessness, the weight of that silence will choke us.</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The fact [T]hat we are here and that I speak these words is an attempt to break that silence and bridge some </span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">of those</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">differences between us, for it is not difference which immobilizes us, but silence. And there are so many silences to be broken.</span></u></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">It’s empirically proven that debate tactics adapt to what wins. At last year’s TOC, at least half of the contestants from quarters on were well-known for running util and policy arguments. This year, there’s been a much bigger influence on that style. A vote for me might not directly cause more debaters to run micropolitical arguments, but it will enable debaters in the future who want to and need to.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">All that I've just said should suggest what I meant when, long ago, in response to someone in the debate world who seemed puzzled by the strong reservations I expressed on being informed that the debate community in the U.S. was appropriating my work on Heidegger, higher education, and American imperialism.

It is no accident, in my mind, that this fraudulent form of debate goes back to the founding of the U.S. as a capitalist republic and that it has produced what I call the &quot;political class&quot; to indicate not only the basic sameness between the Democratic and Republican parties but also its fundamental indifference to the plight of those who don't count in a system where what counts is determined by those who are the heirs of this quantitative system of binaries.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">While</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the underlying factors of verbal abuse, physical violence, and internalized shame often contribute to silencing members of subordinated communities</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, </span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">there are also the variations of silence surrounding other taboo topics. Some of these topics, like sexual harassment, often entail a complex intermingling of these factors, while other taboo topics, such as cancer, ordinarily do not. Some of these varieties of silence are overt as when expression that are superficially about sexual interest are, in fact, vehicles for communicating power, domination, and control that silences victims, sometimes through the explicit threat of a face smashed beyond recognition, or bruised breasts.</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Such silences have been explored in anonymous narratives about the experience of sexual harassment in the communication discipline.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Julia T. Wood affirms in her introduction to the narratives, <strong>“</strong></span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">these stories do more than break the long and oppressive silence surrounding sexual harassment; [and] they also argue for change</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">.” </span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">There are subtle variations of silence surrounding various forms of sexualized aggression that may enable it to continue<strong>.</strong> </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Sometimes the silence of an entire community enables inappropriate behavior, because the silence is a necessary condition for the behavior,</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">regardless of whether the silence is rooted in self protection, a sense of professional duty, the impositions of gags, or less tolerable factors such as personal convenience, political opportunism, cowardice, fear of legal fees, or a misguided belief that an institution’s public relations and fund raising are harmed by acknowledging a problem in the spirit of going to the root of it.</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">[s]uch silence and silencing by those around a perpetrator enables the harassment to continue</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">in the work place.</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">It is </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">sometimes appropriate to recognize and name the willed silence of an entire community as an enabling behavior in the sense that the silence provides a necessary condition for the behavior.</span></u></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Allow me to clearly enumerate behaviors that this evidence indicts: fairness or education claims about how topical debate is better, arguments that say sexual harassment, bullying, and the like are inevitable or a natural product of adversarial debate, any argument that says I am causing some sort of disturbance in the round and should lose because of it, and most importantly any argument that says that this silencing isn't my opponent's fault.

Over ten years ago the first National Developmental Conference on Forensics suggested that “research should be conducted to determine why certain persons are drawn to forensics activities and others, particularly women and minority group members, resist involvement.” Ten years later, the second developmental conference recommended: “The American Forensic Association should establish a committee given the specific charge to increase and strengthen forensic participation by identifying ethnic, racial, gender, and handicap barriers which may currently inhibit student participation and should disseminate findings concerning such barriers throughout the forensic community.”</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">To </span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">limit fair treatment to those on the squad, while </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">systematically exclud[e] classes of individuals</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">from the squad </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">fails to </span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">fully address the problem of fairness.</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Individuals on the squad should receive equal consideration.</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">To favor one class </span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">of individuals to receive special treatment (based on [irrelevant] factors other than effort and other characteristics related to the activity) fails to promote the educational benefits of the activity. Sexual harassment as a blatant form of discrimination and even more subtle versions of discrimination are unethical in that they limit the availability of the activity to a group of individuals.</span></u><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Third is alt solvency:</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> I’ve come a long way from Columbia. It’s not as if my efforts have gone to waste.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #262626; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">1. I’m calling out people for the wrongs they’ve committed in debate, which creates a deterrent effect. More silence means more harassment, and my alt is the antithesis of silence.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #262626; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">2. Since I started running this position at Columbia, I’ve jump-started a culture against sexual violence in debate, including a pledge, several threads on debate websites, Facebook groups, etc.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #262626; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">3. I’m still raising awareness to members of the debate community that don’t know that these problems even exist.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #262626; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">4. I’ve created real-world change since I know for a FACT that debate camps and teams are revising their policies in regards to issues of sexism and sexual harassment.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #262626; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">5. Speaking out gives power to the oppressed. I’m breaking the silence which oppresses the voiceless and the invisible. and I’m opening the door for more discourse. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Remember, voting for or against the resolution doesn’t DO anything. Voting for the resolution thinking that something will change is the equivalent of kissing a frog with the expectation that it will turn into a handsome prince. This isn’t a fairy tale. This is real life.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">I’m speaking the truth and affecting real people. There is only one room in debate. The performance has stepped off the stage and entered reality. You, as the judge, have the opportunity to vote for either real-life rehabilitation or fairy tale rehabilitation, to make me visible or make me remain invisible. With that, I invite you to pull the trigger with me.</span><br />

 <br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13px;">Trigger warning - I'm about to pull the trigger.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13px;">Starting at Columbia, I have been reading a micropolitical position regarding sexism and sexual harassment in the debate community. Aside from constant heckling and derision from judges, coaches, and my fellow debaters, there have also been several attempts to silence me. Tournament staff have detained me and told me to channel my angst elsewhere. One coach took the rather extreme measures of contacting tournament staff, my coach, and even my school administration in an effort to have me punished or excluded. I’ve had several judges refuse to flow my case and give me L24’s because they thought my non-topical discourse was inappropriate. And in every single debate round I’ve had on my micropolitical position, my opponents have never failed to tell me that my arguments don’t belong in the round.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Since I started to use my speech times to advocate a real-life policy change, I have become a better debater. I have finally begun to understand the blood, sweat, and tears that true advocacy skills require. This is infinitely better than reading evidence about hypothetical extinction scenarios and advocating for policy changes that aren’t even remotely relevant to real life and expire after the round ends. Ultimately, I’ve become a better advocate for myself and my community and a force for actual change by advocating for the addressing of real-life issues in debate rounds. The only way to make anyone a better debater is to make debate confront its own real issues before it tries to confront hypothetical ones.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">First, THE ROLE OF THE BALLOT – HOW TO PULL THE TRIGGER</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">I argue that the role of the ballot is to vote for the better debater. However, I defend the following interpretation of what it means to do the better debating, which is an absolute constraint on all sufficient access to the ballot.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">1. The ballot is an educational tool - rounds are THE defining educational event, and ballots are artifacts from rounds/are a product of rounds. Education is the ultimate aim of debate. A founder of modern forensics,</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Walter Alan Ulrich 86:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Walter Alan Ulrich. The Ethical Obligations of the Forensic Educator. Contemporary Argumentation &amp; Debate Vol 7. 1986. p. 81</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Widespread transfer for purely competitive reasons also fosters an unhealthy view of competition. While some amount of competition is inevitable in academic forensics</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">,</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> the over-emphasis on competition undermines the educational benefits of the activity if it is not kept in perspective. Competition is a means toward an end – increased skills as a public speaker and/or a public advocate.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">And, the ballot necessarily educates - it transmits/carries information. Fairness matters, but is instrumental to larger social and educational goals. Public advocacy and actual change are the most important. The impact to better debating is that the better debating will be done by the person who is a better advocate. Competitive skill is outweighed by advocacy skills.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">2. Critiques of the context of debate - of debate norms, topical debate, and of debate practices comes logically prior to any argument substantive or theoretical that is premised on the topic. These are functionally incomparable arguments; my argument is about real effects of speech acts and conduct. The best sequencing evidence you’ve heard all year.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Broda-Bahm and Murphy 94:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">A Defense of Critique Arguments: Beyond the Resolutional Question. Kenneth Broda-Bahm and Thomas L. Murphy. Contemporary Argumentation and Debate. 1994.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">The effect of </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">these arguments</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">,</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">if successful, is to</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">generate discursively mediated “rules of the game.” A team against which a successful challenge is made loses the debate</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, regardless of the truth or falsity of the resolution. This a priori status stems from the impossibility of evaluating normative critiques in comparison to other arguments in the context of the debate. How,</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">for example, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">could a judge weigh a sexist-language critique against</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">the claimed risk of </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">nuclear war</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> <strong><u>solved</u></strong></span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">by</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">affirmative's</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">hypothetical policy? Necessity requires </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">that the arguments be evaluated separately, and the sequential nature of the critique requires that [it] the context be evaluated first. Only if the context is judged to be fair for debate should evaluation proceed to the resolutional question.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Not only do arguments about the role of the ballot come prior to fairness and education concerns that assume a role of the ballot, since they concern a fair context for debate, but arguments that relate to the actual speech acts as speech acts come before arguments directed at the game space of debate.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">3. The ballot is a tool of reward, punishment, and ultimately power. Ballots and bids are the currency of visibility in the contemporary debate culture. In order to “speak” I have to become visible as an individual. The name on the ballot is a voice, visibility, endorsement by authority and backing by normative force. This next argument is a pre-empt to arbitrary punishment arguments: the ballot is a zero sum game, losses are inevitable. If I’m winning that topical debate masks the real issues in the debate community, then it’s not arbitrary to vote against the person in favor of topical debate and masking. More importantly, the ballot with my name on it is uniquely important - the experience of marginalized voices cannot be replicated by others.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 15pt;">“… </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">those who have experienced discrimination speak with a special voice to which we should listen</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> …<strong><u>The imagination of the academic philosopher cannot recreate the experience of life on the bottom.</u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Instead we must look to ...‘organic intellectuals,’ grass roots philosophers who are uniquely able to relate theory to the concrete experience of oppression.</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The technique of imagining oneself black and poor in some hypothetical world is less effective than studying the actual experience of black poverty and listening to those who have done so. When notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice are examined not from an abstract position but from the position of groups who have suffered through history</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">… <strong><u>identifiable normative priorities emerge[,]</u></strong>. … <strong><u>Looking to the bottom for ideas about law will tap a valuable source previously overlooked by</u></strong></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 15pt;"> … </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">philosophers</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">.”</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The better advocate is the person who wins a stronger reason to have their name on the ballot, or their opponent’s name not on the ballot. Invisibility is the opposite of visibility. This has nothing to do with resolutions or limits on debate, and everything to do with your agency and ability to select your own arguments. Sometimes this includes the resolution or limits on debate. You have complete control over what you say. I cannot stop or influence your speech, you cannot stop or influence mine. Learning how to “debate” isn’t the real education. Learning how to DEFEND something you believe in is the most concrete benefit.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13pt;">It is empirically proven that debate tactics adapt to what wins. At last year’s TOC, at least half of the contestants from quarters on were well-known for running util and policy arguments. This year, there’s been a much bigger influence on that style. [Count how many “must specify or defend implementation” shells you’ve seen on Jan/Feb as a judge]. A vote for me won’t directly cause many more debaters to run micropolitical arguments, but it will enable debaters in the future who want to and need to.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">4. The interpretation is that debaters must specify what it means to do the better debating as a part of any framework or voter that is sufficient to access the ballot in the speech that it is read in. Lack of defined role of the ballot makes judge intervention inevitable and reciprocity impossible. If a debater doesn't define what it means to do the better debating they have not created a chain of arguments that can terminate in ballot access, preventing you from voting for them. This is zero risk of any offense.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">1- A win for me is a win against instantiations of oppression and dehumanization in the community - especially bullying and harassment. A no on the ballot can break the cycle of violence,</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Not only does silence mean a lack of support for me and others, but it also encourages sexual harassment and abuse to continue in the future.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">While</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the underlying factors of verbal abuse, physical violence, and internalized shame often contribute to silencing members of subordinated communities</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, </span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">there are also the variations of silence surrounding other taboo topics. Some of these topics, like sexual harassment, often entail a complex intermingling of these factors, while other taboo topics, such as cancer, ordinarily do not. Some of these varieties of silence are overt as when expression that are superficially about sexual interest are, in fact, vehicles for communicating power, domination, and control that silences victims, sometimes through the explicit threat of a face smashed beyond recognition, or bruised breasts.</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Such silences have been explored in anonymous narratives about the experience of sexual harassment in the communication discipline.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Julia T. Wood affirms in her introduction to the narratives, <strong>“</strong></span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">these stories do more than break the long and oppressive silence surrounding sexual harassment; [and] they also argue for change</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">.” </span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">There are subtle variations of silence surrounding various forms of sexualized aggression that may enable it to continue<strong>.</strong> </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Sometimes the silence of an entire community enables inappropriate behavior, because the silence is a necessary condition for the behavior,</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">regardless of whether the silence is rooted in self protection, a sense of professional duty, the impositions of gags, or less tolerable factors such as personal convenience, political opportunism, cowardice, fear of legal fees, or a misguided belief that an institution’s public relations and fund raising are harmed by acknowledging a problem in the spirit of going to the root of it.</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">[s]uch silence and silencing by those around a perpetrator enables the harassment to continue</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">in the work place.</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">It is </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">sometimes appropriate to recognize and name the willed silence of an entire community as an enabling behavior in the sense that the silence provides a necessary condition for the behavior.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />

<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">2- An equal respect environment is a gateway issue, necessary for any debate to occur.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">In addition to obligations to the profession, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the forensics</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">coach has an obligation to the participants in the activity. These obligations fall into two main areas. First, the </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">educator has an obligation to provide equal respect the all participants</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> in the activity.</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Given the educational nature of the activity, all participants should be given an opportunity to participate to receive help, assuming there are sufficient resources available.This obligation may go beyond a simple obligation to those individuals who are on the squad; there also may be an affirmative obligation to recruit individuals outside the forensic community. Over ten years ago the first National Developmental Conference on Forensics suggested that“research should be conducted to determine why certain persons are drawn to forensics activities and others, particularly women and minority group members, resist involvement.”Ten years later, the second developmental conference recommended:“The American Forensic Association should establish a committee given the specific charge to increase and strengthen forensic participation by identifying ethnic, racial, gender, and handicap barriers which may currently inhibit student participation and should disseminate findings concerning such barriers throughout the forensic community.”</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">To</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">limit fair treatment to those on the squad, while <strong><u>systematically exclud[e] classes of individuals</u></strong></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">from the squad </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">fails to</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">fully <strong>address the problem of fairness</strong>.</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Individuals on the squad should receive equal consideration.</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">To favor one class </span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">of individuals <strong>to receive special treatment (based on [irrelevant] factors</strong> other than effort and other characteristics related to the activity) <strong>fails to promote the educational benefits of the activity. Sexual harassment as a blatant form of discrimination and even more subtle versions</strong> of discrimination <strong>are unethical in that they limit the availability of the activity to a group of individuals.</strong></span></u><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">This is a prerequisite to your fairness claims. Out-of-round unfairness outweighs in-round unfairness since</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">A. It prevents access to the debate round itself when individuals quit or are discriminated against at camps. Discrimination negatively impacts debate education, access to coaches, tournament experiences, and objective adjudication. Literally every aspect of my debate experience is defined by the silence that envelops the community.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">B. Magnitude - the lasting impacts of sexual harassment and abuse in the community are far-reaching for an individual’s life, whereas an a priori or plan only affects one individual debate round.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">This is also a prerequisite to all education arguments since Ulrich explains that harassment and discrimination are antithetical to equal education. It also impact turns education claims since in the status quo, they serve to privilege one particular group over another, which reinforces the dominant ideology, the silence that pervades the community.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Finally, any and all theory arguments appeal to who does the better debating, but if I’ve proven a link from your form of debating, then you’re not doing the better debating and deserve to lose.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">AS AN UNDERVIEW,</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">A. TOPIC DEBATE IS BAD , debating strategically interesting and unique positions is preferable to rehashing two months of recycled evidence. Judges – you check out!</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">i personally don't think that classifying a lot of the theory debates that happen these days as &quot;frivolous&quot; is appropriate. deeming certain theory debates &quot;frivolous&quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">[you] presume</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">s </span></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">that &quot;substantive&quot; discussion of the topic is inherently better,</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">but there's absolutely no reason why that's true. theory debates simply focus on a different aspect of debate (maybe a &quot;strategic&quot; aspect?) than &quot;substantive&quot; debates do, but i've never seen anyone offer a coherent argument for why focusing on this strategic aspect is bad</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 11pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">some people claim education, but honestly, especially after several tournaments on any given topic, good debaters aren't learning anything in their rounds that they didn't already know from exhaustive preparatory research.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">on the other hand, [Yet] theory debates necessitate intense, constant critical thought because there are nearly an infinite number of variables in theory debates that change the way debaters must address them. no amount of pre-round preparation can ensure that a debater doesn't have to think critically about his opponents' interpretation and theory standards, whereas that is often [which is] not true with &quot;substantive, case debate&quot; (see</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">debaters</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">who</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">just read the same blocks every round and extend </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">whatever their opponent drops to win</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">)</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. i might be the only person in this boat, but toward the end of my debate career, it was</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">t<strong>he</strong></span></u><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">strategic moves</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">associated with things like theory debates that kept me interested</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">in the activity [kept me interested]</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, </span></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">not re-hashing whether or not we should impose </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">economic sanctions on Iran.</span></u></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">For post-structuralists, women accordingly encounter difficulties because organizations are gendered in ways that circumscribe or marginalise feminine discourse in favour of the masculine. Women’s voices and issues are silenced because in order to maintain its power as a discursive regime, masculinity must suppress, in the struggle for hegemonic status, other competing meanings and interpretations. Acker (1990), for example, suggests that there is a silence around sexuality, procreation and emotions because these intrude upon and disrupt the ideal functioning of the organization. Equally, as Martin (1990) points out, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">there is often </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">a silence around conflict in organizations as dominant ideologies deny the existence of points of view that could be disruptive of existing power relations. This can be seen in the way prevailing normative rules marginalise and suppress sexual harassment as an issue worthy of consideration and debate</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">(Wilson &amp; Thompson, 2001; Collinson &amp; Collinson, 1996)<strong><u>.</u></strong></span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Women’s interests therefore </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">often appear as contradictions, disjunctions, disruptions or as silences.

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 11pt;">Allow me to clearly enumerate behaviors that this evidence indicts: fairness or education claims about how topical debate is better, arguments that say sexual harassment, bullying, and the like are inevitable or a natural product of adversarial debate, any argument that says I am causing some sort of disturbance in the round and should lose because of it, and most importantly any argument that says that this silencing isn't my opponent's fault. ANY participation in the dominant discourse and reinforcement of its normative rules is a form of silencing.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 11pt;">And with that, I invite you to pull the trigger with me.</span><br />

 <br />
<br />
I have been a victim of sexual harassment during my time in debate. I’m not going to tell you my story; I’m not going to make you sit through my pain. However, I will use the debate space to try to create some positive change. Our LD community isn’t perfect – no one is – but it’s not even close, and it needs help. Inspired by the resolution, I seek to rehabilitate the debate community.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 1 – The symptoms.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Three weeks ago at Columbia, I read a performative debate case similar to this one that told a story of my abuse and advocated change the in debate community. I said that the judge should vote for me to take a stand against bullying and sexual harassment, especially in high school debate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just for speaking up on behalf of myself and others in the community, I was harassed, joked about, ignored, excluded, embarrassed, and humiliated all over the course of three days by people I knew, thought I knew, and total strangers. Tabroom, coaches, judges and even my school administration attempted to silence me. I was attacked in person, behind my back, and online.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the online posts are particularly insightful. On the results page for Columbia on a popular debate news site, which was supposed be supportive of my success, I really came to see a lot of the debate community’s sentiments. Anonymous posts represent the actual thoughts of many debaters, coaches, and judges nationwide.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Symptom #1 – Change denialism</strong>. Some people won’t support me because they don’t see the community ever changing. One user called Wolfgang wrote online that no one can EVER succeed in changing debate from within,<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Wolfgang Mittermeyer <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nsdupdate.com/2013/nsd-live-update-columbia/" rel="nofollow">nsdupdate.com/2013/nsd-live-update-columbia/</a>)</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u>“None of you who defend her position seem to have learned from history. Amanda Liverzani failed, Avi Arfin failed, Jalon Alexander failed, and now Jessica too will fail.”</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
And there’s more,<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Wolfgang Mittermeyer <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nsdupdate.com/2013/nsd-live-update-columbia/" rel="nofollow">nsdupdate.com/2013/nsd-live-update-columbia/</a>)</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u>“We as a community need to stop having these sorts of discussions in response to these sorts of positions”…“what you are doing is not helping debate”…”you are a fool”</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
If I haven’t been as successful as I could have been, or others before me weren’t successful enough, maybe it’s a problem with the community, not our positions. Anonymous continues,<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">(LD Outsider - <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nsdupdate.com/2013/nsd-live-update-columbia/" rel="nofollow">http://nsdupdate.com/2013/nsd-live-update-columbia/</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“Yup, </span><strong><u>the micropol movements lately haven't been 'successful' at changing the whole community, but if what you say is true, this is more the result of existing bigotry-and the community's entitled attitude that</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><strong><u>victims</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of such bigotry </span><strong><u>should only respond in a way that can be kept quiet or not be too angry.”</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Symptom #2 - Resolution addiction</strong>. LD purists refuse to acknowledge that some issues might be more important. This includes debaters and judges who don’t give my case a fair shot because the NFL’s topic is more important to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Symptom #3 – Bullying and antagonism.</strong><br />
<br />
During one of my outrounds at Columbia, one debater humiliated me in front of a roomful of spectators by quoting things I said on Facebook ages ago as a means to indict my sincerity to the cause. During one of my outrounds at Newark, my opponent, who was not at Columbia, spewed lies about me and the events of Columbia to the entire room. He acted openly hostile to me; he made me cry right after his first speech; he didn’t apologize to me at all or even shake my hand after the round ended.<br />
<br />
Some have said in round and online that I suck at debate and only win on sympathy votes. Here’s another post,<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Anondebater523 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nsdupdate.com/2013/nsd-live-update-columbia/" rel="nofollow">http://nsdupdate.com/2013/nsd-live-update-columbia/</a></span><br />
<br />
<strong><u>“the judge will intervene because they feel bad for the person”</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Or those who say I don’t really care about the issues, that <strong><u>“[there’s] some ulterior motive.”</u></strong><br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Symptom #4 – Underlying sexism.</strong><br />
<br />
Fewer girls debate; fewer girls succeed. Many cases of harassment go unnoticed. One former debater, Maisie Baldwin, recounts her experience with sexist attitudes,<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Maisie Baldwin <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1759:http://nsdupdate.com/2013/protecting-persons-not-positions/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nsdupdate.com/2013/protecting-persons-not-positions/" rel="nofollow">http://nsdupdate.com/2013/protecting-persons-not-positions/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1759 --></span><br />
<br />
<strong><u>“I was [told I was] &quot;too abrasive for a girl,&quot; needed to &quot;back down because if the dominant person in the room is a woman, people will be made uncomfortable&quot;</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and it isn't &quot;polite to correct an opponent who&quot; multiple times in his NC referred to me as a man.”</span><br />
<br />
There are many more like these.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 2 – The doctor’s prescription.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Rehabilitating the debate community will require a group effort. I recommend these and other ways that we can begin to solve the problems above. Many come directly from contributions in person or online. I thank everyone who helps and welcome more responses during and after the round as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
A- <strong><u>Coaches and debaters can “boycott camps/tournaments that are found to be sexist and hold them accountable</u></strong><br />

<br />
<br />
G- <strong><u>People should speak out against sexual harassment when it happens and raise awareness about its prevalence in our community</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[In conclusion, I agree with the anonymous article writer of “Debaters Against Sexism,” with whom I stand in solidarity:</em><br />

<em><u>“We are tired of online discussions about gender disparities in debate dying out without resulting in any concrete changes.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 3 is efficacy of treatment.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>A daily dose of effort by each member of the community can make a real difference.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Wise 02:</strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Liz Stanley and Sue Wise. Breaking Out Again: Feminist Ontology and Epistemology. New Edition. 2002.‘FEMINIST METHOD’ AND FEMINIST EPISTEMOLOGY</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Ethnomethodology rejects </span><u>claims to privileged status as an interpretation of reality [should be rejected].</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">It also </span><strong><u>[we must] insis</u></strong><u>t</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">s</span> <u><strong>on the epistemological validity of all interpretations</strong> of reality or realities.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">And it is aware that the </span><u>[<strong>L]abelling of people as</strong> ‘mentally ill’</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, ‘paranoid’, </span><u>‘<strong>deviant’ and so on, is the result of a <em>political</em> process</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">which takes place within the events and experiences of everyday life. In other words,</span> <u><strong>[B]y locating ‘the political’ and the construction of reality <em>within</em> the everyday,</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">ethnomethodology implies that</span> <u><strong>we are all involved in our own oppressions and, conversely, can be equally involved in our own liberations. Individually we can effect many small changes. Together we can revolutionize all interactions</strong>, all constructions of ‘reality, for all practical purposes’.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
And, there is evidence that the community will be receptive to the prescriptions suggested.<br />
<br />
A- There have been multiple articles online discussing issues of sexism and harassment in debate. For example, a pledge against sexism is going around. Anyone choosing to help me raise awareness about the issue is a great start. And even people who left debate have returned to help the cause. A post on the Columbia Results page reads,<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">“Lin” - <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nsdupdate.com/2013/nsd-live-update-columbia/" rel="nofollow">http://nsdupdate.com/2013/nsd-live-update-columbia/</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To close, I also am confused when you argue that these debaters failed. First off, none of them ever claimed to promise 100% solvency. But if you think that the discourse that resulted due to the performances has done nothing for the activity at all, then you are horribly mistaken. Minimally, the performances have done two things. One, they brought to light the problems themselves for scrutiny and consideration. Two, </span><strong><u>even if the solutions</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and considerations proposedby individual contributors to the dialogue </span><strong><u>are not adopted by the [whole] community</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">as a whole</span><strong><u>, participants</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">within that dialogue</span> <strong><u>have their thoughts shaped by the dialogue itself</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Sure, some people will not change their minds, but I guarantee you some folks have changed the way they see things. Others become willing to step forward with their own stories, and additionally, the community as a whole is forced to confront a problem that is truly present n debate. If the explosion of commentary online is not a reflexive indication, then I don't know what is. Hell, it's even got a lot of debate old timers coming back to give their two-cents. That speaks volumes. </span><strong><u>People</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">who</span> <strong><u>no longer connected with the activity have even come back...including me.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">I hope that this discussion continues, though.</span> <strong><u>I'm</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">greatly</span> <strong><u>heartened by the fact that more articles and</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">more</span> <strong><u>discourse is happening. The discussion is</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">truly</span> <strong><u>inching along!</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Don't be so skeptical when you have yet to see the end results of the dialogue.</span><br />
<br />

Current debater Tillman Huett stated,<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">About that Micropol discussion that is happening elsewhere—get over it. Jessica read what she read. It happened. It won ballots and it spawned discussion. NO MATTER IF YOU THINK </span><strong><u>WHAT SHE DID</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">WAS RIGHT OR NOT—it </span><strong><u>worked. Here we are as a community talking about these issues. That is all that matters.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I support Jessica’s actions regardless of how I feel about the actual case since this gave us the opportunity to finally work out some community issues.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
B- There have been calls for me and others to continue to run these arguments. One coach, Rebar Niemi wrote,<br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“And yes, you're correct that </span><strong><u>in some ways these positions did &quot;fail.&quot; But they failed</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">primarily</span> <strong><u>because of the [community’s] attitude</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that you claim is a descriptive and law-like reality: that debaters want to win more than they want to substantively engage these issues or accept that they might be in the wrong. I think this is absolutely true, but it's not law-like. It's a product of our community history/structure. </span><strong><u>This</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">argument</span> <strong><u>is in my opinion one of the best reasons</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">that</span> <strong><u>people should run more of these positions</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”</span><br />
<br />
<br />
C- Some are already changing their mentality about these issues, realizing how their actions may have affected others. Current debater Salim Damerdji explains,<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 4 is the role of the ballot</strong><br />
<br />

My alternative is that the judge is a psychiatrist who critically evaluates the state of the debate community and prescribes a treatment in response. Voting for me is an act of resistance against the status quo, stating non-compliance. Send a strong message to debaters, coaches, judges, and camp directors. There are five justifications for deviating from the resolution to vote for me.<br />
<br />
1- Give me a voice. If my message is important, even if we don’t have a perfect idea of what the solution is, speaking out is the first step to finding a solution.<br />

<br />
<strong><u>I have come to believe</u></strong> <strong><u>over and over again that what is most important to me must be spoken, made verbal and shared, even at the risk of having it bruised or misunderstood.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">That the speaking profits me, beyond any other effect. I was forced to look upon myself and my living with a harsh and urgent clarity that has left me still shaken but much stronger. Some of what I experienced during that time has helped elucidate for me much of what I feel concerning the transformation of silence into language and action. In becoming forcibly and essentially aware of my mortality, and of what I wished and wanted for my life, however short it might be, priorities and omissions became strongly etched in a merciless light, and what I most regretted were my silences. Of what had I ever been afraid? To question or to speak as I believed could have meant pain, or death. But we all hurt in so many different ways, all the time, and pain will either change or end. Death, on the other hand, is the final silence. And that might be coming quickly now, without regard for whether I had ever spoken what needed to be said, or had only betrayed myself into small silences, while I planned someday to speak, or waited for someone else’s words. I was going to die, if not sooner then later, whether or not I had ever spoken myself. My silences had not protected me. Your silence will not protect you. What are the words you do not yet have? What do you need to say? What are the tyrannies you swallow day by day and attempt to make your own, until you will sicken and die of them, still in silence? Perhaps for some of you here today, I am the face of one of your fears. Because I am a woman, because I am Black, because I am lesbian, because I am myself — a Black woman warrior poet doing my work — come to ask you, are you doing yours? And </span><strong><u>of course I am afraid, because the transformation of silence into language and action is an act of self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But my daughter, when I told her of our topic and my difficulty with it, said, “Tell them about how you’re never really a whole person if you remain silent, because there’s always that one little piece inside you that wants to be spoken out, and if you keep ignoring it, it gets madder and madder and hotter and hotter, and if you don’t speak it out one day it will just up and punch you in the mouth from the inside.”</span><strong><u>In the cause of silence, each of us draws the face of her own fear — fear of contempt, of censure, of some judgment, or recognition, of challenge, of annihilation</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But most of all, I think, we fear the visibility without which we cannot truly live. And </span><strong><u>[Yet] that visibility which makes us most vulnerable is that which also is the source of our greatest strength</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Because the machine will try to grind you into dust anyway, whether or not we speak. We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and our selves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid. Each of us is here now because in one way or another</span><strong><u>we share a commitment to</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> language and to </span><strong><u>the power of language</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and to the reclaiming of that language which has been made to work against us. In the transformation of silence into language and action, </span><strong><u>it is vitally necessary for each one of us to establish or examine her function in that transformation and to recognize her role as vital within that transformation.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">For those of us who write, it is necessary to scrutinize not only the truth of what we speak, but the truth of that language by which we speak it. For others, it is to share and spread also those words that are meaningful to us. But primarily for us all, it is necessary to teach by living and speaking those truths which we believe and know beyond understanding. Because in this way alone can we survive, </span><strong><u>by taking part in a process of life that is creative and continuing, that is growth.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">And it is never without fear — of visibility, of the harsh light of scrutiny and perhaps judgment, of pain, of death. But we have lived through all of those already, in silence, except death. And I remind myself all the time now that if I were to have been born mute, or had maintained an oath of silence my whole life long for safety, I would still have suffered, and I would still die. It is very good for establishing perspective. We can learn to work and speak when we are afraid in the same way we have learned to work and speak when we are tired. For we have been socialized to respect fear more than our own needs for language and definition, and while we wait in silence for that final luxury of fearlessness, the weight of that silence will choke us.</span><strong><u>The fact [T]hat we are here and that I speak these words is an attempt to break that silence and bridge some</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of those</span> <strong><u>differences between us, for it is not difference which immobilizes us, but silence. And there are so many silences to be broken.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
The judge doesn’t have the power to change the criminal justice system, but they can change debate. To impose rules like a resolution to say what counts and what doesn’t is the worst censorship.Especially regarding sexual abuse, silence on the matter is part of what enables it in the first place. I can’t remain silent, and neither should you.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While </span><strong><u>the underlying factors of verbal abuse, physical violence, and internalized shame often contribute to silencing members of subordinated communities</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, there are also the variations of silence surrounding other taboo topics. Some of these topics, like sexual harassment, often entail a complex intermingling of these factors, while other taboo topics, such as cancer, ordinarily do not. Some of these varieties of silence are overt as when expression that are superficially about sexual interest are, in fact, vehicles for communicating power, domination, and control that silences victims, sometimes through the explicit threat of a face smashed beyond recognition, or bruised breasts. </span><strong><u>Such silences have been explored in anonymous narratives about the experience of sexual harassment in the communication discipline.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Julia T. Wood affirms in her introduction to the narratives, “</span><strong><u>these stories do more than break the long and oppressive silence surrounding sexual harassment; [and] they also argue for change</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” There are subtle variations of silence surrounding various forms of sexualized aggression that may enable it to continue. </span><strong><u>Sometimes the silence of an entire community enables inappropriate behavior, because the silence is a necessary condition for the behavior</u></strong><strong><u>,</u></strong><strong><u>regardless of whether the silence is rooted in self protection, a sense of professional duty, the impositions of gags, or less tolerable factors such as personal convenience, political opportunism, cowardice, fear of legal fees, or a misguided belief that an institution’s public relations and fund raising are harmed by acknowledging a problem in the spirit of going to the root of it.</u></strong><strong><u>[s]uch silence</u></strong> <strong><u>and silencing by those around a perpetrator enables the harassment to continue</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the work place. </span><strong><u>It is sometimes appropriate to recognize and name the willed silence of an entire community as an enabling behavior in the sense that the silence provides a necessary condition for the behavior.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>“It’s not my problem!</u></strong> <strong><u>This is not my fight! Socialized not to interfere in other people’s affairs, to do their own work, and to look out for number one, bystanders can excuse themselves [since] by claiming to be minding their own business.</u></strong><strong><u>This is also known as indifference</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In her prologue to <em>Rescuers: Portraits of Moral Courage in the Holocaust</em>, Cynthia Ozick writes of the inherent danger of such an excuse: “Indifference finally grows lethal…the act of turning away, however empty-handed and harmlessly, remains nevertheless an act.” 3. She is not my friend. Kids are more willing to intervene when the targeted kid is a friend. Bullies often select kids who have few friends. 4.

The ballot breaks the bystander effect. A vote means I can continue to debate into outrounds. If you think my case should be reproduced at this tournament, then vote for me so I can continue to spread my message.<br />

<br />
2- Give others a voice. Opening up possibilities for critique can help to solve other problems in debate, such as those of lone wolfs or ethnic minorities. <strong>Butler 06<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Bob/Desktop/Dropbox/Jessica%20Xu/Harvard/HARVARD%20AFF.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">**[1]**</a></strong>,<br />

<strong><u>If the humanities has a future as cultural criticism</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and cultural criticism has a task at the present moment, </span><strong><u>it is no doubt to return us to the human where we do not expect to find it, in its frailty and at the limits of its capacity to make sense. We would have to interrogate the emergence and vanishing of the human at the limits of what we can know</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, what we can hear, what we can see, what we can sense. </span><strong><u>This might prompt us</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, affectively,</span> <strong><u>to [We must] reinvigorate the</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">intellectual projects of</span> <strong><u>critique,</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of</span> <strong><u>questioning, [and]</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of</span> <strong><u>[come] to understand the difficulties and demands of cultural translation and dissent,</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and</span><strong><u>to</u></strong> <strong><u>create</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">a sense of the</span><strong><u>[a] public [where] oppositional voices are not</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">feared,</span> <strong><u>degraded or dismissed,</u></strong> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 13pt;">but valued</span>for the instigation</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to a sensate democracy they occasionally perform.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
3- The resolution is meaningless. Although I engage in its rhetoric for some grounding, <strong>the judge’s ballot has no power over the criminal justice system</strong>. But, the ballot <u>can</u> lead to meaningful change in the debate community. It did when I told my story at Columbia and Newark, and it can only get better from here. They might say the resolution is more fair, but some things are more important than made-up debate rules, and sometimes a sacrifice must be made for the greater cause.<br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white;">4- Yes, my case touches on some uncomfortable topics, but these are <strong>the most important</strong> to discussed because they’re ignored in other contexts. Debate must be able to change itself from the inside, and the way to do that is to step back from the game and see what’s wrong with the community.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white;">5- The debate round is essential for my message. <strong>I must debate in as many rounds as possible</strong> because otherwise it’s too easy to ignore me. Debaters can easily ignore blog posts about sexism or optional camp assemblies on gender issues, but they can’t ignore my case in the round, and they can’t ignore an L on the ballot.</span><br />

 <br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">FIRST</span></u></span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;"> I BEGIN WITH A PROLOGUE:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">OCCUPIERS TOOK TO WALLSTREET, TO CHICAGO, TO L.A., TO D.C. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">IN THE SPIRIT OF REVIVING THIS MOVEMENT, I AM OCCUPYING THIS DEBATE ROUND; I wish to fill the space that this forum allots to the resolution with an insurgent discourse. Make no mistake: this project is my own. It is of my own accord that I occupy the round, though I will always welcome others to join me.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"> Debbie Hu, an Occupier of D.C. directly questions those bodies who don’t occupy, what she calls “the other room.” She writes,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">HypocriteReader.com</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white;">“<strong><u>If we’re going to think about the occupation we’re also going to have to think about what happens in the other room of the occupation.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I’ve been thinking about “the other room” a lot lately… It’s worth noting that </span><strong><u>to write about the other room is to sensationalize it. It’s to take what is intended as a moment of escape from being a performing person and put that on display, for onlookers to consume as so much irrelevance or else a revealed “secret.”</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">When the secret is sex, it’s a kind of burlesque: I, gendered, perform this for you, knowing that it will be consumed as provocation or maybe pornography. And I feel awkward about it. But a girl once told me a secret about how she writes that brought the framework for this paper into being.</span> <strong><u>I take courage</u></strong> <strong><u>from that to tell some of my secrets on a larger stage, hoping that this act of telling will give us an occasion for being curious about the bodies that aren’t occupying, that it will make us more thoughtful about respecting, protecting, soliciting, or harnessing these bodies’ potentials. I hope to prompt the recognition that the act of reimagining politics can and perhaps needs to be a wild and personal act.</u></strong>”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"> HERE, IN THIS DEBATE ROUND, WE ARE IN THE OTHER ROOM. Most of the time, during relaxed discussion over cigarettes between rounds and late at parties away from the intensity of rounds, we often admit to each other that debate is just a game. However, besides periodic assertions that 'fiat is utopian' or that we may someday act on the policies we describe, the extent to which this game is purely a theatric fiction and not a political reality is overlooked. The reality is that debaters tend <em>not</em> to join lobby groups, volunteer, or join political clubs because we're just so damned busy cutting cards on these issues so we can travel on weekends and feel an inflated sense of political importance, just because we can talk really fast and about issues other people are actually acting on. The following argument should be read as a creative performance, consistent with the reality that debate is nothing more than theater. However, there are real world harms that the resolution ignores that have impacted many debaters themselves. TODAY, IN THIS ROOM, THE OTHER REALITY, THE CONSISTENCY IS BROKEN. THERE IS, AFTERALL, ONLY ONE ROOM. Now, the performance has stepped off the stage, and entered reality. To disregard this round is to be in denial about sexual harassment and bullying in the debate community, to deny the undeniable fact that engaging in politics is a radically personal act.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">SO, I BEGIN THE INSURGENCY. </span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">SECOND</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"> IS THE SOLILOQUY - WHY I AM OCCUPYING THE ROUND:</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"> Why does occupy occupy? Why have people taken to the streets, and stayed there? Tents are set, the cold is braved, and nothing appears to be gained. In many ways, this is the movement’s performative resistance to a system that refuses to reward action. AT THE START IS THE STARVATION: Sexual harassment and bullying doesn’t always begin with a blow. There is emotional abuse, there is fear, there is mistreatment. After the blow, there is frequently a lack of treatment – the bruises are not iced, the cuts not covered, the perpetrator not punished. What victims are denied is a way to live. THIS IS HOW AN OCCUPIER LIVES, BUT IT IS NOT HOW THE OCCUPIER WANTS TO LIVE. He or she or it screams and acts out of desperation. And so the occupier occupies. SO, HOW IS IT NOT OBVIOUS THAT THE OCCUPATION HAS BEEN MISTREATED? A little bit of disobedience, and the response is suppression? </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">We participate in a community that makes debaters think that it is okay to maintain sexist attitudes, to sexually harass others, and even to goes as far as to physically coerce others into sexual behavior. ... So, I must occupy. I am but one face of the anonymous movement, and our struggle is against an anonymous oppression. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">These instances of sexual harassment followed by a “sweeping under the rug” occurs much more often than any of us care to realize. Don't let me get swept under the rug like some of my opponents in past rounds have wanted to do.</span><br />
<br />
<em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">[Once we can see the whole picture, we can begin to push against present norms, to start asking serious questions. <strong>Butler 06<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Bob/Desktop/Dropbox/Jessica%20Xu/Occupy%201-27.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">**[2]**</a></strong>,</span></em><br />
<strong><em><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">If the humanities has a future as cultural criticism</span></u></em></strong><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, and cultural criticism has a task at the present moment</span></em><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, <strong><u>it is no doubt to return us to the human where we do not expect to find it, in its frailty and at the limits of its capacity to make sense.

<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">THIRD</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"> IS THE CURTAIN CALL - WHAT DOES THE AUDIENCE DO</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"> I want to bring light important issues surrounding harrassment - the ones we don’t hear about, and the debate round is the best way to do it. The community has hardly changed. Many female debaters – even successful ones – have suffered sexual harassment. Perhaps the problems that Avi Arfin raised about sexism in debate are better reformulated in my narrative. Female debaters are mistreated and discouraged from succeeding, because even if they are good debaters, they are still never treated properly as human beings. So today, I have been moved to occupy. Take what we’ve learned from my voice and others and stand together in moral outrage</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times;">Matsuda</span></strong><span style="font-family: Times;"> <strong>87</strong> explains,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8pt;">“Looking to the Bottom” 1987. [Matsuda is a prof at William S. Richardson Law School, former prof at Georgetown Law Center. Activist and lawyer specializing in feminist theory and CRT.]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times;">“… <strong><u>those who have experienced discrimination speak with a special voice to which we should listen</u></strong>…<strong><u>The imagination of the academic philosopher cannot recreate the experience of life on the bottom.</u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8pt;">Instead we must look to ...‘organic intellectuals,’ grass roots philosophers who are uniquely able to relate theory to the concrete experience of oppression.</span><span style="font-family: Times;"> <strong><u>The technique of imagining oneself black and poor in some hypothetical world is less effective than studying the actual experience of black poverty and listening to those who have done so. When notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice are examined not from an abstract position but from the position of groups who have suffered through history</u></strong>… <strong><u>identifiable normative priorities emerge[,]</u></strong>. … <strong><u>Looking to the bottom for ideas about law will tap a valuable source previously overlooked by</u></strong>… <strong><u>philosophers</u></strong>.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">My case addresses issues that are important with the debate world today and their implications into realms beyond those discussed as implications of debate rounds. <strong>If I win the round, people will talk about it, and they will be forced to confront these issues. If I lose, people will dismiss this as a failed undertaking and will be further discouraged from discussion.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white;">Voting for the performance enables it to spread and it enables me toperform it in the next round. If more and more debaters are made aware of the sexual harassment that takes place in the community, we will all be more likely to watch out for it, take appropriate preventative actions, change our attitudes, and eventually stop it from occurring.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The role of the judge </span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">as director is to choose callbacks. The ballot determines whose discourse gets reproduced in the next round. I must continue to occupy to disrupt the debate space with my message because I have no choice otherwise. Outside the round, “elite” “circuit” debaters won’t give a damn, but in the round, they’re forced to listen. This mode of interruption is essential.</span><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Censorship[‘s]</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">is a productive form of </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">power [lies in]</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">: it is not merely privative, but formative as well. I propose that </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">censorship seeks to produce subjects according to explicit and implicit norms, and that </span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">the </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">production of the subject has everything to do with the regulation of speech. The subject’s production takes place not only through the regulation of the subject’s speech, but through the regulation of the social domain of speakable discourse. The question is not what it is I will be able to say, but what will constitute the domain of the sayable within which I begin to speak at all.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">To become a subject means to be subjected to a set of implicit and explicit norms that govern the kind of speech that will be legible as the speech of a subject.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white;">Finally, I know this may make you uncomfortable but the only way to compel action sometimes is to be confronted with discomfort. When we choose to not support people who are actively defying the system of power, we tacitly enable the silencing of oppression. I need you to recognize why I occupy.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white;">They can ignore my talking about it outside of rounds and they can ignore my blog posts but they can’t ignore an L on the ballot. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white;">~</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">And, I'd like to thank several people for their help and support, specifically Bob for working with me throughout the year and Ben for his insights into performances and the Occupy movement.</span><br />
