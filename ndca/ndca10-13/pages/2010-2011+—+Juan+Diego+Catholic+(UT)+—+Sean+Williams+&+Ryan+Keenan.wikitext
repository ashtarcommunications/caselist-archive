==New Korean War Advantage== 



=*Negative= 
=***T and Procedurals**= 

==T – Military Must Be All== 
1. The adjective “military” means the plan must apply to all of the armed forces generally—the plan applies only to one branch


**SPIRITUS TEMPORIS 2005 (History website, “Military,” http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/military/meaning-of-the-word.html)**
**In American English, "military" as ………… military strength and military force.**

**2. Violation – the aff specifies certain branches**

**3. Vote Negative**
**a. First, predictable limits—allowing the aff to choose any one service or any combination of them in any combination of countries blows the lid off the topic**

**b. Second, predictable ground—letting the aff pick any one service shifts the debate away from the question of whether presence is good or bad to arguments about comparing one kind of presence to another—this fundamentally changes negative arguments**



==T – Presence is not PMCs== 
PMCs operate outside chain of command, governed by terms of their contracts


**Weiner, lawyer and specialist in corporate law on military policy, International Security Program fellow, 05 Rebecca Ulam Weiner "Private Military Contractors Come with Strings Attached"**
**[[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/index.html|Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School]], Winter 2005-06 [http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/19402/private_military_contractors_come_with_strings_attached.html]**
**Because security contractors operate …………. law, they can be fired.**

**Vote Neg for limits and predictability**
**Limits-They underlimit the topic. Under their interpretation, military presence not under the chain of commands is allowed.**
**Unpredictable because under their interpretation, any military presence somewhat related to the USFG troops is considered topical**
**This explodes neg research burden because we have to research every USFG related military operation, killing fairness.**

**T is a voter for fairness and education**


==T – Combat Troops== 
A. Interpretation - Presence requires regular, non-combat activities – forces engaged in combat or one-time noncombat missions aren’t part of U.S. presence


**Thomason, 2 – Project Leader, Institute for Defense Analysis (James, “Transforming US Overseas Military Presence: Evidence and Options for DoD,” July, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.122.1144&rep=rep1&type=pdf**
**WHAT IS OVERSEAS MILITARY PRESENCE? ……. contingency should call for them.**

**B. Violation – the aff ends combat missions, not presence missions.**
**C. Voting issue -**
**1. Predictable limits – allowing combat missions allows affs to change specific strategies in Afghanistan or Iraq, like ending cluster bombing without actually reducing forces themselves, it explodes the literature base.**
**2. negative ground – presence missions are about deterrence and reassurance – including combat missions avoids core negative Disads**


==T – Presence is ground troops== 
Troops= A. Interpretation – Presence refers to personnel stationed in a region


**The Oxford Essential Dictionary of the U.S. Military, 2 (by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved, republished and cited as “US Military Dictionary” at: http://www.answers.com/topic/presence)**
**US Military Dictionary: presence n.a group ………..maintain a presence in the region.**

[[#LastEdit]]
**C. Standards:**
**1. Limits – their interpretation explodes the topic –there are hundreds of possible mechanisms in a world where any type of reduction is allowed. Holding the line on ground troops is key to checking back any number of unpredictable affirmatives.**
**2. Ground – unlimiting the topic to reduction of anything related to the military allows the aff to spike out of regional stability or enforcement disads or kritiks related to troop action – key ground on this topic**
**D. Voter for fairness, education, and jurisdiction**


==T - Substantial is 50%== 
A. Interpretation – presence refers to the totality of US military power in a country


**Blechman et al, 97 – President of DFI International, and has held positions in the Department of Defense, the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Office of Management and Budget (Barry, Strategic Review, Spring, “Military Presence Abroad in a New Era: The Role of Airpower,” p. 14)**
**The highly complex nature of …………. requisite infrastructure and sustainment capabilities.”2**

**A substantial reduction in presence requires at least a 50% decrease**
**Comprehensive Base Closure Reform and Recovery Act, 92 (1992 H.R. 4421 ; 102 H.R. 4421, text of the Comprehensive Base Closure Reform and Recovery Act of 1992, introduced by Olympia Snowe, lexis)**
**TITLE I-ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION AT ………… and moved to another installation.**

**C. Voting issue –**
**1. predictable limits – allowing minor reductions allows countless variations of small affs likes reducing a single type of intelligence gathering or a covert op in Afghanistan or arms sales to Japan; it makes adequate research impossible**
**2. negative ground – topic disads won’t link to minor modifications, and generic ground is vitally important to protect since there are 6 different countries with diverse literature bases**
**Voter for fairness and education**



==*Bagram Violation== 
B. Violation – the affirmative is a minor reduction in presence- Bagram hosts a total ONLY 7000 service members.


**Wikipedia ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagram_Airfield]], accessed 10/16/10)**
**As of mid-June 2002 ............ including one named Viper City.**


==ASPEC== 
(If You Have Heard This Called BSPEC, That Has Nothing To Do With Me, Complain To Sean)


**A. interpretation and violation – the aff must specify which of the 3 branches of the federal government passes the plan – they don’t – they only say usfg**
**B. vote negative –**
**1. Key to core negative ground – courts, congress, executive counterplans, agent specific disads and case arguments**
**2. Conditionality – ‘resolved’ means a firm course of action according to american heritage dictionary – not specifying allows them to shift agents and allows 2ac clarifications which make them not topical**
**3. Takes out solvency – no such actor as the united states federal government, only specific branches**

==Security Kritik== 
The concept of security is a social construct. Claims of war and conflict create a false “us them” dichotomy, ignoring our role in provoking the aggression.

==Fear Kritik== 
<span style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">Disaster is everywhere we are! The aff is a product of the perversion of our twisted reality: The situations they locate contribute to our landscape of fear – our late capitalist universe’s condition where life is experienced through locating apocalypse and averting it “in the nick of time.” We live obsessed with chaos – the more pain, the more desire, we endlessly theorize how to save ourselves. We reflect an ideological deadlock sequenced by the projection of invulnerability and violence. A systemic of collective mindset cosmic control, projecting the illusion of invulnerability – our illusion confuses our stubborn reality – militarism becomes an inevitability leaving only room for apocalyptic energies.</span>

==Methodology Kritik== 


The affirmative makes decisions in the way that they research, and their decision to not experience and collaborate with those whom have experienced the devastation of US militarism, because that is what their aff prescribed to do- their privilege as scholars provides them with the necessity of collaborating with and providing an opportunity for the voiceless to present their voices in your research on their own terms and in their own words- Lack of this kind of research ignores your responsibility- This reenacts forms of domination and colonization on those you claim to speak for and help.
Kirsch, 1997 ( Gesa, Prof. of , “Multi-vocal Texts and Interpretive Responsibility”, College English, Vol. 59, No. 2 (Feb., 1997), pp. 191-202, jstor.org)
At the same time, however, ………….. with our new interpretive responsibilities.

Epistemological considerations precede politics—it is the most authentic way to understand oppression to create effective responses to exploitation. Rejecting epistemology results in macro-socioengineering, which makes all impacts inevitable. Our alternative of learning through first hand, corporeal experiential suffering solves the methodological problems that the 1ac presents
RAJAN ‘92 (Roby, The Discourse of Exploitation and the Exploitation of Discourse.) 
How then are human beings …………….. change in the larger society.

And our Alternative is the rejection of the exclusive use of the laboratory type research that the 1ac has engaged in- This promotes research that would actually include excluded voices on the peripher of US military presence in the context of debate- This is not a link of omission because you chose second hand research, which we criticize

==Long CP== 
In order to preserve the bilateral defense of Afghanistan and the United States:


The United States federal government should embrace the expansion of Afghan security forces as outlined in General Stanley McChrystal’s 2009 Initial Assesment on Initial United States Forces – Afghanistan (Initial Assesment). The United States federal government should utilize the increase in United States counterinsurgency presence that has been ordered by President Obama to achieve the expansion and training of Afghan security forces as called for in the Initial Assesment. The United States federal government should abide by President Obama’s directive to begin drawing dawn United States military presence in Afghanistan and completely transition to a counterterrorism presence by December 2012. The United States federal government should implement Gates’ weapons program spending proposal.


The counterplan competes – The plan substantially reduces the counterinsurgency presence, we use all of those same troops to train the Afghan security forces.


We solve all of the AFF – We end up with the same counterterrorism posture the plan does BUT we don’t get there until we train the Afghan security forces – The way the transition occurs and its timing is CRITICAL. The plan collapses Afghan stability flipping the case and undermines our ability to execute a counterterrorism strategy flipping their solvency.
