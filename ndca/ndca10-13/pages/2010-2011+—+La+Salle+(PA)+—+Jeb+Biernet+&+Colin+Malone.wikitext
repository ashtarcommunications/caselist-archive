<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">WE BEGIN WITH THE THESIS: IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE SEPTEMBER 11TH ATTACKS, THE UNITED STATES HAD EVERY REASON TO PURSUE AL-QAEDA. HOWEVER, OVER THE FOLLOWING NINE YEARS THAT TRANSFORMED AFGHANISTAN INTO THE LONGEST WAR IN AMERICAN HISTORY, THE US JUSTIFIED ITS 1 to 1000 RATIO OF TERRORISTS TO TROOPS BY MAKING THE TALIBAN AND AL-QAEDA SYNONYMOUS. WITH AMERICAN TROOPS NEEDLESSLY DYING IN THE FUTILE PURSUIT OF A UTOPIAN AFGHANISTAN THROUGH COUNTER-INSURGENCY IN A MANNER REMINESCIENT OF THE VIETNAM WAR, IT IS TIME FOR AMERICAN TO REFOCUS ON ITS VITAL INTERESTS THROUGH A SUSTAINABLE COUNTER-TERRORISM POSTURE. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> </span></span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The appropriate question is not whether the war is winnable…Such demands demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of the public's tolerance for an open-ended mission with ill-defined goals. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A STUBBORN PURSUIT OF NATION-BUILDING UNDERMINES OUR VITAL INTERESTS. STEVEN SIMON OF THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS ARGUES IN OCTOBER 2009 THAT: </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The Obama administration's instincts favouring robust counter-insurgency and state-building in Afghanistan reflect the 1990s-era US and European predilection for peacekeeping, reconstruction and stabilization, and the multilateral use of force for humanitarian intervention, deployed to positive effect in the Balkans and withheld tragically in Rwanda…<span style="color: black;"><span style="color: black;">This is because citizens of democracies tend to find military escalation - encompassing higher casualties, rising brutality and the near-inevitable erosion of democratic practices - increasingly intolerable and often reach their limit before victory can be secured. </span></span></span></span><span style="color: black;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 9pt;"> </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> </span></span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In Afghanistan and Iraq, United States forces are trying to fight a shadowy enemy that does not wear uniforms, while being told to protect corrupt governments…Perhaps, and that would be a dark day. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">By the time Obama became president in 2009, the situation inside Afghanistan was fast deteriorating…So, asked for an exit strategy, the administration instead offered up guidelines for an endless occupation.  </span></span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">THUS THE PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD IMPLEMENT A PHASED, TWO YEAR DRAWDOWN IN THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN TO REDUCE TROOP LEVELS TO A COUNTER-TERRORISM FORCE OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN-THOUSAND TROOPS.

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This means efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan will continue to be those that have been ongoing—collecting intelligence through various means and then targeting with drone strikes based on that intelligence. A stable Afghanistan will not change that…This would be a total force of about 13,000 military personnel and some supporting intelligence community personnel and contractors.  </span></span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">AND UNLIKE STATUS QUO IRRATIONALITY, THIS INTERVENTION IS SUSTAINABLE. IN 2010 LONG CONTINUES: </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> </span></span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The strategic goal of this transition is to ensure the survival of an Afghan state while acknowledging that probably 35-40 percent of the country (i.e. almost all of the Pashtun regions) will be under the de facto control of militants…It is this conflating of the local fighter with the global terrorist that David Kilcullen’s Accidental Guerilla rails against, so it would behoove the United States to avoid this error.42 </span></span>
