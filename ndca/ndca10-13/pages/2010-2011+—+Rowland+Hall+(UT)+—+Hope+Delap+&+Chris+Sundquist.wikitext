OR
Plan: The Department of Defense should substantially reduce its counterinsurgency presence in Afghanistan.

==[[#Affirmative-Hegemony Advantage]]__Hegemony Advantage__== 
First, we’re not ahead – Counterinsurgency is impossible in Afghanistan.
Nelson, ‘9 – former director of a Joint Task Force in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, retired naval officer with assignments at the National Counterterrorism Center and National Security Council, and Senior Fellow at the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (Rick, “The Other Side of the COIN”, 10/1, [[http://csis.org/publication/other-side-coin]])
Q1: General McChrystal is expected to request up to … expenditure that any “all-in” approach would entail.

Failure is inevitable in the status quo – Corruption, lack of resources, ethnic tensions, and geography make the strategy ineffective.
Dorronsoro, ‘10 - visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment, is an expert on Afghanistan, Turkey, and South Asia. Previously, Dorronsoro was a professor of political science at the Sorbonne, Paris and the Institute of Political Studies of Rennes (Gilles, “The Case for Negotiations,” In These Times, 5/24, [[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=40863]])
The coalition's strategy in Afghanistan is at an impasse … recognize the impossibility of a military solution.

The Afghan COIN model is disastrous for US hegemony – We will control 5 internals
a. Budget Paralysis
The new military posture requires massive investment, which collapses our budget.
Klare, 10 - Five Colleges professor of Peace and World Security Studies, whose department is located at Hampshire College, defense correspondent of The Nation magazine, and author of Resource Wars and Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Petroleum Dependency (Michael, “'Two, Three, Many Afghanistans'”, 4/8, The Nation, [[http://www.thenation.com/issue/april-26-2010]])
Now we have President Obama and his domineering Defense Secretary … to a world of increased anti-Americanism and violence.

b. Retrenchment
COIN ultimately results in abandonment – loss of leadership here will result in countless scenarios of destruction.
Kretkowski, ‘10 – Frequently assists think tank in conferences and other work products that aid DoD's long-term thinking about threats that may not be addressable via weapons platforms. Spent six months in Afghanistan working with Army public affairs. (Paul, “Against COIN, for CT in Afghanistan and Elsewhere”, 1/7, Beacon (a blog), [[http://softpowerbeacon.blogspot.com/2010/01/against-coin-for-ct-in-afghanistan-and.html]])
Over the winter break I had an epiphany about the interrelation of … or complex challenges from a rising power (China, a reinvigorated Russia).

c. Morale & Readiness
Afghanistan is a quagmire –presence eviscerates American morale.
Kuhner, 9 - the president of the Edmund Burke Institute for American Renewal (Jeffrey, Washington Times, “Obama’s quagmire; US should look to its own interests,” 9/7, Lexis Academic)
America is losing the war in Afghanistan … Afghans into the evil, welcoming arms of extremists

d. Credibility
The plan restores it with generals and foreign leaders – It ensures a sustainable presence and incentivizes political solutions instead of civil war.
Stewart, ‘10 - Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro (Rory, “Afghanistan: What Could Work”, New York Review of Books, 1/14, [[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jan/14/afghanistan-what-could-work/?page=3]])
As long as the US asserted that Afghanistan was an existential threat … That would be excellent for Afghans and good for the world

e. Overstretch
Reframing our grand strategy is key to an adequate strategic reserve.
Friedman, ‘10 - American political scientist. He is the chief intelligence officer, and CEO of the private intelligence corporation Stratfor. Prior to Stratfor, Friedman spent almost twenty years in academia, teaching political science at Dickinson College. During this time, he regularly briefed senior commanders in the armed services as well as the U.S. Army War College (George, “The 30-Year War in Afghanistan,” Stratfor, 6/29,
[[http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100628_30_year_war_afghanistan]])
The exit of U.S. forces represents a bid to reinstate … to free up forces and re-establish its ground reserves

Loss of primacy guarantees world wars.
Kagan 07 - senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (Robert, “End of Dreams, Return of History”, 7/19, [[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/07/end_of_dreams_return_of_histor.html]])
Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy … influence and global involvement will provide an easier path

The impact is extinction
Nye 90 (Joseph, University Distinguished Service Professor and Sultan of Oman Professor of International Relations at Harvard University., “Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power”, 17-18)
Perceptions of change in the relative power of nations … which two nations have dominated the balance of power.

Even if they win that a world without hegemony is good, they still lose – getting there would mean massive transition wars across the globe
Brzezinski 5 (Zbigniew National Security Advisor in the Carter Administration, Professor of Foreign Policy at Johns Hopkins University, “The Choice: Global Domination or Global Leadership”, p. 2-4)
History is a record of change, a reminder that nothing endures … enlist others in a common effort to shape a secure international environment.

Less is more – shifting to a counterterrorism strategy maintains public support allows for a smaller, but permanent presence in the region.
Stewart, ‘9 - Ryan Family Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro (9/16/09, Rory, “The Future of Afghanistan,” [[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan]])
The best Afghan policy would be to reduce the number of foreign troops … In Afghanistan in the long-term, less will be more.

==[[#Affirmative-Pakistan Advantage]]__Pakistan Advantage__== 

The SQ counter-insurgency will collapse Pakistan
Akhtar, ‘10- professor of international relations, and a senior analyst & writer. He was the dean of faculty of management, Baluchistan university, and former chairman of International Relations Department, Karachi university (1/26/10, Shameem, “Pakistan’s Instability : The US War Factor,” [[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&cid=1262372328640&pagename=Zone-English-Muslim_Affairs/MAELayout#1]])

This was part of the larger design of US military … but they may erupt at any moment, thus destabilizing the state.
Pakistan collapse causes nuclear war
Pitt, ‘9- a New York Times and internationally bestselling author of two books: "War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn't Want You to Know" and "The Greatest Sedition Is Silence." (5/8/09, William, “Unstable Pakistan Threatens the World,” [[http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=commentary&article=2183]])
As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where … gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all.

We solve because CT allows more effective war on terror.
Chellany, ‘9 - professor of strategic studies at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi (9/14/09, Brahma, Japan Times, “An Advantagous U.S. Exit,” [[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20090914bc.html]])
When the administration's principal war target is not … groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e- Mohammed.

Nuclear terrorism independently causes extinction.
Morgan, ‘9 (Dennis Ray, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in South Korea, “World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race”, July 10, Futures 41 (2009) 683–693)
In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks … a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well.

Withdrawal immediately turns the population against the Taliban, solving legitimacy
Dorronsoro, ‘9 -Visiting Scholar, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (January 2009, Gilles, “Focus and Exit: An Alternative Strategy for the Afghan War,” [[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/afghan_war-strategy.pdf]])
This three-zone strategy is not, per se, a game- changer … primarily if it accelerates the independence of Afghanistan’s peripheral regions.

Indicts misunderstand the plan – it is resourced to provide force protection, intelligence, training and will maintain the support of the locals
Long, 10 - assistant professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (Austin, “Small is Beautiful: The Counterterrorism Option in Afghanistan,” Orbis, Spring 2010, Science Direct)
This insoluble problem is why the counterterrorism option is important … it is vastly larger than any other counterterrorism deployment.

===Imperialism=== 
A. Pretending we have a voice in the formation of US military policy is politically disabling- it misidentifies the enemy and presumes a democracy which doesn’t exist.

Thus, an asset that is located (or present) overseas may or may not be “engaged in presence activities,” may or may not be “doing presence.”<span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> We have thus far defined presence activities chiefly in “negative” terms—what they are not. In more positive terms</span></span>, what exactly are presence activities, i.e., what do presence activities actually entail doing? <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Overseas military presence activities are generally viewed as a subset of</span></span> the overall class of activities that the US government uses in its <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">efforts to promote important military/security objectives</span></span> [Dismukes, 1994]. A variety of recurrent, overseas military activities are normally placed under the “umbrella” concept of military presence. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">These include but are not limited to US military efforts overseas to train foreign militaries; to improve inter-operability of US and friendly forces; to peacefully and visibly demonstrate US commitment and/or ability to defend US interests; to gain intelligence and familiarity with a locale; to conduct peacekeeping activities; and to position relevant, capable US military assets such that they are likely to be available sooner rather than later in case an evolving security operation or contingency should call for them</span></span>.2 



B. Violation – the aff ends combat missions, not presence missions.

C. Voting issue -

1. limits – allowing combat missions allows affs to change specific strategies in Afghanistan or Iraq, like ending cluster bombing without actually reducing forces themselves, it explodes the literature base

2. negative ground – presence missions are about deterrence and reassurance – including combat missions avoids core negative disads

===China Currency=== 

A. Uniqueness – 
Momentum to pass China currency legislation is mounting but Obama will exert enough pressure to stop it in the status quo.

Rapprochement with Russia arguably offers the best prospects for near-term success. Washington and Moscow are well on their way toward closing a deal on arms control, and their interests intersect on a number of other important issues, including the need for stability in Central and South Asia. Moreover, the United States can piggyback on the progress that the European Union has already made in reaching out to Russia on issues of trade, energy, and security. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Obama also needs to start laying the groundwork for congressional support. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">To help clear the legislative hurdles ahead, Obama</span></span></span> should consider including in his stable of special envoys a prominent Republican--such as former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, former Senator Chuck Hagel, or former Secretary of State James Baker--to lend a bipartisan imprimatur to any proposed deals that might come before Congress. He <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">must</span> </span>also <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">be careful not to overreach. For example, his call to eliminate</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> nuclear <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">weapons</span></span></span> altogether, however laudable in theory, <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">may scare off centrist senators</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> who might otherwise be prepared to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Obama should also be mindful of the order in which he picks his fights. If advancing rapprochement</span> with Russia <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is a priority</span> for 2010, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it makes sense to put off heavy lifting</span></span></span> with Cuba until the following year. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">It is better to shepherd a few key items through Congress than to ask for too much--and risk coming back empty-handed</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;"> </span>
