**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">First, funding for the Famine Early Warning System, or FEWS, has been cut. Future cuts are expected. This undermines the effectiveness of the satellites.</span>**

**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">Budget constraints are likely to continue to severely limit U.S. investments in new satellites and other capabilities</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">, according to government officials in a range of agencies. </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">Funding may become the critical constraint on future earth monitoring capabilities.</span>__**

<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, for example, highlighted the importance of tsunami early warning capabilities. Yet funding cuts threaten NOAA’s Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) program, which proved crucial for leveraging U.S. satellite and ground-based systems to extend evacuation time in Hawaii, including at a range of coastal military bases. The National Weather Service, which runs the DART program, may see cuts of up to 28 percent for fiscal year (FY) 2012.14 </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">The</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;"> U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID)</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';"> Famine Early Warning System (FEWS) network will likely see its budget reduced in the next several years </span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">as well, and accord- ing to many USAID officials the agency’s climate change work is one of the areas most likely to be cut. </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">NASA’s Applied Sciences Program, which disseminates information and other data from NASA satellites, has also contributed to early warning and response to natural disasters. The president’s budget request for FY 2012 includes 33.1 million dollars for this program – down from 35.3 million dollars in FY 2010 – and Congress may cut that number even further.</span>__****__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">15 </span>__****__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">These offices and programs are critical to executing the existing satellites’ missions.</span>__**



**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">And the need for Famine Early Warning Systems to be funded through congress undermines its effectiveness.</span>**

**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">FEWS NET's activities</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">, however, are not funded under PL 480, which means that it </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">must get its annual funds through the contentious, difﬁcult and highly politicized budget process at USAID</span>__****__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 6pt;">. </span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 6pt;">In 2007, after nearly being defunded and having its USAID representatives spend six months trying to restore funding levels to that of 2006. FEWS NET’s supporters and leadership have sought to include funding for its work under the PL 480 reauthorization effort that is currently in congress**__.__** If this is successful, FEWS NET will become institutionalized similar to USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, one that has regular, reliable funding and that can focus on improving its services without having to focus on maintaining its funding levels in an ever-varying political environment. Since</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';"> the need for information seems only to increase through time.</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 6pt;">there is signiﬁcant support for this effort. Although food aid authorized through PL 480 has improved or saved the lives of many hundreds of millions of people worldwide since its passage in 1954, there has been much discussion during the reauthorization process that describes how the law could be changed to make food aid a more effective and farther reaching tool. Barrett and Maxwell (2005) describe policy changes that would greatly improve its ability to reduce poverty and hunger while simultaneously reducing costs. There are a few of these that FEWS NET could directly address, with its use of remote sensing being at the forefront. The relevant recommendations include: 0 Focus on emergencies and make the response quicker and more ﬂexible; 0 Within current budgets, adapt the resource to ﬁt the application; 0 Improve the targeting of food aid; and 0 Use food aid only where it is appropriate (Barrett and Maxwell, 2005). These are all areas where FEWS NET has worked to provide information and policy guidance for the past twenty years, and yet Barrett and Maxwell point out thatthey can be done better</span><span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';"> **__Because the provisioning of food aid is part of a political process, information and recommendations provided to the US and other donor countries may not be followed. The information itself could be better__**</span><span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 6pt;">and the preceding sections and chapters point to ways this can be done. Overall, </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">FEWS NET can only be as effective as the structure in which it operates.</span>__**

**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 24pt;">Thus the plan:</span>**

Funding, enforcement, and administration will be through necessary means.</span>**

**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: 'Century Gothic';">We will isolate 3 scenarios </span>**

<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">speculation? Sean Thompson, November 2011 http://www.4edu.info/images/a/ad/Food_and_energy_crisis_-_Sean_Thompson.pdf</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">Global food prices have fallen slightly from their historic peak in February but a report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, published in October 10, says that high,</span><span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';"> **__unpredictable prices are likely to continue. The global food price index produced by the FAO reached a historic peak of 238 points in February, well above the peak of 213.5 reached in 2008.__**</span><span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;"> Prices have since eased and in October the index registered 216 points. However</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';"> it is still 5% higher than in October 2010. In 2009, for the first time in human history, over a billion people were officially classified as living in hunger, while another two billion live in perpetual food insecurity. So today, despite unprecedented wealth existing in the world, over 40% of all human beings are either permanently malnourished or suffering from varying degrees of food insecurity</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">. </span>





**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">And there is a moral obligation to share food – even if the result of the action is extinction.</span>**

No principle of morality absolves one of behaving immorally simply to save one’s life or nation. There is a strict analogy here between adhering to moral principles for the sake of being moral, and adhering to Christian principles for the sake of being Christian. </span>The moral world contains pits and lions, but **__one looks always to the highest light.

**__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Century Gothic';">Child soldiering does not assume centrality on the West's security agenda, whose top priorities are terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and weapons of mass destruction. Nor is it a preoccupation of scholars in security studies. Yet despite its relatively low profile in both realms, child soldier recruitment is important because it involves the suffering and death of thousands of children every year—many more than are direct victims of terrorism or the use of weapons of mass destruction.</span>__**<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;"> Concerns about the immorality of their recruitment and transgression of the rules of war might be regarded as self-evident. But to this consideration can be added several others, including the heightened exposure of naive children to the risks of death or injury in combat; the difficulty of rehabilitating child combatants; and the excessive cruelty inflicted by some child soldiers on their victims. It has long been understood that socialization into violence in youth creates a generation of violent adults, perpetuating a vicious cycle of instability within countries. Now, according to the aforementioned media reports, </span>**__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Century Gothic';">child soldiering has become intertwined with terrorism, suggesting that the increasing use of child soldiers poses a long-term threat to the health and security of societies far beyond the borders of the war-torn, fragile states in which these civil and ethnic conflicts take place. If their rehabilitation is difficult but necessary for the future stability of societies, then prevention is arguably even more vital and less costly.</span>__**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Act and idea in the Nazi genocide By Berel Lang professor of Philosophy at Wesleyan, 2003, pg 12-13</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Before considering further the two primary factors in the concept of genocide (the specification of the group and the intention related to its destruction), it is important to recognize the implied relation between these factors, on the hand, and the likely agents of genocide, on the other. That genocide entails the destruction of a group does not imply that the act of genocide itself must be the act of a group; but the practical implementation of a design for genocide would almost necessarily be so complex as to assure this. Admittedly; the same technological advances that make genocide increasingly possible as a collective action also have increased the possibility that an individual acting alone could initiate the process. </span><span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">(</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">When the push of a single button can produce cataclysmic effects, we discover an order of destruction-“omnicide</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">”</span><span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">-even larger than genocide.)'1'</span><span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';"> **__But the opprobrium attached to the term “genocide” seems also to have the connotation of a corporate action--as if this act or sequence of acts would be a lesser fault, easier to understand if not to excuse if one person rather than a group were responsible for it. A group (we suppose) would be bound by a public moral code; decisions made would have been reached collectively; and the culpability of individual intentions would be multiplied proportionately.__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">Admittedly, corporate responsibility is sometimes invoked in order to diminish (or at least to obscure) individual responsibility; so, for example, the “quagmire” effect that was appealed to retrospectively by defenders of the United States’ role in Vietnam. But</span><span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';"> **__for genocide, the likelihood of its corporate origins seems to accentuate its moral enormity: a large number of individual, intentional acts would have to be committed and the connections among them also affirmed in onder to produce the extensive act. Unlike other corporate acts that might be not only decided on but carried out by a single person or small group of persons, genocide in its scope seems necessarily to require collaboration by a relatively large number of agents acting both collectively and individually.__**</span>

In a region where grazing animals are a significant part of the agricultural sector, Scicchitano said, assistance programs are in place to give herders greater capacity to sustain their animals through drought. FEWS NET was created in the aftermath of a disastrous famine in the early 1980s that hit the continent from West Africa to Ethiopia. The organization monitors about 30 famine-prone countries around the world and collects mountains of data from diverse sources to constantly evaluate levels of food security. FEWS NET alerts give national governments, international agencies and donor nations information they need to make life-saving preparations.</span>__**//

//<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Scicchitano said FEWS NET accumulates real-time data about weather, crops and livestock to track the course of food security. He describes satellite images collected by NASA that show analysts more about the crops than farmers may know themselves. "It shows us midway through the crop season, how are those crops developing? Are we looking at a normal year? Are we looking at a year when rains have failed altogether, or is it an excellent year or somewhere in between?" he said. The analysts also study people and families: what they eat, where they grow it, how they buy it and what might happen if food supplies are disrupted.</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">Understanding the array of data that contributes to food security or the lack of it has helped ease the toll of widespread hunger, whether it results from a failed growing season or a natural disaster such as the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Despite widespread destruction and homelessness, famine did not occur in that disaster because a targeted humanitarian response, informed by FEWS NET analysis, helped meet emergency needs in the Caribbean nation.</span>__****__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">Just as FEWS NET grew out of a disaster, Scicchitano said, the analysis FEWS NET conducts today will create a stronger body of data to plan for food security in the future. It is widely acknowledged that global agriculture must step up production in the decades ahead if the food needs of growing populations are to be met. Scicchitano said achieving that goal will require well-founded decisions about which investments might produce the greatest yields for the future. "If we can make good investments, we can combat hunger," Scicchitano said, "and FEWS NET can contribute to that."</span>__**//





//**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">Finally, effectively famine early warning system solves the alternate causes of food instability – specifically the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, which is a uniquely NASA space tool, allows longitudinal comparison.

**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">Currently the best data for NDVI measurements come from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites; earlier data came from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments deployed on NOAA polar orbiting meteorological satellites. </span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">Since chlorophyll -- the green pigment that plants use to turn sunlight into carbohydrates and hence energy -- absorbs visible light, healthy plants reflect less red light and therefore have a higher NDVI than those with sparse or unhealthy leaves. On Tucker's maps, the sparsely vegetated areas of the Sahara and the Sahel region have NDVI values near zero. The dense jungles of Central Africa have an NDVI closer to 1, the highest value. "It's a very simple and elegant measurement, just two channels of information," said Assaf Anyamba, a Goddard scientist who uses NDVI to research climate variability and vector-borne diseases. "We now have almost 29 years of NDVI documenting global land-based photosynthesis." **Keeping Food on the Table** </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">NDVI is a remarkably versatile measurement, but monitoring the global food supply has emerged as one of its particularly important uses. By comparing NDVI from one year to previous years, scientists can see tell-tale signs that crops are healthy and vigorous or suffering from drought, insect infestation, or some other problem. </span>__**

<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">The largest user of NDVI data is the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which monitors agricultural production worldwide with a focus on 15 key crops, including wheat, corn, soy beans, and rice. FAS estimates agricultural production to determine the market rate for commodities, the foundation of the economy in both developed and developing countries. </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">The</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;"> U.S. Agency for International Development's Famine Early Warning Systems Network </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">(FEWS NET) uses NDVI as its primary tool for anticipating food shortages and failed harvests. FEWS NET provides near real-time data to 20 African countries -- as well as Guatemala, Haiti, and Afghanistan -- about the risks of famine based on NDVI and complementary environmental data.</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">Satellite data alone cannot cure the world of famine, Brown notes, but systems like </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">FEWS NET can buy critical time for governments and relief organizations to react when droughts, wars, and infestations strike the food supply. </span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 8pt;">NDVI has proven particularly useful in some of the world’s most contentious hotspots. In 2008, the FAS, FEWS NET, and a number of other partners used NDVI to monitor wheat yields in Iraq and Afghanistan through a persistent drought that led to the worst yields in a decade. Closer to home, NDVI is also used in certain states as a basis for a novel crop insurance program managed by the USDA. And it's used by ranchers in the American Southwest, as part of the "Range View" monitoring network, to locate the best areas for cattle to forage. **Solution for a Hungry, Crowded World** he United Nations projects Earth’s population will surpass 9 billion people by 2050, up from the current 6.8 billion. Since the 1990s, commodity prices have risen and the amount of cultivated land per person has declined. The result: many poor communities are ending up with less access to locally grown food even as global food supplies are increasing. Already, researchers estimate that 30 percent of the rural populations of developing countries lack reliable access to food because of poverty. Meanwhile, models suggest that climate change could create an El-Niño like effect in the Indian Ocean that causes more droughts in key agricultural areas of the Americas, Africa, and Asia Such findings cause Brown and others to worry that areas already struggling with food shortages may face even graver problems in the future. But she also remains hopeful that scientific and technological tools like </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">NDVI can provide critical information to help us blunt the worst of the problems. Improving early prediction systems may be as important in preventing famine as improving farming techniques and food aid policies for ensuring a sustainable future</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Century Gothic';">.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is even a chance that </span>**__the ascent of economics to its pinnacle position in modern life reduces war. Nations interconnected by trade may be less willing to fight each other__**<span style="font-size: 6pt;">: If China and the United States ever fought, both nations might see their economies collapse. It is true that, in the decades leading up to World War I, some thought rising trade would prevent war. But today’s circumstances are very different from those of the Fin de siècle [turn of the century]. Before World War I, great powers still maintained the grand illusion that there could be war without general devastation; World Wars I and II were started by governments that thought they could come out ahead by fighting.</span>**__Today, no major government appears to believe that war is the best path to nationalistic or monetary profit; trade seems much more promising__****__.__**

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The late economist Julian Simon proposed that, in a knowledge-based economy, people and their brainpower are more important than physical resources, and thus the lives of a country’s citizens are worth more than any object that might be seized in war. Simon’s was a highly optimistic view — he assumed governments are grounded in reason — and yet there is a chance this vision will be realized. Already, most Western nations have achieved a condition in which citizens’ lives possess greater economic value than any place or thing an army might gain by combat. As knowledge-based economics spreads throughout the world, physical resources may mean steadily less, while life means steadily more. That’s, well, enlightenment. In his 1993 book, A History of Warfare, the military historian John Keegan recognized the early signs that combat and armed conflict had entered a cycle of decline. War “may well be ceasing to commend itself to human beings as a desirable or productive, let alone rational, means of reconciling their discontents,” Keegan wrote. Now there are 15 years of positive developments supporting the idea. Fifteen years is not all that long. Many things could still go badly wrong; there could be ghastly surprises in store. But, for the moment</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>**__the trends have never been more auspicious:__** **__Swords really are being beaten into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As a warning bell to come, Congress has cut almost $1B from the requested $19B budget. At the same time, NASA has a troubled program - the James Webb Space Telescope that continues experiencing cost overruns and schedule delays. </span> **__With Congress' mandate__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to proceed with the space telescope, </span>**__many of the smaller NASA science projects are at risk.__** **The Houston Chronicle** **__worries that two science missions to Mars in 2016 1nd 2018 are already affected by the new budget.

**Additionally, the affirmative’s use of geospatial mapping to understand geographic phenomena solves the epistemological and ontological questions that arise as a result of their criticism.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Cartographic Visualization: An Assessment and Epistemological Review* Elaine J. Hallisey Director of the GIS Team at the Office of Health Information and Policy, Division of Public Health, at the Georgia Department of Human Resources, Georgia State University http://www.coss.fsu.edu/geography/stallins/geog/Readings/hallisey.pdf</span>

**__The two primary aims of this article were to demonstrate the value of cartographic visualization as an essential part of a comprehensive analysis of geographic phenomena and to show that it can be undertaken using different epistemological approaches__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A brief history of cartographic visualization addressed the concepts of the map communication model and graphicacy, which is the ability to effectively ommunicate and understand relationships through visual aids that cannot be expressed solely with text, spoken words, or mathematical notation. MacEachren’s characterization of cartographic visualization is the result of the evolution of these earlier concepts and includes both public realm map communication as well as private realm interactive visual analysis. Several specific examples of the visual analysis of spatial data, among innumerable others, demonstrated the value of cartographic visualization in the study of geographic phenomena, particularly for interactive analysis. As acknowledged**__,__** </span>**__it is more difficult to determine the negative effects of not using cartographic visualization in the analysis of spatial data, but when results in scientific research on spatial data conflict, cartographic visualization may help to clarify understanding__****__. With regard to defining the epistemological approach of cartographic visualization, technological determinism must be avoided. The process of cartographic visualization takes on the epistemological approach of the researcher, so it may incorporate positivist perspectives, realist perspectives, or other modes of knowledge acquisition and production__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Criticisms of cartographic visualization come from various epistemological standpoints. Social theorists tend to focus on public-realm map communication, claiming it to be subjective, ethnocentric, and culturally produced, thereby helping to maintain the status quo with respect to power relationships. Social theorists have called for greater democratization, which, in fact, is occurring in cartography and GIS today. Quantitative positivists agree that cartographic visualization is subjective, but many also argue it is descriptive and inductive and, therefore, inadequate for robust analysis. Is objectivity truly attainable? Educated in a decidedly positivist environment with current leanings toward a more realist perspective, I would say </span>**__there is some subjectivity inherent in all research; in choosing which data to analyze, which methods of analysis to perform, and in how results are interpreted. It is true that cartographic visualization is inductive, but falsification in the modern scientific method also involves some inductive reasoning, as discussed. Some cartographic visualization may be descriptive or qualitative, but it is useful for seeing patterns and relationships and sometimes drives the direction of research, especially when visualizing data in the private realm. As noted earlier in the article, the high levels of humanmap interaction in private-realm cartographic visualization engender a more complete understanding of the spatial data. The individual researcher has access to the data source, not just final production maps, and may generate multiple views, using different algorithms, of the same data__**. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">For example, in interpolating a surface of mean minimum temperature from sample points for a study area, the researcher has the option of using inverse distance weighting, spline, or kriging, among other geostatistical methods. Some methods are better than others, depending upon the type of data, the distribution of the sample points, and other factors. Additionally, techniques for estimating error exist. The researcher also has the option of creating a contour map or a gridded surface to visualize the data. The patterns revealed among various layers of data in the cartographic visualizations could suggest a direction for the research process. An astute researcher uses cartographic visualization techniques throughout the analysis of spatial data and is intimately involved in the mapping process, either by conducting his or her own cartographic visualization or by working closely with those who are performing the cartographic visualization. Employing a mapping technician who is unfamiliar with the topic under study to decide the most suitable way to map the data would certainly be detrimental to the research. Employing a cartographer to map results after the analysis is also unfavorable in that the opportunity is missed to interactively and comprehensively investigate the spatial data. In conclusion,</span> **__no matter the epistemological or ontological considerations, it is best to come at any problem from many different perspectives. A single method or approach may not be the best in all cases and could be limited in most. The incorporation of qualitative and quantitative information, text, and numbers, as well as thoughtful cartographic visualization, leads to a more complete understanding of geographic data. In conjunction with text, spoken words, and mathematics, cartographic visualization completes the metaphor of Balchin and Coleman. Modifying their words, in spatial research, graphicacy__** **__<span style="font-family: AdvJansonT-I,sans-serif;">must </span>__****__be ‘‘the fourth ace in the pack__****__.’’__**
