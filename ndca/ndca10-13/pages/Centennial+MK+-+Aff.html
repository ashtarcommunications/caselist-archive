Diminishing returns to complexity are probably inevitable, but collapse doesn’t necessarily follow. Collapses are actually not that common. There are several ways to cope with diminishing returns to complexity. One is to find energy subsidies to pay for the process. That is what we have done with fossil fuels. And it is a big part of why a future crisis in fossil fuels is the most important thing we should be worrying about.<br />
<br />
Complexity theory doesn’t apply to economic crises—growth is sustainable because economic recessions are a product of insufficient complexity—star this argument<br />

<br />
Racism’s global scope demands US incorporation of CERD.<br />
Domestic rights groups MUST incorporate the provisions of CERD as the growing trend for U.S. courts to indirectly apply international human rights standards. U.S. activists attach ADDITIONAL meaning and content to civil rights statutes and the U.S. constitution as accepted under the ICCPR and CERD, this ESPECIALLY true to the WIDE ARRAY of problems that Blacks face. The color line is INTERNATIONAL and the INTERNATIONAL COLOR LINE is dependent on U.S. participation.<br />

CERD is key to eradicating global racial discrimination.<br />
CERD embodies the WORLD’S expression that a UNIVERSAL international standard against race discrimination is NECESSARY. The U.S. is CHALLENGED to uphold CERD as domestic law has proven INADEQUATE. The application of international human rights law could be PIVOTAL to eradicating RACISM and its DELETERIOUS effects.<br />
