<br />
The inequitable transit landscape in which we find ourselves today did not sprout up organically or overnight. Several factors have contributed, but the most significant has been suburbanization and its attendant growth of car-based lifestyles. By investing disproportionately in highways that expand metropolitan areas, funding construction far from urban centers, and tipping decision-making power away from urban and inner suburban constituencies, our transit planning has placed inequitable burdens on low-income people, people with disabilities, and people of color by entrenching the segregation of racial minorities and increasing the concentration of poverty. Post-WWII highway projects plowed through minority urban neighborhoods to shuttle commuters to and from the suburbs. Transportation planning has historically prioritized suburban development over strengthening cities and incentivized geographic expansion rather than improving infrastructure to accommodate larger, more densely populated areas. The result: Geographic segregation, along with unequal investment in transit options for urban, low-income people. Today, we still invest disproportionately in new highways, allowing public transit systems to age and leaving metropolitan cores more difficult to navigate. Metropolitan areas are actually subsidizing this policy: Federal highway funding comes largely from gas taxes, and metropolitan areas contribute the most per capita. Still, outlying areas benefit most.24 Suburban and rural areas receive more federal and state spending per capita than metropolitan areas, where most people live. Unequal power in the decision-making process explains at least some of the disparities. State departments of transportation and local groups called Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) play a large role in determining how to allocate transit funding. Unfortunately, MPOs disproportionately represent suburban interests (because a less dense county has an equal vote with a highly populous urban jurisdiction in a metro area), and their memberships are not representative of metro area demographics. Eighty- eight percent of voting members of the 50 largest MPOs are White.25 Not surprisingly, this underrepresentation of urban interests affects MPOs’ decisions about transportation investment.<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">According to some observers, the legal influence of the United States in the world is waning.' Where once the world looked to the U.S. Supreme Court as a guiding light, now foreign courts are increasingly disinterested in what our nine Justices have to say.2 &quot;One of our great exports used to be constitutional law,&quot; contends Anne-Marie Slaughter; &quot;we are losing one of the greatest bully pulpits we have ever had.&quot;3 Some commentators view this trend as disturbing evidence that the United States is losing its voice in an emerging international and transnational legal dialogue.4 This does not appear to be a temporary fad: the U.S. Supreme Court's fading relevance in this global judicial dialogue is seen as a consequence of globalization.5 In sum, &quot;Judges are globalizing,&quot;6 &quot;[c]ourts are talking to one another all over the world,&quot;7 and the United States is &quot;out of step with [this] international mainstream.&quot;8 There is empirical evidence offered to support this proposition. For example, the New York Times found that the rate of citation to the U.S. Supreme Court by the Supreme Court of Canada from 2002 to 2008 fell by fifty percent as compared to the number of citations from 1990 to 2002.9 Particularly in human rights cases, foreign courts are now more likely to cite the European Court of Human Rights than the U.S. Supreme Court.10 </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">And, the current federal stance on racial discrimination represents a significant and ongoing reservation against international law</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Menedian et al 08</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Structural Racism in the United States A Report to the U.N. Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on the occasion of its review of the Periodic Report of the United States of America February 2008 Prepared by: Stephen Menendian, Marguerite Spencer, Lidija Knuth, john powell, Sara Jackson, Fran Fajana, Andrew Grant-Thomas, Jason Reece, Eva Paterson, and Kimberly Rapp.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">As a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the United States is under an obligation to condemn and pursue a policy of eliminating racial discrimination, in all its forms (art. 2, ¶1). The U.S. has not taken seriously the duty under Article 2 of CERD to affirmatively address racial discrimination. Instead, the U.S. has rationalized racial discriminatory effects as not covered by U.S. law. Sometimes these effects are caused by explicit government polices. At other times they are caused by private actors. Frequently, it is a combination of both. The Convention defines racial discrimination (art. 1, ¶1) to mean distinctions, exclusions, restrictions or preferences based on race which have “the purpose or effect” of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any field of public life. CERD’s definition of discrimination is unequivocal: effects and racially disparate outcomes caused by individual action or government practices or policies, singularly or collectively, are of primary concern. Contrary to CERD, U.S. law defines racial discrimination more narrowly in at least two critical respects. First, with few exceptions U.S. law narrowly defines cognizable racial discrimination by requiring evidence of intent to discriminate. Section II demonstrates that such a requirement is contrary to the framework of CERD and does not reflect the real-world operation of discriminatory behavior in contemporary American society. As recognized by CERD, discrimination can be the product of facially race neutral polices and practices as well as unintentional action and inaction of individuals. This observation is not controversial and yet fails to be robustly recognized in U.S. law. Second, U.S. law fails to recognize that racial discrimination in American society often arises from the interactions, both public and private, over time and across domains. Section III details how racial discrimination manifests itself in these ways and argues that to correct for unjustifiable and cumulative racial impacts, U.S. courts and policy makers must adopt an inter-institutional perspective. Although Article 1 and General Recommendation XIV of CERD are concerned with racially disparate effects of policies and practices involving this intersectionality, U.S. courts have been increasingly reluctant to redress discrimination in one domain that is caused by interactions in other domains. The definition of discrimination under CERD also extends to private as well as public action. Although the U.S. has reserved to the Convention with respect to the regulation of private conduct beyond what is required under domestic law, the United States is responsible for addressing unjustifiable racial impacts that result from the interaction of public and private actions. </span><br />

CONCLUSION P46In order to achieve its goals of removing doubts as to U.S. commitment to international human rights and of influencing the world community, the U.S. must make three changes: (1) the U.S. should withdraw its first reservation concerning the juvenile death penalty; (2) it should withdraw its first understanding concerning discrimination; and (3) the U.S. should modify its domestic laws in order to conform with the international standard. The U.S. should also consider withdrawing those RUDs which merely assert different labels or purport to exclude compliance during times of emergency.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">This section of this Note, on the legal authority of customary international law vis-a-vis federal legislation, has not been included with the purpose of discovering which position is correct. Rather, the overview of this debate holds a central place in this Note because it demonstrates some of the issues at stake as U.S. courts begin to integrate customary international law into what were previously thought of as purely or primarily domestic issues. Admittedly, the number of cases using customary international law in this manner is still few and primarily based on some enabling federal statute. Nonetheless, these decisions take on a greater importance in light of the debate discussed above. Should theorists such as Paust and Lillich prevail, these early cases, taking the first modern steps in the process of identifying and applying customary international law would become crucial precedent in a law-making process that Congress would be powerless to overturn. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">No species has ever dominated its fellow species as man has. In most cases, people have assumed the God-like power of life and death -- extinction or survival -- over the plants and animals of the world. For most of history, mankind pursued this domination with a singleminded determination to master the world, tame the wilderness, and exploit nature for the maximum benefit of the human race. n67 In past mass extinction episodes, as many as ninety percent of the existing species perished, and yet the world moved forward, and new species replaced the old. So why should the world be concerned now? The prime reason is the world's survival. Like all animal life, humans live off of other species. At some point, the number of species could decline to the point at which the ecosystem fails, and then humansalso would become extinct. No one knows how many [*171] species the world needs to support human life, and to find out -- by allowing certain species to become extinct -- would not be sound policy. In addition to food, species offer many direct and indirect benefits to mankind. n68 2. Ecological Value. -- Ecological value is the value that species have in maintaining the environment. Pest, n69 erosion, and flood control are prime benefits certain species provide to man. Plants and animals also provide additional ecological services -- pollution control, n70 oxygen production, sewage treatment, and biodegradation. n71 3. Scientific and Utilitarian Value. -- Scientific value is the use of species for research into the physical processes of the world. n72 Without plants and animals, a large portion of basic scientific research would be impossible. Utilitarian value is the direct utility humans draw from plants and animals. n73 Only a fraction of the [*172] earth's species have been examined, and mankind may someday desperately need the species that it is exterminating today. To accept that the snail darter, harelip sucker, or Dismal Swamp southeastern shrew n74 could save mankind may be difficult for some. Many, if not most, species are useless to man in a direct utilitarian sense. Nonetheless, they may be critical in an indirect role, because their extirpations could affect a directly useful species negatively.In a closely interconnected ecosystem, the loss of a species affects other species dependent on it. n75 Moreover, as the number of species decline, the effect of each new extinction on the remaining species increases dramatically. n76 4. Biological Diversity. -- The main premise of species preservation is that diversity is better than simplicity. n77 As the current mass extinction has progressed, the world's biological diversity generally has decreased. This trend occurs within ecosystems by reducing the number of species, and within species by reducing the number of individuals. Both trends carry serious future implications.Biologically diverse ecosystems are characterized by a large number of specialist species, filling narrow ecological niches. These ecosystems inherently are more stable than less diverse systems. &quot;The more complex the ecosystem, the more successfully it can resist a stress. . . .[l]ike a net, in which each knot is connected to others by several strands, such a fabric can resist collapse better than a simple, unbranched circle of threads -- which if cut anywhere breaks down as a whole.&quot; n79 By causing widespread extinctions, humans have artificially simplified many ecosystems. As biologic simplicity increases, so does the risk of ecosystem failure. The spreading Sahara Desert in Africa, and the dustbowl conditions of the 1930s in the United States are relatively mild examples of what might be expected if this trend continues. Theoretically,each new animal or plant extinction, with all its dimly perceived and intertwined affects, could cause total ecosystem collapse and human extinction. Each new extinction increases the risk of disaster. Like a mechanic removing, one by one, the rivets from an aircraft's wings, [hu]mankind may be edging closer to the abyss.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">As we enter the twenty-first century, the attitude one encounters toward comparative law in the United States might, in some ways, compare with the attitudes that prevailed in France in the first half of the nineteenth century. We recall that a certain paradox existed then. While the French Civil Code was spreading triumphantly across [*1094] Europe and around the world (sometimes manumilitari, other times admiringly received like written reason itself), and becoming perhaps the greatest legal export ever seen, at home, the jurists of France maintained the narrowest, most self-absorbed focus possible. This was the height of l'ecole de l'exegese; France considered itself cut off from the wider world of civil law. One recalls the phrase of Bugnet, an early commentator: &quot;I know nothing of civil law; I only teach the code Napoleon.&quot; To use a trendy word, the code was headed global (even reaching la belle Louisiane) while French jurists only thought local. The land of Montesquieu was oblivious to comparative law. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=205aa6367116ade556dde4e385aae1b5&amp;docnum=1&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkAB&amp;_md5=91b0052552147d6fb3f83048b4c33696&amp;focBudTerms=As%20we%20enter%20the%20twenty-first%20century&amp;focBudSel=all#n2" rel="nofollow">2</a></span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> To my eyes there is a similar phenomenon in the United States, and it is illustrated by the attitude of our judges, legislators, mainstream scholars, and law reformers.

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Africa's judiciaries are emerging</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> at </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">last from decades of powerlessness and marginalization at the hands of omnipotent executives</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> and strongmen. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Constitutional reforms that have accompanied democratic transitions</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> in countries like Benin, Ghana, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">are helping to redefine</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> the role </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">and enhance the stature of the judiciary in</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> the contemporary African state. While past judiciaries served primarily as passive instruments of legitimation for authoritarian regimes, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">today’s African courts,</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> like their counterparts in emerging democracies elsewhere, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">must enforce constitutional limitations on the exercise of governmental power, as well as protect the rights of citizens, the media, and civil society. The idea of judicial review is now</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> enthusiastically </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">embraced in a growing number of African countries. Establishing judicial review is,</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> of course, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the easy part</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">; a clause or two in the national constitution is generally all that is required to bestow such awesome power on the courts. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The challenge is to ensure that judges in newly democratizing states exercise their new power</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> so as </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">to advance and deepen the transition to constitutional democracy</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">. This is indeed a matter of genuine concern, because judicial review, though widely celebrated by democrats and constitutional architects in transitional democracies, is not quite the unmitigated virtue it is frequently made out to be. As Alexander Bickel has reminded us, “</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">judicial review means</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> not only that the Court may strike down a legislative [or executive] action as unconstitutional but also </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">that it may validate it as within constitutionally granted powers and as not violating constitutional limitations.” Because judicial review “performs not only a checking function but</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> also </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">a legitimating function</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">,” it is a double-edged sword. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">If exercised courageously</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> (but prudently) </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">to defend rights or hold the line against abuses of power, it could enhance constitutionalism in transitional democracies. In the hands of weak, insecure, or illiberal judges</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">, however, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">judicial review could easily become an even more formidable instrument for legitimating authoritarianism.</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">Thus Africa’s newly democratizing states must seek to minimize the risk that judicial review will become a curse rather than the blessing it was meant to be. Because it has generally been assumed that the African judiciary’s primary problem to date has been that lack of institutional autonomy and career security for judges, Africa’s contemporary constitutional architects have adopted that standard Hamiltonian solution: judicial independence. Thus </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Africa’s new constitutions all carry the standard provisions designed to secure judges in their jobs, salaries, jurisdiction, and judgments.</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> Judges no longer hold their offices at the sufferance of the executive; judicial salaries and other benefits may not be varied to the judges’ detriment; jurisdiction of the courts may not be diminished at the pleasure of the executive or legislature; and, in general, at least two independent institutions must cooperate in making judicial appointments. In some cases, as in Ghana, the new constitution goes even further by giving the judiciary autonomy in the preparation, administration, and control of its own budget. Except in South Africa and Benin, where newly created “constitutional courts” have been laid over the preexisting judiciary, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Africa’s newly refurbished judiciaries have</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> generally </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">consisted entirely of holdovers from the ancien regime “</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">grandfathered” into the new constitutional arrangement in the name of institutional continuity. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The assumption seems to have been</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> that, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">given a new constitution with a host of rights-friendly provisions, limitations on governmental power, and guarantees of judicial independence, judicial review will lead to a liberal-democratic jurisprudence almost as a matter of course</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">. Yet the evidence that is emerging, especially from the common-law jurisdictions, suggests that there is a significant risk that an asymmetrical jurisprudence will take hold, with the constitutional text contemplating a rights-friendly, liberal-democratic jurisprudence while that actual decisions and reasoning of the courts take a different course. Ghana’s experience under its new constitution is a case in point. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The case of Ghana indicates that reliance on judicial review and formal guarantees of judicial independence as the exclusive mechanisms for liberating African courts from their authoritarian past may be futile,</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> unless such reforms are considered as incidental to the more fundamental question of how to produce a paradigm shift in the jurisprudence of the judges. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">If the constitutions of Africa’s transitional democracies can</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> be said to </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">compel a new jurisprudence of constitutionalism, it</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> also </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">appears that recourse to tradition and longstanding common-law docrine,</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> an ingrained deference to executive diktat, and the forse of </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">stare decisis</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> all </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">propel Africa’s judges back toward a jurisprudence of executive supremacy. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">The trajectory of Africa’s democratic transitions will be adversely altered if Africa’s judiciaries fail to make a contemporaneous transition from the jurisprudence of executive supremacy to the jurisprudence of the constitutionalism.</span></span></span><br />

<em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Nairobi — As world attention remains riveted on the US political campaigns and their implications for the Obama presidency, many may forget that in Africa there will be major tests for democracy this year. Among the most critical political events on the continent will be a referendum in Darfur that is expected to pave the way for the self-determination of the people of that troubled Sudanese region. In the wake of the emergence of independence for South Sudan, what happens in Darfur will be of great significance for East Africa, and Africa as a whole. Ravaged by war for many years, Darfur has been one of the major hotspots on the African continent. Tellingly, it was the allegedly genocidal violence in Darfur that resulted in the issuing of a warrant of arrest for Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir by the International Criminal Court. Also of great significance this year will be developments in Libya and Egypt, the counties in Africa in which, together with Morocco, the so-called Arab uprising has had a major impact. While in Egypt there will be elections for the Shura Council expected to steer the country's political future, in post-Gaddafi Libya there will be the Public National Conference election expected to put paid to the uncertainties currently facing the troubled country. Other countries holding either presidential or parliamentary elections this year include Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Togo and Sierra Leone. Also expected to hold polls before the year ends are Algeria, Angola, Burkina Faso and Madagascar. Regarding Senegal, the usually stable West African state has already set a blistering pace for the rest of Africa. As the worrying political situation unfolds in that country, amidst mounting pre-election violence that has already claimed some lives, there is cause for concern about the future of democracy in Africa.</span></em><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The common root cause of economic decay, state collapse, ethnic violence, civil war, and humanitarian disaster in Africa is bad</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">, abusive </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">governance. Because most states lack any semblance of a rule of law and norms of accountability that bind the conduct of those in government, their societies have fallen prey to massive corruption, nepotism, and the personal whims of a tiny ruling elite. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">In such circumstances, every political clique and ethnic group struggles for control of a stagnant or diminishing stock of wealth. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">There are no institutions to facilitate trust, cooperation, or confidence in the future. Every competing faction tries to grab what it can for the moment while excluding other groups</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">. THE SOLUTION</span></span></span><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The only real antidote to this decay is a constitutional framework that facilitates the limitation, separation, devolution, and sharing of power so that each group can have a stake in the system while checking the ruling elite</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> and one another. In essence, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">this means a democratic political system</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">, to one degree or another. Given Africa’s authoritarian history, many changes in beliefs and institutions will be necessary for democracy to emerge.</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> A growing segment of African elites and the public realize that every type of dictatorship on the continent has been a disaster</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">. Thus, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">there is increasing hunger for economic and political freedom and the predictability of a democratic constitution. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">As Hoover Institution senior fellow Barry Weingast pointed out in the American Political Science Review, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">ethnic groups will not trust and tolerate one another and cooperate for a larger national good unless there are credible limits on the state. Democracy cannot be stable unless rulers see that it is in their interest to abide by the rules. What makes it in their interest is the</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> overriding </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">commitment of all major ethnic groups, parties, and interest organizations to a constitution.</span></span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">The Rabid Tiger Project believes that a </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">nuclear war is most likely to start in Africa. Civil wars in the Congo</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> (the country formerly known as Zaire), </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Rwanda, Somalia and Sierra Leone, and domestic instability in Zimbabwe, Sudan and other countries, as well as occasional brushfire and other wars</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> (thanks in part to &quot;national&quot; borders that cut across tribal ones)</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">turn into a really nasty stew. We've got all too many rabid tigers and potential rabid tigers, who are willing to push the button rather than risk being seen as wishy-washy in the face of a mortal threat and overthrown. Geopolitically speaking, Africa is open range. Very few countries</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> in Africa </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">are beholden to any particular power</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">. South Africa is a major exception in this respect - not to mention in that she also probably already has the Bomb. Thus, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">outside powers can more easily find client states there than, say, in Europe where the political lines have long since been drawn, or Asia where many of the countries</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;"> (China, India, Japan) </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">are powers unto themselves and don't need any &quot;help,&quot; thank you. Thus, an African war can attract outside involvement very quickly. Of course, a proxy war alone may not induce the Great Powers to fight each other. But an African nuclear strike can ignite a much broader conflagration, if the other powers are interested in a fight</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">. Certainly, such a strike would in the first place have been facilitated by outside help - financial, scientific, engineering, etc. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Africa is an ocean of troubled waters, and some people love to go fishing</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt;">. Asia is a close second, due to the competition of major powers. For example, in an Indo-Paki confrontation, China may be tempted to side with Pakistan, since China and India are major nuclear powers sharing a long border. However, the Asian powers are basically stable internally, at least for now. The things to watch for are domestic economic and political instability in a nuclear power, the spread of nuclear weapons to new countries and new national antagonisms and great-power ties either weak or nonexistent enough to enable opportunistic alliances and destabilization, or strong enough that the great powers feel compelled to follow their client states.</span></span></span><br />

<em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">While the fundamental ideas are not novel, the expanded context of their application to peremptory norms of international law is new. Giving effect to peremptory norms as limiting sovereignty even in relation to domestic law presents a challenge to the role of domestic courts. The issues will vary from state to state according to their constitutional provisions and their traditional approaches to giving effect to customary international law in their courts. The substantive implications can, however, be seen in examining the U.S. context, recognizing that the specific issues involved in this context may be relevant in varying degrees in other states. In the U.S. the tradition of an independent judiciary was laid down by Chief Justice Marshall in Marbury v. Madison: &quot;It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply this rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.&quot; </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://livepage.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">174</a></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">For an independent judiciary anywhere, it is the duty of courts to declare and apply the governing law.

It would be something quite different for an Act of Congress to attempt to instruct an independent judiciary to ignore some part of applicable international law binding on the United States in the decision of cases within its jurisdiction. It seems unlikely that the United States would attempt to take advantage of the &quot;Exceptions&quot; clause of the U.S. Constitution to restrict broadly the authority of U.S. courts to provide a remedy to persons having justiciable causes of action based on violations of peremptory norms of international law by the United States. The United States, by becoming a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has expressly undertaken to &quot;ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.&quot; </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://livepage.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">184</a></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Presumably this commitment would be [*492] honored even though the Senate's ratification was made subject to a &quot;declaration&quot; that this and other provisions of Articles 1-27 &quot;are not self-executing.&quot; </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://livepage.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">185</a></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The challenge to the role of an independent judiciary will come, if at all, not in conforming to the U.S. Constitution nor in cases that are excluded from the court's jurisdiction by an act of Congress, but in acting as a court of law where some provision that purports to be domestic law is in conflict with a peremptory norm of international law. Giving effect to peremptory norms as domestic law does not itself give rise to any such conflict. As noted above, three federal courts of appeal have given recognition to the concept of peremptory norms from which no derogation is permitted. Given the general rule that international law is a part of U.S. law, there is no reason why peremptory norms should not be enforceable in U.S. courts. The kind of apparent conflict most likely to arise for U.S. courts may also not in fact present a testing issue. A perceived conflict may arise where the United States ratifies a convention that affirms rights recognized as binding customary international law and, as has been the Senate's wont in ratifying human rights conventions, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://livepage.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">186</a></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> the ratification is made with the declaration that the convention shall not be given effect as self-executing, that is, shall be effective as U.S. law only as made so by enactment of separate legislation. If a norm is already binding as customary international law, it could be said that in giving effect as U.S. law to the customary law norm, U.S. courts would not be giving effect to the [*493] treaty itself as domestic law. The perceived perils of legislation by treaty would not be involved. The general rule of construction would, indeed, call for construing the declaration in a way to avoid a conflict with international law. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://livepage.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">187</a></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The true testing case would be one where a state attempts to block or undo the application of a peremptory norm of international law as domestic law.

For example wealth, wealth in African American communities is almost zero. The history is striking. You take a look at the history of African Americans in the US. There’s been about thirty years of relative freedom. There was a decade after the Civil War and before north/south compact essentially recriminalized black life. During the Second World War there was a need for free labor so there was a freeing up of the labor force. Blacks benefitted from it. It lasted for about twenty years, the big growth period in the ‘50s and ‘60s, so a black man could get a job in an auto plant and buy a house and send his kids to college and kind of enter into the world but by the 70s it was over. With the radical shift in the economy, basically the workforce, which is partly white but also largely black, they basically became superfluous. Look what happened, we recriminalized black life. Incarceration rates since the 1980s have gone through the roof, overwhelmingly black males, women and Hispanics to some extent. Essentially re-doing what happened under Reconstruction. That’s the history of African Americans – so how can any one say there’s no problem. Sure, racism is serious, but it’s worse than that…</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The U.S. legal standard requiring that victims of discrimination prove “intent” to discriminate as a condition to getting a remedy is a major barrier to addressing racial inequality in general and meeting CERD obligations in particular. Such a requirement is contrary to the framework of CERD and does not reflect the real-world operation of discriminatory behavior in contemporary American society. As recognized by CERD, discrimination can be the product of facially race neutral polices and practices as well as an unintended consequence of individual action. Racial discrimination is often the unintentional, but predictable consequence of public or private action. The Convention defines racial discrimination (Art. 1, ¶1) to mean distinctions, exclusions, restrictions or preferences based on race which have “the purpose or effect” of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any field of public life. Although the CERD definition recognizes purposeful discrimination, racially disparate outcomes and effects are of equal concern. Contrary to CERD, plaintiffs alleging racial discrimination in U.S. courts must prove that the defendant was motivated by racial animus, and that this discriminatory intent was the cause of plaintiff’s harm. It is not that the text of pertinent Constitutional or statutory provisions preclude a reading that accounts for unjustifiable racial impacts. Instead, U.S. courts have increasingly interpreted these provisions narrowly, especially with respect to racial discrimination. In 1976, the U.S Supreme Court, reviewing an Equal Protection Clause claim, limited the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection against discrimination by announcing the “intent doctrine.” Under this doctrine, a plaintiff who alleges discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause must prove that the discriminating actor or agency “selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable racial group.” This requirement of intent to discriminate in spite of predictable, adverse effects upon an identifiable group is inconsistent with the paradigm envisioned in CERD and effectively bars most discrimination plaintiffs from pursuing Equal Protection claims. One of the most significant and tragic applications of this doctrine is highlighted by a landmark study filed with the United States Supreme Court in McCleskey v. Kemp. The study showed that prosecutors seek the death penalty in 70 percent of cases involving Black defendants and White victims, yet only in 19 percent of cases involving White defendants and Black victims. Further, White victim cases are 11 times more likely to result in death sentences than Black victim cases. Despite this evidence, the Supreme Court held that the state's capital sentencing process was not administered in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Equal Protection Clause because a mere correlation between the racial characteristics and the application of the death penalty did not prove that the application of the death penalty to the McCleskey was motivated by racial prejudice. The intent doctrine makes incorrect assumptions about how people behave and make decisions. This constricted “intent doctrine” permeates U.S. antidiscrimination law, ignores much of what we know about the dynamics of discrimination, and deprives many of redress for discrimination. The extraordinarily high burden almost requires a civil rights plaintiff to find a “smoking gun” statement expressing outward racial animus. Aside from the obvious problems inherent in requiring a private plaintiff to offer proof of a government actor or agency’s unspoken motivations, the futility of the intent doctrine stems from a fundamental misconception about how discrimination operates. Although social psychologists of the mid-twentieth century believed discrimination resulted from the discriminator’s conscious motivation (“intent”), modern social science has greatly expanded our understanding of discrimination and how it infiltrates interpersonal, intergroup, and structural relationships. In recent years, social science research has shown that we all have subconscious or implicit biases—beliefs, attitudes, and expectations that are based on stereotypes about the race, gender, age, or other group to which an individual belongs. Though most of us are completely unaware of their influence on our subconscious, these biases affect how we perceive, interpret, and understand others’ actions. Because these attitudes—unrecognized on the conscious level but powerful at the subconscious level—influence choices and decisions, individual and institutional discrimination can occur even in the absence of blatant prejudice, ill will, or animus. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">For analysts like Robert Bullard, the curtailment of African American mobilities, and attendant possibilities for white mobilities, have long been evident in U.S. transportation policies, typically being absorbed into practice through the unconscious assumptions of white privilege. ‘White racism’, Bullard (2004b, p. 20) asserts, ‘shapes transportation and transport-related decisions’, and produces actions that ‘den[y] many black Americans and other people of color the benefits, freedoms, opportunities, and rewards offered to white Americans’. At all levels of government in the United States, legislation has determined the manner in which non-white individuals can move, which spaces they can access, and where they can live. Yet, despite a history of restraints on non-white movement, mobility is arguably the defining feature of African American geographies. From the transportation and sale of slaves for over three hundred years, to the migrations of African Americans from the rural south to the industrial urban north in the twentieth century, the movement of African Americans has shaped the United States in myriad ways. These mobile ‘black geographies’, however, almost always occurred in the context of the power of whites to allow or deny African American mobility. The multiple spaces and varied practices of slavery produced ‘a geography of discipline and confinement’, that resulted in, ‘for most slaves, extremely limited mobility’ (Delaney, 1998 p. 35). When slaves did move, as I explore in the Dred Scott (1857) case, they typically did so at the behest of an owner who could transport them through the patchwork of free and slave territories in the United States. Following emancipation, the mobility of African Americans was transformed and individuals such as Josephine De Cuir, whose 1877 Supreme Court case I assess, believed in their right to travel without restriction; a right that whites often sought to deny. During the postbellum era, the visibility to whites of a mobile African American population led to numerous legal actions prior to the 1896 Plessy v Ferguson case which ushered in the formalization of racial segregation and transformed the spatial practices of slavery into the white supremacist practices of territorial control which epitomized the Jim Crow era. These practices attempted, among other things, to secure a labor force in the rural southern states by creating conditions of ‘actual or virtual immobility’ for African Americans (Goluboff, 2003, p. 1981), and controlled how people like Irene Morgan, plaintiff in the 1946 case I review, used public transportation up to and immediately after WW2. Mobility in the United States has more often than not, I contend, been at the behest of white Americans. American space was, and arguably still is, racialized as hegemonically white, and the ability to be freely mobile is intertwined with the social construction of white racial identities (cf. Ignatiev, 1995; Jacobson, 1998; Roediger, 1999). It was, for example, white settlers that were free to move westward, the mobile nomadic lifestyles of the peoples they encountered being understood as primitive and 334 E. Hague inferior. Native Americans subsequently became immobilized on reservations. Similarly, African American slaves were immobilized on plantations and movement away from plantation space was illicit, codified as illegal, and required the networks of the Underground Railroad (cf. McKittrick, 2007). An African American moving through white American spaces faced often deadly consequences. African Americans should, in the parlance of the times, ‘know their place’ and not have the ambition, or in many instances the legal right, to move freely around the USA. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">What in fact is racism? It is primarily a way of introducing a break into the domain of life that is under power's control: the break between what must live and what must die. The appearance within the biological continuum of the human race of races, the distinction among races, the hierarchy of races, the fact that certain races are described as good and that others, in contrast, are described as inferior: all this is a way of fragmenting the field of the biological that power controls. It is a way of separating out the groups that exist within a population. It is, in short, a way of establishing a biological type caesura within a population that appears to be a biological domain. This will allow power to treat that population as a mixture of races, or to be more accurate, to treat the species, to subdivide the species it controls, into the subspecies known, precisely, as races. That is the first function of racism: to fragment, to create caesuras within the biological continuum addressed by biopower. Racism also has a second function. Its role is, if you like, to allow the establishment of a positive relation of this type: &quot;The more you kill, the more deaths you will cause&quot; or &quot;The very fact that you let more die will allow you to live more.&quot; I would say that this relation (&quot;If you want to live, you must take lives, you must be able to kill&quot;) was not invented by either racism or the modern State. It is the relationship of war: &quot;In order to live, you must destroy your enemies.&quot; But racism does make the relationship of war-&quot;If you want to live, the other must die&quot; - function in a way that is completely new and that is quite compatible with the exercise of biopower. On the one hand, racism makes it possible to establish a relationship between my life and the death of the other that is not a military or warlike relationship of confrontation, but a biological-type relationship: &quot;The more inferior species die out, the more abnormal individuals are eliminated, the fewer degenerates there will be in the species as a whole, and the more Ias species rather than individual-can live, the stronger I will be, the more vigorous I will be. I will be able to proliferate.&quot; The fact that the other dies does not mean simply that I live in the sense that his death guarantees my safety; the death of the other, the death of the bad race, of the inferior race (or the degenerate, or the abnormal) is something that will make life in general healthier: healthier and purer. This is not, then, a military, warlike, or political relationship, but a biological relationship. And the reason this mechanism can come into play is that the enemies who have to be done away with are not adversaries in the political sense of the term; they are threats, either external or internal, to the population and for the population. In the biopower system, in other words, killing or the imperative to kill is acceptable only if it results not in a victory over political adversaries, but in the elimination of the biological threat to and the improvement of the species or race. There is a direct connection between the two. In a normalizing society, race or racism is the precondition that makes killing acceptable. When you have a normalizing society, you have a power which is, at least superficially, in the first instance, or in the first line a biopower, and racism is the indispensable precondition that allows someone to be killed, that allows others to be killed. Once the State functions in the biopower mode, racism alone can justify the murderous function of the State. So you can understand the importance-I almost said the vital importance-of racism to the exercise of such a power: it is the precondition for exercising the right to kill. If the power of normalization wished to exercise the old sovereign right to kill, it must become racist. And if, conversely, a power of sovereignty, or in other words, a power that has the right of life and death, wishes to work with the instruments, mechanisms, and technology of normalization, it too must become racist. When I say &quot;killing,&quot; I obviously do not mean simply murder as such, but also every form of indirect murder: the fact of exposing someone to death, increasing the risk of death for some people, or, quite simply, political death, expulsion, rejection, and so on. I think that we are now in a position to understand a number of things. We can understand, first of all, the link that was quickly-I almost said immediately-established between nineteenth-century biological theory and the discourse of power. Basically, evolutionism, understood in the broad sense-or in other words, not so much Darwin's theory itself as a set, a bundle, of notions (such as: the hierarchy of species that grow from a common evolutionary tree, the struggle for existence among species, the selection that eliminates the less fit) naturally became within a few years during the nineteenth century not simply a way of transcribing a political discourse into biological terms, and not simply a way of dressing up a political discourse in scientific clothing, but a real way of thinking about the relations between colonization, the necessity for wars, criminality, the phenomena of madness and mental illness, the history of societies with their different classes, and so on. Whenever, in other words, there was a confrontation, a killing or the risk of death, the nineteenth century was quite literally obliged to think about them in the form of evolutionism. And we can also understand why racism should have developed in modern societies that function in the biopower mode; we can understand why racism broke out at a number of .privileged moments, and why they were precisely the moments when the right to take life was imperative. Racism first develops with colonization, or in other words, with colonizing genocide. If you are functioning in the biopower mode, how can you justify the need to kill people, to kill populations, and to kill civilizations? By using the themes of evolutionism, by appealing to a racism. War. How can one not only wage war on one's adversaries but also expose one's own citizens to war, and let them be killed by the million (and this is precisely what has been going on since the nineteenth century, or since the second half of the nineteenth century), except by activating the theme of racism? From this point onward, war is about two things: it is not simply a matter of destroying a political adversary, but of destroying the enemy race, of destroying that [sort] of biological threat that those people over there represent to our race. In one sense, this is of course no more than a biological extrapolation from the theme of the political enemy. But there is more to it than that. In the nineteenth century-and this is completely new-war will be seen not only as a way of improving one's own race by eliminating the enemy race (in accordance with the themes of natural selection and the struggle for existence), but also as a way of regenerating one's own race. As more and more of our number die, the race to which we belong will become all the purer. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The current U.S. transportation infrastructure focuses on motor vehicle travel and provides limited support for other transportation options for most Americans. Physical activity and active transportation have declined compared to previous generations. The lack of physical activity is a major contributor to the steady rise in rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and other chronic health conditions in the United States. Motor vehicle crashes continue to be the leading cause of injury-related death for many age groups. Pedestrians and bicyclists are at an even greater risk of death from crashes than those who travel by motor vehicles. Many Americans view walking and bicycling within their communities as unsafe because of traffic and the lack of sidewalks, crosswalks, and bicycle facilities. Although using public transportation has historically been safer than highway travel in light duty vehicles, highway travel has grown more quickly than other modes of travel. A lack of efficient alternatives to automobile travel disproportionately affects vulnerable populations such as the poor, the elderly, people who have disabilities and children by limiting access to jobs, health care, social interaction, and healthy foods. Although motor vehicle emissions have decreased significantly over the past three decades, air pollution from motor vehicles continues to contribute to the degradation of our environment and adverse respiratory and cardiovascular health effects. Transportation accounts for approximately one-third of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. </span><br />

Various transport and land use factors affect the amount of active transportation that occurs in a community.7 These are summarized below. These tend to have synergistic effects (their total impacts are greater than the sum of their individual impacts), so an integrated program that combines several strategies tends to be more effective at increasing active transportation than implementing just one or two of these strategies.

It may also mean that certain individuals with power are able to anaesthetize the populace into believing their authority is indispensable and that life is easier by abdicating responsibility to them. The ruled are instilled with the notion that the government knows best; it is the most efficient vehicle for providing services to the community, while the ordinary folks are neither qualified nor capable. Like any successful institution, government also prospers by inculcating its necessity in the populace. Once power has been accumulated into a few hands it is more difficult to get rid of it. It has a savage appetite and habit of a cancer, ever expanding and enlarging. As we have suggested elsewhere in this essay there has been, over the decades, a gradual erosion of self-help and voluntary co-operative institutions in our society, an erosion which has favoured an increasing encroachment of government into the lives of all. This is not only to be criticized as a threat to liberty, but it is equally a threat to the everyday practice of voluntary co-operation, of self-reliance and mutual aid between ‘natural’ groups in society. <br />

<span style="color: #000001;">The future of our planet and our continued evolution are under grave threat. Important social r/evolutionary choices must be made. The nation-state has not been particularly successful in solving the enormous social and environmental problems we as a species collectively face. Governments have not solved the problems of violence and war. Indeed until quite recently the Russian and American. governments were threatening to blow one another up with nuclear missiles and probably destroy the entire eco­system of the planet in the process. (Destruction of the earth is the least desirable evolutionary development imaginable). Governments have consistently failed to preserve the integrity of our soils and forests. The imperialist empires of the last few centuries, for example the most extensive form of state/government exploitation/ domination yet known to our species inflicted irreparable environmental damage not merely upon particular ecological regions, but upon entire continents. The introduction of new animals ill-suited to the prevailing ecology and the exploitation of local bio-resources – fertile lands, forests, game, etc. –to provide raw materials for the short term benefit of distant imperial-states has resulted in huge tracts of land being turned into pitiful deserts. The human species, if it is to survive, must stop blindly placing its faith in government and state. Change and the continued evolution of our species can no longer be left in the hands of official bumbledom. Only the people at the level of the individual household, community or factory can initiate the socialist-ecologist r/evolution of the future. The state has always been a mechanism which supports the rich and powerful, who, far from being interested in the future of our species and our planet, are interested only in their own self-aggrandizement. A social and political organistion lasts as long as the people are willing to abide it. Within reason, any social system, no matter how vicious, destructive or stupid (apartheid or Nazism for example), is workable in the short term if enough people believe in it. But if enough people are convinced of the desirability of organizing society on a non-governmental basis, then anarchism, as an organized social force, becomes a realizable social-evolutionary choice every bit as practical as the centralized government and the nation-state. </span><br />

<span style="color: #010001; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In our hierarchiacal system, we’re all so busy trying to pretect ourselves from each other that we never have a chance to stop and ask if this is really the best way our society could be organized. I we could think about it, we’d probably agree that it isn’t; for we all know happiness comes from control over our own lives, not other people’s lives. And as long as we’re busy competing for control over others, we’re bound to be the victims of control ourselves. It is our hierarchical system that teaches us from childhood to accept that power of any authority figure, regardless of whether it is in our best interest or not. We learn to bow instinctively before anyone who claims to be more important than we are. It is hierarchy that makes homophobia common among pooer people in the U.S.A. they’re desperatre to feel more valuable, more significant than somebody. It is hierarchy at work when two hundred punk rockers go to a rock club (already a mistake, of course!) to see a band, and for some stupid reason the clubowner won’t let them perform there are two hundred and six epeople at the club, two hundred and five of whom want the band to play, but they all accept the decision of the clubownwer because he is older and owns the place (i.e. has more financial power, and thus more legal power) it is hierarchical values that are responsible for racism, classism, sexism, and a thousand other prejudices that are deeply ingrained in our society. It is hierarchy that makes rich people look at poor people as if they aren’t even human and vice versa. It pits employer against employee, manager against worker, teacher against student, making people struggle against each other rather than work together in mutual aid; sperated this way, they can’t benefit from each other’s skills and ideas and abilities, but must live in jealousy and fear of them. It is hierarchy at work when your buss insults you and makes sexual advances at you and ou can’t do anything about it, just as it is when plolice flaunt their power over you. For power does make people cruel and heartless, and submission does make people cowardly and stupid: and most peole in a hierarchical system partake in both. Hierarchical values are responsible for our destruction of the natural environment and the exploitation of animals led by the capitalist West, our species seeks control over anything we can get our claws on, at any cost to ourselves or others. And it is hierarchical values that send us to war, fighting for power over each other, inventing more and more powerful weapons until finally the whole world teeters on the edge of nuclear annihilation.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">An obligation to play the game is elemental to the functioning of any anarchic polity. And, of course, it is readily enforced by fear of diffuse and religious sanctions. Nevertheless, those who are used to living in a society governed by policemen and legal sanctions often fail to appreciate the significance of the sense of obligation to play the game as a motivating force for social order even within their own society. We must not forget that in all human societies most members chose to follow the rules because they want to and because they believe in them. They would resist any attempt to lead them into non-conformity. In any society, sanctions of whatever kind are for the tiny minority. Were all law enforcement to be removed tomorrow there would probably be an initial burst of crime, but after the novelty wore off it would dissipate. At the same time, the vast majority would not be involved, but would go about its business as usual. To hold, as some apparently do, that were the law to be removed there would occur some momentous explosion of brutish and murderous behaviours among all the populace, is, in the first place, grossly to overestimate the present power of the police. More importantly it is grossly to underestimate the years of conditioning about right and wrong to which all have been exposed and the power of the internalized censor or conscience. In those cases where traditional techniques for social control have been removed suddenly or greatly relaxed two consequences are noteworthy. One is the extent to which voluntary mutual aid spontaneously appears and spreads – people begin helping each other. The other consequence is the opposite response the one the law and order supporters would predict. That is, there is rioting, looting and mayhem. But the reason for this reaction is not because there is no police to keep order. The reasons are suggested by the kinds of people who engage in such behaviour. There people are definitely not the members of society who have prospered from it, nor are they the ones in positions of prestige, power and influence. On the contrary, they are always from the ranks of the disadvantaged and frustrated. And the revolt which is what it is an attempt at catharsis, to relieve pent up aggression and hostility generated by a system perceived to be oppressive (whether it is ‘in fact’ oppressive is beside the point; it is seen to be such and that is what counts). </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Every revolutionary epoch, moreover, not only brings together apparently separate processes but also converges them on a specific locus in time and space where the social crisis is most acute. In the seventeenth century this center was England; in the eighteenth and nineteenth, France; in the early twentieth, Russia. The center of the social crisis in the late twentieth century is the United States an industrial colossus that produces more than half of the world’s goods and with little more than five percent of the world’s population. Here is the Rome of world capitalism, the keystone of its imperial arch, the workshop and marketplace of its commodities, the den of its financial wizardry, the temple of its culture, and the armory of its weapons. Here too, is the center of the world counter-revolution and the center of the social revolution that can overthrow hierarchical society as a world historical system. To ignore the strategic position of the United States, both historically and internationally, would reveal an incredible insensitivity to reality. To fail to draw all the implications of this strategic position and act upon them accordingly would be negligence of criminal proportions. The states are too great to allow for obscurantism. America, it must be emphasized, occupies the most advanced social terrain in the world. America, more than any other country, is pregnant with the most important social crisis in history. Every issue that bears on the abolition of hierarchical society and on the construction of utopia is more apparent here than elsewhere. Here lie the resources to annul and transcend what Marx called the “prehistory” of humanity. Here, too, are the contradictions that produce the most advanced form of revolutionary struggle. The decay of the American institutional structure results not from any mystical “failure of nerve” or from imperialist adventures in the Third World, but primarily from the over ripeness of America’s technological potential. Like hanging fruit whose seeds have matured fully, the structure may fall at the lightest blow. The blow may come from the Third World, from major economic dislocations, even from premature political repression, but fall the structure must, owing to its ripeness and decay.</span><br />

From the moment we are born – separated from our mothers, gendered male or female, weighed, measured, named, allocated the special space of a cot and monitored at regular intervals – we are subjected to and made subjects through myriad practices involving the operation of power and the production of knowledge. The procedures of inscription which bring individuals into effect and objectivise bodies in specific ways – as healthy or ill, learned or illiterate, political or passive, law abiding or deviant, mobile or stationary – simultaneously enable the aggregation of those singular histories into knowledge of populations where norms, the limits to normal, and deviations from the norm are constituted (Foucault 1977, 1982). An important point here is that these are not necessary ways of knowing individuals. Rather, conditions at different moments enable objectification of bodies in new ways. With this knowledge, individuals are worked upon through systems of punishment and reward to regulate themselves according to the norm while those found wanting – disruptive, abnormal – might be removed altogether. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Travel is but one domain in which bodies have been objectivised and subjectivised3; separated, scrutinised and worked upon and, in the case of cycleways, removed altogether.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Consider again the contrastive terms in which it is possible to view biopolitics and sovereignty. The final chapter in the first volume of the History of Sexuality that contrasts sovereignty and biopolitics is titled &quot;Right of Death and Power over Life.&quot; The initial terms of the contrast between the two registers of government is thus between one that could employ power to put subjects to death, even if this right to kill was conditioned by the defense of the sovereign, and one that was concerned with the fostering of life. Nevertheless, each part of the contrast can be further broken down. The right of death can also be understood as &quot;the right to take life or let live&quot;; the power over life as the power &quot;to foster life or disallow it.&quot; Sovereign power is a power that distinguishes between political life (bios) and mere existence or bare life (zoe). Bare life is included in the constitution of sovereign power by Its very exclusion from political life. In contrast, biopolitics might be thought to include zoe in bios: stripped down mere existence becomes a matter of political reality. Thus, the contrast between biopolitics and sovereignty is not one of a power of life versus a power of death but concerns the way the different forms of power treat matters of life and death and entail different conceptions of life. Thus, biopolitics reinscribes the earlier right of death and power over life and places it within a new and different form that attempts to include what had earlier been sacred and taboo, bare life, in political existence. It is no longer so much the right of the sovereign to put to death his enemies but to disqualify the life—the mere existence—of those who are a threat to the life of the population, to disallow those deemed &quot;unworthy of life,&quot; those whose bare life is not worth living. This allows us, first, to consider what might be thought of as the dark side of biopolitics (Foucault 1979a: 136—37). In Foucault's account, biopolitics does not put an end to the practice of war: it provides it with new and more sophisticated killing machines. These machines allow killing itself to be reposed at the level of entire populations. Wars become genocidal in the twentieth century. The same state that takes on the duty to enhance the life of the population also exercises the power of death over whole populations. Atomic weapons are the key weapons of this process of the power to put whole populations to death. We might also consider here the aptly named biological and chemical weapons that seek an extermination of populations by visiting plagues upon them or polluting the biosphere in which they live to the point at which bare life is no longer sustainable. Nor does the birth of biopolitics put an end to the killing of one's own populations. Rather, it intensifies that killing—whether by an &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; that visits holocausts upon whole groups or by the mass slaughters of classes and groups conducted in the name of the Utopia to be achieved. There is a certain restraint in sovereign power. The right of death is only occasionally exercised as the right to kill and then often in a ritual fashion that suggests a relation to the sacred. More often, sovereign power is manifest in the refraining from the right to kill. The biopolitical imperative knows no such restraint. Power is exercised at the level of populations and hence wars will be waged at that level, on behalf of everyone and their lives. This point brings us to the heart of Foucault's provocative thesis about biopolitics: that there is an intimate connection between the exercise of a life-administering power and the commission of genocide: &quot;If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill: it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population&quot; (1979a: 137). Foucault completes this same passage with an expression that deserves more notice: &quot;massacres become vital.&quot; There is thus a kind of perverse homogeneity between the power over life and the power to take life characteristic of biopower. The emergence of a biopolitical racism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries can be approached as a trajectory in which this homogeneity always threatened to tip over into a dreadful necessity. This racism can be approached as a fundamental mechanism of power that is inscribed in the biopolitical domain (Stoler 1995: 84—85). For Foucault, the primary function of this form of racism is to establish a division between those who must live and those who must die, and to distinguish the superior from the inferior, the fit from the unfit. The notion and techniques of population had given rise, at the end of the nineteenth century, to a new linkage among population, the internal organization of states, and the competition between states. Darwinism, as an imperial social and political program, would plot the ranking of individuals, populations, and nations along the common gradient of fitness and thus measure eflicienqp6 However, the series &quot;population, evolution, and race&quot; is not simply a way of thinking about the superiority of the &quot;white races&quot; or of justifying colonialism, but also of thinking about how to treat the degenerates and the abnormals in one's own population and prevent the further degeneration of the race. The second and most important function for Foucault of this biopolitical racism in the nineteenth century is that &quot;it establishes a positive relation between the right to kill and the assurance of life&quot; (Stoler 1995: 84). The life of the population, its vigor, its health, its capacities to survive, becomes necessarily linked to the elimination of internal and external threats. This power to disallow life is perhaps best encapsulated in the injunctions of the eugenic project: identify those who are degenerate, abnormal, feeble*minded, or of an inferior race and subject them to forced sterilization: encourage those who are superior, fit, and intelligent to propagate. Identify those whose life is but mere existence and disqualify their propagation: encourage those who can partake of a sovereign existence and of moral and political life. But this last example does not necessarily establish a positive justification for the right to kill, only the right to disallow life. If we are to begin to understand the type of racism engaged in by Nazism, however, we need to take into account another kind of denouement between the biopolitical management of population and the exercise of sovereignty. This version of sovereignty is no longer the transformed and democratized form founded on the liberty of the juridical subject, as it is for liberalism, but a sovereignty that takes up and transforms a further element of sovereignty, its &quot;symbolics of blood&quot; (Foucault 1979a: 148). For Foucault, sovereignty is grounded in blood—as a reality and as a symbol—just as one might say that sexuality becomes the key field on which biopolitical management of populations is articulated. When power is exercised through repression and deduction, through a law over which hangs the sword, when it is exercised on the scaffold by the torturer and the executioner, and when relations between households and families were forged through alliance, &quot;blood was a reality with a symbolic function.&quot; By contrast, for biopolitics with its themes of health, vigor, fitness, vitality, progeny, survival, and race, &quot;power spoke of sexuality and to sexuality&quot; (Foucault 1979a: 147). For Foucault (1979a: 149—50), the novelty of National Socialism was the way it articulated &quot;the oneiric exaltation of blood,&quot; of fatherland, and of the triumph of the race in an immensely cynical and naive fashion, with the paroxysms of a disciplinary and biopolitical power concerned with the detailed administration of the life of the population and the regulation of sexuality, family, marriage, and education.'Nazism generalized biopower without the limit-critique posed by the juridical subject of right, but it could not do away with sovereignty. Instead, it established a set of permanent interventions into the conduct of the individual within the population and articulated this with the &quot;mythical concern for blood and the triumph of the race.&quot; Thus, the shepherd-flock game and the city-citizen game are transmuted into the eugenic ordering of biological existence (of mere living and subsistence) and articulated on the themes of the purity of blood and the myth of the fatherland. In such an articulation of these elements of sovereign and biopolitical forms of power, the relation between the administration of life and the right to kill entire populations is no longer simply one of a dreadful homogeneity. It has become a necessary relation. The administration of life comes to require a bloodbath. It is not simply that power, and therefore war, will be exercised at the level of an entire population. It is that the act of disqualifying the right to life of other races becomes necessary for the fostering of the life of the race. Moreover, the elimination of other races is only one face of the purification of one's own race (Foucault 1997b: 231). The other part is to expose the latter to a universal and absolute danger, to expose it to the risk of death and total destruction. For Foucault, with the Nazi state we have an &quot;absolutely racist state, an absolutely murderous state and an absolutely suicidal state&quot; (232), all of which are superimposed and converge on the Final Solution. With the Final Solution, the state tries to eliminate, through the Jews, all the other races, for whom the Jews were the symbol and the manifestation. This includes, in one of Hitler's last acts, the order to destroy the bases of bare life for the German people itself &quot;Final Solution for other races, the absolute suicide of the German race&quot; is inscribed, according to Foucault. in the functioning of the modern state (232).</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Instead of staying within the problem/solution mindset of biopolitical control, we must look for particular instances within which we might instead question the underlying power/knowledge relations that presuppose these methods of policy and academic thought.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">First, intellectuals are of course not as separate from political and social structures as might seem to be the case. Antonio Gramsci addresses the question of whether intellectuals are ‘an autonomous and independent social group’ (Gramsci 1971: 5) as they so often appear. He argues against looking for criteria that distinguish intel- lectuals as such ‘in the intrinsic nature of intellectual activities, rather than in the ensemble of the system of relations in which these activities (and therefore the intel- lectual groups who personify them) have their place within the general complex of social relations’ (Gramsci 1971: 8). We should focus not on what defines ‘an intel- lectual’ but rather on what categories are historically made available for intellectual activity and how struggles for dominance between different groups or classes can be conceived in these terms. He distinguishes ‘traditional intellectuals,’ on the one hand, who have an apparent neutrality and absence of class-belongingness, but whose status and authority derives from their historical position and whose role is as ‘the dominant group’s ‘deputies’, exercising the … functions of social hegemony and political government’ (Gramsci 1971: 12) and ‘organic intellectuals,’ on the other, who are part of a subaltern group or class that is engaged in a struggle for dominance. ‘Traditional intellectuals’ are those who are commonly recognised as intellectuals: academics, writers, scientists and so on. ‘Organic intellectuals,’ on the other hand, though not recognisable as intellectuals, articulate the ‘new modes of thought’ (Gramsci 1971: 9) of their group. Organic intellectuals serve to help disrupt rather than reinforce the prevailing hegemony. The second preliminary point is that contemporary intellectuals in the Western context operate within a particular ‘‘regime’ of truth’ (Foucault 1980a: 133), one that constitutes as ‘truth’ knowledge that is the product of scientific methods of working. Michel Foucault argues that the figure of what he calls ‘the specific intellectual’ is of central importance in present day struggles. Specific intellectuals, such as atomic scientists for example, who have a ‘direct and localised relation to scientific knowledge and institutions’ (Foucault 1980a: 128) constitute a political threat because of their ability ‘to intervene in contemporary political struggles in the name of a “local” scientific truth’ (Foucault 1980a: 129). In other words, because of their status as experts, and despite the fact that ‘the specific intellectual serves the interests of State or Capital’ (Foucault 1980a: 131), they remain in a strategic position to intervene on behalf of local struggles. There are dangers, of course: the risk of remaining at the level of local struggles, of manipulation or control by other inter- ests, and of not being able to gain widespread support. Nevertheless, the specific intellectual should not be discounted (Foucault 1980a: 131). What is important is the relation between ‘truth’ and power, and the way in which Each society has its regime of truth, its ‘general politics’ of truth: that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements, the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged of saying what counts as true. (Foucault 1980a: 131) Foucault argues that, in our societies, the dominant regime of truth is centred on scientific discourse and the institutions that support this. The specific intellectual has a particular class position, as Gramsci noted too, and particular conditions of work, but more than that, a particular connection to the way that the politics of truth works. This gives such an intellectual the possibility of struggle at the level of the regime of truth. Of course, ‘this regime is not merely ideological or superstructural; it was a condition of the formation and development of capitalism’ (Foucault 1980a: 133), which means that interventions that challenge the regime of truth constitute a challenge to the hegemony of the social and economic system with which it is bound up. It is in this context of a particular, scientific regime of truth and the role of the intellectual that I want to discuss the ways in which the academic search for ‘causes’ and ‘solutions’ to the Northern Ireland conflict operates, and how this mode of working can prohibit change. The role of the intellectual, as both Gramsci and Foucault have argued, can be central to change and contestation, but it can also be part of the structures that prohibit change and keep existing structures and problematisations in place. I suggest that the particular form of intellectual work that identifies ‘problems’ and then proposes ‘solutions’ is problematic. It ultimately rein- forces or reproduces certain ways of thinking and conceals the way that identifying something as a problem in the first place is already to take a particular stance in rela- tion to it. I argue that the alternative in the case of violence in particular is to engage in intellectual activity that brings to light struggles hidden in detailed historical records or localised knowledges – an activity that Foucault calls genealogy – and emphasises the necessity for a gradual remaking of the world, not through narrative accounts that regularise and normalise history in terms of cause and effect, but through a slow re-building, brick by brick</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span><br />

To determine if the omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, &quot;and the same hereby is&quot;, (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2) constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the trial judge's intent must be garnered from the four corners of the entire record.16 </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Yet </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">a</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">nother </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">criticism of</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> the </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">NEPA</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> review process </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">is that it impedes the development of</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> consensus support for </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">solutions</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> to environmental problems. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">In fact, there is no</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> necessary </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">conflict between the decision-making process established by NEPA and the formation of</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">consensus around </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">particular projects or programs</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. Properly conducted, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">the NEPA process can be instrumental in achieving lasting solutions with broad public support</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. Those who insist on seeing conflict between NEPA and consensus building argue, in effect, for rolling back the most valuable aspects of the NEPA process for no good reason. According to some critics, conflict between NEPA and so-called “collaborative” decision-making processes is inevitable. Collaborative decision-making is typically understood as an iterative process of consultation among government officials and stakeholder representatives designed to develop a consensus solution for a particular natural resource problem. Expressing a representative viewpoint, Douglas MacDonald, Secretary of Transportation for the State of Washington, recently opined that the NEPA process “creates a context for discussion and problem-solving that maximizes the polarization of opinion, the staking out of positions, and the exclusion of iteration and compromise in problem solving.” 49 To like effect, the Deputy Chief of the Forest Service has commented: The requirement that alternatives to proposed actions and their effects be documented in an environmental impact statement and environmental assessment prior to a decision does not facilitate a collaborative process between agencies or with other interests. ... Documenting and circulating ... alternatives in a draft and final document for public comment fosters an assumption that the decision maker has a range of options to choose from and various interests can weigh in and comment on the alternatives they support. There is no incentive built into the NEPA process to work toward a single solution that accommodates multiple interests. 50 The Forest Service’s new forest planning regulations reflect this viewpoint, calling the traditional approach of developing and evaluating alternatives in the planning process “divisive.” 51 Under the new regulations, forest plans will be developed through a “collaborative” process that “encourage[s] people to work together to understand each other and find common solutions.” 52 Significantly, environmental analysis will apparently play little if any role in that endeavor; the planning regulations state that Forest Service will not provide “indepth social, economic, or ecological analysis” for options that are discussed in the collaborative process, 53 and the Service separately proposed to exempt forest planning from NEPA analysis altogether. 54 There is unquestionably a serious tension between the NEPA process and the type of “collaborative” approach advanced by the Forest Service. As discussed, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">NEPA is based on the principles that information on environmental impacts is important in making rational choices among options and that the public should have broad access to the decision-making process. The Forest Service’s approach ignores both principles, threatening to recreate the kind of narrow, environmentally-insensitive decision-making that prevailed prior to NEPA’s enactment. By essentially eliminating environmental analysis, the Forest Service’s approach leaves agency personnel and other participants in the planning process effectively blind to the potential effects of a proposed management approach. The agency’s refusal to identify and evaluate alternatives, in particular, will preclude meaningful evaluation of the potential environmental benefits and tradeoffs offered by different management approaches. Furthermore, the Forest Service’s substitution of a vague “collaborative” process for the clearly-defined rights of public involvement under NEPA threatens to limit, and possibly bias, public engagement in the planning process. The Forest Service will itself choose the participants in its collaborative process; it may either deliberately or instinctively select citizens and groups that it views as likely to agree with its views, and exclude </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">those that it anticipates will make reaching “consensus” difficult. Thus, the representativeness and fairness of the agency’s collaborative process will frequently be open to question. Citizens outside the collaborative process, meanwhile, will be denied all the procedural rights afforded by NEPA, including the opportunity to participate in scoping sessions, to receive information on the environmental impacts of the agency’s proposed action, to propose alternative approaches, and to offer comments on the accuracy of the agency’s environmental analysis. Ultimately, the Forest Service’s approach appears to be based on the notion that by embracing a philosophy of “collaboration,” and controlling the range of viewpoints involved in planning, the agency can magically make disputes over management of forest lands disappear. In reality, management of federal lands, like most government actions affecting the environment, inevitably raises conflicts among different values and interests. NEPA is based on the sound premise that these types of conflicts are best resolved through an inclusive, analytically rigorous process, not an artificially-constrained search for consensus. There are other approaches to “collaborative” decision-making that do allow federal agencies to engage the public broadly in their planning processes without undercutting environmental reviews. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">There is no </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">necessary</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;"> conflict between a well-managed NEPA process and an effort to arrive at a conclusion supported by broad public consensus</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. The scoping process that agencies undertake before beginning preparation of an EIS is explicitly intended to be a collaborative process, albeit an open one, drawing together agency planners, concerned citizens, tribes and other affected governments to define the key environmental issues and alternative approaches that should be studied by the agency. Agencies can continue that cooperative approach throughout the EIS process, consulting with the public and with other affected interests to build consensus on a preferred alternative, on mitigation measures, and on issues arising during scientific studies in the course of preparing the EIS. Concurrent with or subsequent to the NEPA process, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">agencies</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> can </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">employ alternative dispute resolution, negotiated rule-making, or other techniques in an attempt to arrive at a conclusion with broad public support. 55 Such dispute resolution efforts are actually more likely to succeed once disputed issues have been thoroughly aired and narrowed through the NEPA review process. The recent success in</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> the Gifford </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Pinchot National Forest</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> in Washington State, described earlier, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">illustrates the potential for NEPA to help generate solutions with broad public support</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. In that case, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">environmentalists</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">timber companies</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, local </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">citizens and the Forest Service used the NEPA process as the springboard for negotiating a new management approach</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> for the national forest that reconciled timber harvesting with ecological goals. A local resident involved in the process concluded: “</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">We were able to get timber out in an environmentally responsible way, and we succeeded in avoiding appeals that plague controversial timber sales</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.” 56</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Since 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (“</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">NEPA</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">”) </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">has required federal agencies to assess</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> the </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">environmental effects of their proposed actions and provide the public a meaningful opportunity to participate</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> in agency decision making. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">The proper application of NEPA ensures that agencies make well-informed decisions that are supported by a robust consideration of the environmental effects of both the proposed action and alternatives to that action</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, the cumulative effects of the proposed action and its alternatives, and concerns raised by the public.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">The past eight years have witnessed an assault on NEPA that has eroded the application of the law to the point where major federal actions with significant environmental effects are taken without any environmental analysis.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">First, some agencies have improperly shifted the application of NEPA to later stages of decision making. CEQ regulations state that agencies should integrate the NEPA process at the earliest time possible; the regulations also expressly state that the adoption of “formal plans” is major federal action subject to NEPA. However, agencies have not heeded this mandate, with one agency (the Forest Service) going as far as seeking to exempt planning documents entirely from NEPA analysis. By misconstruing NEPA to mean that an agency does not have to conduct a NEPA analysis until narrow, site-specific actions are taken,</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">agencies have effectively exempted themselves from NEPA’s provisions</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> at the decision stage. Moreover, some agencies fail to apply NEPA until after they have entered binding contracts that create a financial incentive for the agency to go forward with an action regardless of its environmental impacts. Second, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">agencies have improperly expanded</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> the use of </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">categorical exclusions</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">(CEs) to exempt categories of activities that may have significant environmental effects from environmental review. A categorical exclusion is “a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment”, and therefore do not require preparation of environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">CEs are approved through an agency’s NEPA</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> implementing </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">procedures</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> or, in one case, through legislation. If extraordinary circumstances exist that may cause the proposed action to have a significant effect on the environment, that action cannot be categorically excluded from NEPA analysis. When used appropriately, CEs can save agencies time and resources, and avoid duplicative analysis for actions that will not have a significant effect on the environment. However, when there are substantive questions about whether an action’s impacts are significant, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">the public deserves the opportunity to be part of the process for evaluating potential impacts</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. Over the past eight years, agencies and Congress have expanded the approval and application of CEs. No longer are CEs applied to only discrete actions that do not have a significant environmental effect; instead, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">CEs have been expanded</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> to include broad categories of actions that should receive a detailed look by the agencies and the public because these actions may have significant direct or cumulative impacts on the environment. Also, some agencies have failed to provide for extraordinary circumstances that would limit the application of CEs to environmentally insignificant actions.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Thus, potentially significant actions are approved with minimal to no environmental review or public input.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Reinforcing CEQ’s Leadership Role in the CE Process On September 19, 2006, CEQ published draft guidance designed to aid agencies in the establishment, revision, and use of CEs. This guidance has not been finalized. The next Administration should issue final guidance that will reinforce CEQ’s leadership role in the CE process and reflect the changes suggested in comments submitted jointly by over 100 local and national environmental organizations.1 Specifically, the final guidance should, inter alia, (1) require agencies to consult with CEQ early in the drafting of the proposed CE and at minimum before the proposed CE is published in the Federal Register, (2) require agencies to provide CEQ with a comprehensive administrative record supporting the new or revised CE, (3) require that agencies make information supporting CEs available to the public, and (4) instruct agencies to avoid establishing CEs for activities likely to generate public opposition regarding effects on the human environment.

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">A distinguishing feature of any society is its prevailing assumptions about its relationship to the Earth. The history of cultures--especially of religions--reveals a great number of cosmologies, the perceived relationships of people to their planetary environment. Today</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">the survival of living species may depend first, upon the</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> degree to which mankind's concept of its </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">environmental situation</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">corresponds to biophysical realities and second, upon what humans value, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">and how</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> these </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">values are expressed</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">in relation to these realities. Archeology has recorded the failure of societies that have misconceived the requirements for environmental sustainability. During the earlier centuries of human history the impact of society on its environment was relatively light and local. If an environment, for whatever reason, became unsustainable, people could often move on to new lands, often displacing or destroying the original inhabitants. When degradation of the environment was slow or scarcely perceptible, the consequences of its decline often were not felt until they were irreversible. Where human numbers were small relative to space, migration permitted impaired environments to recover, at least partially. But many areas of the Earth have never recovered from the degradation of centuries-long misuse, and still more are headed toward impoverishment. In a world filled with people and settlements, the </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">option of migration is increasingly unavailable</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Recognition of narrowing environmental options has led in recent decades to conservation practices assisted by the growth of science</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, to the comparative measurement of environmental change, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">and to forecasts of</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> the probable consequences of present </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">trends</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. The conservation of natural resources movement has had a paradoxical effect upon human perceptions of environmental realities. While the conservation movement contributed both to the emergence of applied ecology and public environmental concern, many conservationists rejected environmentalism (often called preservationism) as uneconomical, unrealistic and anti-social. Economy and efficiency in the wise use of resources has been the essence of &quot;conservation,&quot; which sees the environment as infinitely manageable--capable of sustained productivity under the guidance of experts knowledgeable of science. In this respect, conservationism [*236] is fundamentally consistent with the Western worldview, especially that which prevailed during the era of U.S. Progressivism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n82" rel="nofollow">n82</a></span> Environmentalism emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century from a convergence of changing perceptions of the human condition in fields as diverse as ecology, public health, demography, climatology, cosmology, and ethics. When its true dimensions, assumptions, and expectations are understood, environmentalism is, as Robert Nisbet observed, revolutionary. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n83" rel="nofollow">n83</a></span> Its effect upon human society is comparable to the changed views of reality inherent in the Copernican cosmic revolution in the seventeenth century and the Darwinian evolution revolution in the nineteenth century. To some, this conclusion may seem to be an exaggerated estimate of the influence of environmentalism and its future prospects. Following initial successes of environmental protection efforts, there has been in many countries (including the United States) an anti-government reaction that has sometimes been violent. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n84" rel="nofollow">n84</a></span> It is doubtful that in the long run the &quot;green backlash&quot; will prevail. Its angry proponents are chiefly natural resources industries, land developers and speculators, libertarians, and their allies in public office. Still the counter-intuitive behavior of social systems makes any forecast of the future uncertain. Nevertheless there are ascertainable, measurable trends in today's world that strongly suggest the impending negative impact of powerful coercive environmental events upon human society in the twenty-first century.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Adherence to principles</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> like those expressed </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">in NEPA may become more a matter of necessity than of voluntary choice. The way in which people and their governments respond to the prospect of these coercions will shape the future of the world</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. The timing of effective response is equally important. The longer the delay, the more [*237] difficult the task and the greater the possibility of irremediable damage. Because the future of the world in the twenty-first century cannot be foreseen, we can only conjecture the true location of NEPA on the trajectory of history. I offer the following assessment of the significance of NEPA, fully realizing that, at least in the short run, the world is capable of unpredictable turns. NEPA is most fully understood as a national policy for henceforward into the future. &quot;Environment&quot; may be understood as a surrogate term for a concept more comprehensive than is usually appreciated. Our language tends to lag behind new insights. Among our most persistent and pervasive misconceptions is the artificial dichotomy of economy/ecology. Their true relationship might be suggested by the time-space concept in physics. The concepts of ecology and economy are not the same--they are distinguishable, but, paradoxically, also inseparable.<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n85" rel="nofollow">n85</a></span> In mundane reality there are obvious conflicts within and between the &quot;domains&quot; of economy and the environment. Yet both these aspects of our world are in actuality inextricable--separable by cultural convention and for analytic purposes. In reality they should have a common inclusive name. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Achievement of a national policy for the environment requires awareness of the ecology/economy interrelationship</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, of the direction toward which the world appears to be moving, and a growth of consensus on the kind of future that is desirable and sustainable. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">A national policy for the future of the environment cannot be achieved in isolation from other major societal issues</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. Issues of population, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">material growth</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, property rights and obligations, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">and basic social equities involve choices which many people would prefer not to make</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. But the world today is not a &quot;new age of Aquarius,&quot; free from ultimate accountability to nature, if not to humanity. Regardless of what we may deny or resist, our society will in one way or another be compelled to accommodate its behaviors [*238] to the inexorable workings of the world. But apocalypse need not be a preordained outcome for a society that marshals and moves its moral, material, intellectual, and organizational capabilities toward attainment of a preferred and sustainable future. IX. AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">The National Environmental Policy Act may be seen as a charter and agenda to guide this nation toward rational strategies for coping with the critical environmental problems that are present and growing. The United States has the material and intellectual capabilities for setting a non-hegemonic example for the world. Whether it can generate a collective moral purpose to do so remains uncertain. As individuals, there is little that people can do to reverse destructive socio-ecological trends. Voluntary local initiatives may help where there is a sense of community purpose. But our fundamental environmental problems transcend manmade boundaries and require solutions commensurate with the problems, which are increasingly seen to be transnational, even global. The 1968 Biosphere Conference and the 1972 and 1992 U.N. conferences on the environment testify to an international recognition of mankind's environmental predicament. Yet in a world governed by nations, national action is necessary, not only for each nation, but for international cooperation. Action on any major social issue requires a credible collective purpose, catalytic leadership, and popular receptivity. There is strong evidence that the last of these--public support for environmental action--already exists. A goal-directed agenda is necessary to focus and activate social effort, for without such a codification of purpose, there can be no concerted action. Translation of social purpose into action is a function of leadership. To cope with the environmental predicament of mankind,leadership must be national and participatory</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, involving all sectors of society, but with an indispensable responsibility in government which is the affirmingand coordinative institution for nationwide and international effort. For the United States, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">NEPA provides a comprehensive agenda for the environmental future.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">NEPA creates a foundation for a unifying national effort and legitimizes its goals and principles as [*239] national policy. Beyond NEPA, specific, targeted action programs are needed to achieve its intent. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">NEPA may be regarded,</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> in effect, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">as a constitution for the environment--principles to guide the nation toward an enhanced quality of life and an enduring environmental future</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">The world is heading for an &quot;ecological</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> credit </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">crunch</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&quot; far worse than the current financial crisis </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">because humans are over-using the natural resources of the planet</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, an international study warns today. The Living Planet report calculates that humans are using 30% more resources than the Earth can replenish each year, which is leading to deforestation, degraded soils, polluted air and water, and dramatic declines in numbers of fish and other species. As a result, we are running up an ecological debt of $4tr (£2.5tr) to $4.5tr every year - double the estimated losses made by the world's financial institutions as a result of the credit crisis - say the report's authors, led by the conservation group WWF, formerly the World Wildlife Fund. The figure is based on a UN report which calculated the economic value of services provided by ecosystems destroyed annually, such as diminished rainfall for crops or reduced flood protection. The problem is also getting worse as populations and consumption keep growing faster than technology finds new ways of expanding what can be produced from the natural world. This had led the report to predict that by 2030, if nothing changes, [hu]mankind would need two planets to sustain its lifestyle. &quot;The recent downturn in the global economy is a stark reminder of the consequences of living beyond our means,&quot; says James Leape, WWF International's director general. &quot;But the possibility of financial recession pales in comparison to the looming ecological credit crunch.&quot; The report continues: &quot;We have only one planet. Its capacity to support a thriving diversity of species, humans included, is large but fundamentally limited. When human demand on this capacity exceeds what is available - when we surpass ecological limits - we erode the health of the Earth's living systems. Ultimately this loss threatens human well-being.&quot; Speaking yesterday in London, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">the report's authors also called for politicians to mount a huge</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">international</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">response</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> in line with the multibillion-dollar rescue plan for the economy. &quot;</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">They</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> now </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">need to turn their collective action to a far more pressing concern and that's the survival of all life on planet Earth,</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&quot; said Chief EmekaAnyaoku, the president of WWF International.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">In many cases</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">minority and low-income communities are disparately impacted by government actions</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">because the communities do not have a voice in the decision-making process, and the communities lack the influence or political power of special interest groups that may support the government action. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Broad and flexible public participation provisions, like those in NEPA, empower communities and provide them with a voicein the decisionmaking process. Broad and flexible public participation provisions</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> also </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">improve the government's decision-making process by enabling it to solicit information vital to that process</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. 36 </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Without such provisions, the federal government may reach decisions that disparately impact minority and low-incomecommunities because the government fails to obtain input from the impacted communities.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Arguably, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">the communities are the most important group of experts. Local individuals</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, who will be most directly affected by a government action, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">can provide unique information about the impacts of the proposed action that the government may be unable to obtain elsewhere</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. 37 </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">This additional information enables the government to identify additional alternatives to the proposed action</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">environmental protection</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> apparatus </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">in the United States does not provide equal protection</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> for all communities. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">The environmental justice movement</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> emerged in response to environmental inequities, threats to public health, unequal protection, differential enforcement, and disparate treatment received by the poor and people of color. The movement </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">redefined environmental protection as a basic right</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. It also emphasized pollution prevention, waste minimization, and cleaner production techniques as strategies for achieving environmental justice for all Americans without regard to race, color, national origin, or income. The</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">poisoning of African Americans</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> in Louisiana's &quot;Cancer Alley,&quot; </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Native Americans</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> on reservations, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">and Mexicans in the border towns all have their roots in the same economic system, a system characterized by economic exploitation, racial oppression, and devaluation of human life and the natural environment.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Both race and class factors place low-income and people-of-color communities at spe-cial risk. Although environmental and civil rights laws have been on the books for more than 3 decades, all communities have not received the same benefits from their application, implementation, and enforcement. Unequal political power arrangements also have allowed poisons of the rich to be offered as short-term economic remedies for poverty. There is little or no corre-lation between proximity of industrial plants in communities of color and the employment opportunities of nearby residents. Having industrial facilities in one's community does not automatically translate into jobs for nearby residents. Many industrial plants are located at the fence line with the communities. Some are so close that local residents could walk to work. More often than not, communities of color are stuck with the pollution and poverty, while other people commute in for the industrial jobs. Similarly, tax breaks and corporate welfare programs have produced few new jobs by polluting firms. However, state-sponsored pollution and lax enforcement have allowed many communities of color and poor communities to become the dumping grounds. Louisiana is the poster child for corporate welfare. The state is mired in both poverty and pollution. It is no wonder that Louisiana's petrochemical corridor, the 85-mile stretch along the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge to New Orleans dubbed &quot;Cancer Alley,&quot; has become a hotbed for environmental justice activity. The environmental justice movement has set out clear goals of eliminating</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">unequal</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> enforcement of </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">environmental, civil rights, and public health laws</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">; differ-ential</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">exposure</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">of some populations </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">to harmful chemicals, pesticides, and other toxins</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> in the home, school, neighborhood, and workplace; faulty assumptions in calculating, assessing, and managing risks; </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">discriminatory zoning and land use practices</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">; and </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">exclusionary policies and practices that limit some individuals and groups from participation in decision making</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. Many of these problems </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">could be eliminated if existing</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> environmental, health, housing, and civil rights </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">laws were vigorously enforced</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">in a nondiscriminatory way. The call for environmental and economic justice does not stop at the U.S. borders but extends to communities and nations that are threatened by the export of hazardous wastes, toxic products, and &quot;dirty&quot; industries. Much of the world does not get to share in the benefits of the United States' high standard of living. From energy consumption to the production and export of tobacco, pesticides, and other chemicals, more and more of the world's peoples are sharing the health and envi-ronmental burden of America's wasteful throwaway culture. Hazardous wastes and &quot;dirty&quot; industries have followed the path of least resistance. Poor people and poor nations are given a false choice of &quot;no jobs and no development&quot; versus &quot;risky, low-paying jobs and pollution.&quot; Industries and governments (including the military) have often exploited the economic vulnerability of poor communities, poor states, poor nations, and poor regions for their unsound and &quot;risky&quot; operations. Environmental justice leaders are demanding that no community or nation, rich or poor, urban or suburban, Black or White, be allowed to become a &quot;sacrifice zone&quot; or dumping grounds. They are also pressing governments to live up to their mandate of protecting public health and the environment.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;">The discursive logic of transportation policy is bound up within a problematic biopolitical objectification of travel as “transport”, the aff is merely another attempt to discipline the social life of travel through the production of particular types of knowledge/power relations </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;">Cox and Bonham 10(Peter, Jennifer, “The disruptive traveller? A Foucauldian analysis of Cycleways” Road &amp; Transport Research Vol 19 No 2</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">those who produce and utilise transport knowledge participate both in shaping how people can think about their journeys and in structuring the field of action of individual travellers</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;">. It is impossible to review the key elements of Foucault’s work in this article, instead we offer a brief introduction accompanied by an example of how Foucault’s work can be utilised in transport. Readers unfamiliar with Foucault are directed to McHoul and Grace (1995) for a concise introduction and Bacchi (2009) on applying Foucault to policy analysis. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Foucault offers an understanding of power as productive, as producing particular types of being and knowledge</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"> (Bacchi 2009:37–8). </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">He identifies different types of power</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"> (Hindess 1996:96–136) </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">and, although governmental and bio power are important to transport, our paper focuses on discipline as it foregrounds the role of ‘spatialising’ practices2 in processes of objectification and subjectification</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"> (the formation of subjects). </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Disciplinary power, fundamental to the self regulation that characterises modern societies</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"> (Foucault 1991:101), </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">has enabled the production of knowledge about the capabilities and capacities of human beings that, in turn, facilitates innovations in the exercise of power</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"> (Foucault 1977:224). It </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">is through the operation of power at a micro-scale, the sorting and physical separation of the human mass – constituting difference through the discursive mechanisms</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"> (records keeping, data collection</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">) involved in separating, scrutinising and monitoring bodies – that knowledge of singular bodies has been produced</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"> (Foucault 1977:191–2). From the moment we are born – separated from our mothers, gendered male or female, weighed, measured, named, allocated the special space of a cot and monitored at regular intervals – we are subjected to and made subjects through myriad practices involving the operation of power and the production of knowledge. The procedures of inscription which bring individuals into effect and objectivise bodies in specific ways – as healthy or ill, learned or illiterate, political or passive, law abiding or deviant, mobile or stationary – simultaneously enable the aggregation of those singular histories into knowledge of populations where norms, the limits to normal, and deviations from the norm are constituted (Foucault 1977, 1982). An important point here is that these are not necessary ways of knowing individuals. Rather, conditions at different moments enable objectification of bodies in new ways. With this knowledge, individuals are worked upon through systems of punishment and reward to regulate themselves according to the norm while those found wanting – disruptive, abnormal – might be removed altogether. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Travel is but one domain in which bodies have been objectivised and subjectivised3; separated, scrutinised and worked upon and, in the case of cycleways, removed altogether. Through the late nineteenth but especially the twentieth century it became thinkable, practicable and meaningful to study urban movement. Until recently, the meaning of that movement has been asserted and widely accepted as ‘transport’– the journey from a to b specifically to accomplish some activity or task at point b</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"> (Bonham 2000). </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Over time, the journey, or trip, has come to appear as ‘selfevident’, as mechanisms for the study of journeys</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"> – origin–destination studies, household travel surveys, vehicle counts – </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">excise particular practices from the mass of daily activities and bring them under scrutiny. Objectifying travel as ‘transport’ establishes the journey as a by-product of its end points – derived demand – and provides the imperative for trips to be accomplished as quickly, or as economically, as possible(</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;">Bonham and Ferretti 1999). </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">‘Derived demand’ functions as a ‘statement’</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"> (Foucault 1976:102–17) within the field of transport, a statementthat both disciplines those who would study travel, and discounts, if not excludes, the many other possibilities of our journeys.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">Drawing on Foucault’s</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"> (1980:119) </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;">understanding of power as productive,the objectification of travel as transport is productive in that it has enabled the development of a vast body of </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;">Consider again the contrastive terms in which it is possible to view biopolitics and sovereignty. The final chapter in the first volume of the History of Sexuality that contrasts sovereignty and biopolitics is titled &quot;Right of Death and Power over Life.&quot; The initial terms of the contrast between the two registers of government is thus between one that could employ power to put subjects to death, even if this right to kill was conditioned by the defense of the sovereign, and one that was concerned with the fostering of life. Nevertheless, each part of the contrast can be further broken down. The right of death can also be understood as &quot;the right to take life or let live&quot;; the power over life as the power &quot;to foster life or disallow it.&quot; Sovereign power is a power that distinguishes between political life (bios) and mere existence or bare life (zoe). Bare life is included in the constitution of sovereign power by Its very exclusion from political life.Incontrast,biopoliticsmight be thought to include zoe in bios:stripped down mere existence becomes a matter of political reality. Thus, the contrast between biopolitics and sovereignty is not one of a power of life versus a power of death but concerns the way the different forms of power treat matters of life and death and entail different conceptions of life. Thus, biopoliticsreinscribes the earlier right of death and power over life and places it within a new and different form that attempts to include what had earlier been sacred and taboo, bare life, in political existence. It is no longer so much the right of the sovereign to put to death his enemies but to disqualify the life—the mere existence—of those who are a threat to the life of the population, to disallow those deemed &quot;unworthy of life,&quot; those whose bare life is not worth living. This allows us, first, to consider what might be thought of as the dark side of biopolitics (Foucault 1979a: 136—37). In Foucault's account, biopolitics does not put an end to the practice of war:it providesit withnew and more sophisticated killing machines. These machines allow killing itself to be reposed at the level of entire populations. Wars become genocidalin the twentieth century.The same state that takes on the duty to enhance the life of the population also exercises the power of death over whole populations. Atomic weapons are the key weapons of this process of the power to put whole populations to death. We might also consider here the aptly named biological and chemical weapons that seek an extermination of populations by visiting plagues upon them or polluting the biosphere in which they live to the point at which bare life is no longer sustainable.Nor does the birth of biopolitics put an end tothe killing of one's own populations. Rather, itintensifiesthat killing—whether by an &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; that visits holocaustsupon whole groupsor by themass slaughters of classes and groups conducted in the name of theUtopiato be achieved. There is a certain restraint in sovereign power. The right of death is only occasionally exercised as the right to kill and then often in a ritual fashion that suggests a relation to the sacred. More often, sovereign power is manifest in the refraining from the right to kill.The biopoliticalimperative knows nosuch restraint. Power is exercised at the level of populations and hence wars will be waged at that level, on behalf of everyone and their lives.This point brings us to the heart of Foucault's provocative thesis about biopolitics: that there is an intimate connection between the exercise of a life-administering power and the commission of genocide: &quot;If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill: it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population&quot; (1979a: 137). Foucault completes this same passage with an expression that deserves more notice: &quot;massacres become vital.&quot; There is thus a kind of perverse homogeneity between the power over life and the power to take life characteristic of biopower. The emergence of a biopolitical racism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries can be approached as a trajectory in which this homogeneity always threatened to tip over into a dreadful necessity. This racism can be approached as a fundamental mechanism of power that is inscribed in the biopolitical domain (Stoler 1995: 84—85). For Foucault, the primary function of this form of racism is to establish a division between those who must live and those who must die, and to distinguish the superior from the inferior, the fit from the unfit. The notion and techniques of population had given rise, at the end of the nineteenth century, to a new linkage among population, the internal organization of states, and the competition between states. Darwinism, as an imperial social and political program, would plot the ranking of individuals, populations, and nations along the common gradient of fitness and thus measure eflicienqp6 However, the series &quot;population, evolution, and race&quot; is not simply a way of thinking about the superiority of the &quot;white races&quot; or of justifying colonialism, but also of thinking about how to treat the degenerates and the abnormals in one's own population and prevent the further degeneration of the race. The second and most important function for Foucault of this biopolitical racism in the nineteenth century is that &quot;it establishes a positive relation between the right to kill and the assurance of life&quot; (Stoler 1995: 84). The life of the population, its vigor, its health, its capacities to survive, becomes necessarily linked to the elimination of internal and external threats. This power to disallow life is perhaps best encapsulated in the injunctions of the eugenic project: identify those who are degenerate, abnormal, feeble*minded, or of an inferior race and subject them to forced sterilization: encourage those who are superior, fit, and intelligent to propagate. Identify those whose life is but mere existence and disqualify their propagation: encourage those who can partake of a sovereign existence and of moral and political life. But this last example does not necessarily establish a positive justification for the right to kill, only the right to disallow life. If we are to begin to understand the type of racism engaged in by Nazism, however, we need to take into account another kind of denouement between the biopolitical management of population and the exercise of sovereignty. This version of sovereignty is no longer the transformed and democratized form founded on the liberty of the juridical subject, as it is for liberalism, but a sovereignty that takes up and transforms a further element of sovereignty, its &quot;symbolics of blood&quot; (Foucault 1979a: 148). For Foucault, sovereignty is grounded in blood—as a reality and as a symbol—just as one might say that sexuality becomes the key field on which biopolitical management of populations is articulated. When power is exercised through repression and deduction, through a law over which hangs the sword, when it is exercised on the scaffold by the torturer and the executioner, and when relations between households and families were forged through alliance, &quot;blood was a reality with a symbolic function.&quot; By contrast, for biopolitics with its themes of health, vigor, fitness, vitality, progeny, survival, and race, &quot;power spoke of sexuality and to sexuality&quot; (Foucault 1979a: 147). For Foucault (1979a: 149—50), the novelty of National Socialism was the way it articulated &quot;the oneiric exaltation of blood,&quot; of fatherland, and of the triumph of the race in an immensely cynical and naive fashion, with the paroxysms of a disciplinary and biopolitical power concerned with the detailed administration of the life of the population and the regulation of sexuality, family, marriage, and education.'Nazism generalized biopower without the limit-critique posed by the juridical subject of right, but it could not do away with sovereignty. Instead, it established a set of permanent interventions into the conduct of the individual within the population and articulated this with the &quot;mythical concern for blood and the triumph of the race.&quot; Thus, the shepherd-flock game and the city-citizen game are transmuted into the eugenic ordering of biological existence (of mere living and subsistence) and articulated on the themes of the purity of blood and the myth of the fatherland. In such an articulation of these elements of sovereign and biopolitical forms of power, the relation between the administration of life and the right to kill entire populations is no longer simply one of a dreadful homogeneity. It has become a necessary relation. The administration of life comes to require a bloodbath. It is not simply that power, and therefore war, will be exercised at the level of an entire population. It is that the act of disqualifying the right to life of other races becomes necessary for the fostering of the life of the race. Moreover, the elimination of other races is only one face of the purification of one's own race (Foucault 1997b: 231). The other part is to expose the latter to a universal and absolute danger, to expose it to the risk of death and total destruction. For Foucault, with the Nazi state we have an &quot;absolutely racist state, an absolutely murderous state and an absolutely suicidal state&quot; (232), all of which are superimposed and converge on the Final Solution. With the Final Solution, the state tries to eliminate, through the Jews, all the other races, for whom the Jews were the symbol and the manifestation. This includes, in one of Hitler's last acts, the order to destroy the bases of bare life for the German people itself &quot;Final Solution for other races, the absolute suicide of the German race&quot; is inscribed, according to Foucault. in the functioning of the modern state (232).</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;">First,intellectuals areof coursenot as separate from political and social structuresas might seem to be the case. Antonio Gramsci addresses the question of whether intellectuals are ‘an autonomous and independent social group’ (Gramsci 1971: 5) as they so often appear. He argues against looking for criteria that distinguish intel- lectuals as such ‘in the intrinsic nature of intellectual activities, rather than in the ensemble of the system of relations in which these activities (and therefore the intel- lectual groups who personify them) have their place within the general complex of social relations’ (Gramsci 1971: 8). We should focus not on what defines ‘an intel- lectual’ but rather on what categories are historically made available for intellectual activity and how struggles for dominance between different groups or classes can be conceived in these terms. He distinguishes ‘traditional intellectuals,’ on the one hand, who have an apparent neutrality and absence of class-belongingness, but whose status and authority derives from their historical position and whose role is as ‘the dominant group’s ‘deputies’, exercising the … functions of social hegemony and political government’ (Gramsci 1971: 12) and ‘organic intellectuals,’ on the other, who are part of a subaltern group or class that is engaged in a struggle for dominance. ‘Traditional intellectuals’ are those who are commonly recognisedas intellectuals: academics, writers, scientists and so on. ‘Organic intellectuals,’ on the other hand, though not recognisable as intellectuals, articulate the ‘new modes of thought’ (Gramsci 1971: 9) of their group. Organic intellectuals serve to help disrupt rather than reinforce the prevailing hegemony. The second preliminary point is that contemporary intellectuals in the Western contextoperate within a particular ‘‘regime’ of truth’(Foucault 1980a: 133), one that constitutes as ‘truth’ knowledge that is the product of scientific methods of working. Michel Foucault argues that the figure of what he calls‘the specific intellectual’ is of central importance in present day struggles. Specific intellectuals, such as atomic scientists for example, who have a ‘direct and localised relation to scientific knowledge and institutions’ (Foucault 1980a: 128) constitute a political threat because of their ability ‘to intervene in contemporary political struggles in the name of a “local” scientific truth’ (Foucault 1980a: 129). In other words, because of their status as experts, and despite the fact that ‘the specific intellectual serves the interests of State or Capital’ (Foucault 1980a: 131), they remain in a strategic position to intervene on behalf of local struggles. There are dangers, of course: the risk of remaining at the level of local struggles, of manipulation or control by other inter- ests, and of not being able to gain widespread support. Nevertheless, the specific intellectual should not be discounted (Foucault 1980a: 131).What is important is the relation between ‘truth’ and power, and the way in which Each society has its regime of truth, its ‘general politics’ of truth: that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements, the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged of saying what counts as true. (Foucault 1980a: 131) Foucault argues that, in our societies, the dominant regime of truth is centredon scientific discourse and the institutions that support this.The specific intellectual has aparticular class position, as Gramsci noted too, and particular conditions of work, but more than that, aparticular connection to the way that the politics of truth works. This gives such an intellectual the possibility of struggle at the level of the regime of truth. Of course, ‘this regime is not merely ideological or superstructural; it was a condition of the formation and development of capitalism’ (Foucault 1980a: 133),which means that interventions that challenge the regime of truth constitute a challenge to the hegemony of the social and economic system with which it is bound up. It is in this context of a particular, scientific regime of truth and the role of the intellectual that I want to discuss the ways in which the academic search for ‘causes’ and ‘solutions’ to the Northern Ireland conflict operates, and how this mode of working can prohibit change. The role ofthe intellectual, as both Gramsci and Foucault have argued,can be central to changeand contestation, but it can also be part of the structures that prohibit change and keep existing structures and problematisations in place. I suggest thatthe particular form of intellectual work that identifies ‘problems’ and then proposes ‘solutions’ is problematic. It ultimately rein- forces or reproduces certain ways of thinking and conceals the way that identifying something as a problem in the first place is already to take a particular stance in rela- tion to it. I argue thatthe alternativein the case of violence in particularis to engage in intellectual activity that brings to light struggles hidden in detailed historical records or localisedknowledges – an activity that Foucault calls genealogy – and emphasises the necessity for a gradual remaking of the world, not through narrative accounts that regularise and normalise history in terms of cause and effect, but through a slow re-building, brick by brick</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.</span>
