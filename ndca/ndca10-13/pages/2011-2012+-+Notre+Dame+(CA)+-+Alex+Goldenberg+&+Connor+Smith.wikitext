Contention one—(Inner)Space
**What is space? What is its purpose? Who owns it?**
**In a globalized world, the way we answer these questions effects and shapes the way we think about terrestrial based polotics. Space is both a blank canvas and a mirror—how we theorize space can aid or abet our thinking about sovereignty, cooperation, and violence** **Stuart 2009**<span style="font-size: 10.66px;"> [Jill, </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.66px;">Dr .

<span class="Underline">**Sadly, the radical potential to think differently about space and sovereignty has been hijacked by militarization. This is not just a militarization of OUTER space—it is also a militarization of our INNER space. Status quo politics and rhetoric is an attempt to militarize both space and the American psyche in order to maintain imperial dominance.** **Orr 04,** Jackie Orr, from the department f sociology at Syracuse University, “The Militarization of Inner Space,” //Critical Sociology,// March 2004, volume 2, issue 30, pg. 451-481.</span> This militarized mindset is a primary cause of genocidal violence—a politics based in bounded communities cannot result in anything save atrocities—it can only solve wars between like-minded people <span style="font-size: 15.99px;">Archibugi 8</span><span style="font-size: 10.66px;"> (2008, Daniele, “The Global Commonwealth of Citizens: Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy” Princeton University Press, Chapter 2 p. 41-43 SG)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15.99px;">And, moreover, this psychological emphasis on the nation and the individual community first can no longer solve problems in the world. Every existential threat humanity faces—war, terrorism, proliferation, population growth and total environmental collapse—can only be dealt with via true international cooperation.

The volume of abandoned rockets, shattered satellites and missile shrapnel in the Earth’s orbit is reaching a “tipping point” and is now threatening the $250 billion (£174bn) space services industry, scientists said. A single collision between two satellites or large pieces of “space junk” could send thousands of pieces of debris spinning into orbit, each capable of destroying further satellites. Global positioning systems, international phone connections, television signals and weather forecasts are among the services which are at risk of crashing to a halt. This “chain reaction” could leave some orbits so cluttered with debris that they become unusable for commercial or military satellites, the US Defense Department's interim Space Posture Review warned last year. There are also fears that large pieces of debris could threaten the lives of astronauts in space shuttles or at the International Space Station.
