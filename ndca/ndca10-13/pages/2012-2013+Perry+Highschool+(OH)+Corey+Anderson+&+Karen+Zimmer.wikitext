__Approximately 80% of the 2030 Blue Map CCS demand is met worldwide in the baseline. The USA and Western Europe are particularly able to meet their respective demands with relatively low cost networks__. Meeting __the 2050 Blue Map demand is very challenging using the study’s modeled baseline assumptions on the distribution of storage capacities. At a global scale, only 15.5% of the 2050 is met; in a ‘high aquifer’ scenario, where the modeled percentage of published aquifer capacities available for CO 2 storage is increased from 2% to 10%, the percentage of Blue Map demand met in 2050__ increases only to 23%. The principle uncertainty is on the available storage capacity in aquifers. Assuming CO 2 storage in depleted __giant gas fields is possible at levels published in a recent IEA GHG study 2 , the study identifies the aquifer storage capacities in__ Australasia, China, Eastern Europe, India, Japan and the USA as key uncertainties for meeting the 2030 demand. The study further identifies that the capacity and cost-effectiveness of transport in 2050 for Central and South America and Western Europe additionally depend to a large extent on the aquifer storage capacity.

These approaches vary in terms of process technology and maturity, but all yield a stream of extracted CO2 which may then be compressed to increase its density and make it easier (and cheaper) to transport. Although **__technologies to separate and compress CO2 are commercially available, they have not been applied to large-scale CO2 capture from power plants for the purpose of long-term storage__**.9 Transportation Pipelines are the most common method for transporting large quantities of CO2 over long distances. CO2 pipelines are operated at ambient temperature and high pressure, with primary compressor stations located where the CO2 is injected and booster compressors located as needed further along the pipeline.10 In overall construction, CO2 pipelines are similar to natural gas pipelines, requiring the same attention to design, monitoring for leaks, and protection against overpressure, especially in populated areas.11 Many **__analysts consider CO2 pipeline technology to be mature__**, stemming from its use since the 1970s for EOR and in other industries.12 Marine transportation may also be feasible when CO2 needs to be transported over long distances or overseas; however, **__many manmade CO2 sources are located far from navigable waterways__**, so such a scheme would **__still likely require pipeline construction between CO2 sources and port terminals__**. Rail cars and trucks can also transport CO2, but these modes would be logistically impractical for large-scale CCS operations.

If CCS is widely deployed, the potential required CO2 pipeline infrastructure could be very large. ―Plausible **__capture rates (~80%) of the carbon dioxide from fossil fuels used for electric power production in the US today would produce a CO2 stream of approximately 1800 million tons__** (Mt) per year injected into a variety of geological formations.<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">‖</span>8 **__The existing U.S. CO2 pipeline infrastructure transports forty-five Mt__** of CO2 per year over 3,500 miles of pipe for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).9 For comparison, the existing U.S. natural gas pipeline network transports 455 Mt per year of natural gas over 300,000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipe.10 At the high-end, **__some estimates predict that the CO2 pipeline network that will develop for CCS could be comparable in size to the existing natural gas infrastructure__**.11 Other estimates predict that, because CO2 transportation is expected to involve shorter transportation distances than natural gas, a smaller network will likely result.12 The geographic configuration and size of the CO2 pipeline network is difficult to predict at this time. It seems unlikely that CCS will drastically alter current siting calculations for electricity generation units, as ―[**__t]he cost of piping CO2 is not negligible, but is much less than__** [electric**__] transmission cost.__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">‖</span>13 Rather, the network‘s configuration will likely be dictated by the feasibility and economics of generating electricity near a particular sequestration site, and the economics of transporting fuel to the generation unit and the economics of transmitting electricity from that location outward to serve load.14

=We isolate 2 scenarios- first is warming.= 

====Runaway warming is inevitable unless we take action --- err aff even if we cannot guarantee that warming is anthropogenic.====

Even if<span class="Underline"> carbon dioxide </span>emissions were to stop today<span class="Underline">, the built-in </span>inertia in the climate system would lead to temperatures increasing<span class="Underline"> further</span>. In addition to the 0.75CC rise since the nineteenth century, we are already committed to a further warming of 0.6°C. If emissions, and hence temperatures, continue to rise, warming may be as much as 4°C by 2050—and locally much more, 15°C hotter in the Arctic and 10°C in western and southern Africa. At this level, climate impacts will become more and more serious. //Extinctions are likely to increase sharply//<span class="Underline">, while extreme heat-waves, </span>forest die-offs<span class="Underline">, flooding</span> of major river deltas, persistent severe <span class="Underline">droughts</span>, mass migrations,33 <span class="Underline">wars and famines are all possible</span>. We may soon pass, or already have passed, the point at which, over the next few centuries, parts of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets melt irreversibly, with potential sea level rises of 1.5 and 2-3 metres respectively.34 Due to feedback<span class="Underline"> mechanisms</span> and poorly understood components of global climate, there is<span class="Underline"> even the possibility of </span>a //sudden, rapid catastrophic change//. For example, <span class="Underline">open </span>ocean absorbs more heat<span class="Underline"> from the sun than ice. </span>Melting permafrost35 and warming ocean bottom waters36 release carbon dioxide<span class="Underline"> and</span> the powerful greenhouse gas <span class="Underline">methane, driving further warming. </span>Carbon sinks will become<span class="Underline"> increasingly </span>ineffective37 as forests die off, soils dry out<span class="Underline"> and warmer oceans dissolve less carbon dioxide, so that </span>ecosystems may become //net contributors// of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, <span class="Underline">rather than</span> net <span class="Underline">absorbers</span> as today. The shade of clouds may diminish over warming oceans,38 while melting ice shelves may lead to sudden collapse of grounded ice, and hence rapid rises in sea level. The picture is complicated further by some offsetting effects, due for instance to increased plant growth in a warmer, more CO2-rich world. Changes in cloudiness, snowfall and albedo (reflectiveness) of vegetation may have warming or cooling effects. Such positive feedbacks may greatly accelerate warming. Unpredictable, <span class="Underline">non-linear effects can lead to</span> prolonged <span class="Underline">droughts</span> in the Mediterranean, California41 or West Africa,42 <span class="Underline">or to weakening of ocean circulation</span>43 with knock-on effects including a rise in North Atlantic sea levels of up to 1 metre, a <span class="Underline">collapse of fisheries, disruption of the South Asian monsoon</span>,44 <span class="Underline">and</span> possibly (albeit unlikely) <span class="Underline">sharp cooling in Europe</span>.45 Similar rapid changes are documented from Earth history, as at the end of the Ice Ages. At one time, at the end of the so-called Younger Dryas event around 12,000 years ago, Europe warmed by some 5°C within two decades.4" It seems<span class="Underline"> increasingly </span>clear, from geological studies, that<span class="Underline"> the </span>climate<span class="Underline"> system </span>is<span class="Underline"> unstable and </span>prone to //abrupt transitions// from one state to another, <span class="Underline">so further warming might trigger entirely unforeseen consequences</span>.47 We should not give in to alarmism, and such disastrous shifts are thought to be unlikely—but their consequences are serious enough to be worth guarding against. This is about as far as the weight of consensus has reached,48 Yet many individuals and corporations <span class="Underline">continue to </span>deny the reality of <span class="Underline">anthropogenic </span>climate change. The US petroleum and coal businesses, in particular certain commentators,49 and many of the general public across the world, 50 continue to maintain that the climate is not warming, that elevated carbon dioxide does not cause warming, that rising carbon dioxide and temperatures are not caused by humans, that the consequences of climate change will be benign, or some combination of these positions. Beyond this understanding, there remains great uncertainty and debate on how much warming will occur for given changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide, how serious the impacts of this warming will be, how the climate will change at regional and local levels, how much it is worth spending to reduce climate change,51 exactly what types of action we should take, and how we should go about encouraging global action. Despite extensive<span class="Underline"> and continuing </span>research<span class="Underline">, these major uncertainties will persist for the foreseeable future</span>. Some of the debate is a normative one, about the values of our civilisation, and therefore is not even capable of being solved by scientific inquiry. <span class="Underline">Such </span>uncertainty and controversy, though, is //not a reason for inaction//. After all, <span class="Underline">we ban</span> certain <span class="Underline">drugs</span> suspected to be carcinogenic, <span class="Underline">without waiting for absolute proof, and we will only know the truth about</span> some of these <span class="Underline">climate</span> change <span class="Underline">disasters when they actually strike</span>. I will take as my starting point here, in this fast-evolving area of research, the view that we should attempt to keep total warming below 2-3°C.52 The original goal of the EU, recommended by the International Climate Change Task Force, was for a maximum temperature rise of 2°C,53 but given the delay in taking major action, and the latest science, this already seems to be very tough to achieve. <span class="Underline">Anything above 2°C is already dangerous but</span>, with luck, avoiding rises over 3°C will prevent the //most damaging effects of climate change//<span class="Underline">. </span>Otherwise<span class="Underline">, we will venture into uncharted territory, where the risk of </span>abrupt<span class="Underline"> climatic </span>changes is //high//: 'Once the world has warmed by 4°C, conditions will be so different from anything we can observe today (and still more different from the last ice age) that it is inherently hard to say where the warming will stop.'55
====A preponderance of evidence proves warming is anthropogenic --- results in extinction.==== 
**Deibel 2007** (Terry – international relations at the Naval War College, Foreign Affairs Strategy: Logic of American Statecraft, Conclusion: American Foreign Affairs Strategy Today, p. 387-390)
Finally, there is one major //existential threat// to American security (as well as prosperity) <span class="Underline">of a nonviolent nature, which</span>, though far in the future, <span class="Underline">demands urgent action. It is</span> the threat of <span class="Underline">global </span>warming to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. <span class="Underline">Scientists worldwide have been observing</span> the gathering of this threat for three decades now, <span class="Underline">and what was once a mere possibility </span>has //passed through probability to near certainty//<span class="Underline">. Indeed </span>not one of//more than 900 articles// on climate change published in//refereed scientific journals// from 1993 to 2003 doubted<span class="Underline"> that anthropogenic </span>warming<span class="Underline"> is occurring. “In legitimate scientific circles,” writes</span> Elizabeth <span class="Underline">Kolbert, “</span>it is //virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement//<span class="Underline"> over the fundamentals of global warming.” </span>Evidence<span class="Underline"> from a vast international scientific monitoring effort </span>accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: an international panel predicts “brutal droughts, floods and violent storms across the planet over the next century”; climate change could “literally alter ocean currents, wipe away huge portions of Alpine Snowcaps and aid the spread of cholera and malaria”; “glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and…worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than a decade ago”; “rising sea temperatures have been accompanied by a significant global increase in the most destructive hurricanes”; “NASA scientists have concluded from direct temperature measurements that 2005 was the hottest year on record, with 1998 a close second”; “Earth’s warming climate is estimated to contribute to more than 150,000 deaths and 5 million illnesses each year” as disease spreads; “widespread bleaching from Texas to Trinidad…killed broad swaths of corals” due to a 2-degree rise in sea temperatures. “The world is slowly disintegrating,” concluded Inuit hunter Noah Metuq, who lives 30 miles from the Arctic Circle. “They call it climate change…but we just call it breaking up.” <span class="Underline">From the founding of the first cities</span> some 6,000 years ago <span class="Underline">until the beginning of the industrial revolution, </span>carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere <span class="Underline">remained relatively constant</span> at about 280 parts per million (ppm). <span class="Underline">At present they </span>are //accelerating toward 400 ppm//, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, <span class="Underline">we are</span> thus <span class="Underline">in for significant global warming; </span>//the only debate is how much and how serious the effects will be//. As the newspaper stories quoted above show, we are<span class="Underline"> already </span>experiencing the effects of 1-2 degree warming in more violent storms, <span class="Underline">spread of </span>disease<span class="Underline">, mass die offs</span> of plants and animals, species extinction<span class="Underline">, and</span> threatened <span class="Underline">inundation of low-lying countries</span> like the Pacific nation of Kiribati and the Netherlands at a warming of 5 degrees or less the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida, and inundate Manhattan up to the middle of Greenwich Village. Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation that keeps the winter weather in Europe far warmer than its latitude would otherwise allow. Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. But <span class="Underline">the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor</span> in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. <span class="Underline">Past ice age transitions</span>, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, <span class="Underline">took place in just decades</span>, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. <span class="Underline">Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “</span>humankind’s<span class="Underline"> continuing </span>enhancement of the<span class="Underline"> natural </span>greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and //humanity’s life support system//<span class="Underline">. At worst, says physics professor</span> Marty <span class="Underline">Hoffert of New York University, “we’re just going to </span>//burn everything up//; we’re going to heat the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, and then //everything will collapse//<span class="Underline">.” During the Cold War</span>, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the Untied States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possible end life on this planet. <span class="Underline">Global warming is the post-Cold War era’s equivalent of nuclear winter</span> at least as serious and //considerably better supported scientifically//<span class="Underline">. Over the long run it puts dangers from</span> terrorism and traditional <span class="Underline">military challenges to shame. It is a threat</span> not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially <span class="Underline">to the </span>//continued existence of life on this planet//.

Keep in mind that the current <span class="Underline">consequences of global warming</span> discussed in previous chapters are the result of a global average temperature increase of only 0.5 'C above the 1951-1980 average, and these consequences <span class="Underline">are beginning to accelerate</span>. Think about what is in store for us when the average global temperature is 1 °C higher than today. That is already in the pipeline, and there is nothing we can do to prevent it. We can only plan strategies for dealing with the expected consequences, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by about 60% as soon as possible to ensure that we don't experience even higher temperatures. <span class="Underline">There is</span> also <span class="Underline">the danger of eventually triggering an </span>abrupt climate change<span class="Underline"> that </span>would //accelerate global warming//<span class="Underline"> to a </span>//catastrophic level//in a //short period of time//.

Capture Can Tackle Carbon Dioxide Already in the Atmosphere
We will quite possibly discover, in the next ten, twenty, or thirty years, that our emissions abatements have been insufficient, and that the climate is much more sensitive than we had imagined.

====Ocean acidification results in extinction --- CO2 is the driver.==== 
**Parry**, 3/2/**2012** (Wynne – senior writer for LiveScience, Oceans Turning Acidic Faster than Past 300 Million Years, Live Science, p. http://www.livescience.com/18786-ocean-acidification-extinction.html)
The oceans are becoming<span class="Underline"> more </span>acidic<span class="Underline"> faster than</span> they have <span class="Underline">in the past 300 million years</span>, a period that includes four mass extinctions, researchers have found. Then, as is happening now, increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warmed the planet and made the oceans more acidic. These changes are associated with major shifts in climate and //mass extinctions//. But while past increases in the atmosphere's carbon dioxide levels resulted from volcanoes and other natural causes, <span class="Underline">today that spike is due to human activities, the scientists note. "What we're doing today really stands out," lead researcher</span> Bärbel <span class="Underline">Hönisch</span>, a paleoceanographer <span class="Underline">at Columbia University</span>'s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, <span class="Underline">said</span> in a news release. "We know that life during past ocean acidification events was not wiped out — new species evolved to replace those that died off. But if<span class="Underline"> industrial carbon </span>emissions continue at the current pace, <span class="Underline">we may lose organisms</span> we care about — coral reefs, oysters, salmon." [Humans Causing 6th Mass Extinction] <span class="Underline">As the level of carbon dioxide</span> in the atmosphere <span class="Underline">increases, </span>oceans<span class="Underline"> absorb that carbon dioxide, which </span>turns into a carbon acid. As a result the pH — a measure of acidity — drops, meaning the water has become more acidic. This dissolves the carbonates needed by some organisms, like corals, oysters or the tiny snails salmon eat. In their review, published Thursday (March 1) in the journal Science, Hönisch and colleagues found the closest modern parallel about 56 millions ago in what is called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, when atmospheric carbon concentrations doubled, pushing up global temperatures. Extinctions in the deep sea accompanied this shift. (The PETM occurred about 9 million years after the dinosaurs went extinct.) But, now, <span class="Underline">the ocean is acidifying at least </span>//10 times faster// than it did 56 million years ago, <span class="Underline">according to Hönisch</span>. Ocean acidification may also have occurred when volcanoes pumped massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the air 252 million years ago, at the end of the Permian period, and 201 million years ago, at the end of the Triassic period, they found. Both are associated with mass extinctions. "The current rate<span class="Underline"> of</span> (mainly fossil fuel) <span class="Underline">carbon dioxide release </span>stands out as capable of driving<span class="Underline"> a</span> combination and <span class="Underline">magnitude of ocean geochemical </span>changes potentially //unparalleled// in at least the last 300 million years of Earth history, raising the possibility that we are entering<span class="Underline"> an </span>//unknown territory of marine ecosystem change//<span class="Underline">," the researchers conclud</span>e in their paper.
====U.S. development of CCS is __necessary__ --- its role in the world __determines__ the rate of CO2 emissions.==== 
**Stephens**, 6/28/**2012** (Jennie – Assistant Professor of the Environmental Science and Policy Program in the Department of International Development for Community and Environment at Clark University, An Uncertain Future Capture and Storage for Carbon, Public Interest Report, Federation of American Scientists, p. [[http://www.fas.org/blog/pir/2012/06/28/an-uncertain-future-capture-and-storage-for-carbon-css/]])
As the coal-reliant countries of the world have been increasingly forced to consider reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to mitigate climate change, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged as a technology with critically important political influence. Visions of “clean” coal-fired power plants that will not emit CO2 into the atmosphere have provided powerful motivation for large public and private investments in CCS technology1. And the scale of<span class="Underline"> CO2 emission </span>reductions<span class="Underline"> deemed </span>necessary for //climate stabilization// is so large that some consider CCS a //necessary// //future technology// without which society will be //unable to mitigate// //climate change//<span class="Underline">. Despite growing interest and investment in CCS, the technology’s future remains uncertain and the pace of technological development has been </span>//slower//<span class="Underline"> than many had envisioned five or ten years ago</span>.2 STATUS OF CCS TECHNOLOGY CCS incorporates various technologies associated with capturing and transporting CO2 and storing the compressed gas somewhere other than the atmosphere. Most current conceptualizations of a complete CCS system focus on the potential of storing the CO2 in underground geologic reservoirs, although ocean storage and terrestrial storage have also been considered. The different components of a fully integrated CCS system are at various levels of technical readiness, but most parts of a full CCS system have been used and applied, often at a smaller scale, in other industrial applications. <span class="Underline">Despite growing interest and investment, a fully integrated coalfired power plant with CCS has not yet been demonstrated</span>.3There are, however, numerous small scale projects that focus on demonstrating a limited part of a full CCS system.4A public database maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory currently documents a total of 254 CCS projects, including proposed, active and cancelled projects.5These projects are geographically distributed in 27 countries including 65 projects focused on capture, 61 projects focused on storage, and 128 that involve both capture and storage. Of these projects, most are in the planning phase and only 20 are actually currently capturing and/or injecting CO2. Among the current priorities for advancing CCS are enhancing the capture process to reduce the energy intensity and cost of capture, demonstrating underground CO2 capture in a diverse set of geologic formations, and demonstrating and deploying integrated and scaled-up CCS power-plant systems that allow for “learning-by-doing.” A CHANGE IN COAL POLITICS IN THE UNITED STATES The potential of CCS technology has changed the politics of coal in many places, but its influence in the United States is particularly pronounced. The United States has so far focused its national response to climate change on technology rather than policy and is among the countries in the world that has invested most heavily in CCS.6 <span class="Underline">The scope and scale of </span>U.S. interest<span class="Underline"> in CCS </span>is critica<span class="Underline">l, because </span>due to its size, status, and<span class="Underline"> disproportionate </span>contribution to<span class="Underline"> accumulated CO2 </span>emissions, the //U//nited //S//tates <span class="Underline">has </span>//unique potential// for political and technological influence over//energy technology development// and //the trajectory of// //global atmospheric CO2 concentrations//<span class="Underline">. The magnitude of the U.S. reliance on coal (about 45 percent of the nation’s electricity</span> comes from coal) <span class="Underline">has been a dominant factor influencing</span> both <span class="Underline">national energy policy and the lack of national climate policy</span>. Politicians from regions of the country where the coal industry is most influential have been among the most powerful opponents of national climate change legislation. For coal states and politicians representing those states, however, CCS has provided a potential vision of a carbon constrained future in which the coal industry could still thrive. From a political perspective, therefore, the potential of CCS technology has been valuable in contributing to the engagement of critical actors in national climate policy discussions; CCS has enabled some constituents who had been previously reluctant to even acknowledge the challenges of climate change to engage in the climate-energy political discourse.

An aggressive R&D effort in the near term will yield significant dividends down the road, and should be undertaken immediately to help meet this urgent scientific challenge."Key findings in this study:• Coal is a low-cost, per BTU, mainstay of both the developed and developing world, and its use is projected to increase. Because of coal's high carbon content, increasing use will exacerbate the problem of climate change unless coal plants are deployed with very high efficiency and large scale CCS is implemented.• CCS is the critical enabling technology because it allows significant reduction in CO2 emissions while allowing coal to meet future energy needs.• A significant charge on carbon emissions is needed in the relatively near term to increase the economic attractiveness of new technologies that avoid carbon emissions and specifically to lead to large-scale CCS in the coming decades. We need large-scale demonstration projects of the technical, economic and environmental performance of an integrated CCS system. We should proceed with carbon sequestration projects as soon as possible. <span class="Underline">Several</span> integrated <span class="Underline">large-scale </span>demonstrations with appropriate measurement, monitoring and verification are needed<span class="Underline"> in the </span>//U//nited //S//tates over the next decade //with government support//<span class="Underline">. This is important for establishing public confidence for the</span> very <span class="Underline">large-scale sequestration program anticipated in the future</span>. The regulatory regime for large-scale commercial sequestration should be developed with a greater sense of urgency, with the Executive Office of the President leading an interagency process.• The U.S. government should provide assistance only to coal projects with CO2 capture in order to demonstrate technical, economic and environmental performance.• Today, IGCC appears to be the economic choice for new coal plants with CCS. However, this could change with further RD&D, so it is not appropriate to pick a single technology winner at this time, especially in light of the variability in coal type, access to sequestration sites, and other factors. The government should provide assistance to several "first of a kind" coal utilization demonstration plants, but only with carbon capture.• Congress should remove any expectation that construction of new coal plants without CO2 capture will be "grandfathered" and granted emission allowances in the event of future regulation. This is a perverse incentive to build coal plants without CO2 capture today.• <span class="Underline">Emissions will be stabilized only through </span>//global adherence//<span class="Underline"> to CO2 emission constraints. </span>China and India are //unlikely// to adopt<span class="Underline"> carbon </span>constraints //unless the U.S. does so and leads the way in the development of CCS technology//.

====__<span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Syrian Revolution marked a “civic awakening of millions of Arabs who had found their voices to prove that they were citizens</span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">, not subjects,” according to Mark Schnellbaecher. Millions of Arabs all throughout the Middle East united against their oppressive rulers for a common cause; freedom. A current resident on Cabrini’s campus, CRS associate Mark Schnellbaecher spoke on Tuesday, Nov. 13 as the keynote speaker for Cabrini Day. This particular Cabrini Day’s encompassing theme was “We the people, Democracy andDiversity,” appropriate for the celebration of St. Francis Xavier Cabrini’s feast day. “In many ways in today’s Middle East, history is actually current events,” Schnellbaecher said. The long and fractured history of the Arabs have influenced the current way that government and life are being run, and it is the generation of the technological age that wants to do something to change it. Schnellbaecher and many other experts believe that the root of the problem is Arabs’ religious differences and the freedom from a religious government that Arabs that some desire. “Islamist rulers draw no sharp line between religion and the rest of life,” Schnellbaecher said. “The fundamental question is how to reconcile faith and governance.” This concept of religious pluralism, or tolerance, is difficult to align with the Islamic religion. Islamists’ beliefs prevent them from simply instituting tolerance for many different reasons. “Contemporary Arab attitude toward religious difference have been shaped by the varying competing interpretations of Quranic scripture, by the Sunni-Shiite split,” Schnellbaecher said. The governments that took over after the uprisings occurred are now in the process of forming a better and more comprehensive democratic system for their people. “They face the very same massive socioeconomic challenges that confounded their authoritarian predecessors; widespread poverty, rising unemployment and growing income disparities,” Schnellbaecher said. Schnellbaecher’s speech was followed by a panel of faculty, as well as one student, each of whom had firsthand experience in the world of Middle Eastern turmoil. Professors Vonya Womack and Alia Sheety shared stories and insight of their time spent amongst the people living in the shadows of their governments.</span>====

Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) is a processconsisting of the separation of CO2from the emissions stream fromfossil-fuel combustion, transporting it to a storage location, andstoring it in a manner that ensures its long-term isolation from theatmosphere (IPCC,2005). Currently,themajorCCS effortsfocus on theremoval of CO2directly from industrial or utility plants and storing itin secure geological reservoirs. <span class="Underline">The rationale for </span>CCS<span class="Underline"> is to </span>allow thecontinued use of fossil fuels while reducing the emission of CO2intothe atmosphere, thereby mitigating **global** climate change.At present, <span class="Underline">fossil fuels are the dominant source of </span>global primary<span class="Underline">energy supply</span>, and they will likely remain so for the rest of thecentury. Fossil fuels supply over 85% of all primary commercialenergy; the rest is made up of nuclear energy, hydroelectricity, andrenewable energy (commercial biomass, geothermal, wind, and solarenergy).<span class="Underline">Although</span> great efforts and <span class="Underline">investments are being made</span> by manynations <span class="Underline">to increase</span> the share of <span class="Underline">renewable energy</span> in the primaryenergy supply and to foster conservation and efficiency improve-ments, addressing climate change concerns during the comingdecades will likely //require significant contributions from CCS//.

Today, its contribution is on the scale of millions of metric tons(megatons, Mt) per year. At present, only four large-scale CCS projectsare in operation (Table 1). All of these projects are injecting on theorder of 1 Mt CO2per year.

**Warming causes Middle East and African instability and war – it’s a threat multiplier** 
**Broder 11** (John, Writer for Green from the New York Times, “Climate Change Drives Instability, U.N. Official Warns,” 2/15/11, [[http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/climate-change-drives-instability-u-n-official-warns/]])

The United Nations’ top climate change official said on Tuesday that **__food shortages and rising prices caused by climate disruptions were among the chief contributors to the civil unrest coursing through North Africa and the Middle East.__** In a speech to Spanish lawmakers and military leaders, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations climate office, said **__that climate change-driven drought, falling crop yields and competition for water were fueling conflict throughout Africa and elsewhere in the developing world__**. She warned that **__unless nations took aggressive action to reduce emissions causing global warming such conflicts would spread, toppling governments and driving up military spending around the world__**. “It is alarming to admit that if the community of nations is unable to fully stabilize climate change, it will threaten where we can live, where and how we grow food and where we can find water,” said Ms. Figueres, a veteran Costa Rican diplomat and environmental advocate. “In other words, it will threaten the basic foundation – the very stability on which humanity has built its existence.” Rising food prices were a factor in the January riots that unseated Tunisia’s longtime president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, although decades of repression and high unemployment also fed the revolution. The link between food and resource shortages and Egypt’s revolution is less clear. But Ms. Figueres said that **__long-term trends in arid regions did not look promising unless the world took decisive action on climate change.__** She said that **__a third of all Africans now lived in drought-prone regions and that by 2050 as many as 600 million Africans would face water shortages.__** “On a global level, increasingly unpredictable weather patterns will lead to falling agricultural production and higher food prices, leading to food insecurity,” she said in her address. “**__In Africa, crop yields could decline by as much as 50 percent by 2020. Recent experiences around the world clearly show how such situations can cause political instability and undermine the performance of already fragile states__**.” She said that rising sea levels, more frequent and severe natural disasters, pandemics, heat waves and widespread drought could lead to extensive migrations within countries and across national borders. Military leaders around the world, including those in the United States, have warned that such **__effects of a changing climate can serve as “threat multipliers__**,” adding stresses to nations and regions that already face heavy burdens of poverty and social insecurity. “All these factors taken together,” Ms. Figueres concluded, “mean that **__climate change, especially if left unabated, threatens to increase poverty and overwhelm the capacity of governments to meet the basic needs of their people, which could well contribute to the emergence, spread and longevity of conflict.”__**

**Middle East war leads to nuclear war**

Graduate of Columbia University, 1960 and the recipient of a Ph.D. from New York University, 1966, “The Coming Crisis In The Middle East,” 6/28/10, The Gatestone Institute, [[http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/1387/coming-crisis-in-the-middle-east]])

**__The coming storm in the Middle East is gaining momentum__**; like conditions prior to World War I, **__all it takes for explosive action to commence is a trigger__**. Turkey's provocative flotilla, often described in Orwellian terms as a humanitarian mission, has set in motion a gust of diplomatic activity: if the Iranians send escort vessels for the next round of Turkish ships, which they have apparently decided not to do in favor of land operations, it could have presented a casus belli. [cause for war] **__Syria, too, has been playing a dangerous game__**, with both missile deployment and rearming Hezbollah. According to most public accounts, Hezbollah is sitting on 40,000 long-, medium- and short-range missiles, and Syrian territory has been serving as a conduit for military materiel from Iran since the end of the 2006 Lebanon War. **__Should Syria move its own scuds to Lebanon or deploy its troops as reinforcement for Hezbollah, a wider regional war with Israel could not be contained__**. In the backdrop is **__an Iran, with sufficient fissionable material to produce a couple of nuclear weapons__**. It **__will take some time to weaponize the missiles, but the road to that goal is synchronized in green lights since neither diplomacy nor diluted sanctions can convince Iran to change course__**. From Qatar to **__Afghanistan__** all political eyes are on Iran, poised to be "**__the hegemon" in the Middle East; it is increasingly considered the "strong horse" as American forces incrementally retreat from the region.__** Even Iraq, ironically, may depend on Iranian ties in order to maintain internal stability. For Sunni nations like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, regional strategic vision is a combination of deal-making to offset the Iranian Shia advantage, and attempting to buy or develop nuclear weapons as a counterweight to Iranian ambition. However, both of these governments are in a precarious state; should either fall, all bets are off in the Middle East neighborhood. It has long been said that the Sunni "tent" must stand on two legs: if one, falls, the tent collapses. Should this tent collapse, and **__should Iran take advantage of that calamity, it could incite a Sunni-Shia war. Or feeling empowered, and no longer dissuaded by an escalation scenario, Iran, with nuclear weapons in tow, might decide that a war against Israel is a distinct possibility__**. However implausible it may seem at the moment, the possible annihilation of Israel and the prospect of a second holocaust could lead to a nuclear exchange**__. The only wild card that can change this slide into warfare is an active United States' policy.__** Yet, curiously, the U.S. is engaged in both an emotional and physical retreat from the region. Despite rhetoric which suggests an Iran with nuclear weapons is intolerable, the U.S. has done nothing to forestall this eventual outcome. Despite the investment in blood and treasure to allow a stable government to emerge in Iraq, the anticipated withdrawal of U.S. forces has prompted President Maliki to travel to Tehran on a regular basis. Further, despite historic links to Israel that gave the U.S. leverage in the region as well a democratic ally, the Obama administration treats Israel as a national security albatross that must be disposed of as soon as possible. As a consequence, the U.S. is perceived in the region as the "weak horse," the one dangerous to ride. In every Middle East capital the words "unreliable and United States" are linked. Those individuals seeking a moderate course of action are now in a distinct minority. A political vacuum is emerging, one that is not sustainable and one the Iranian leadership looks to with imperial exhilaration. It is no longer a question of whether war will occur, but rather when it will occur, and where it will break out. There are many triggers to ignite the explosion, but not many scenarios for containment. Could it be a regional war in which Egypt and Saudi Arabia watch from the sidelines, but secretly wish for Israeli victory? Or will this be a war in which there aren't victors, only devastation? Moreover, should war break out, what does the U.S. do? This is a description far more dire than any in the last century and, even if some believe that it is overly pessimistic, Arab and Jew, Persian and Egyptian, Muslim and Maronite tend to believe in its veracity -- a truly bad sign.

The subject of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) for power sta-tions running on coal or natural gas is both important and promi-nent. <span class="Underline">The application of CCS to other industries</span> which have largecarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions <span class="Underline">is</span> equally <span class="Underline">important</span> but much lessprominent. Industry accounts for 40% of global energy-related CO2emissions. In 2007 the global figure for direct CO2emissions fromindustry was 7.6 Gte of direct CO2emissions to which could beadded3.9 GteofindirectCO2emissionsfrompowerstationssupply-ingelectricityto industry[1]. The much-quotedIEA‘‘blue map’’sce-nario for halving global CO2emissions between 2005 and 2050shows a 19% contribution from CCS which is split roughly equallybetween the power generation sector and the rest of industry [1].Intuitively it would seem obvious that financial benefits couldbe available from building CO2pipelines to serve the needs of acluster of CO2emitters (both industrial and power-sector) com-pared with a collection of point-to-point transportation and stor-age solutions. <span class="Underline">Confirmation comes from </span>the economic cost model developed by McCoy and Rubin which draws<span class="Underline"> by analogy </span>upon<span class="Underline"> as-built costs for </span>//263 natural gas pipelines// built in the USA be-tween 1995 and 2005. <span class="Underline">Their cost model </span>shows that return on investment is //significantly more dependant on pipeline capacity//<span class="Underline">and on cost of capital </span>//than on any other factor// that they considered[2]. <span class="Underline">Further confirmation is provided by Middleton and Bielicki</span>when they quantify the cost of networks up to 50 Mte/year andcompare them with point-to-point solutions [3].The <span class="Underline">previous</span> UK government’s <span class="Underline">CCS strategy includes the comment that</span> ‘‘the <span class="Underline">establishment of an </span>embryonic UK <span class="Underline">CO2</span>transportand storage infrastructure may //sustain existing and future investment in carbon intensive process industries through the assurance that they will be able to access a system to handle their CO2when the carbon market drives them to CCS’’// [4]. <span class="Underline">It also talks about</span> thepossibility of <span class="Underline">storing CO2on behalf of other countries</span>. For at least10 years, Norway has also been considering the merits of develop-ing a CO2infrastructure and extending it to handle much of Northern Europe’s industrial CO2emissions [5].A number of regional studies have been carried out to investi-gate the potential for CO2cluster development. A study of theYorkshire and Humber area in the UK found that 90% of the re-gion’s 90 Mte/year of CO2emissions comes from 12 large CO2emit-ters, and developed some ideas for building a CO2collection andstorage network [6]. A Scottish study makes a case for building aCO2collection network to transport 20 Mte/year of CO2for ulti-mate storage under the North Sea [7]. A Portuguese study dividesthe country’s 27 biggest CO2 emitters into three clusters andidentifies suitable storage sites [8]. An Italian study identifies an8 Mte/year CO2cluster in the industrialised part of Northern Italyand links it to three storage sites [9]. A large-scale study in Califor-nia links 37 potential sources to 14 potential reservoirs, with theprospect of storing up to 50 Mte/year of CO2[3]. <span class="Underline">Similar studies have been carried out</span> in North East England, the Rotterdam area,the Northern Netherlands, Germany and at various other locations<span class="Underline">in the USA</span>.

? Geologic <span class="Underline">sequestration is not economically</span> or technically <span class="Underline">feasible within North Carolina</span> An assessment of geologic storage in North Carolina reveals little available storage capacity.

The timing of the carbon capture and pipeline<span class="Underline"> system</span> //dramatically affects the net// present //value// (NPV) //of the whole system//, and the price of CO2 has considerable influence over the timing of building capture equipment and pipeline. The optimal timing of the pipeline for a given CO2 price is different with IGCC than with SPC. At a CO2 price of $7.2 per ton ($15 per ton levelized)9, IGCC becomes cost-effective on a NPV basis, assuming CCS is brought on-line in 2027. This scenario would avoid almost 800 million tons of CO2 over its lifetime compared to SPC with CCS (CCS and pipeline beginning in 2039).

====No risk of earthquakes or leaks --- best studies and analysis are on our side.==== 
**Peridas**, 6/26/**2012** (George – scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council Climate Center, CCS and Earthquakes – Anything to Worry About?, p. http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/community/blogs/authors/gperidas/2012/06/26/ccs-and-earthquakes-anything-worry-about-0)
Zoback and Gorelick however <span class="Underline">appear to have </span>been causing //undue alarm in the media//. They state (p. 2) that their “principal concern is not that injection associated with CCS projects is likely to trigger large earthquakes; the problem is that even small to moderate earthquakes threaten the seal integrity of a CO2 repository”. They acknowledge that only slip on large faults can result in earthquakes large enough to cause damage to human environments, and that such faults are easily identified and avoided. No objections on that last point. <span class="Underline">The potential for</span> slip on existing faults/<span class="Underline">fractures</span> and seismicity can and should be taken into account during site selection. This is routinely done as part of a proper geomechanical assessment, and Federal Underground Injection Control Program regulations for geologic sequestration operation<span class="Underline">s</span> require “[i]nformation on the seismic history including the presence and depth of seismic sources and a determination that the seismicity would not interfere with containment”.1 Large seismic events can be avoided in a straightforward way through proper siting and operations. <span class="Underline">Zoback’s and Gorelick’s </span>arguments against CCS hinge on the assertion that “[b]ecause laboratory studies show that just a few millimeters of shear displacement are capable of enhancing fracture and joint permeability, several centimeters of slip would be capable of creating a permeable hydraulic pathway that could compromise the seal integrity of the CO2 reservoir and potentially reach the near surface.” In plain English, the authors are saying that even a small earthquake can cause CO2 to escape all the way to the surface, without investigating the circumstances under which this might happen or their applicability to broad scale CCS. This creates the impression that it will happen in every case, and <span class="Underline">is </span>a big logical leap and a //gross simplification//, for several reasons. First, <span class="Underline">the laboratory studies they cite were performed on granite, </span>which is extremely unlikely to be used as a sealing lay<span class="Underline">er</span>, or “caprock” in a real-life sequestration projec<span class="Underline">t</span>. Almost certainly, the caprock will be shale or another low permeability sedimentary rock. <span class="Underline">The way</span> that a strong but brittle rock like granite deforms in response to stress is very different<span class="Underline"> from</span> the way that softer and //more ductile shales// and other sedimentary rocks deform, <span class="Underline">and is therefore not a good analogue</span>.2 Second, <span class="Underline">concluding</span> de facto <span class="Underline">that</span> joint and <span class="Underline">fracture</span> permeability in the caprock(s) <span class="Underline">would increase</span> in all cases, <span class="Underline">and</span> that a pathway would be created that would <span class="Underline">result in the </span>migration of CO2 to the surface, is wrong. The degree to which joint and fracture permeability is increased, if at all, <span class="Underline">depends on many factors, including rock type, stress state, and in-filling materials. This is </span>//well documented in a large body of literature// on shear-induced behavior of fractures and faults (if you want a flavor, take a look here3 for example). In fact, <span class="Underline">situations abound where many large faults that </span>exhibit large slip act as seals and have //no effect on permeability//<span class="Underline">. Such is the case in California and </span>Iran, where trapped oil and gas exists despite frequent large natural earthquakes. In these areas, in fact, <span class="Underline">faults</span> themselves <span class="Underline">have acted as seals as opposed to pathways</span> for fluid migration, <span class="Underline">and </span>//trapped hydrocarbons// over geologic time. Another well-documented event is the magnitude 6.8 earthquake in <span class="Underline">Chuetsu</span>, which //did not result in any leaks//<span class="Underline"> in the nearby Nagaoka CO2 injection project. </span>Despite //frequent// and //large// natural earthquakes therefore, CO2 and other fluids <span class="Underline">have remained </span>trapped in the subsurface. Additionally, <span class="Underline">assuming that CO2 will reach the surface implies that the fault</span> in question <span class="Underline">extends from the injection zone to the surface. </span>As the authors themselves note, such a large fault would be //easy to identify and avoid//<span class="Underline">. Even if a f</span>ault allows CO2 to migrate out of the injection zone, many sites also have //multiple sealing layers// that impede the motion of fluids to the surface as well as multiple permeable layers that can act as secondary containers. In fact, <span class="Underline">studies show that such layered systems can help prevent fluids from reaching the surface</span>.4 Assuming that a pathway will be created all the way to the surface is a huge leap of logic. Fluids can and do move along faults and fractures – but this does not mean that the containment “box” has been breached – fluids can simply move within the “box”, leaving the caprocks intact. In other words, <span class="Underline">jumping to the conclusion that a small induced earthquake would result in surface leakage is wrong</span>. That’s not to say that it cannot happen, but the problem with the authors’ assertion is that they then postulate that not enough sites for sequestration can be found that avoid this scenario to meaningfully deploy CCS at scale. Although they acknowledge that certain geological settings are ideally suited to secure sequestration of CO2, such as <span class="Underline">in the case of the Sleipner project in Norway</span> (which features a highly porous and permeable reservoir consisting of weak, poorly cemented sandstone that is laterally extensive), <span class="Underline">they</span> then <span class="Underline">extrapolate that not enough sites like Sleipner can be found</span> around the U.S. to house the necessary volumes of CO2 to mitigate climate change. <span class="Underline">This </span>extrapolation is based on //speculation// and comes with //no scientific justification//. The authors do not study the potential for sites like Sleipner – i.e. with sufficient porosity and permeability to accommodate injected CO2 without giving rise to unacceptable stresses – to be found around the country. This can only be done with a rigorous geologic assessment, and <span class="Underline">there is </span>//no evidence// to suggest that such sites cannot be found in sufficient numbers.<span class="Underline"> Not all sequestration sites need to be slam-dunk cases</span> with porosity and permeability <span class="Underline">like Sleipner’s</span> in order to safely accommodate CO2. Of course – wouldn’t it be nice if things were ideal everywhere, but a wide range of geological settings can also accommodate CO2 safely without causing unacceptable seismicity risk. <span class="Underline">The </span>regulation of maximum allowable pressure, evaluation of seismic risk, and of the conditions in whic<span class="Underline">h</span> transmissive faults would threaten groundwater is central to //Federal regulations under the Underground Injection Control Program//. Industry and regulators should take note, however: even though smaller earthquakes caused by injection may cause no physical damage or human harm, the public may reject the idea of CO2 injection if these quakes and perceptible. <span class="Underline">Zoback and Gorelick’s assertions were met with skepticism by expert scientists</span>. Sally <span class="Underline">Benson (Stanford professor</span> of Energy Resources Engineering and Director of Stanford's Global Climate and Energy Project, and Lead Coordinating Author of the Underground Geological Storage Chapter in the IPCC Special Report on CCS) <span class="Underline">said</span> “of course, you need to pick sites carefully, but <span class="Underline">finding</span> these kinds of locations does not seem infeasible”. I think Rob <span class="Underline">Finley</span> hit the nail on the head when he <span class="Underline">compared Zoback and Gorelick's analysis to early criticisms of the Wright brothers</span> and the notion at the time that airplanes would never work at scale. <span class="Underline">Rob is the principal investigator of the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium</span>, which is now operating a large CO2 injection project in Decatur, Illinois, <span class="Underline">and has spent considerable time</span> and money <span class="Underline">investigating the geology of the Illinois Basin</span>. Julio Friedmann at Lawrence Livermore National Lab points out that “[b]y 2020, we're going to have somewhere between 15 and 20 projects around the world. That will be a good time to assess what we've learned and whether [CCS] can be scaled up more.” <span class="Underline">The last</span> in the series of <span class="Underline">international conferences</span> on the subject <span class="Underline">attracted 1,500 people. </span>//None of them appear to have voiced the seeming impossibilities for CCS// that Zoback and Gorelick describe in their “Perspective”. <span class="Underline">Should we</span> therefore <span class="Underline">be alarmed by the prospect of CO2 injection in terms of earthquakes?</span> My view is “//no//” – we should however be vigilant. Improperly conducted CCS does have the potential to cause earthquakes, due to the volumes of CO2 injected. But preventing and predicting these is within our capabilities. Avoiding the large ones is straightforward. It is worth noting that large natural earthquakes have not compromised the storage security in natural and man-made sites that trap CO2 and hydrocarbons. This does not mean, of course, that we should tolerate CCS projects that could cause earthquakes. Avoiding smaller quakes that may not cause harm but may alarm the public and local communities will require will careful site operation and regulation. And that can and must be done. Regulators and prospective injectors, do your homework.

====CO2 transportation infrastructure investment reduces the barriers and spills over to the development of CCS technology.====

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Establishing a widespread </span>//<span style="font-size: 7pt;">CO2 transportation infrastructure</span>//<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> requires a strategic approach that takes into account the magnitude of potential deployment scenarios for CCS with hundreds of megatonnes (Mt) of CO2 transported every year through pipeline systems. Transporting CO2 by pipeline is not a new technology; in the US almost 4,000 miles of CO2 pipeline for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) are in operation. However, </span><span class="Underline" style="font-size: 7pt;">the infrastructure for mass CCS</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> could be on the scale of the current gas transmission infrastructure for Europe or North America, and </span><span class="Underline" style="font-size: 7pt;">will require significant investment to construct and operate. The CO2 Capture Project</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (a partnership of seven oil and gas majors to advance CCS) has been looking at the issues surrounding the economics of transportation of CO2 in common carrier network pipeline systems. The CCP </span><span class="Underline" style="font-size: 7pt;">commissioned a study to examine different approaches to infrastructure development</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In the study two approaches have been evaluated. The first would see the development of a point-to-point system, the second the development of common carrier pipeline networks, including backbone pipeline systems. This study has helped our understanding of the challenges involved; shedding light on what would be the best scenario and how in practical terms CO2 infrastructure might evolve. The results of this study were presented in a paper - Assessing issues of financing a CO2 transportation pipeline infrastructure commissioned by the CCP, and completed by Environmental Resources Management (ERM). </span>Results of the Study <span class="Underline">The study confirmed that an integrated backbone pipeline network is likely to be the </span>//most efficient long-term option//<span class="Underline">. It offers the </span>//lowest average cost// on a per tonne basis for operators over the life of the projects if sufficient capacity utilization is achieved relatively early in the life of the pipeline. Crucially, integrated pipelines //reduce the barriers to entry// and are more likely to //lead to the faster development and deployment of carbon capture and storage//. Particularly in situations where government money is being used to finance CO2 transportation it makes sense to pursue an integrated approach that provides equitable, open access to other large final emitters. This will reduce the barriers to entry and will //encourage faster adoption of CCS//. However, point-topoint pipelines offer lower costs for the first movers and do not have the same capacity utilization risk. It is clear that //without government incentives//<span class="Underline"> for</span> the development of optimized <span class="Underline">networks, project developers are likely to build point-to-point pipelines</span>. Other forms of financial support may be needed which overcome commercial barriers and ensure optimized development of CO2 pipeline networks So what is the way forward? Guaranteed capacity utilization is essential for integrated backbone pipeline networks to become economically viable. Public policy is needed that provides some guarantees as to capacity utilization. <span class="Underline">Government incentives</span> or loan guarantees <span class="Underline">are</span> also <span class="Underline">needed to </span>//support a backbone infrastructure and encourage the development of optimized networks//<span class="Underline">. Government support</span> in the first years, when capacity is ramping up, <span class="Underline">will be essential for eventual </span>//commercial viability//.
