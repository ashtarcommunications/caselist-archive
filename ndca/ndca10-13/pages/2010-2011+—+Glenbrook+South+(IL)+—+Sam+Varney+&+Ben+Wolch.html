2. Lack of US action catalyzes regional actors-solve Iran Prolif<br />
Kerstein 10 <strong>(Benjamin, senior writer for the New Ledger, &quot;The inevitable Nuclear Iran&quot;, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://newledger.com/2010/06/the-inevitable-nuclear-iran/print/" rel="nofollow">http://newledger.com/2010/06/the-inevitable-nuclear-iran/print/</a></span>, JS)</strong><br />
<strong>It is now all but certain that the American administration has more or less resigned itself to a nuclear Iran. At the very least, it appears to have decided to take no military action against the Iranian nuclear program, nor even to support or encourage – publicly or discreetly – the Iranian popular opposition to the Ahmadinejad regime. The Obama administration will likely continue to pursue its policy of promoting engagement, either out of cynicism or naiveté, while simultaneously busying itself with the diplomatic give and take of arranging international support for sanctions which are unlikely to be effective. It is entirely possible, moreover, that American exhaustion from a decade of war and its public’s concentration on pressing domestic problems will effectively vitiate any political damage that might result from the emergence of a nuclear Iran. This, at any rate, is likely what Obama and the doves in his administration are counting on. At first glance, this appears to be a disastrous state of affairs. But it need not be so. A nuclear armed Iran may be considered the lesser of possible evils by the United States, but it cannot be seen this way by others. To many Americans, the Iranian threat appears to be comfortably distant. This is something of a willful illusion, of course, but it is a politically influential and perhaps decisive one. For Iran’s neighbors, however, as well as many nations on their periphery, the threat is far more immediate. Israeli concerns are naturally the most intense, given the Iranian president’s openly racist and genocidal attitude toward the Jewish state. But Israel is hardly alone in its concerns. If, as many suspect, the ultimate goal of the Iranian theocrats is the establishment of Iranian hegemony in the Middle East and thus the de facto seizure of the leadership of the Muslim world, then almost everyone in the region and many beyond have an interest in preventing such an outcome. The Arab nations (Iran, it should be remembered, is not an Arab state) have squabbled among themselves for decades over leadership and hegemony, with the prize generally going to Egypt. Saudi Arabia, however, home to the most sacred sites and objects of Islam, as well as vast oil wealth, has long harbored its own sense of ancient entitlement. Jordan’s interest remains solely the stability and survival of its anachronistic monarchy. Iraq, still in the throes of its post-totalitarian regeneration, is Iran’s longtime rival, and its large Sunni and Kurdish minorities are unlikely to encourage Iranian dominance on Iraqi borders. These are only a few examples, but they serve to demonstrate the degree to which a newly hegemonic Iran would frustrate and threaten many of the most powerful players in the Middle East. Even Syria, which has established a cordial unofficial alliance with Iran in service of its continuing domination of Lebanon through Hezbollah terrorism, might find itself having second thoughts in the face of an Iran suddenly become much more powerful than Syria itself. Such concerns are even more prominent outside the Arab world. India is far away from the Middle East, but radical Islamic terrorism has taken many Indian lives, and the prospect of a nuclear armed Islamic republic and its possible galvanization of Islamic movements in and around India – especially in its longtime rival Pakistan – cannot be a particularly sanguine prospect. To the north, Russia is currently in the midst of an attempt to resurrect its own regional hegemony while simultaneously fighting its own long war against domestic and foreign Islamic radicalism. China, while perhaps hoping to remain aloof from a region it considers outside of its sphere of influence, is having its own problems with a burgeoning Islamic movement. Turkey, as has been amply demonstrated in recent weeks, is currently moving toward some kind of alignment with Iran, but the ruling AKP party has a large and by no means dormant secular opposition, and they likely do not desire to see their rivals strengthened by the emergence of a hegemonic Islamic theocracy. Europe, ironically, has recently been far more proactive than the United States on this issue, and there are some fairly obvious reasons for this. There is not only the threat of radical Islam both outside and inside European borders, but the realization that, missile technology being what it is, an Iranian nuclear bomb could eventually threaten Europe as easily as the nations of the Middle East. A few years ago, no one could have anticipated that France, for example, would be ahead of America on this issue, but in many ways it makes sense, if only because of the brute facts of physical proximity. While there is and will remain a large and powerful European lobby in favor of appeasement, Europe nonetheless seems to be waking up to the realization that on this matter they may well be left to fend for themselves. Paradoxically, then, this confluence of interests has at least the potential to overcome the Obama administration’s policy of resignation and successfully avert the Iranian threat. It is impossible, for course, for such disparate interests to band together in any formal way, but a quiet, tacit alliance of convenience – and, perhaps more importantly, fear – is by no means unthinkable. While any military action against Iran will almost certainly be solely Israeli, the lead up to any action and the subsequent fallout will certainly involve many of the parties mentioned above. In the context, it is important to note that it is not merely likely that the Obama administration will not support an Israeli strike on the Iranian nuclear program, but it seems increasingly clear that it will actively oppose one and perhaps try to prevent it from occurring. If this does prove to be the case, then the influence of other nations will prove to be decisive. A careful indifference on the part of the Arab states, for example, or a round of denunciations concealing a policy of inaction, would eliminate Israel’s worst fears of sparking a regional war. Similarly, a tacit silence on the part of Russia, India, and China would do a great deal to deter the Obama administration from taking active steps to prevent a strike or to punish Israel should one occur, especially considering the administration’s active fetishization of maintaining good public relations in these emerging (or in Russia’s case, reemerging) superpowers. It is impossible, of course, to imagine that Europe will openly come out in favor of an Israeli military strike, but a concerted effort on the part of anti-appeasement forces on the continent could serve as a countervailing force both to its own domestic opponents and to the Obama administration. Even a split within the European establishment on the question would allow Israel considerable room to maneuver, and render diplomatic attempts at obstruction or punishment largely ineffective. Considering American public opinion on the issue, it would also be difficult for Obama to take an openly anti-Israel position without unanimous European support. His only supporters would likely be in the media, and while they can make a great deal of noise, they are nonetheless always destined to be the dogs barking while the camels pass. A president of the United States cannot afford to be loved by the BBC and no one else, though there are indications that this president may well think he can. The point of all this is not to engage in hypothetical scenarios or wishful fantasies. It is simply to emphasize that the emergence of a nuclear Iran is not inevitable. That is, the basic concept behind Obama’s foreign policy on Iran – that there is nothing we can do about it and we might as well resign ourselves to the inevitable and make the best of it – is not merely a self-fulfilling prophecy but also simply untrue. It is simply defeatism dressed up as realpolitik. The truth is that even a cursory look at the big picture reveals a strong majority of nations whose interests stand to be damaged by the emergence of a hegemonic Iranian theocracy. And the possible negative repercussions of attempting to exploit this confluence of interests appear to pale in comparison to those that will follow Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons. With a little creative diplomacy, this fact can be turned to the advantage of all these nations, but only if they are prepared to move beyond the idea that the United States must take the lead in all such crises. And this is perhaps the saddest aspect of the entire situation. If the Iranian nuclear program is successfully stopped, it will only be because Barack Obama should have been more careful in wishing for a post-American world. He will have gotten it, but not in the way he would have liked. The tragedy of Obamaism is painfully obvious when one considers that, as long as Obama is president, a nuclear Iran is avoidable only if concerted opposition to it is undertaken without the United States.</strong><br />

According to one study, in 2000, cross border trade reached nearly $1 billion, a figure that increased to $4 billion in 2005. In 2008, cross-border trade between the two states passed $10 billion annually (see table 1 below and the two charts). Turkey became Iran's 5th largest trading partner that year. According to the IMF, some Turkish officials, including state minister Cevet Yilmaz, and some Iranian news sources, trade fell to $5.63 billion in 2009 due to a slowdown in the global economy. Despite these reports, both Tehran and several government officials in Ankara, including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, maintain a figure of over $10 billion and have stated a goal to triple this figure by 2015.</strong> UN Sanctions on Iran <strong>The UN Security Council has imposed a series of four separate sanctions on Iran because of its refusal to cooperate with the IAEA and its subsequent refusal to suspend its nuclear enrichment program, which is viewed as a precursor for building nuclear weapons. The first set of sanctions was imposed in December 2006 under Resolution 1737. The resolution called on states to block Iran's import and export of &quot;sensitive nuclear material and equipment&quot; and to freeze the financial assets of those involved in Iran's nuclear activities. With Iran's nuclear program ongoing, in March 2007 the Security Council voted to toughen sanctions by passing Resolution 1747, which banned all of Iran's arms exports. It also froze the assets and restricted the travel of people it deemed involved in the nuclear program. Further restrictions imposed in March 2008 in Resolution 1803 encouraged scrutiny of the dealings of Iranian banks. It also called upon countries to inspect cargo planes and ships entering or leaving Iran if there were &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; to believe they were carrying goods prohibited by previous resolutions. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:63:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@_ednref12&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: _ednref12&quot;/&gt; --><a name="_ednref12"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:63 --><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn12" rel="nofollow">[12</a></span>] UN Security Council Resolution 1929 of June 9, 2010, has so far been the most comprehensive in terms of sanctions on Iran. The Resolution targeted goods and services supporting Iran's nuclear and missile program. The Resolution prohibits the supply of heavy military equipment to Iran, targets Iranian investment in business relating to missile technology, and, perhaps most significantly, calls on states to prevent the provision of financial services, including insurance or re-insurance, and the transfer of any financial or other assets or resources where there is reason to believe that such services, assets, or resources could contribute to Iran's proliferation programs.<!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:64:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@_ednref13&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: _ednref13&quot;/&gt; --><a name="_ednref13"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:64 --><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn13" rel="nofollow">[13</a></span>] The Resolution was passed by 13 votes, and only two rotating member countries - Turkey and Brazil - voted against [the resolution] it, because their attempt to broker a deal with Iran regarding its uranium enrichment program was rejected by the U.S. and the European countries.

The sanctions went beyond the fourth set of UN sanctions imposed over Tehran's refusal to freeze nuclear work and follow similar sanctions imposed by the United States and Australia. The EU measures include a ban on the sale of equipment, technology, and services to Iran's energy sector, hitting activities in refining, liquefied natural gas, exploration, and production. New investments in the energy sector are banned. The Iranian banking sector was also hit by restrictions, forcing any transaction over 40,000 Euros ($52,000) to be authorized by EU governments before they can go ahead.

There are many reasons why the sanctions will hurt. The most significant aspect of the sanctions is the inability of Iran's ships to secure maritime insurance, without which they will be denied access to European ports. By one account Iran received only three shipments of gasoline so far this month, because tankers carrying gasoline destined for Iran were diverted because of the sanctions.<!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:69:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@_ednref18&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: _ednref18&quot;/&gt; --><a name="_ednref18"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:69 --><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn18" rel="nofollow">[18</a></span>] Iran will also have problems opening letters of credit for its business transactions with Western suppliers. It will mean that Iran will need to cover many of these transactions by cash or through intermediaries. which will increase the cost of the transactions. The United Arab Emirates was among the first to take measures against Iran. This is quite significant because Dubai, one of the seven emirates of the UAE, was the principal transit port for goods destined for Iran. UAE closed down 40 international and local firms as part of a crackdown on companies that violate UN sanctions on Iran. These corporations have been dealing in &quot;dual-use and dangerous materials barred under UN resolutions and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.&quot; The UAE has declared its commitment to carry out the sanctions in full.<!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:70:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@_ednref19&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: _ednref19&quot;/&gt; --><a name="_ednref19"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:70 --><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn19" rel="nofollow">[19</a></span>] Even Venezuela, whose leader Hugo Chavez is a close friend and ally of Ahmadinedjad, is having a problem meeting a prior commitment to ship 20,000 tons of benzene daily to Iran.

While Turkey has declared that it will honor UN sanctions, it made it clear that it will not adhere to sanctions imposed by individual countries (referring to the U.S., EU countries, Australian, and Canada). By its words and action Turkey appears determined to provide Iran a safety net, while at the same time promoting, in the words of the Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, &quot;closer trade links with Iran.&quot; After a number of international and private companies have stopped selling refined oil products to Iran, state-owned Turkish refiner Tupras has stepped up its sale of oil to Iran. With Dubai imposing restrictions on transit goods to Iran, the Turkish foreign economic relations board said that Turkey's ports of Mersin and Trabzon will fill the slack. Turkey is also offering Istanbul in lieu of Dubai as an attractive place for real estate investments by Iranians. Turkey will watch Russia and China to determine how far it can go in ignoring U.S. unilateral sanctions. On the other hand, Turkish banks appear to be more reluctant to violate the sanctions because the value of Turkish export to Iran is merely $2 billion, which is too small an amount for the Turkish banks to risk falling under punitive measures by the US/EU. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:74:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@_ednref23&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: _ednref23&quot;/&gt; --><a name="_ednref23"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:74 --><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn23" rel="nofollow">[23</a></span>] The real danger is that Turkey can help Iran circumvent sanctions by smuggling banned freight over the common border.<!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:75:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@_ednref24&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: _ednref24&quot;/&gt; --><a name="_ednref24"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:75 --><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn24" rel="nofollow">[24</a></span>]And it would be necessary to watch whether Turkish imports of certain goods register a large and sudden spike.</strong> Iran and Turkey Ink Deal to Construct New Gas Pipeline <strong>Notwithstanding the sanctions that restrict investment in Iran's energy sector, Iran and Turkey signed a contract for the construction of a 660km (412.5 miles) gas pipeline which will pass through Turkey and transfer Iran's national gas to Europe, at a cost of one billion euros.</strong><br />

<strong>Yet, every great power needs a regional wing man, and Turkey seems to be the reliable partner the U.S. wants in this corner of the world. The relationship between the U.S. and Iran has been a cold one since the 1979 Islamic revolution; there has been no love lost. Any expectations that the U.S. could ever tame Iran by itself are fanciful at best. For Iran, the West has lost all credibility, and Iranian suspicions still exist as to what Turkey’s actual motive might be in meditating Iran’s fight against the world. After all, Turkey was once the superpower in the region during the Ottoman heyday, and for hundreds of years it was Persians vs. Ottomans over supremacy in the neighboring expanse. Turkish foreign policy aims to be a regional power once more; it continues to rise from the ashes of the Treaty of Sevres, a treaty that nearly led to the modern Republic of Turkey being swallowed up by other international actors. However, if Iran is worried about Turkey for those reasons, then they are sorely mistaken. The Turks are not trying to re-create the glory days of the Empire; they are trying to tame their neighbors. Unfortunately, as of late, it seems Iran is rebuking Turkish advances and support. Ironically, soon after Obama gave his support to Turkey, Iran made an announcement that it did not need Turkish mediation in its struggles with the world community and that it would continue its uranium enrichment program as is. This declaration came only one day after Obama said he had told Erdoğan “how important it is to resolve the issue of Iran’s nuclear capacity in a way that allows Iran to pursue peaceful nuclear energy but provides assurances that it will abide by international rules and norms,” adding, “I believe that Turkey can be an important player in trying to move Iran in that direction.” U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been adamant in her stance that sanctions will be imposed if Iran does not straighten up its act, often times using aggressive rhetoric. A few political pundits in the states have argued that the U.S. is just waiting for the right opportunity to strike Iran (with sanctions first of course). If Iran fails to comply with any of the demands made upon it, and becomes even more cagey and secretive, sanctions will be proposed and most likely enacted. It seems that if Turkey had made any headway at all in the past months with Iran, after Obama’s announcement voicing support for Turkish mediation, Iran has once again become skeptical of whom it keeps for company. Prior to Erdoğan meeting Obama, the White House had not said much on the issue, it was Europe and within Turkey itself that critics began lashing out at Turkey’s undertaking in Middle Eastern affairs, with specific reference to Iran during most of those censures. Turkish mediation would be Iran’s last chance if it continues to evade questions. If Iran proceeds to turn its back on Turkey, they will have no heavy hitters in their corner. The Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has repeatedly sounded off on the nuclear issue. At last week’s White House meeting he reiterated that Iran’s nuclear program should be dealt with diplomatically and criticized the rush to impose sanctions on Iran. Earlier this month, Turkey abstained from the International Atomic Energy Agency’s, or IAEA, vote to rebuke Iran’s secret building of a second nuclear plant, an abstention that caused much disparagement over its decision. Even China and Russia, who have major interests in Iran and have long maintained that sanctions are not necessary, partook in the 26-3 vote. After Turkey displayed its bid of solidarity with Iran, disappointment in Turkey’s decision became apparent. However, for all the criticism Turkey has received, as usual, it is important to remember its location and the new policy understanding it is trying to implement within the region. Although the latter does not excuse all behaviors, whether past, present or future, it can offer explanations as to why Ankara behaves the way it does sometimes. Turkey does not need another war in its region. If an aggression occurs against Iran, once more Turkey will find itself on the doorstep of conflict. Turkey wants dialogue and diplomatic solutions, it hopes to integrate the Middle East on the basis of economics and communication, and any collapse of these will harm those aspirations. Washington gave its support for Turkey to further its efforts in trying to resolve Iran’s nuclear issue; however, it is uncertain whether Iran will allow Turkey to step into that role once more. Whatever place Turkey aims to take in Iranian affairs, it is safe to say that it should expect the unexpected with Iran. Erdoğan has defended Iran’s undertakings and called them a friend, but what has Iran done for Turkey? Perhaps Turkey has exhausted all its capabilities for this particular affair, perhaps it needs to step aside and let the international community deal the crippling economic blows to Iran that it has threatened to do for so long.</strong><br />
4. Turkish Mediation fails-any reason they’re uniquely positioned to solve is a reason Iran will use them to disband international opposition<br />
Schulte 9 <strong>(Gregory L., former U.S. ambassador to the IAEA, Winter 2009/10 Turkish Policy Quarterly, &quot; Why Turkey cannot abstain on Iran’s nuclear violations&quot;, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=why-turkey-cannot-abstain-on-iran8217s-nuclear-violations-2010-04-19" rel="nofollow">http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=why-turkey-cannot-abstain-on-iran8217s-nuclear-violations-2010-04-19</a></span>, JS)</strong><br />
<strong>Mediation can play a role. Certainly, Turkey has better insights into Iran and contacts with its leaders than do the United States and many other countries seeking a diplomatic solution. At one point last fall, it appeared that Turkey’s mediation could bring Tehran to accept an IAEA proposal to ship much of Iran’s illicitly-produced low-enriched uranium out of the country in exchange for fuel for a research reactor. This prospective deal gave hope for a diplomatic breakthrough that would build confidence and buy time for further diplomacy. But the deal died – either a victim of Iranian domestic politics or another Iranian ploy to avoid Security Council action. Iranian authorities recognize the value of mediation – not to secure a diplomatic solution but to divide the international community. Iran has regularly convinced countries and politicians that they could serve as important mediators. Being a mediator is a comfortable position. It gives an excuse to avoid confrontation and tough positions. Prospects for success bring special attention. Failure can be blamed on the parties or external meddling. Iran’s interest in encouraging mediation is to chip away at the coalition of international concern about its illicit nuclear pursuits. It often encourages mediation by countries that have significant trade ties with Iran or that can influence key international decisions. Turkey, now on both the IAEA Board and UN Security Council, meets both criteria. Mediation is not sufficient for diplomacy to succeed. Success, at this juncture, requires that the offer of negotiations be reinforced by significant international pressure. Pressure or its prospect move Iran’s leaders in ways that mediation has not. The goal of international pressure is not to back Iran’s leaders into a corner, but to convince them to walk through a door toward serious negotiations. In these negotiations, Iran’s leaders must take more than token steps but agree instead to significant, verifiable measures that demonstrate they have given up any weapon ambitions. Even if today’s leaders refuse to rollback their illicit nuclear pursuit, we must create conditions to convince future leaders who respect Iran’s international obligations and seek a different relationship with the rest of the world.</strong><br />
Arguments about the Iranian nuclear program are exaggerated hysteria, there’s no risk of adventurism, attacking Israel, terrorism, or regional prolif<br />
<span style="color: black;">Amuzegar 6 </span><strong><span style="color: black;">(Jahangir, finance minister and economic ambassador in Iran's pre-1979 government, Middle East Policy, “Nuclear Iran: perils and prospects”, 6/22, lexis)</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> Questioning the validity of objections to a nuclear-powered Iran, however, are a large number of experts who find the threats somewhat exaggerated, if not largely based on hysteria. First, the Islamic Republic's challenge to Washington's interests and power in the region needs no bomb for leverage, as U.S. interests and influence have already been effectively threatened since 1979 through conventional means and via financial support to groups in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Second, the chances of the Islamic Republic's engaging in adventurism or naked aggression against its neighbors are far-fetched. The last time Iran started a war was back in 1850 to liberate Herat; its last invasion of another country was in 1738. In the immediate past, even when Afghan Taliban challenged the Tehran government both militarily and ideologically, the clerical leadership showed an astonishing restraint. Third, the possibility of the Iranian nuclear program spawning a Middle East arms race is indeed ominous, but that race started decades ago, and Iran was not the one to launch it. Furthermore, Israel, Pakistan and India are already nuclear powers. Iraq, Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf emirates all enjoy U.S. or NATO presence, alliance or protection and, thus, have no need of a nuclear defensive shield. No Iranian government, no matter how belligerent or stupid, would dare provoke or challenge American or NATO forces. Still further, potential candidates for the race--Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Turkey--present technical, financial, political and security problems of their own, and their foray into the nuclear bazaar is highly circumstantial. (46) Finally, Iran might hesitate to start a regional nuclear arms race because it would lose its current superiority in conventional weapons. Fourth, there is the straw-man issue of a &quot;bold Iran&quot; engaging in nuclear coercion through the so-called &quot;suitcase bomb.&quot; (47) But chemical and biological weapons would be much cheaper to produce, less cumbersome to pack and carry, easier to handle and more devastating in effect. Fifth, Iran's influence in OPEC, whatever it might be, will be neither augmented nor diminished by possession of the bomb, but rather by its own oil-capacity limitations. Last, and most crucial, Washington's concern about the Islamic Republic's posture toward the Jewish state seems to be a bogus argument to neutral observers. The esteemed Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld believes that, &quot;given the balance of forces,&quot; it cannot be argued that a nuclear Iran will threaten the United States or even Israel. (48) Since the chances of mutual annihilation loom large in any nuclear first strike, a nuclear Iran would not dare initiate such an attack. Visiting the Natanz centrifuge facility, President Ahmadinejad told the staff, &quot;What enemies fear is not production of an atomic bomb because in today's world atomic weapons are not efficient.&quot; (49) The new president may be a political amateur, occasionally making dimwitted statements, but he is neither a fool nor a suicide bomber. Some pundits argue that a Shiite belief in martyrdom, coupled with the Iranian regime's extremist ideology, could render deterrence meaningless. (50) Such people know neither Shiite martyrdom nor the regime leaders' instinct for self-preservation, nor even the mullahs' bazaari habit of always looking for the best deal.</span></strong><br />
Deterrence prevents the impact<br />
<span style="color: black;">Hendrickson and Tucker 6</span><strong><span style="color: black;"> (David, Distinguished Service Professor at Colorado College, and Robert, professor Emeritus of American Foreign Policy at Johns Hopkins University, “A Test of Power”, The National Interest, Sept/Oct,<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; color: black; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=11900" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=11900</a></span>, JS)</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> The consensus view that Iran could not be deterred if it did acquire nuclear weapons is also dubious in the extreme. These alarms were a regular feature of the Cold War, and it was confidently predicted that neither the Soviet Union nor China would be susceptible to deterrence once they acquired atomic devices. Events showed otherwise. It is said today that President Ahmadinejad is different, that he welcomes the coming of the twelfth imam that a nuclear holocaust would entail, and that a crazed religious fanatic in control of a nuclear-armed state would represent an intolerable danger to Israel, the Gulf sheikhdoms, the United States and the rest of the world. Against these considerations, however, it may be asserted that the Iranian public did not elect their new president on the basis of the expectation that they would soon be burnt to a crisp, but rather that he would improve their standard of living in the here and now; that Ahmadinejad's reputed common touch is utterly incompatible with the careless disregard for the lives of his countrymen that such an act would entail; that any decision for war by Iran could not, from all we know of Iranian decision-making, be undertaken simply on the president's say so but would also require the consent of the religious establishment; and that it is inconceivable that Iran's rulers would display such a complete disregard of Iran's true interests as to invite the retaliation against it that would surely follow. The restraints governing the use of nuclear weapons rest on far more than the strong likelihood of retaliation. Any regime that used nuclear weapons in a first strike &quot;bolt from the blue&quot; would almost certainly be signing its death warrant. The infamy that would attach to any such action, both at home and abroad; the license it would give to others to retaliate or otherwise attempt to bring the regime down; the international isolation and withering contempt it would draw upon itself; the reputation for brigandage it would entail--all this constitutes an insurance policy against the dangers of an Iranian bomb. As a practical matter, it makes extremely unlikely--nay, virtually inconceivable--what is now taken by consensus opinion in America as a sort of moral certainty.</span></strong><br />

<strong>Could today's quarrel between Israelis and Hezbollah over Lebanon produce World War III? That's what Republican Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, called it last week, echoing earlier fighting talk by Dan Gillerman, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. Such language can — for now, at least — safely be dismissed as hyperbole. This crisis is not going to trigger another world war. Indeed, I do not expect it to produce even another Middle East war worthy of comparison with those of June 1967 or October 1973. In 1967, Israel fought four of its Arab neighbors — Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq. In 1973, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. Such combinations are very hard to imagine today. Nor does it seem likely that Syria and Iran will escalate their involvement in the crisis beyond continuing their support for Hezbollah. Neither is in a position to risk a full-scale military confrontation with Israel, given the risk that this might precipitate an American military reaction. Crucially, Washington's consistent support for Israel is not matched by any great power support for Israel's neighbors. During the Cold War, by contrast, the risk was that a Middle East war could spill over into a superpower conflict. Henry Kissinger, secretary of State in the twilight of the Nixon presidency, first heard the news of an Arab-Israeli war at 6:15 a.m. on Oct. 6, 1973. Half an hour later, he was on the phone to the Soviet ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin. Two weeks later, Kissinger flew to Moscow to meet the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev. The stakes were high indeed. At one point during the 1973 crisis, as Brezhnev vainly tried to resist Kissinger's efforts to squeeze him out of the diplomatic loop, the White House issued DEFCON 3, putting American strategic nuclear forces on high alert. It is hard to imagine anything like that today. In any case, this war may soon be over. Most wars Israel has fought have been short, lasting a matter of days or weeks (six days in '67, three weeks in '73). Some Israeli sources say this one could be finished in a matter of days. That, at any rate, is clearly the assumption being made in Washington.</strong><br />

<strong><span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">The military and political ramifications of an attack on Iran cannot</span></span>, however,<span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;"> be</span></span> so easily <span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">remedied</span></span> by clever planning or arms acquisitions. The worst-case scenario, which cannot be entirely dismissed, is that Iran already has a deliverable nuclear weapon that might survive and be used in retaliation for an Israeli attack. A more likely result is that <span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">the Israeli attack, far from</span></span><span class="underline0"> permanently</span><span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">eliminating Iran’s nuclear program<span style="border: medium none initial;">, will delay it</span></span></span><span class="underline0"> by only a few years </span><span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">while</span></span><span class="underline0"> simultaneously </span><span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">stimulating (and justifying) Iranian efforts to acquire such weapons as quickly as possible</span></span>. Conventional responses are also likely. Iran’s medium-range Shahab-3 missiles are likely to be launched at Israel’s Dimona nuclear reactor or at an easier target like Tel Aviv. Shorter-range Scuds might be fired by the Iranian-supported Hezbollah from its bases in south Lebanon. Even more troubling is the possibility of attacks against military or civilian targets by sleeper cells of Israeli Arabs that would be activated by Israeli actions against Iran. An indication that such attacks are well within the realm of the possible is the recent arrest of Israeli Mohammad Ghanem for alleged espionage on behalf of Iran.34 <span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">The U</span></span><span class="underline0">nited </span><span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">S</span></span><span class="underline0">tates, widely perceived as the source of Israel’s power and protection, </span><span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">is</span></span><span class="underline0"> also </span><span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">likely to bear the brunt of retaliatory action</span></span><span class="underline0">. U.S. vulnerabilities in Iraq would surely be exploited by an Iranian Republican Guard Corps</span> (IRGC) that is intimately familiar with the players and how they might be motivated or manipulated to cause trouble for the United States or its allied Iraqi government. Were the Islamic Republic to seriously commit its resources to the funding and training of anti-Western jihadist groups like al-Qaeda, Americans might even be confronted with further attacks on the homeland. <span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">The political consequences</span></span><span class="underline0"> of Israeli action </span><span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none initial;">are sure to include increased anti- Americanism and anti-Zionism</span></span><span class="underline0">, not only among Arabs but also Europeans and much of the developing world.

No Extinction and destroys Iranian Nuclear Reactors-solves prolif<br />
AP 6 <strong>(The Assc Press. “What a War with Iran would Look Like” The AP, 9/17/6.ln<em>GBS-JV)</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>So what would it look like? Interviews with dozens of experts and government officials in Washington, Tehran and elsewhere in the Middle East paint a sobering picture:<span class="underline0"> Military action against Iran's nuclear facilities would have a decent chance of succeeding</span>, but at a staggering cost. And therein lies the excruciating calculus facing the U.S. and its allies: Is the cost of confronting Iran greater than the dangers of living with a nuclear Iran? And can anything short of war persuade Tehran's fundamentalist regime to give up its dangerous game? <span class="underline0">No one is talking about a ground invasion of Iran</span>. Too many U.S. troops are tied down elsewhere to make it possible, and besides, it isn't necessary. <span class="underline0">If the U.S. goal is simply to stunt Iran's nuclear program, it can be done better and more safely by air</span>. An attack limited to Iran's nuclear facilities would nonetheless require a massive campaign. Experts say that Iran has between 18 and 30 nuclear-related facilities. The sites are dispersed around the country -- some in the open, some cloaked in the guise of conventional factories, some buried deep underground. <span class="underline0">A U.S. strike would have a lasting impression on Iran's rulers. U.S. officials believe that a campaign of several days could set back Iran's nuclear program by two to three years. Hit hard</span> enough, some believe, <span class="underline0">Iranians might develop second thoughts about their government's designs as a regional nuclear power</span>. Some U.S. foes of Iran's regime believe that <span class="underline0">the crisis of legitimacy that the ruling clerics would face in the wake of a U.S. attack could trigger their downfall</span>, though others are convinced it would unite the population with the government in anti-American rage.</em></strong><br />

<em><strong>Turkey is launching initiative after ambitious initiative aimed at stabilising the Middle East. Building on the successes of its normalisation with Syria and Iraq, it is facilitating efforts to reduce conflicts, expanding visa-free travel, ramping up trade, integrating infrastructure, forging strategic relationships and engaging in multilateral regional platforms. For some, this new activism is evidence that Turkey is turning from its traditional allies in Europe and the United States. In fact, its increased role in the Middle East is a complement to and even dependent on its ties to the West. This report assesses Turkey’s growing engagement with the Middle East within the broader frame of Turkish foreign and trade policy. The process is still in its infancy, faces official scepticism in Arab governments and has divided opinion among Turkey’s Western allies. Yet, the attempts to grow the regional economy, create interdependence and foster peace have positive potential. At a time when negotiations to join the European Union (EU) have faltered, Ankara has adopted early EU gradualist integration tactics for post-Second World War peace in Europe as a model for strengthening long-term stability and healing the divisions of the Middle East. Turkey’s self-declared “zero-problem” foreign policy to end disputes with its neighbours has worked well in Syria and Iraq, and its facilitation role in some Middle East conflicts has booked some success, for instance in hosting Syria-Israel proximity talks in 2008. Ankara has been less effective, however, in intractable matters like the dispute between Fatah and Hamas. The sharpening tone of Turkey-Israel relations has raised Turkish leaders’ popularity among Middle Eastern publics but has undermined trust among traditional allies in Washington, Brussels and even some Arab capitals. Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP) leaders’ rhetoric, and</strong></em><strong>their// new regional activism extending from Persian Gulf states to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), have given rise to perceptions that they have changed Turkey’s fundamental Westward direction to become part of an Islamist bloc, are attempting to revive the Ottoman Empire or have “turned to the East”. These are incorrect. The basic trends in the country’s regional activism seen today were well established before AKP came to power, and NATO membership and the relationship with the U.S. remain pillars of Turkish policy. While Turkey is bitter over attacks by France, Germany and others on its EU negotiation process between 2005 and 2008, half of its trade is still with the EU, and less than one quarter of its exports go to Middle East states – a proportion typical for the past twenty years. The global nature of Turkey’s realignment is underlined by the fact that Russia and Greece have been among the biggest beneficiaries of its regional trade boom. Nevertheless, since the end of the Cold War, Turkey has been shifting its foreign policy priority from hard security concerns to soft power and commercial interests and moving away from being a kind of NATO-backed regional gendarme to a more independent player determined to use a plethora of regional integration tools in order to be taken seriously on its own account. Turkey’s U.S. and EU partners should support these efforts towards stabilisation through integration. Ankara has many balls in the air and sometimes promises more than it can deliver, over-sells what it has achieved and seeks a role far away when critical problems remain unsolved at home. Turkey’s new prominence is partly attributable to confusion in the region after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, a situation that is not necessarily permanent. Some Middle Eastern governments are also wary of the impact on their own publics of emotional Turkish rhetoric against Israel or about implicit claims to represent the whole Muslim world. Turkey should sustain the positive dynamics of its balanced relationships with all actors in the neighbourhood and its efforts to apply innovatively the tactics of early EU-style integration with Middle East neighbours. While doing so, however, it should pay attention to messaging, both internationally, to ensure that gains with Middle Eastern public opinion are not undercut by loss of trust among traditional allies, and domestically, to ensure that all Turkish constituencies are included, informed and committed to new regional projects over the long term. Also, it will gain credibility and sustainability for its ambitions if it can solve disputes close to home first, like Cyprus and Armenia. Middle Eastern elites worry about any sign of Ankara turning its back on its EU accession process. Much of their recent fascination with Turkey’s achievements derives from the higher standards, greater prosperity, broader democracy, legitimacy of civilian rulers, advances towards real secularism and successful reforms that have resulted from negotiating for membership of the EU. At the same time, Turkey and its leaders enjoy unprecedented popularity and prestige in Middle Eastern public opinion, notably thanks to their readiness to stand up to Israel. Turkey’s new strength, its experience in building a strong modern economy and its ambition to trade and integrate with its neighbours offer a better chance than most to bring more stability and reduce the conflicts that have plagued the Middle East for so long.</strong><br />

<strong>The Arab Gulf States: Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have said little about Iranian nuclearization. Its wait-and-see mentality has three causes. First, these states traditionally have formulated foreign policy in private, without transparency, announcing it only when deemed absolutely necessary. The Gulf Coalition Council (GCC) has shifted its attitude toward a nuclear Iran, but it has done so in a very limited manner. The Gulf States are likely to continue to avoid specifying a policy until no other course is available to them. Second, on a diplomatic level, the Arab Gulf States likely do not want to irritate Iran, complicating the current negotiations between Iran and the rest of the world. It would be better to have others solve the problem of a nuclear Iran than to become involved. Third, as partners in oil production and as neighbors, the Arab Gulf States have no interest in provoking Iran, which may in turn disrupt the status-quo that keeps these states among the richest in the world. Iran’s past attempts to overthrow regional leaders is well remembered, and those states would prefer not to return to those days. The debate on this issue takes two courses. On one hand, a nuclear-armed Iran is not a serious concern. There are already nuclear states within the region, and it is nothing new. In gaining nuclear weapons, Israel and Pakistan have not caused any further instability. Similarly, Iran also would not significantly impact the region. One of Israel’s most prominent military historians, Martin van Creveld of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has justified Iran’s nuclear program in response to Israel’s own nuclear status. Van Creveld is on record stating that, in the face of Israel’s increasing nuclear capabilities, through alleged deployment of nuclear equipped submarines to the region, Iran would be “crazy” not to try to develop a similar capability.81 The other side of the debate depicts a nuclear Iran as a serious threat to regional security. Iran with nuclear weapons would potentially reenergize its aims to export its Islamic revolution and supplant regional regimes with those more in line with Tehran’s vision of fundamentalist law. With nuclear weapons, Iran threatens to shift the balance of power within the Arabian Gulf in its favor, against the smaller and weaker Arab Gulf States.82 This chapter examines the reaction that the Arab Gulf States will likely have to a nuclear-armed Iran. This chapter scrutinizes the background of regional historical concerns about Iran. Second, the chapter describes the current Gulf States security apprehensions about Iran. Third, the chapter assesses the impact that a nuclear-armed Iran is likely to have regionally, including response options available to them. Finally, it outlines the likely impact these matters will have on U.S. interests.</strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">With growing concerns about the threat of nuclear terrorism after September 11, 2001, officials in the United States and NATO have pointed to a lingering problem regarding Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal (a class of weapons similar to the type of U.S. nuclear weapons deployed on the soil of several NATO member states in Europe). TNW's are potentially vulnerable to terrorists or nations who might try to buy or steal them. These weapons are smaller and more portable than strategic nuclear weapons and could be used without the authority of centralized command and control oversight mechanisms. Despite several decades of nuclear arms control initiatives, non-strategic, or TNWs, are not covered by any formal treaties. The U.S. and Russian Presidential nuclear initiatives of the early 1990's called for voluntary controls on the vast stocks of these weapons. While significant reductions resulted from the Presidential initiatives, they were informal and lacked a codified agreement setting out verification and legal obligations. </span></strong><br />

3. Stolen nukes can’t be deployed<br />
Frost 5 <strong>(intelligence analyst with the Canadian government, Robin, Adelphi, 45.378, December, “The nuclear black market”, InformaWorld)</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Even if terrorists had been able to obtain any of these weapons, Sokov argues that they would have been difficult or impossible to deploy: the bombs might have been fitted with locks to prevent unauthorised deployment, or radioactive components may have decayed to the point of uselessness. Even if it were still fresh and fully functional, terrorists would only be able to 'mine' one for its nuclear materials, which they almost certainly could not reassemble into a functional weapon. These materials could, however, be used in one or more relatively harmless RDDs. This discussion necessarily involves a good deal of speculation - state secrets are state secrets, after all, and few are more closely held than those concerning nuclear weapons - but Sokov is unusually well qualified to address the matter.</span></strong><br />
4. Underground vaults solve<br />
Kristensen 8** (Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, co-author of the NRDC Nuclear Notebook column in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and the World Nuclear Forces overview in the SIPRI Yearbook (6/26, Hans, FAS, “USAF Report: “Most” Nuclear Weapon Sites In Europe Do Not Meet US Security Requirements”, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2008/06/usaf-report-%E2%80%9Cmost%E2%80%9D-nuclear-weapon-sites-in-europe-do-not-meet-us-security-requirements.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2008/06/usaf-report-%E2%80%9Cmost%E2%80%9D-nuclear-weapon-sites-in-europe-do-not-meet-us-security-requirements.php</a></span>)<br />
The U.S. weapons are stored in underground vaults, known as WS3 (Weapon Storage and Security System), at bases in Belgium, Germany, Holland, Italy, and Turkey. Most of the weapons are at U.S. Air Force bases, but Belgium, Germany, Holland and Italy each have nuclear weapons at one of their national air bases. The weapons at each of the national bases are under control of a U.S. Air Force MUNSS in peacetime but would, upon receipt of proper authority from the U.S. National Command Authority, be handed over to the national Air Force at the base in a war for delivery by the host nation’s own aircraft. This highly controversial arrangement contradicts both the Non-Proliferation Treaty and NATO’s international nonproliferation policy. Implications and Observations The main implication of the BRR report is that the nuclear weapons deployment in Europe is, and has been for the past decade, a security risk. But why it took an investigation triggered by the embarrassing Minot incident to discover the security problems in Europe is a puzzle. Since the terrorist attacks in September 2001, billions of dollars have been poured into the Homeland Security chest to increase security at U.S. nuclear weapons sites, and a sudden urge to improve safety and use control of nuclear weapons has become a principle justification in the administration’s proposal to build a whole new generation of Reliable Replacement Warheads
