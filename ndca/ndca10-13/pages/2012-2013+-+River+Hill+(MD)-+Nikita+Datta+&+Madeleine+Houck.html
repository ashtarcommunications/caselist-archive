In addition to a host of warnings, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">last Wednesday’s Congressional Budget Office report did contain a little bit of good news.</span> The economy will grow slightly faster in the second half of 2012 than in the first half, and inflation will stay extremely low, according to projections in the CBO’s Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The bad news is that unemployment will probably remain above 8%. The worse news is that next year the U.S. faces continued high unemployment, below-average growth and the risk of a double-dip recession. The U.S. economy never built up much of a head of steam coming out of the 2007-09 recession, which saw the biggest drop in real GDP since the 1940s and the highest unemployment since the early 1980s. Historically, after such a major downturn ends, there’s typically a powerful rebound in which real GDP growth average</span>s<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> more than 4.5% annually over a period of two or three years and briefly hits annualized rates above 9%. By contrast, during the recovery that began in 2009, the economy has never grown faster than 4.5% and has averaged about 2.2% a year. </span>And <span style="font-size: 10pt;">next year, the global economic situation figures to be even less hospitable to growth, which will make it harder for the U.S. economy to speed up from its current disappointing pace.</span> Indeed, last week the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor’s released a report saying that the chances of a recession in the U.S. in 2013 had increased to 25%, up from 20% in February. A U.S. recession is by no means inevitable, but the domestic economy faces three large hurdles, any one of which could mean the difference between steady growth and another economic contraction. The fiscal cliff. Under current law, a variety of tax increases and spending cuts are scheduled to go into effect next year, with serious consequences. On the plus side, these measures would cut the deficit by more than $500 billion. The Federal debt, as a percentage of GDP, would slowly begin to shrink. All that deficit reduction, however, would come at the price of a likely reduction in the economy’s output of more than two percentage points, resulting in a mild-to-moderate recession. That’s just one of the reasons why these policies aren’t likely to go into effect as they stand. A gridlocked Congress and a closely-contested Presidential election make any sort of legislative action unlikely before November. But neither party wants to allow tax cuts to expire for the middle-class or to see more people get hit with the alternative minimum tax. And while the parties disagree on reductions in defense spending and Medicare payments to doctors, the cuts currently scheduled are so large that they will probably be modified or delayed. Historically, Congress has been very good at avoiding big middle-class tax increases and sudden, disruptive spending cuts. While the fiscal cliff may not be eliminated entirely, odds are it will be greatly reduced – even if only at the last possible moment. The global slowdown. While the U.S. economy is growing, albeit somewhat sluggishly, growth around the rest of the world is slowing. Several European countries are already in recession, and the continent as a whole is heading in that direction. Indeed, recent figures show that the private sector in the euro zone has been contracting for seven months. Even Germany’s economy is losing momentum, and current trends indicate that real GDP for the overall euro zone could fall by half a percentage point in the current quarter. Moreover, if there is some sort of euro currency crisis, the resulting shocks to major European banks could turn a minor slowdown into a severe and possibly worldwide recession. In addition, the U.K. has been in recession since late 2011. And some booming economies in the rest of the world – like China and Brazil – are looking at significantly slower growth, dashing the hopes of some that growth in newly advanced economies would blunt the impact of a recession in the developed world. The stimulus shortfall. Ordinarily, in a situation like this the Federal government would try to rev up the U.S. economy with fiscal and monetary stimulus. Only trouble is, the emergency fuel tank is empty. Over the past 12 years, taxes have been cut and kept low, government spending has ratcheted up, the Federal Reserve has cut short-term interest rates to a minimum and has even taken to stoking the money supply through a process known as quantitative easing (which amounts to creating money by purchasing government bonds). With yearly deficits topping $1 trillion, there is little appetite in Washington for further fiscal stimulus, either through tax cuts or spending. On the monetary side of things, the Fed can’t push interest rates much lower, and the impact of another round of quantitative easing is unlikely to last any longer than the effects of the previous two rounds. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">None of this means that a U.S. recession is inevitable. Sure, a mild slump in Europe, combined with slower growth in places like China, would affect U.S. multinationals that sell a lot overseas. And a financial crisis in the euro zone would doubtless hurt U.S. banks to some extent. But U.S. GDP growth depends largely on domestic factors, and there is still time for Congress to resolve the looming fiscal-cliff issues in a way that prevents a sudden shock to the economy and reduces the risk of another recession.</span> But while the private and public sectors in the U.S. have the wherewithal to avoid contracting GDP, that doesn’t mean that we’ll see the kind of growth that will put a serious dent in the unemployment rate. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Even under the CBO’s optimistic scenario, real-GDP growth will pick up only from 1.75% at an annual rate to 2.25% later this year, and average 1.7% in 2013. Having failed to rebound when the weather was more favorable, the U.S. economy is hardly likely to do any better as storm clouds start rolling in.</span><br />

With the global financial system in serious trouble, is America's geostrategic dominance likely to diminish? If so, what would that mean? <span style="font-size: 10pt;">One immediate implication of the crisis that began on Wall Street and spread across the world is that the primary instruments of U.S. foreign policy will be crimped. </span>The next president will face an entirely new and adverse fiscal position. Estimates of this year's federal budget deficit already show that it has jumped $237 billion from last year, to $407 billion. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">With families and businesses hurting, there will be calls for various and expensive domestic relief programs</span>. In the face of this onrushing river of red ink, both Barack Obama and John McCain have been reluctant to lay out what portions of their programmatic wish list they might defer or delete. Only Joe Biden has suggested a possible reduction -- <span style="font-size: 10pt;">foreign aid</span>. This <span style="font-size: 10pt;">would be one of the few popular cuts, but in budgetary terms it is a mere grain of sand.</span> Still, Sen. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Biden's comment hints at where we may be headed: toward a major reduction in America's world role, and perhaps even a new era of financially-induced isolationism. Pressures to cut defense spending, and to dodge the cost of waging two wars, already intense before this crisis, are likely to mount.</span> Despite the success of the surge, the war in Iraq remains deeply unpopular. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Precipitous withdrawal -- attractive to a sizable swath of the electorate before the financial implosion -- might well become even more popular with annual war bills running in the hundreds of billions. </span>Protectionist sentiments are sure to grow stronger as jobs disappear in the coming slowdown. Even before our current woes, calls to save jobs by restricting imports had begun to gather support among many Democrats and some Republicans. In a prolonged recession, gale-force winds of protectionism will blow. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Then there are the dolorous consequences of a potential collapse of the world's financial architecture. For decades</span> now, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Americans have enjoyed the advantages of being at the center of that system. The worldwide use of the dollar, and the stability of our economy, among other things, made it easier for us to run huge budget deficits, as we counted on foreigners to pick up the tab by buying dollar-denominated assets as a safe haven. Will this be possible in the future? Meanwhile, traditional foreign-policy challenges are multiplying. The threat from al Qaeda and Islamic terrorist affiliates has not been extinguished. Iran and North Korea are continuing on their bellicose paths, while Pakistan and Afghanistan are progressing smartly down the road to chaos. Russia's new militancy and China's seemingly relentless rise also give cause for concern. If America now tries to pull back from the world stage, it will leave a dangerous power vacuum. The stabilizing effects of our presence in Asia, our continuing commitment to Europe, and our position as defender of last resort for Middle East energy sources and supply lines could all be placed at risk. </span>In such a scenario <span style="font-size: 10pt;">there are shades of the 1930s, when global trade and finance ground nearly to a halt, the peaceful democracies failed to cooperate, and aggressive powers led by the remorseless fanatics who rose up on the crest of economic disaster exploited their divisions.

Increased Potential for Global Conflict Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is likely to be the result of a number of intersecting and interlocking forces. With so many possible permutations of outcomes, each with ample Revisiting the Future opportunity for unintended consequences, there is a growing sense of insecurity. Even so, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">history may be more instructive than ever</span>. While we continue to believe that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the Great Depression</span> is not likely to be repeated, the <span style="font-size: 10pt;">lessons</span> to be drawn from that period <span style="font-size: 10pt;">include the harmful effects on fledgling democracies and multiethnic societies</span> (think Central Europe in 1920s and 1930s) <span style="font-size: 10pt;">and</span> on the <span style="font-size: 10pt;">sustainability of multilateral institutions</span> (think League of Nations in the same period). <span style="font-size: 10pt;">There is no reason to think that this would not be true in the twenty-first as much as in the twentieth century.</span> For that reason, the ways in which <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the potential for greater conflict could grow</span> would seem to be even more apt <span style="font-size: 10pt;">in a constantly volatile economic environment</span> as they would be if change would be steadier. In surveying those risks, the report stressed the likelihood that terrorism and nonproliferation will remain priorities even as resource issues move up on the international agenda. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Terrorism’s appeal will decline if economic growth continues in the Middle East and youth unemployment is reduced.</span> For those terrorist groups that remain active in 2025, however, the diffusion of technologies and scientific knowledge will place some of the world’s most dangerous capabilities within their reach. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Terrorist groups</span> in 2025 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">will</span> likely be a combination of descendants of long established groups_inheriting organizational structures, command and control processes, and training procedures necessary to conduct sophisticated attacks_and newly emergent collections of the angry and disenfranchised that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">become self-radicalized, particularly in the absence of economic outlets that would become narrower in an economic downturn. The most dangerous casualty of any economically-induced drawdown of U.S. military presence would</span> almost certainly <span style="font-size: 10pt;">be the Middle East</span>. Although Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is not inevitable, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">worries</span> about a nuclear-armed Iran <span style="font-size: 10pt;">could lead states in the region to develop new security arrangements with external powers, acquire additional weapons, and consider pursuing their own nuclear ambitions. It is not clear that the type of stable deterrent relationship that existed between the great powers for most of the Cold War would emerge naturally in the Middle East with a nuclear Iran.</span> Episodes of low intensity <span style="font-size: 10pt;">conflict</span> and terrorism taking place under a nuclear umbrella <span style="font-size: 10pt;">could lead to an unintended escalation and broader conflict</span> if clear red lines between those states involved are not well established. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The close proximity of potential nuclear rivals</span> combined with underdeveloped surveillance capabilities and mobile dual-capable Iranian missile systems also <span style="font-size: 10pt;">will produce inherent difficulties in achieving reliable indications and warning of an impending nuclear attack</span>. The lack of strategic depth in neighboring states like Israel, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">short warning and missile flight times, and uncertainty </span>of Iranian intentions <span style="font-size: 10pt;">may place more focus on preemption</span> rather than defense, potentially <span style="font-size: 10pt;">leading to escalating crises.</span> 36 Types of <span style="font-size: 10pt;">conflict</span> that the world continues to experience, such as <span style="font-size: 10pt;">over resources, could reemerge</span>, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">particularly if protectionism grows and there is a resort to neo-mercantilist practices. Perceptions</span> of renewed energy scarcity will drive countries to take actions to assure their future access to energy supplies. In the worst case, this <span style="font-size: 10pt;">could result in interstate conflicts if government leaders deem assured access to energy resources,</span> for example, to be <span style="font-size: 10pt;">essential for</span> maintaining domestic stability and the <span style="font-size: 10pt;">survival of their regime</span>. Even actions short of war, however, will have important geopolitical implications. Maritime security concerns are providing a rationale for naval buildups and modernization efforts, such as China’s and India’s development of blue water naval capabilities. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">If</span> the <span style="font-size: 10pt;">fiscal stimulus focus for</span> these <span style="font-size: 10pt;">countries indeed turns inward, one of the most obvious funding targets may be military. Buildup of regional</span> naval <span style="font-size: 10pt;">capabilities could lead to increased tensions, rivalries, and counterbalancing moves</span>, but it also will create opportunities for multinational cooperation in protecting critical sea lanes. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">With water</span> also <span style="font-size: 10pt;">becoming scarcer in Asia and the Middle East, cooperation to manage changing water resources is likely to be increasingly difficult both within and between states in a more dog-eat-dog world. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Geopolitical risk is on the rise after years of relative quiet</span> – potentially creating further headwinds to the global recovery just <span style="font-size: 10pt;">as fears of a double-dip recession are growing</span>, says Tina Fordham, senior political analyst at Citi Private Bank. “Recently, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">markets have been focused on problems within the eurozone and not much moved by developments in North Korea, new Iran sanctions, tensions between Turkey and Israel or the unrest in strategically significant Kyrgyzstan</span>,” she says. “But taken together, we don’t think investors can afford to ignore the return of geopolitical concerns to the fragile post-financial crisis environment.” Ms Fordham argues <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the end of post-Cold War US pre-eminence is one of the most important by-products of the financial crisis. “The post-crisis world order is shifting. More players than ever are at the table, and their interests often diverge. Emerging market countries have greater weight in the system, yet many lack experience on the global stage. Addressing the world’s challenges in this more crowded environment will be slower and more complex. This increases the potential for proliferating risks: most notably the prospect of politically and/or economically weakened regimes obtaining nuclear weapons; and military action to keep them from doing so. “Left unresolved, these challenges could disrupt global stability and trade. This would be a very unwelcome time to see the return of geopolitical risk.”</span><br />

 <span class="TagChar">Keeling and Mooney, ‘11</span> [2011, Dr. Mary Keeling is a Manager of the IBM Institute for Business Value Center for Economic Analysis. She holds a PhD in Economics from Trinity College, Dublin. Gerard M. Mooney is currently General Manager of Global Smarter Cities. IBM Executive Report, “Transportation and economic development: Why smarter transport is good for jobs and growth” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/en/gbe03441usen/GBE03441USEN.PDF" rel="nofollow">http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/en/gbe03441usen/GBE03441USEN.PDF</a>]<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">High unemployment, languid economic growth and growing urbanization make transport’s role in driving growth more important than ever. Problems relating to congestion, the environment and safety, as well as opportunities presented by growing data and smarter consumers, must be addressed to help support job creation and growth</span>. The intelligent transportation systems (<span style="font-size: 10pt;">ITS) industry is helping build transport systems that address these issues</span>. To sustain momentum, governments need to accelerate the development of common standards for ITS solutions and open data, the industry needs to collaborate across industry boundaries and cities need to continue building smarter transport networks. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The role of transport in driving jobs and growth is more important than ever Transport contributes directly to economic activity and employment</span> through bus, rail, road, air <span style="font-size: 10pt;">and </span>maritime services. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">It also has a large indirect impact via all the other sectors and activities in the economy that depend on and use these various modes of transport to move people and goods around, nationally and internationally, in an efficient and safe manner. 1 </span>In the current economic environment, three interrelated factors are placing even greater weight on the role of transport in driving jobs and growth: • The rate of urbanization globally has been rising and, in 2008, for the first time in human history, the proportion of the worlds’ population based in urban areas was greater than 50 percent. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">In the United States, 82 percent of the total population is based in urban areas, and this is set to rise to 90 percent by 2050. Cities need to help ensure that their transportation networks can support this high and increasing level of human and economic activity </span>based in cities. 2 • <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The financial environment for cities and federal, state and local governments is challenging. Many states are amid their most severe fiscal crisis since the Great Depression. The largest collapse in state revenues on record combined with languid economic growth are constraining the use of traditional fiscal instruments to support job creation, as well as creating affordability and funding issues for large infrastructure investments. 3 Because of the importance of transport in supporting job creation, it can help address the pressing structural problem of unemployment in many advanced economies.</span> In the United States, long-term unemployment in particular is at crisis levels unprecedented in the post-war period. 4 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Yet,at a time when transport has never been more important in supporting growth and job creation, transportation systems in the United States and globally are facing several key challenges.</span> There are also technological and socioeconomic trends that are creating new opportunities for transport providers (Figure 1). If unaddressed, these challenges and opportunities will inhibit the ability of transport to support job creation and growth. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Today’s transport challenges create an urgent need for action </span>Demographic changes and more vehicles are placing new demands on existing networks. Many <span style="font-size: 10pt;">transportation systems are facing rising demand driven by increased urbanization </span>of populations. Over the past decade, the biggest migration of Americans has been to cities with between 100,000 and 1 million residents. 5 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Many</span> of these <span style="font-size: 10pt;">cities </span>are less than prepared to deal with this influx of individuals and, as a result, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">are struggling to manage these busier transport networks.</span> But not all cities are facing the same challenge. Chicago and Detroit, for example, are actually experiencing population declines, and cities with populations greater than 10 million suffered a 10 percent rate of outmigration over the last decade. 6 This declining demand exacerbates existing revenue problems. Whether populations are increasing or declining creates a challenge for transportation providers in terms of maintaining an efficient and productive transport system in the face of population changes. In tandem, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">over the last 20 years, there has been substantial growth across all transport modes and, therefore, more vehicles and vessels using the transport network (see Figure 2). All these additional vehicles and vessels competing for limited capacity on the transport network create a challenge for transport providers trying to efficiently manage the network and balance demand and capacity Congestion is a growing problem that incurs significant costs. Congestion pressures faced by cities are worsening over time and cannot be ignored</span> – traffic congestion in the 100 biggest metropolitan areas in the United States increased by 11 percent last year. 7 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Congestion costs time and money – approximately US $101 billion and about 4.8 billion wasted hours last year in the United States</span>. 8 It also negatively impacts quality of life by decreasing personal and business productivity, lowering air quality, creating noise pollution, adversely impacting health, as well as leading to the waste of nearly 1.9 billion gallons of fuel each year. 9 A large portion of congestion is not caused by limited highway capacity – <span style="font-size: 10pt;">60 percent of all freeway congestion is caused by incidents such as wrecks and debris</span> on the road. 10 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">So, reducing these types of incidents could help reduce the incidence of congestion and the negative costs associated with it</span>. “The numbers quantify what is intuitively evident – the extent and cost of congestion in cities of all sizes continue to significantly increase. The congestion numbers also demonstrate that we will not build our way out of the urban mobility problems that have developed.” Dennis Christiansen, Agency Director, Texas Transportation Institute <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Accidents</span> in the transport network take thousands of lives and cost billions of dollars each year. There are more than 10 million motor vehicle accidents in the United States every year. 11 In the United States, accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 25 to 34 and cause almost 40,000 fatalities a year – equivalent to two jumbo jets crashing every week! 12 This figure has remained virtually unchanged over the last 20 years (Figure 3). In terms of injuries from vehicle crashes, more than 2.3 million adults are treated every year in emergency departments. 13 These events <span style="font-size: 10pt;">impose about US$41 billion in medical and work loss costs every year. 14 As 20 percent of all freeway crashes are “secondary,” occurring because the roadway is blocked by an earlier incident, reducing congestion caused by accidents could potentially reduce these costs. 15 “Motor vehicle crashes and the resulting injuries and fatalities impose a huge cost on society. The often-overlooked economic impact of crashes is over US$230 billion annual </span>Pressure is growing – nationally and internationally – to reduce emissions and the negative environmental impact of transport. As transportation greenhouse gases (GHG) account for 29 percent of total U.S. GHG and over 5 percent of total global GHG emissions, it is not surprising the transport industry has been subject to increasing levels of environmental regulations. 16 For example, steps were outlined by U.S. President Obama in May 2010 on the adoption of the first-ever GHG regulations for heavy-duty engines and vehicles, as well as the development of further light-duty vehicle GHG regulations. In August 2011, a regulation was signed relating to Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles. 17 The increase in regulation is not just happening at the national level. In recent decades, there has been a proliferation of multilateral environmental agreements. Global regulation is likely to continue and to extend to new areas. 18 Environmental pressure is also being driven by changing attitudes among consumers and cities as exemplified by movements such as “Car Free America” and efforts in Arlington County, Virginia, and other urban areas that promote the use of transportation modes other than single-occupancy vehicles. 19Technology and socioeconomic trends are creating new opportunities Transportation system providers can leverage technology to get closer to smarter citizens and give them access to their transport network. Transport system providers are facing smarter citizens as technology fundamentally changes the way they interact, obtain information and purchase goods and services. While 30.2 percent of the world’s population are online, that proportion is even higher in North America at 78.3 percent, representing an increase of 151 percent in North America between 2000 and 2011. 20 Ninety-one percent of the U.S. population has a mobile phone account, and Smartphone penetration of the U.S. mobile phone market will overtake feature phone penetration by the end of 2011. 21 There are over 425,000 iPhone apps and over 15 billion downloads – and this growth occurred in just four years. 22 What all of these statistics serve to illustrate is the growing familiarity that consumers have with technology. What it means for transportation system providers is that they are now facing consumers who are not just more informed, enabled and demanding, but who also increasingly expect technology to be embedded in the services they use. Transportation providers have more data and information at their disposal than ever before. From 2008 to 2009, the amount of digital information increased 62 percent to 0.8 zetabytes – and in 2010, it was estimated to have increased to 1.2 zetabytes. 23 A recent study put this into perspective by estimating this amount equals 75 billion fully loaded 16GB Apple iPads or 707 trillion copies of the 2,000 page U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. 24 “In 2009, more than 40 million portable GPS devices were sold worldwide, and 52 percent of those sales were in the United States. 25 In transport, the amount data has also been growing. Several years of fast growth have led to well over 200 million “turn-by-turn navigation” systems in use worldwide, 20 percent of which are factory installed and aftermarket in-dash navigation systems. 26 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">About 10 percent of the world’s new cars in 2010 had factory-installed telematics – that is expected to increase to 62 percent by 2016. 27 Many cities are also sitting on potential treasure troves of data from individual tickets, journeys and usage of public transport to data in road charging or toll schemes. Transportation providers and agencies have a vast amount of information at their disposal from across their entire transport network. This represents a valuable opportunity to gain greater insight into the network, make better and more informed decisions, take appropriate action and help improve the quality of the transport services. Transport services can become a differentiator for cities to attract and retain the talent necessary to drive growth. Talent is becoming more and more important in driving economic growth in cities and regions</span>. And while the number of mobile highly educated individuals is set to rise over the next 20 years, cities will face intensifying competition to attract and retain this talent. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">28 Transport services could become a significant differentiator, as they have a critical influence on the attractiveness and liveability of a location. For cities and regions that can attract this mobile talent, the resulting wealth can be spread out across the economy. More growth means more jobs – not only for higher-skilled but also for lowerskilled individuals</span>. In addition, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">transportation enhancement can be leveraged by cities experiencing falling population numbers to stimulate recovery, jobs and growth and stem further population declines. To help drive growth and job creation, transport providers must address the challenges and opportunities </span>before them. In answering the question of “how” transport providers can deal with these pressures and opportunities, we now outline how “smarter,” more intelligent transport systems can help. “Economic growth will not be possible without increasing the efficiency and capacity of our highway systems. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">ITS has proven to be one of the quickest andmost cost-effective ways to accomplish these objectives.”</span> Abbas Mohaddes, President and CEO, Iteris Inc. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Smarter transport helps drive jobs and growth through ITS solutions, jobs and revenue The ITS value chain spans 15 major industry groupings and accounts for 13 percent of total industry outpu</span>t. In the U.S. economy, this market includes both ITS-driven companies and also more diversified companies (Figure 4), illustrating the breadth of the ITS industry outside of transport. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The ITS industry enhances the potential of transport to drive growth and jobs through two key channels. First, it is developing innovative solutions that help transportation providers effectively deal with the challenges and opportunities they face and build smarter, more intelligent transportation systems. Second, the industry itself makes a major contribution to economic activity and jobs through its revenue and employment. ITS helps drive growth through innovative solutions that enable smarter transport systems</span>. Smarter transport systems are instrumented, interconnected and intelligent. The right type of data is collected, managed and integrated across different parts of the transport system, fleet or a single vehicle in a way that allows modern information technology and advanced analytics to be used for further insight. This insight can form the basis for more effective decision making and responses. For example, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">a smart system can support more efficient and effective use of limited resources</span> by allowing providers to “visualize” the transportation system, quickly identify the source of problems and rectify them, as well as by helping them be better prepared for responses to infrequent events. The <span style="font-size: 10pt;">ITS </span>industry is helping build smarter transport <span style="font-size: 10pt;">systems that enable data gathering and analysis and more effective responses to issues such as congestion, safety and environmental efficiency.</span> For example, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">ITS solutions are relaying real-time traffic information via handheld devices and on-board traffic information advisory systems to help drivers avoid congestion and reroute. ITS solutions that provide information relating to carpools and parking can help increase vehicle occupancy and reduce the number of vehicles and their time on the road</span>. Making better information available for travelers can help facilitate a modal shift by giving them the ability to perhaps mix and match different modes or spread the load on the system through the timing of trips. In terms of safety, on-board collision avoidance systems can detect vehicles or other obstacles and alert drivers of looming threats – and eventually could impose brakes. Other solutions, such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems, enable vehicles to be fully “aware” of dynamic information of neighboring vehicles, helping them keep a safe distance and facilitating faster responses to traffic incidents. Such innovative solutions can make a real difference in helping reduce the existing safety problems across the transport network. The industry is also developing solutions to address environmental pressures. GPS-based eco-routing, one of the first applications currently in use, helps drivers choose a route with minimal environmental footprints and environmentally-relevant real-time transportation data. Having been promoted in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Applications for the Environment: Real-Time Information Synthesis’ (AERIS) program, this application empowers vehicles to mitigate their environmental impact. 29 “We can stay here, stuck in traffic, or we can invest in transportation and ITS technology that have the potential to transform how we travel. Whether it’s a commercial hauler seeking a route for his on-time delivery or a parent trying to make it from the office to her child’s soccer game, this technology can lower business costs, improve quality of life, ease traffic congestion and make us safer.” Kirk Steudle, Director, Michigan Department of Transportation Intelligent vehicle technologies will ultimately enable autonomous driving and cars that don’t crash. Not only will these vehicles revolutionize personal mobility, they also promise to dramatically decrease fuel consumption and emissions, greatly enhance traffic safety and provide significantly more value for consumers.” Nady Boules, Director, Electrical &amp; Controls Integration Lab, General Motors Global Research &amp; Development IBM Global Business Services 9 Solutions are also being created that help transportation system providers capitalize on opportunities to gain information and insight. Embedded and road-side sensors, along with information exchanged wirelessly, could provide more information to transportation agencies. And advanced analytics solutions could gather and help provide insights on which to act. Many organizations are overwhelmed by vast amounts of data and struggle to effectively use it to achieve business results – more than two thirds of organizations report that their organizations have more data than they know how to use effectively. 30 Analytics can help mitigate the mounting complexity resulting from the data deluge and facilitate more informed decision making. “…..the connected vehicle system holds the promise of reducing congestion, improving transport time and doing it in a safer fashion.” Dana Christensen, Deputy Laboratory Director for Science and Technology, National Renewable Energy Laboratory “A significant commitment to safety is needed to fund better data collection systems, road and vehicle improvements, and performance-based counter-measures that can have the greatest impact on saving lives and reducing crashes. Transportation technology solutions play a role in all of these areas.” Jill Ingrassia, Managing Director, Government Relations &amp; Traffic Safety Advocacy, AAA Embedding technology in the transportation system, such as through integrated fare processing or smart cards, facilitates the “smarter” services that “smarter” consumers increasingly demand. Leveraging technology to enhance travelers’ experiences through smart and more accurate traffic signs and smart phone mobility apps, for example, could help cities improve transport services and perhaps attract talent. “ITS systems can now provide for detailed traffic and revenue analysis that truly informs decision making based in great detail on the ‘voices of the consumers’ and how they actually use our transportation systems.” Ken Philmus, Senior VP, Transportation Solutions Group, Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. “Our efforts with transportation agencies worldwide are driving better intelligence from these vast data stores in ways that help them plan, build, manage and measure the performance of our road networks for a fraction of the cost.” Bryan Mistele, President and CEO, Inrix Inc. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">ITS can thus help providers effectively deal with many of the pressures – and opportunities – they face and generate further spillover benefits for users of the systems. This, in turn, helps foster efficiency savings and benefits for citizens and businesses across the economy.</span> And statistics point to the continued development of innovative solutions – ITS-related patents increased by 17 percent between 2007 and 2008 when overall patent applications in the United States were static. 3110 Transportation and economic development <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Smarter transport can directly impact economic activity through the revenue and jobs generated by the industry. The ITS end-use products and services market was US$52 billion in 2009 – larger in revenue size than motion picture and video production (US$48 billion), computers(US$44 billion), direct mail advertising (US$44 billion) or Internet advertising (US$23 billion). 32 Continued growth is projected through 2015 with the North American ITS market size expected to increase to US$73 billion </span>(consisting of US$67 billion for the United States and an additional US$6 billion for the rest of North America). <span style="font-size: 10pt;">This amounts to a compound annual growth rate of 5.8 percent per annum over the 2009-2015 </span>period. 33 In addition, as is evident from Figure 5, the <em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">annual growth rates for ITS are higher than the average growth for total North American revenue.</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> The ITS industry also directly affects the economy through number and quality of jobs and wages for those jobs. ITS industry employment in 2011 is estimated at over 513,000,</span> with 306,000 in enabling services and components and 207,000 in end-use intelligent transport. This is a 4 percent increase of over 19,000 since 2009 – impressive growth considering an economic environment in which aggregate employment levels in the United States increased by just 4,000 over the same period. 34 The ITS U.S. and North American employment outlook is also positive. By 2015, the ITS value chain is projected to contribute over 564,000 jobs – an increase of 14 percent over 2009 levels. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Growth in employment in the ITS industry is also higher than other sectors and the economy overall. 35 ITS jobs typically command annual salaries above the national average</span> as they require specialized skills. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">ITS average salaries are more than US$32,000 above the national average of US$42,270. More than half of the U.S. ITS jobs categorized by occupation had salaries of US$69,000 or more (see Figure 6). These high-paying earners have a positive impact on the economy via the goods and services they purchase and those employed to provide them.</span><br />

 <span class="TagChar">Belcher, ‘9</span> (December 4, 2009 Scott Belcher, CEO and President, Intelligent Transportation Society of America, represents several hundred member organizations including public agencies, private industry leaders, and academic institutions involved in the research, development, and deployment of intelligent transportation systems that improve safety, increase mobility, and sustain the environment, “Congress: Invest in Intelligent Transportation Systems to create jobs”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/70623-congress-invest-in-intelligent-transportation-systems-to-create-jobs" rel="nofollow">http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/70623-congress-invest-in-intelligent-transportation-systems-to-create-jobs</a>)<br />
As Congressional leaders work to craft a jobs package that will address our nation’s alarming unemployment levels, they would do well to invest in Intelligent Transportation Systems (<span style="font-size: 10pt;">ITS</span>) and other transportation projects that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">will modernize our nation’s aging infrastructure </span>and improve the performance of our multimodal transportation systems. ITS technologies are beginning to move our national transportation network into the digital age, and are already providing major improvements in transportation safety, mobility, efficiency, and the environment. A few examples include high-tech traffic and freight management systems, synchronized and adaptive traffic signals, smart transit systems, electronic tolling systems, weigh-in-motion truck inspections, ramp metering, advanced condition assessment technologies, and real-time traffic, transit and parking information. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Investing in ITS will create new jobs quickly because these technologies can be deployed without a lot of new construction or right-of-way issues. And 50 percent of every dollar spent on ITS deployment goes directly to wages and salaries, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Consider that an investment of $1.2 billion to deploy and operate real-time traffic information programs in all 50 states and the nation’s largest 50 cities would not only create new jobs and spur economic growth, but would also generate more than $30 billion in safety, mobility, and environmental benefits to the public</span>, according to a newly-released GAO study. The future of ITS and its positive impact on our national economy are significant. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The U.S. DOT projects that the field of ITS could create almost 600,000 new jobs</span>over the next 20 years.<span style="font-size: 10pt;">With a federal commitment to ITS deployment, these figures could be significantly higher.</span> In the United Kingdom, an investment of 15 billion British pounds (approximately $25 billion) in information and communications technology (<span style="font-size: 10pt;">ITS</span>, smart grid and broadband)<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> is estimated to create or retain 700,000 jobs, of which 360,000 are small business jobs. Several other segments of the economy will also benefit from federal investments in ITS.</span> Researchers from the London School of Economics and the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation have found <span style="font-size: 10pt;">that investment in ITS</span>creates a ‘network effect’ throughout the economy and <span style="font-size: 10pt;">directly benefits economic growth by stimulating high-tech job creation</span> across multiple sectors, including green jobs, high-tech, automotive, information technology, consumer electronics, and related industries; <span style="font-size: 10pt;">and provides a foundation for long-term benefits,</span>including government cost savings, economy-wide productivity, and an improved quality of life. It’s also important to recognize the international commitment to ITS is growing among other leading industrialized nations. China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Germany, Great Britain, and other nations today view their ITS industry as a key industrial base, and one capable of generating considerable economic growth. With unemployment rates reaching alarming levels and traffic congestion stifling our economy and quality of life, it’s time for the U.S. to make a commitment to ITS. ITS will play a major role in helping American workers retain existing jobs while providing new jobs for the unemployed. It will also provide lasting benefits by increasing safety, reducing congestion and emissions, improving system performance and creating more livable, sustainable communities.<br />

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Small businesses are important to the economic recovery and to U.S. global competitiveness</span>, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Bernanke said</span> Wednesday in welcoming remarks at a Fed conference on small business entrepreneurship during the recovery.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> &quot;We need to think carefully about how, in the current economic environment, our nation can best provide small businesses and entrepreneurs with the support they need to expand job opportunities,&quot;</span> Bernanke said in prepared remarks. Bernanke said that small businesses support their local communities while also helping the U.S. compete globally. &quot;They often offer a level of agility in bringing innovative products to the global marketplace that larger firms cannot match,&quot; Bernanke said. Bernanke also said that entrepreneurship offered &quot;an important option for people confronting economic challenges in their lives, such as insufficient retirement savings.&quot; Many small businesses are still finding it hard to get credit after the financial crisis. The crisis has made small companies more vulnerable and banks more cautious in giving out loans to them. A Fed survey this week showed that fewer banks relaxed lending standards to business in the third quarter-- especially to small companies. Bernanke said Nov. 2 that the Fed stands ready to buy more mortgage-backed securities to aid an economy that's expected to remain weak for many more years, but he declined to commit firmly to such a move. The central bank last week refrained from taking new unorthodox steps to spur growth after taking them at previous meetings in August and September. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Small companies were more optimistic for the second month in a row in October as a bigger share of businessmen said they expect the economy to improve over the next six months</span>, a survey showed Tuesday. But it was less pessimism that really moved the needle--not an increase in optimism. The level of the optimism index published by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) is still close to levels associated with recession and remains below last spring's level. Small companies' expectations of sales growth and business conditions stayed in negative territory, the NFIB survey showed. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hiring prospects</span> also <span style="font-size: 10pt;">remained dim last month, with only 3% of firms saying they plan to add employees to their workforce, down one percentage point from September and in line with the weak average seen over the past six months.</span><br />

A <span style="font-size: 10pt;">leading atomic regulator has privately warned that the world stands on the brink of a &quot;nuclear 9/11&quot;</span>. • The <span style="font-size: 10pt;">WikiLeaks cables in full Security briefings suggest that jihadi groups are also close to producing &quot;workable and efficient&quot; biological and chemical weapons that could kill thousands</span> if unleashed in attacks on the West. Thousands of <span style="font-size: 10pt;">classified American cables</span> obtained by the WikiLeaks website and passed to The Daily Telegraph <span style="font-size: 10pt;">detail the international struggle to stop the spread of weapons-grade nuclear, chemical and biological material around the globe. </span>At a Nato meeting <span style="font-size: 10pt;">in</span> January <span style="font-size: 10pt;">2009, security chiefs briefed member states that al-Qaeda was plotting a programme of &quot;dirty radioactive IEDs&quot;, makeshift nuclear roadside bombs that could be used against British troops in Afghanistan</span>. As well as causing a large explosion, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; attack would contaminate the area for many years. The briefings also state that al-Qaeda documents</span> found in Afghanistan in 2007 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">revealed that &quot;greater advances&quot; had been made in bio-terrorism than was previously realised</span>. An <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Indian national security adviser told American security personnel</span> in June 2008 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">that terrorists had made a &quot;manifest attempt to get fissile material&quot; and &quot;have the technical competence to manufacture an explosive device beyond a mere dirty bomb&quot;. Alerts about the smuggling of nuclear material, sent to Washington from foreign US embassies, document how criminal and terrorist gangs were trafficking large amounts of highly radioactive material across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. </span>The alerts explain how customs guards at remote border crossings used radiation alarms to identify and seize cargoes of uranium and plutonium. Freight trains were found to be carrying weapons-grade nuclear material across the Kazakhstan-Russia border, highly enriched uranium was transported across Uganda by bus, and a &quot;small-time hustler&quot; in Lisbon offered to sell radioactive plates stolen from Chernobyl. In one incident in September 2009, two employees at the Rossing Uranium Mine in Namibia smuggled almost half a ton of uranium concentrate powder – yellowcake – out of the compound in plastic bags. &quot;Acute safety and security concerns&quot; were even raised in 2008 about the uranium and plutonium laboratory of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the nuclear safety watchdog. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tomihiro Taniguchi, the deputy director-general of the IAEA, has privately warned America</span> that the world <span style="font-size: 10pt;">faces the threat of a &quot;nuclear 9/11&quot; if stores of uranium and plutonium were not secured against terrorists</span>. But diplomats visiting the IAEA's Austrian headquarters in April 2008 said that there was &quot;no way to provide perimeter security&quot; to its own laboratory because it has windows that leave it vulnerable to break-ins. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Senior British defence officials have raised &quot;deep concerns&quot; that a rogue scientist in the Pakistani nuclear programme &quot;could gradually smuggle enough material out to make a weapon,&quot;</span> according to a document detailing official talks in London in February 2009. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Agricultural stores of deadly biological pathogens in Pakistan are also vulnerable to &quot;extremists&quot; who could use supplies of anthrax, foot and mouth disease and avian flu to develop lethal biological weapons. Anthrax and other biological agents, including smallpox and avian flu, could be sprayed from a shop-bought aerosol can in a crowded area, leaked security briefings warn.</span> The security of the world's only two declared smallpox stores in Atlanta, USA, and Novosibirsk, Russia, has repeatedly been called into doubt by &quot;a growing chorus of voices&quot; at meetings of the World Health Assembly documented in the leaked cables. The alarming disclosures come after President Barack Obama last year declared nuclear terrorism &quot;the single biggest threat&quot; to international security with the potential to cause &quot;extraordinary loss of life&quot;.<br />

Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, former Director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, U.S. Department of Energy, former Chief of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Department, Counter-terrorist Center, Central Intelligence Agency, recipient of the CIA Director’s Award, graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, West Point, “Al Qaeda Weapons of Mass Destruction Threat: Hype or Reality?” <span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/al-qaeda-wmd-threat.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/al-qaeda-wmd-threat.pdf</a></span>]<br />
Osama <span style="font-size: 10pt;">bin Ladin’s assertion in 1998 that it was his Islamic duty to acquire weapons of mass destruction ensured that the fulfillment of this intent would become a top priority for his lieutenants in the ensuing years</span>. In an effort to explain his thinking to his followers, and to help guide their efforts, the al Qaeda leader has offered a number of statements that provide a need and rationale for using weapons of mass destruction as a means of achieving the group’s concrete and ambitious goals. Most recently, he promised in a 2007 video release to “escalate the killing and fighting against you (Americans)”–on grounds of destroying an international conspiracy to control the world–adding, “The capitalist system seeks to turn the entire world into a fiefdom of the major corporations under the label of globalization in order to protect democracy.” <span style="font-size: 10pt;">These statements should not be interpreted as empty rhetoric and idle threats: Osama bin Ladin has signaled a specific purpose for using WMD in al Qaeda’s quest to destroy the global status quo, and to create conditions more conducive to the overthrow of apostate regimes throughout the Islamic world</span>. His argument is essentially that even weapons of mass destruction—which are outlawed under Islam—are a justifiable means of countering US hegemony. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Osama bin Ladin’s morality-based argument on the nature of the struggle between militant Islamists and the US-led coalition of secular forces focuses the group’s planning on the acquisition of strategic weapons that can be used in mass casualty attacks, rather than on the production of tactical, more readily available weapons such as “dirty bombs,” chemical agents, crude toxins and poisons</span>. In this light, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">it is not surprising that the group’s top WMD priority has been to acquire nuclear and strategic biological weapons</span>. Considering the potential that such weapons hold in fulfilling al Qaeda’s aspirations, their <span style="font-size: 10pt;">WMD procurement efforts have been managed at the most senior levels</span>, under rules of strict compartmentalization from lower levels of the organization, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">and with central control over possible targets and timing of prospective attacks</span>. In this sense, their approach has been “Muhammed Atta-like”—similar to the modus operandi Khaled Sheikh Mohammed employed in making preparations for the 9/11 attacks—<span style="font-size: 10pt;">as opposed to resembling the signature characterizing most terrorist attacks to which the world has become accustomed</span>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Al Qaeda’s patient, decade-long effort to steal or construct an improvised nuclear device (IND) flows from their perception of the benefits of producing the image of a mushroom cloud rising over a US city, just as the 9/11 attacks have altered the course of history. This lofty aim helps explains why al Qaeda has consistently sought a bomb capable of producing a nuclear yield, as opposed to settling for the more expedient and realistic course of devising a “dirty bomb,” or a radiological dispersal device</span>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Another 9/11-scale operational plot managed by the al Qaeda core leadership was the development of anthrax for use in a mass casualty attack in the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 10pt;">S</span>tates. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The sophisticated anthrax project was run personally by al Qaeda deputy chief Ayman Zawahiri, in parallel to the group’s efforts to acquire a nuclear capability</span>; anthrax was probably meant to serve as another means to achieve the same effect as using a nuclear bomb, given doubts that a nuclear option could be successfully procured. Notably, al Qaeda’s efforts to acquire a nuclear and biological weapons capability were concentrated in the years preceding September 11, 2001. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Based on the timing and nature of their WMD-related activity in the 1990’s, al Qaeda probably anticipated using these means of mass destruction against targets in the US homeland in the intensified campaign they knew would follow the 9/11 attack</span>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">There is no indication that the fundamental objectives that lie behind their WMD intent have changed over time</span>. On the other hand, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the pursuit of crude toxins and poisons appears to have been of little interest to the al Qaeda leadership, even though the production of such weapons is easier and thus might seem more attractive for potential use in attacks</span>. Although experimentation and training in crude chemical agents and pathogens was standard fare in al Qaeda’s camps in Afghanistan before 9/11, their use in attacks appears to have been left to the initiative of individual cells and planners outside the direct supervision of the al Qaeda core leadership. Prominent examples of small-scale chemical- and biological- related activity include Midhat al-Mursi’s (aka Abu Khabab) basic training for operatives in the al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan before 9/11; the Abu Musab al Zarqawi network’s plotting to use ricin and cyanide in multiple attacks planned in Europe in late 2002-early 2003; and a Bahraini terrorist cell’s plot to use a crude cyanide gas device called the “mobtaker” (an Arabic word roughly meaning “invention”) in an attack on the New York City subway in the same time frame. In each of these cases, the evidence suggests that the al Qaeda senior leadership was not directly involved or apparently even aware of attack preparations until late stages of planning. Moreover, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">there is no evidence that the al Qaeda leadership regarded the use of crude toxins and poisons as being suitable for conducting what would amount to pin prick attacks on the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 10pt;">S</span>tates; <span style="font-size: 10pt;">on the contrary, Zawahiri canceled the planned attack on the New York City subway for “something better,” suggesting that a relatively easy attack utilizing tactical weapons would not achieve the goals the al Qaeda leadership had set for themselves</span>. So, why hasn’t a terrorist WMD attack happened since 9/11? <span style="font-size: 10pt;">There are many plausible explanations for why the world has not experienced an al Qaeda attack using chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons, but it would be foolish to discount the possibility that such an event will occur in the future. To date, al Qaeda’s WMD programs may have been disrupted</span>. This is in fact one likely explanation, given a sustained and ferocious counterterrorist response to 9/11 that largely destroyed al Qaeda as the organization that existed before the fateful attack on the US. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">If so, terrorists must continue to be disrupted and denied a safe haven to reestablish the ability to launch a major strike on the US homeland</span>, or elsewhere in the world. Or perhaps, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">al Qaeda operational planners have failed to acquire the kind of weapons they seek, because they are unwilling to settle for anything other than a large scale attack in the US</span>. It would surely be hard for al Qaeda to lower the bar they set on 9/11: what would constitute a worthy follow-up to 9/11, on their terms? What would they achieve through another attack? <span style="font-size: 10pt;">There are few weapons that would meet their expectations in this regard. It is extremely difficult to acquire a functioning nuclear bomb, or to steal enough weapons usable material to build a bomb. And as al Qaeda probably learned in trying to weaponize anthrax, biological pathogens may seem simple enough to produce, but such weapons are not easy to bottle up and control</span>. To complicate matters further, an attack on the scale of 9/11 is more difficult to accomplish in an environment of heightened security and vigilance in the US. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">But if Osama bin Ladin and his lieutenants had been interested in employing crude chemical, biological and radiological materials in small scale attacks, there is little doubt they could have done so by now</span>. However, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">events have shown that the al Qaeda leadership does not choose weapons based on how easy they are to acquire and use</span>, be they conventional or unconventional weapons. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">They choose them based on the best means of destroying the specific targets that they have in mind. Al Qaeda’s reasoning thus runs counter to analytic convention that equates the ease of acquisition of chemical, biological or radiological weapons with an increasing likelihood of terrorist use</span>—i.e., a terrorist attack employing crude weapons is therefore more likely than an attack using a nuclear or large scale biological weapon. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">In fact, it is the opposite: If perpetrating a large-scale attack serves as al Qaeda’s motivation for possessing WMD, not deterrence value, then the greatest threat is posed by the most effective and simple means of mass destruction, whether these means consist of nuclear, biological, or other forms of asymmetric weapons</span>. An examination of the 9/11 attack sheds light on al Qaeda’s reasoning behind the selection of specific weapons, and how that may apply to the role WMD plays in their thinking. Al Qaeda opted to pursue a highly complex and artfully choreographed plot to strike multiple targets requiring the simultaneous hijacking of several 747 jumbo passenger aircraft, because using airplanes as weapons offered the best means of attacking the targets they intended to destroy. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">If conventional wisdom on assessing WMD terrorism threats had been applied to considering the likelihood of the 9/11 plot, analysts may well have concluded it never would have happened; at the time, it was simply hard to believe any terrorist group could pull off such an elaborate plot utilizing novel, unpredictable weapons that were so difficult to acquire</span>. Yet, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">WMD terrorism skeptics abound, and for understandable reasons. There is widespread suspicion in America and abroad that WMD terrorism is another phony threat being hyped for political purposes, and to stoke fears among the public</span>. It is difficult to debunk this allegation, given the US government’s lack of credibility in the case of Iraqi WMD. That said, WMD terrorism is not Iraqi WMD. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The case that the WMD terrorism threat is real</span> bears no association with the Iraqi intelligence failure whatsoever, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">in terms of the reliability of the sources of intelligence, the quality of the information that has been collected, and the weight of the evidence that lies at the heart of our understanding of the threat. If anything, the biases in WMD terrorism analysis tilt towards treating the absence of information as an absence of threat; this could become a vulnerability in the defenses, considering the very real possibility that there may be a terrorist plot in motion that has not been found</span>.<br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The expert community distinguishes pathways terrorists might take to the bomb</span> (discussed in detail in the next section of the report). <span style="font-size: 10pt;">One is the use of a nuclear weapon that has been either stolen or bought on the black market</span>. The probability of such a development is very low, given the high levels of physical security (guards, barriers, and the like) and technical security (electronic locks and related measures) of modern nuclear warheads. But <span style="font-size: 10pt;">we cannot entirely rule out such a scenario</span>, especially <span style="font-size: 10pt;">if we recall the political instability in Pakistan</span>, where the situation could conceivably develop in a way that would increase the chance that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">terrorist groups might gain access to a Pakistani nuclear weapon A second pathway is the use of an improvised nuclear device built either by terrorists or by nuclear specialists that the terrorists have secretly recruited, with use of weapons-usable fissile material either stolen or bought on the black market</span>.1 The probability of such an attack is higher than using stolen nuclear warheads, because <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the acceleration of technological progress and globalization of information space make nuclear weapons technologies more accessible while the existence of the nuclear black market eases access of terrorists to weapons-usable fissile materials</span>. A third pathway is the use of an explosive nuclear device built by terrorists or their accomplices with fissile material that they produced themselves—either highly enriched uranium (HEU) they managed to enrich, or plutonium they managed to produce and reprocess. Al-Qaeda and associated groups appear to have decided that enriching uranium lies well beyond the capabilities that they would realistically be able to develop. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">A fourth pathway is that terrorists might receive a nuclear bomb or the materials needed to make one from a state. North Korea</span>, for example, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">has been willing to sell its missile technology to many countries</span>, and transferred its plutonium production reactor technology to Syria, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">suffering few consequences</span> as a result. Transferring the means to make a nuclear bomb to a terrorist group, however, would be a dramatically different act, for the terrorists might use that capability in a way that could provoke retaliation that would result in the destruction of the regime. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">A far more worrisome transfer of capability from state to group could occur without the witting cooperation of the regime</span>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">A future A.Q. Khan-type</span> rogue nuclear supplier network operating out of North Korea or out of a future nuclear-armed Iran <span style="font-size: 10pt;">could potentially transfer such a capability to a surrogate group and/or sell it for profit to the highest bidder. Global trends make nuclear terrorism a real threat</span>. Although the international community has recognized the dangers of nuclear terrorism, it has yet to develop a comprehensive strategy to lower the risks of nuclear terrorism. Major barriers include complacency about the threat and the adequacy of existing nuclear security measures; secrecy that makes it difficult for states to share information and to cooperate; political disputes; competing priorities; lack of funds and technical expertise in some countries; bureaucratic obstacles; and the sheer difficulty of preventing a potentially small, hard-to-detect team of terrorists from acquiring a small, hard-to-detect chunk of nuclear material with which to manufacture a crude bomb. These barriers must not be allowed to stand in the way of the panhuman universal priority of preventing this grave threat from materializing. If current approaches toward eliminating the threat are not replaced with a sense of urgency and resolve, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the question will become not if, but when, where, and on what scale the first act of nuclear terrorism occurs</span>.<br />

In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question ‘‘Is Nuclear War Inevitable??’’ [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what <span style="font-size: 10pt;">most terrorists</span> obviously already <span style="font-size: 10pt;">know</span> about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve <span style="font-size: 10pt;">figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange</span>. As Moore points out, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian ‘‘dead hand’’ system, ‘‘where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,’’ it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 10pt;">S</span>tates’’ [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal ‘‘Samson option’’ against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even ‘‘anti-Semitic’’ European cities [10]. In that case, of course, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Russia would retaliate</span>, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not <span style="font-size: 10pt;">tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most</span> of the <span style="font-size: 10pt;">major cities</span> in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a <span style="font-size: 10pt;">nuclear winter</span> that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">could last</span> as long as a <span style="font-size: 10pt;">100 years, taking a savage toll upon the</span> environment and fragile <span style="font-size: 10pt;">ecosphere</span> as well. And <span style="font-size: 10pt;">what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on. Any accident, mistaken communication, false signal or ‘‘lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason could, in a matter of a few minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons, and once a weapon is used, then the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high</span> while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is actually less probable since <span style="font-size: 10pt;">each country would act under the ‘‘use them or lose them’’ strategy and psychology</span>; restraint by one power would be interpreted as a weakness by the other, which could be exploited as a window of opportunity to ‘‘win’’ the war. In other words, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">once Pandora’s Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them.</span> Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, ‘‘everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors’’ [10]. In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and <span style="font-size: 10pt;">once even just one is used, it is very likely that many, if not all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of much of human civilization while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter</span>.<br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Effective information sharing across datasets and system boundaries, the ability to fuse information and data from sources that provide </span>(partially) <span style="font-size: 10pt;">overlapping and complementary coverage, and efficient, secure data management have long been identified as key drivers of effective intelligence and homeland security-related information systems. Information systems for protecting transportation infrastructure share the same design objectives. To support counterterrorism efforts such as preparing, detecting, and responding to terrorism events, large amounts of information in different modalities from many sources must be acquired, integrated, and interpreted in the right context, often in real time.2 In addition, a critical need exists for a data-management infrastructure that can support information flows across jurisdictional and organizational boundaries</span> (for example, intelligence, law-enforcement, and emergency-response communities). Despite existing efforts, researchers and practitioners must still make significant progress in this area from both technical and policy perspectives, with careful attention to laws and regulations, privacy considerations, and civil rights.<br />

Within government circles around the world, the announcement has highlighted a dilemma: How do you balance the universal mandate for scientific openness against the fear that terrorists or rogue states might follow the researchers' work -- using it as catastrophic cookbooks for global influenza contagion? <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Concern reached such heights that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a surprise visit to Geneva on Dec. 7, addressing the review summit on biological weapons. No American official of her stature had attended the bioweapons summits in decades, and Clinton's presence stunned observers</span>. Clinton told the Palais des Nations audience that the <span style="font-size: 10pt;">threat of biological weapons could no longer be ignored because &quot;there are warning signs,&quot; including &quot;evidence in Afghanistan that … al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula made a call to arms for</span> -- and I quote -- <span style="font-size: 10pt;">'brothers with degrees in microbiology or chemistry to develop a weapon of mass destruction.'&quot;</span> (Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is the terrorist group's Yemeni-based affiliate and perhaps its most aggressive arm today, with connections to a number of ambitious plots.) <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Then, in what has widely been interpreted as an allusion to the superflu experiments, </span>Clinton added, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">&quot;The nature of the problem is evolving. The advances in science and technology make it possible to both prevent and cure more diseases, but also easier for states and nonstate actors to develop biological weapons. A crude, but effective, terrorist weapon can be made by using a small sample of any number of widely available pathogens, inexpensive equipment, and college-level chemistry and biology. Even as it becomes easier to develop these weapons, it remains extremely difficult … to detect them, because almost any biological research can serve dual purposes. The same equipment and technical knowledge used for legitimate research to save lives can also be used to manufacture deadly diseases.&quot;</span> By the end of 2011, few governments or scientific committees were satisfied with the actions that had been taken to date to limit publication of the methods Fouchier and Kawaoka deployed, and most were frankly frightened. The Fouchier episode laid bare the emptiness of biological-weapons prevention programs on the global, national, and local levels. Along with several older studies that are now garnering fresh attention, it has revealed that the political world is completely unprepared for the synthetic-biology revolution.<br />

The Commission believes that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">unless the</span> world <span style="font-size: 10pt;">community acts decisively and with great urgency, it is more likely than not that a weapon of mass destruction will be used</span> in a terrorist attack somewhere in the world <span style="font-size: 10pt;">by the end of 2013. The Commission further believes that terrorists are more likely to be able to obtain and use a biological weapon than a nuclear weapon.</span> The Commission believes that the U.S. government needs to move more aggressively to limit the proliferation of biological weapons and reduce the prospect of a bioterror attack. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">This</span> powerful <span style="font-size: 10pt;">statement</span> from the most recent Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Proliferation and Terrorism <span style="font-size: 10pt;">serves as ample warning of the dire threats faced by the United States and indeed the world from a bioweapon successfully deployed by a determined and knowledgeable terrorist</span>. In thinking about the potential for such a bioterror attack, several important questions serve to frame the discussion. Do terrorists have the desire to employ WMD, and in particular biological weapons? Under what conditions might biological weapons be an attractive choice for use by terrorists? Would they have the requisite knowledge, equipment, and organizational capacity to mount a biological warfare (BW) attack? Would they be successful in such an attack? What could we do to mitigate the effects of a bioterror attack? This article provides a framework for understanding the potential for a BW attack now and in the future by a terrorist or terrorist organization. In developing this framework, the findings hinge less on the technical capabilities than on the intentions of the potential perpetrator. State use of biological weapons in either large-scale strategic scenarios or as tools of assassination is not examined directly, although the framework could have equal application to a state BW program. The Potential Perpetrator Terrorism is a term that evokes strong emotions. Events of 9/11 brought terrorism to the forefront of the national security debate in the United States and arguably throughout the rest of the world. Despite this increased attention during the intervening period, the debate has seen little increased clarity. No agreed definition of terrorist has been developed, and the word has been used seemingly interchangeably with other terms such as insurgent, illegal combatant, and freedom fighter. The result is a politicization of the term that hinders global cooperation and confuses the issue. This can be seen in a discussion of the rationality of the terrorist. Many believe that terrorists are pathologically damaged, violent sociopaths who employ violence for their own perverted outcomes. Others believe that terrorists are calculating and highly rational actors with real or perceived grievances, employing a range of strategies from political actions to violence in order to achieve desired outcomes. Some have gone as far as to suggest that it is possible to reach a negotiated settlement with terrorists, in the same way that one might reach a postconflict settlement following a state-to-state conflict. 2 Regardless of the exact definition or the rationality of the terrorist, several important trends serve as the foundation for this analysis. First, terrorism is not a new phenomenon and has a long historical precedence. The direct origin of the term can be traced to the time of the French Revolution, although the period beginning in the 1970s is of the most interest for our discussion. It is during this period—with emphasis on the post-9/11 period—where we see the confluence of the use of high violence strategies, the rise of global terrorist organizations fueled by globalization, and increasing religious radicalization. 3 Second, terrorists are continually searching for new means to facilitate increasingly violent and spectacular attacks that will gain visibility for and further their causes. Attacks have become more frequent and more violent. Prior to the Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in the late 1990s, for instance, global casualties from terrorist attacks were fewer than 500 per year. 4 The Embassy bombings caused casualties in the thousands, and then the attacks of 9/11caused over 3,000 deaths with many more injured. In compiling terrorism trends for 2008, the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) identified 11,770 attacks that killed 15,765 (see figure 1). 5 A note of caution is in order for the reader who might want to directly compare the casualty figures. The different counting rules and definitions certainly contribute to some of the disparities noted. Additionally, the NCTC data include attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan, which some might consider related to an insurgency rather than terrorist action. Still, the increases in violence and number of attacks are worth considering. A statement by noted terrorism expert Brian Jenkins summarizes the trends in terrorism: Over the past three decades, terrorists have multiplied the number of their victims by an order of magnitude every 15 years. In the 1970s, the bloodiest incidents involved tens of fatalities. By the 1990s, hundreds were killed and the incidents increased. In 2001, the number reached the thousands, and today we fear scenarios in which tens of thousands might die. 6 Third, general agreement now exists that terrorists are “rational” actors. Their actions may not be understood by their victims or the governments and law enforcement agencies that attempt to deal with these threats, but they are far from random irrational acts. One noted expert identifies alienation, humiliation, demographics, history, and territory as grievances that motivate terrorists. 7 Fourth, and related to their rational actor status, terrorists have constituencies they must satisfy. High violence strategies that indiscriminately kill and maim large numbers of people are not desirable as a long-term tactic. Likewise, failure to adequately gain visibility and promote a cause will likely be seen as ineffective by these constituencies. This will serve as both a motivating influence and a moderating factor that will feature prominently into the bioterror question. Fifth, the question of whether a terrorist will employ a unique means such as biological weapons is directly related to the ability to develop the capabilities, intentions, and knowledge necessary for perpetrating a bioterror attack. Some terrorist groups will likely find it outside of their operational envelope to employ such a technique. Others may find development of these capabilities too technically challenging. Still others may determine that use of these weapons may present an existential threat to the terrorist should the attacked nation employ a massive retaliatory effort (assuming, of course, that the perpetrators can be identified). <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally, terrorism today does not represent an existential threat to the United States or our friends and allies. </span>However, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">this could change should terrorists develop or acquire the capability for conducting a WMD attack using either nuclear or biological weapons</span>. In a harbinger of what the future might hold, Bruce Hoffman noted ominously that “many of the constraints (both self-imposed and technical) which previously limited terrorist use of WMD are eroding.” 8 What Is Biological Warfare? <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Biological warfare is the intentional use of microbes to cause disease in a target population.</span> Microbes are inherent in all life forms and include bacteria, viruses, protozoa, algae, and fungi. While some microbes are responsible for causing disease, many others serve vital functions for supporting all forms of plant and animal life. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">In BW, the attempt is to effectively and efficiently deploy weapons composed of biological material to attack a target and achieve a desired objective. The use of biological weapons is not a new tactic and in fact predates the understanding of disease</span>. The history of biological warfare can be traced back to medieval times including the siege of Caffa on the Crimean Peninsula, the use of blood-laced arrows against enemies, and the catapulting of human and animal carcasses into enemy encampments and fortifications during the Crusades. The modern history of biological weapons includes programs by some 20 states beginning in the 1940s to the present. Often-cited efforts include the Japanese use of BW against China and captured prisoners in the World War II period; the massive Soviet program that continued through the end of the Cold War; and the programs and cooperation among Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States that began in the 1940s and continued until the United States unilaterally denounced biological weapons and toxins in 1969. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The modern history of BW also includes the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which was the first arms control treaty that banned the use of an entire class of weapons for offensive purposes. Also part of this history is the limited success the BWC has had with regard to halting the development of offensive BW capabilities by some of the convention’s signatory nation</span>s. The history of bioterror incidents is also instructive. One study concluded that from 1900 to 2003, there were only 77 total incidents. The data do not encompass state-sponsored BW or hoaxes. 9 The hoaxes in particular would include a large number of “incidents” as they tend to outnumber actual events by as much as 100 to 1. 10 The small number of incidents and the uniqueness of each limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions from the data. Instead, each requires analysis to determine the key parameters and outcomes that defined it and ultimately the success or failure of the attack. An important note is that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">during combat operations in Afghanistan in 2001, documents were seized indicating al Qaeda’s interest in developing a BW capability</span>; few details have emerged concerning the intended purpose of the weapons or how far their developmental effort have progressed. In understanding BW, several factors contribute directly to the ability to develop and employ an effective biological weapon, including the agent or pathogen, deployment method, formulation, manufacturing process, and meteorological and terrain conditions. 11 It is instructive in understanding the potential for a bioterror attack to appreciate the choices that must be made. Will the agent be a bacteria, virus, or toxin? Should a contagious or noncontagious pathogen be selected? Should a lethal or an incapacitating agent be used? These initial decisions begin to determine the type of attack that will be possible and even the manner in which it should be conducted. In examining the deployment method, will the agent be delivered by aerosol, vector, food, or water? Will the pathogen be delivered using an explosive device or a spray nozzle? The formulation of the pathogen is also important. Will a wet or dry agent be used? Will the material be stabilized to make it more efficient and able to remain airborne for a longer period? What is the manufacturing process? How and in what quantities will the material be grown to mount an attack against the envisioned target? Will the material be dried and milled? What size are the particles? Do they support efficient respiratory infection or are they too large to be inhaled and remain deeply embedded in the alveoli within the lungs? Even once the initial agent, deployment method, formulation, and manufacturing process have been determined, success in the attack ultimately depends on the meteorological conditions when the weapon is deployed. What is the wind speed? Will the weapon be deployed in a city or open terrain? What time of day? Is there an inversion that would keep the agent on the ground and therefore be more effective against the intended target? These questions relate to the potential effectiveness of the biological weapon; however, another set of considerations is directly related to the effectiveness of the attack. They include the concentration, dose, stability, and target susceptibility. In considering these factors, the goal of the bioweaponeer is to have the highest concentration of organisms per milliliter or gram (depending on whether a liquid or dry formulation is used) of material. Another consideration is the lethal dose (LD) or infective dose (ID), which is normally measured in LD50 and ID50 , respectively, and relates to the dose required to cause mortality or infection in 50 percent of the people exposed. This becomes a major factor in considering the agent for weaponization. Consider that for the disease tularemia, the LD50 is approximately 50 organisms, while for anthrax it is approximately 8,000 spores. However, there are always tradeoffs to be made. Francisella tularensis, the organism responsible for tularemia, is highly susceptible to the environment and experiences biological decay at a rate of 2.5 to 5 percent per minute (depending on meteorological conditions and the weaponization of the pathogen), while Bacillus anthracis, the anthrax organism, is a hearty spore that experiences virtually no biological decay. The final consideration of target susceptibility is another important factor. Ultimately, the success of an attack will be determined by whether the deployed BW weapon will infect the target population in the appropriate manner to cause disease. If the target population has been vaccinated or is not susceptible to the weapon or if protective measures have been taken, the attack will fail. For example, if an anthrax attack against troops is initiated, but the soldiers all have personal protective equipment and have been vaccinated against the pathogen, the attack most likely will not be successful. An important note is in order at this point. When terms such as LD50 and ID50 are used, they normally are based on what the medical and public health community knows about the effect of the naturally occurring strains of the bacteria and viruses. But what if the biological material has been altered such that fewer particles cause disease or the virulence of the material reduces the incubation time? This would be the likely goal of a bioweaponeer. This previous set of questions contains a mix of operational and technical issues that the bioterrorist would need to master for a successful attack. It also serves as fodder for those who claim that developing a BW capacity is a nontrivial task too difficult for a terrorist to master. But what are the facts? Dual-use Technologies <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Central to the question of the potential for a bioterror attack is the ability of the terrorist to develop a viable BW capability, implying mastery of the biology, the technology for dispersing the pathogen, and the development of a scenario aligned with the objectives sought. Some believe that the technology is too sophisticated for mastery by a terrorist and that specialized capabilities are required.</span> Advocates of this position state that other terrorists such as Aum Shinrikyo and the Rajneeshee cult failed to acquire, process, weaponize, and successfully deploy a biological weapon. In another example, a postdoctoral student was given a year to develop this scenario using the pathogen Francisella tularensis. At the end of that period, when the results were briefed, the student had made three fatal errors that would have doomed the effort and prevented a successful attack. 12 In yet another anecdote that alludes to the difficulties of developing a biological weapons capability, Jerzy Mierzejewski, the retired director of the Polish biological defense laboratories who spent his career working with Clostridium botulinum, lamented that “one culture cycle would produce toxin that was lethal and a few months later the next would not, and so on over the years.” 13 Others argue that the development of biological weapons is almost trivial. One author wrote that producing biological weapons was “about as complicated as manufacturing beer and less dangerous than refining heroin.” <span style="font-size: 10pt;">In seminar presentations a few years ago, former Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey claimed that “a B-plus high school chemistry student” could produce biological agents, and at a January 2000 meeting he described producing biological agents as being “about as difficult as producing beer.”</span> In her book The Ultimate Terrorist, Jessica Stern quotes Kathleen <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Bailey</span> who, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">after interviewing professors, graduate students, and pharmaceutical manufacturers, concluded that several biologists with only $10,000 worth of equipment could produce a significant quantity of biological agent</span>. 14 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">In fact, the U.S. Government conducted an experiment in which a small team of experts was tasked with determining the feasibility of developing an “anthrax” weapon using readily available capabilities and equipment. The initiative—Project Bacchus— was sponsored by the</span> Defense Threat Reduction Agency (<span style="font-size: 10pt;">DTRA</span>) and demonstrated that<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the development of these capabilities is not particularly complex or costly</span>. 15 Does this important issue really come down to a question of whom one believes? <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Other insights can be gleaned from examining the trends in biotechnology that are placing ever increasing knowledge and capabilities in the hands of more people around the globe, undoubtedly including some who would use the technology for other than noble purposes.</span> In fact, many believe that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">we have entered the Age of Biotechnology</span>. On the face of it, such a statement means little without further examining the likely impact for <span style="font-size: 10pt;">key technologies</span> that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">could be</span> used for the benefit of humankind or just as readily turned into <span style="font-size: 10pt;">deadly weapons of mass destruction</span>.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> One study conducted by the</span> Department of Defense (<span style="font-size: 10pt;">DOD</span>) concluded that capabilities<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> in several key technologies are experiencing a doubling every 6 months—a 400 percent increase per yea</span>r. Areas experiencing such increases include cell growth chambers and fermenters, encapsulization and stabilization, the human genome, pathogen efficacy, DNA engineering, sensors, vaccines and antibiotics, and nucleic acid synthesis. 16 By way of an example, the rate of vaccine development doubled every 5 years from 1940 to 1970. From 1970 to 1980, the rate increased fivefold such that the time to double the capabilities in the field of vaccines was 1 year. Over the next 20-year period from 1980 to 2000, the time to double in capability decreased to 6 months. Another field, DNA engineering, not even in existence until 1982, has doubled in capacity every 6 months since. This area is critically important to a variety of biotechnical advances including gene therapy, vaccine development, and sensors, as well as the potential of ominously increasing the virulence of a pathogen. The same is true for encapsulization and stabilization, which have potential for enhancing personal protection and therapeutics as well as making BW weapons more effective and stable in the environment. 17 As an example of what the future might hold, a recent article discusses the development of an artificial polio virus synthesized with nonliving components combined using specialized equipment and chemicals. 18 While this early work provides a proof of concept, genetic engineering and combinatorial chemistry in the future will allow for largescale, rapid synthesizing of peptides, polynucleotides, and other low weight molecular material, allowing for manipulation of the very building blocks of life. The polio virus, with its relatively simple structure and 8,000 base pairs in its genomic sequence, provides a glimpse into the possibilities as well as highlighting the potential for the development of, for instance, the smallpox virus in this manner. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Artificial development of the smallpox virus, with 200,000 base pairs and a considerably more complex structure, in this manner remains out of reach for the moment, but the Age of Biotechnology will likely make this development possible in the future.</span> Couple this with the ready <span style="font-size: 10pt;">availability of the genomic sequences from a wide variety of disease-causing pathogens and organisms, and one can easily predict the potential for artificially developing pathogens, manipulating current pathogens to make them more virulent, or perhaps developing antibiotic-/ antiviral-resistant pathogens</span>.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Attempts to control or limit advances in biotechnology seem fruitless with an industry that has such potential for improving the quality of life and that comprises such a large part of the U.S. and global economies</span>. Additionally, the dual-use nature of biotechnology—that is, the very capabilities that allow <span style="font-size: 10pt;">for developing prophylaxes and treatments and can be employed just as effectively for developing biological weapons—results in a conundrum that we cannot fail to recognize.</span> Framework for Analysis Successful employment of a bioterror weapon implies that a lone terrorist or terrorist organization has mastered five steps: acquire, process, and weaponize a pathogen, and plan the attack and deploy the weapon so as to cause disease in a target population. However successful, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">employment of a bioterror weapon should not be considered in isolation, but rather should be thought of as a two-sided proposition where our capabilities in preparedness and response as articulated in the D</span>epartment of <span style="font-size: 10pt;">H</span>omeland <span style="font-size: 10pt;">S</span>ecurity’s <span style="font-size: 10pt;">doctrine of prevent, protect, respond, and recovery interact to either facilitate or hinder the terrorists’ capabilities in varying degrees across each of the five steps</span>. This framework forms a matrix that allows us to consider this two-sided equation in detail (see figure 2). For our purposes, the matrix has been color-coded to reflect our ability to affect each of the bioterrorist’s necessary steps. A useful exercise is to look at the matrix in greater detail to gain an understanding of the potential for a bioterror incident and our ability to positively affect outcomes. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Our ability to prevent a terrorist from acquiring, processing, and weaponizing biological material is limited.</span> Deadly pathogens<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> are naturally occurring, and with the proliferation in the life sciences of knowledge, equipment, and capabilities, these collective steps have experienced a lowering of thresholds that allows for more biotechnology in the hands of a larger number of people, some of whom may desire to employ these capabilities as weapons. Equipment for fermentation, freeze drying, and milling—which can be found readily in local hardware stores or ordered from the comfort of one’s home—allows for developing and weaponizing these biological capabilities.</span> This is not to say that all pathogens will be available to all terrorists. International efforts to prevent biological proliferation activities such as the Australia Group and the Proliferation Security Initiative have limited effectiveness given that pathogens are naturally occurring and that the equipment requirements for processing pathogens are not particularly sophisticated. Some will prove to be too difficult or dangerous to work with; however, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">a determined terrorist hoping to develop a basic BW capability would see thresholds lowered</span>. In short, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">biological material suitable for use in an attack has become less technically challenging and therefore made these biological capabilities more readily available. Impacting the terrorists’ ability to acquire, process, and weaponize a pathogen is also limited by the modest requirements for developing a BW capability</span>. Unlike nuclear <span style="font-size: 10pt;">weapons that have a requirement for highly specialized equipment and radioactive material with a large footprint and distinctive signature, BW weapons can be constructed in a small, confined space with little need for complex equipment and no discernible signature</span>. In fact, the <span style="font-size: 10pt;">DTRA study conducted as part of Project Bacchus established this clearly.</span> We do have some ability to prevent terrorists from successfully planning and deploying such weapons. For example, buildings can be designed to prevent employment of biological weapons in certain scenarios. Standoff distances and limiting access to air intake systems will limit use of biological weapons against these types of hardened targets. In the category of protection, we do have greater ability to affect outcomes. Terrorists desiring to acquire, process, and weaponize a pathogen such as anthrax would likely be deterred from doing so if they intended to employ the BW weapon against a population that had been fully immunized against the pathogen. Development of vaccines and therapeutics can have an important deterrent effect as well. Likewise, conducting an attack against a building that has defensive measures built into the air handling system would probably not result in a successful attack and therefore would also serve as a deterrence measure. Developing and fielding new realtime sensors that provide a detect-to-warn capability will also be important. Today, the current suite of sensors, such as those in the BioWatch 19 program, are detect-to-treat with relatively long periods between exposure and establishing that an attack has occurred. This period may be as long as a day or more. In the future, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">new age biotechnological capabilities should begin to allow for real-time detection that will permit warning of the attack as it is occurring so people can be moved out of the attack area and begin receiving immediate treatment, and potential victims can be prevented from entering contaminated areas.</span>Protection also implies the employment of risk-based strategies to determine where attacks are most likely, and the deployment of deterrence and countermeasures to ensure adequate coverage of important locations and facilities. Examining the last two categories, respond and recover, we reach two important conclusions. First, these actions have no applicability to the terrorists’ ability to acquire, process, or weaponize a biological weapon. Second, these areas offer the greatest potential for us to affect outcomes with well considered and emplaced programs. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Response begins with the ability to sense that an attack is in progress or has occurred.</span> It is related to our sensor technology as part of the BioWatch program, but also includes improved biosurveillance, stockpiling of critical treatments and vaccines, increased resilience in the health care system to handle surge requirements envisioned from a bioterror attack, and trained and ready first responders. The BioSense 20 and BioShield 21 programs are a start at improving biosurveillance and stockpiling, respectively, but more can and must be done. The readiness of our public health community and first responders is also a vital link in this system. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 21, “Public Health and Medical Preparedness,” of October 2007 identified the four most critical components of public health and medical preparedness as biosurveillance, countermeasure distribution, mass casualty care, and community resilience. 22 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Today, we have no national biosurveillance system. Rather, we have a collection of state and local systems that have been cobbled together and that continue to rely on the capabilities of astute clinicians, doctors, and public health personnel. The picture is even worse globally as much of the reporting is spotty and incomplete at best, and even subject to politicization.</span> Certainly, we have the technical capability to develop an automated disease tracking system linked to hospitals, clinics, and public health facilities. Perhaps the more relevant question is whether we have the political will. On a positive note, the World Health Organization International Health Regulations that establish requirements for global disease reporting by 2012 represent an important step in global biosurveillance. Just as advances in biotechnology allow for the proliferation of increasingly dangerous dual-use capabilities, they also provide a greater capacity to develop new age treatments and prophylaxes. In the future, developing technologies such as DNA engineering and combinatorial chemistry combined with emerging technology such as nanotechnology will provide new opportunities for fighting naturally occurring disease as well as bioterror attacks. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The importance of casualty care and community resilience cannot be overstated. A bioterror attack will likely result in a mass casualty situation with large numbers of affected individuals and worried well converging on hospitals, clinics, and treatment facilities. The ability to rapidly assess and treat, instill public confidence, and communicate effectively will be essential for a quick response and recovery effort</span>. The implications of the framework are important to developing comprehensive programs that are both effective and efficient in dealing with an attack. In an era of scarce resources, we must ensure that we are spending wisely. Biological laboratory safety and control of dual-use technologies have received much attention recently. Deficiencies at biological safety level (BSL) laboratories, both in the labs and in their physical security, have been publically noted. Better controls are necessary for BSL facilities, but they are not sufficient. Likewise, efforts such as those by the Australia Group 23 and through the Proliferation Security Initiative 24 have less applicability for biological weapons where the pathogens are naturally occurring, and there are only modest requirements for developing and deploying BW weapons. This strongly implies that novel approaches must be developed for preventing, responding to, or recovering from a potential bioterror attack. Bioterrorism is a very real and growing threat. We have seen a new type of terrorist emerge since the 1970s with a greater tendency toward taking global action and employing high violence strategies. This emerging terrorist has also demonstrated the propensity to employ nontraditional means such as airliners and fertilizers as weapons of mass destruction.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> It is becoming increasingly likely with trends in biotechnology that terrorists will turn to the use of biological pathogens for perpetrating bioterror attacks. The nature of BW suggests that our ability to prevent such bioterror attacks cannot be assured, given the natural availability of disease-causing pathogens and advances in biotechnology that are allowing proliferation of potentially dangerous biological capabilities. However, </span>we control our own destiny with regard to protecting populations and mounting an effective response and recovery.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> All indications are that the time to prepare is now.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">A looming danger confronts the world—the threat of bioviolence. It is a danger that will only grow in the future, yet we are increasingly failing to confront it. With every passing day, committing a biocatastrophe becomes a bit easier, and this condition will perpetuate for as long as science progresses.</span> Biological warfare is as old as conflict, of course, but in terms of the objectives of traditional warfare— gaining territory or resources, compelling the surrender of an opposing army—biological weapons weren’t very effective. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">If the objective is to inflict mass death and panic on a mixed population,</span> however, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">emerging bioweapons offer remarkable potential. We would be irresponsible to presume that radical jihadists like al Qaeda have ignored said potential</span>. What’s New in Bioviolence? <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Bioviolence refers to the many ways to inflict disease as well as the many people who might choose to do so, whether heads of states, criminals, or fanatics</span>. Fortunately, doing bioviolence is technically far more difficult than using conventional explosives. Natural pathogens like anthrax are difficult to weaponize. Smallpox remains unavailable (presumably); plague is readily treatable; Ebola kills too quickly to ignite a pandemic. But <span style="font-size: 10pt;">emerging scientific disciplines—notably genomics, nanotechnology, and other microsciences— could alter these pathogens for use as weapons. These scientific disciplines offer profound benefits for humanity, yet there is an ominous security challenge in minimizing the danger of their hostile application</span>. For example, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">highly dangerous agents can be made resistant to vaccines or antibiotics. In Australia, scientists introduced a gene into mousepox (a cousin of smallpox) to reduce pest populations—it worked so well that it wiped out 100% of affected mice, even those that had immunity against the disease. Various bacterial agents, such as plague or tularemia (rabbit fever), could be altered to increase their lethality or to evade antibiotic treatment. Diseases once thought to be eradicated can now be resynthesized, enabling them to spread in regions where there is no natural immunity</span>. The polio virus has been synthesized from scratch; its creators called it an “animate chemical.” Soon, it may be resynthesized into a form that is contagious even among vaccinated populations. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Recreation of long eradicated livestock diseases could ravage herds severely lacking in genetic diversity, damage food supplies , and cause devastating economic losses. Perhaps the greatest biothreat is the manipulation of the flu and other highly contagious viruses, such as Ebola. </span>Today, scientists can change parts of a virus’s genetic material so that it can perform specific functions. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The genomic sequence of the Spanish flu virus that killed upwards of 40 million people nearly a century ago has been widely published; any savvy scientist could reconstruct it.</span> The avian flu is even more lethal, albeit not readily contagious via casual aerosol delivery. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">A malevolent bioscientist might augment its contagiousness. The Ebola virus might be manipulated so that it kills more slowly, allowing it to be spread farther before its debilitating effects altogether consume its carrier. A bit further off is genetic manipulation of the measles virus—one of the great killers in human history—rendering useless the immunizations that most of us receive in early childhood. Soon, laboratory resynthesis of smallpox may be possible. Advanced drug delivery systems can be used to disseminate lethal agents to broad populations.</span> Bioregulators — small organic compounds that modify body systems— could enhance targeted delivery technologies. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Some experts are concerned that new weapons could be aimed at the immune, neurological, and neuroendocrine systems. Nanotechnology that lends itself to mechanisms for advanced disease detection and drug delivery—such as gold nanotubes that can administer drugs directly into a tumor—could also deliver weaponized agents deep into the body, substantially raising the weapon’s effectiveness.</span> Altogether, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">techniques that were on the frontiers of science only a decade or two ago are rapidly mutating as progress in the biological sciences enables new ways to produce lethal catastrophe. </span>Today, they are on the horizon. Within a decade, they will be pedestrian. According to the National Academies of Science, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">“The threat spectrum is broad and evolving—in some ways predictably, in other ways unexpectedly. In the future, genetic engineering and other technologies may lead to the development of pathogenic organisms with unique, unpredictable characteristics.” For as far into the future as we can possibly see, every passing day it becomes slightly easier to commit a violent catastrophe than it was the day before.</span> Indeed, the rapid pace of advancing science helps explain why policies to prevent such a catastrophe are so complicated. Bioviolence Jihad? <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Some experts argue that terrorists and fanatics are not interested in bioviolence and that the danger might therefore be overblown. Since there have been no catastrophic bioviolence attacks, these experts argue, terrorists lack the intention to make bioweapons</span>. Hopefully, they are correct.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> But an enormous amount of evidence suggests they are wrong. From the dawn of biology’s ability to isolate pathogens, people have pursued hostile applications of biological agents. It is perilous to ignore this extensive history by presuming that today’s villains are not fervent about weaponizing disease</span>. Not a single state admits to having a bioweapons program, but U.S. intelligence officials assert that as many as 10 states might have active programs, including North Korea, Iran, and Syria. Moreover, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">many terrorist organizations have expressed interest in acquiring biological weapons. Whatever weight the taboo against inflicting disease might have for nation-states, it is obviously irrelevant to terrorists, criminals, and lunatics. Deterrence by threat of retaliation is essentially meaningless for groups with suicidal inclinations who are likely to intermingle with innocent civilians. Al -Qaeda and affiliated Islamic fundamentalist organizations have overtly proclaimed their intention to develop and use bioweapons. The 11th volume of al-Qaeda’s Encyclopedia of Jihad is devoted to chemical and biological weapons. Indeed, alQaeda has acknowledged that “biological weapons are considered the least complicated and easiest to manufacture of all weapons of mass destruction.” Al-Qaeda is widely reported to have acquired legal pathogens via publicly available scientific sources. Before 9/11, al-Qaeda operatives reportedly purchased anthrax and plague from arms dealers in Kazakhstan, and the group has repeatedly urged followers to recruit microbiology and biotechnology experts. Following the Taliban’s fall, five al Qaeda biological weapons labs in Afghanistan tested positive for anthrax. Documents calculating aerial dispersal methods of anthrax via balloon were discovered in Kabul, along with anthrax spore concentrate at a nearby vaccine laboratory. According to a lengthy fatwa commissioned by Osama bin Laden, jihadists are entitled to use weapons of mass destruction against the infidels, even if it means killing innocent women, children, and Muslims. No matter that these weapons cannot be specifically targeted. “[N]othing is a greater duty, after faith itself, than repelling an enemy attacker who sows corruption to religion and the world.” According to the fatwa, “No conditions limit this: one repels the enemy however one can.” The sentiment might be reprehensible, but it is certainly not irrational. Even the most passionate terrorists must realize that conventional attacks are not bringing the West to its knees. The 9/11 strikes, the bombing of the Madrid and London subways, and numerous smaller attacks have all put civilization on edge, but history marches inexorably forward.</span> A few thousand people can be killed, yet Western armies still traverse the world, and Western economies still determine winners and losers. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">From this perspective, the stakes must be raised. Bioviolence is perhaps the most dire, easiest means to execute existential danger.</span> What Might Bioviolence Accomplish? Envision a series of attacks against capitals of developing states that have close diplomatic linkages with the United States. The attacks would carry a well-publicized yet simple warning: “If you are a friend of the United States, receive its officials, or support its policies , thou sands of your people will get sick . ” How many attacks in how many cities would it take before international diplomacy, to say nothing of international transit, comes to a crashing halt? <span style="font-size: 10pt;">In comparison to use of conventional or chemical weapons, the potential death toll of a bioattack could be huge.</span> Although the number of victims would depend on where an attack takes place, the type of pathogen, and the sophistication of the weapons maker, there is widespread consensus among experts that a heightened attack would inflict casualties exceedable only by nuclear weapons. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">In comparison to nuclear weapons, bioweapons are far easier and cheaper to make and transport, and they can be made in facilities that are far more difficult to detect. The truly unique characteristic of certain bioweapons that distinguishes them from every other type of weapon is contagion. No other type of weapon can replicate itself and spread. Any other type of attack, no matter how severe, occurs at a certain moment in time at an identifiable place. If you aren’t there, you are angry and upset but not physically injured by the attack. An attack with a contagious agent can uniquely spread, potentially imperiling target populations far from where the agents are released. A bio-offender could infect his minions with a disease and send them across borders before symptoms are obvious. Carriers will then spread it to other unsuspecting victims who would themselves become extended bioweapons, carrying the disease indiscriminately</span>. There are challenges in executing such an attack, but <span style="font-size: 10pt;">fanatical terrorist organizations seem to have an endless supply of willing suicide attackers</span>. All this leads to the most important characteristic of <span style="font-size: 10pt;">bioviolence</span>: It <span style="font-size: 10pt;">raises incomparable levels of panic. Contagious bioviolence means that planes fly empty or perhaps don’t fly at all. People cancel vacation and travel plans and refuse to interact with each other for fear of unseen affliction.</span> Public entertainment events are canceled; even going to a movie becomes too dangerous. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Ultimately, bioviolence is about hiding our children as everyone becomes vulnerable to our most fundamental terror: the fear of disease. For people who seek to rattle the pillars of modern civilization and perhaps cause it to collapse, effective use of disease would set in motion political, economic, and health consequences so severe as to call into question the ability of existing governments to maintain their citizens’ security.</span> In an attack’s wake, no one would know when it is over, and no government could credibly tell an anxious population where and when it is safe to resume normal life. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">While it is difficult to specify when this danger will strike, there should be no doubt that we are vulnerable to a rupture. Just as planes flying into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, instantly became a historical marker dividing strategic perspectives before from after, the day that disease is effectively used as an instrument of hate will profoundly change everything. </span>If you want to stop modern civilization in its tracks, bioviolence is the way to go.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> The notion that no one will ever commit catastrophic bioviolence is simply untenable.</span> What Can We Do? <span style="font-size: 10pt;">How can we confront these growing dangers?</span> First, we must appreciate the global nature of the problem. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Perpetrators from anywhere can get pathogens from virtually everywhere. Bioresearch labs that once were concentrated in about two dozen developed states are proliferating, expanding the risk that lethal agents could be diverted and misused. The knowledge needed to weaponize pathogens is available on the Internet. An attack can be prepared through easy networks of transnational communication</span>. Once a bioweapon is prepared, terrorists or other perpetrators from anywhere can slide across national boundaries and release disease anonymously. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Once released, a contagious agent would spread without regard for boundaries, race, religion, or nationality. Public health responses would have to be internationally coordinated</span>. New modes of international legal cooperation would immediately be needed to investigate the crime. Thus, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">bioviolence dangers shrink the planet into an interdependent neighborhood. It makes no sense for any particular country to try to insulate its homeland from these dangers. No missile defense system will protect us from bioviolence.</span> Improved border security will not keep disease at bay. National efforts to enhance medical preparedness have virtues, but these defenses can be readily circumvented. To prevent bioviolence requires policies that focus on humanity as a species and that are implemented everywhere with centralized governance. Antibioviolence policies must be global. Ye t , advanc ing ant i -bioviol enc e policies is what the international community does worst. Bioviolence dangers are unnecessarily high because national and international antibioviolence strategies are gap-ridden, often incoherent, and not globally observed. As a result, we are all virtually naked in the face of unacceptable dangers. No other threat presents such a stark contrast between severity of harm and a failure of leadership to reduce risks. Most important, existing institutional arrangements are inadequate. In sharp contrast to most other global security challenges, there is no responsible international authority that defines relevant prohibitions and responsibilities, implements policies over time, or evaluates whether obligations are being fulfilled. With regard to global bioviolence prevent i o n p o l i c i e s , t h e r e ’ s n o b o d y i n charge. No one is responsible; no one is accountable. The absence of authority is profoundly dangerous. Bioviolence prevention and preparedness requires a sizable orchestra, made up of various instruments, to play complicated music in harmony. Today, there is not a bad “conductor”, there is no conductor at all. The result is cacophony. Simply stated, bioviolence is the dark s ide of global izat ion, ye t int e rna tional alarms of bioviolence ring nowhere! We need a comprehensive national and international strategy for bioviol enc e prevent ion . [See box: “Five S t r a t e g i e s f o r P r e v e n t i n g B i oviolence,” page 30.] Policies should be pursued within an integrated approach that enables each policy to gain strength from all the others. Such policies are potentially available and effective, but they demand progressive changes in our global order. The Security Mission Global bioviolence prevention and preparedness policies are imperative, but also imperative is recognition that the world faces natural disease horrors. Where mass public health challenges are daily phenomena, the risks of terrorists using pathogens must be weighed against more tangible natural threats. Simply stated, it is illegitimate to insist that every nation adopt policies for preventing human-inflicted disease without acknowledging the silent genocide of natural disease that is responsible for millions of deaths. But neither is it legitimate to view bioviolence dangers as distractions from efforts to combat natural disease and therefore to put off beneficial measures until those afflictions are defeated. To do so frustrates forward movement on cost-effective initiatives that could help build an international security architecture for advancing science and health. Thus, bioviolence prevention must be a facet of a broad international commitment to: 1. Prevent the spread of disease ( e .g. , through publ i c -heal th measures). 2. Enhance protection against and cures for disease (e.g., through vaccination and drug therapies). 3. Supervise the conduct of biological science. 4. Criminalize unauthorized or improper use of pathogens. From this foundation should flow a policy commitment to the growth of bioscience as a global public good. Policies to encourage its worldwide spread deserve vigorous support. This governance mission should, therefore, be conceived as a global covenant . As bios c i enc e goe s forward as a fundamental pillar of human progress, all nations must undertake common responsibilities to prevent bioviolence even as the burdens associated with those responsibilities are differentiated according to wealth and capability. From everyone according to their abilities—to all for the benefit of all. The United Nations’ Importance The United Nations represents the b e s t venu e fo r a new gove rnanc e platform that can accommodate the need for an integrated global strategy agains t bioviol enc e . Only the United Nations has the necessary in ternational legitimacy, and only the Uni t ed Nat ions can int egrat e the many sectors—health, law enforcement, science, military, emergency preparedness—that must devote expertise and resources. A primary consideration here is to minimize any bureaucratic reshuffling. There is certainly no need to modify or replicate existing capabilities. Many relevant governance tasks are already addressed by one or more international organizations. For example, the World Health Organization should continue to be responsible for addressing the health implications of a pandemic, whether natural or malevolent. Interpol should continue to be responsible for a d d re s s i n g b i o v i o l e n c e ’ s l aw e nforcement implications. Indeed, the UN’s role should be only to coordinate the performance of these tasks. Broadly viewed, the United Nations should be able to undertake three functions: First, a specific UN agency should stimulate bioscience development by incorporating security concerns into the fabric of scientific undertakings and by assisting countries in using bioscience in ways that are consistent with policies for preventing bioviolence. Because science, development, and security can and must be mutually reinforcing, this agency’s primary responsibilities would be to promote and distribute knowledge and build capacity to fulfill obligations, especially in developing nations. Second, a UN office should coordinate activities among the relevant international/regional organizations, professional networks, and expert bodies. For example, three major international organizations focus on health (World Health Organization, Animal Health Organization, and the Food and Agriculture Organization); Interpol and Europol both focus on law enforcement; a large array of organizations focus on conveyance of dangerous items (e.g., International Maritime Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization). This UN office should be a steering mechanism to engage each of these orga nizations’ specialized expertise and to identify synergies. Third, a Security Council Committee should be authorized to investigate bioviolence preparations as well as respond and coordinate assistance to a bioviolence attack. Situations that call for investigation or response arise rarely, but they carry disproportionate significance for international peace and security. The Security Council Committee should not advance programmatic agendas, but it should be able to wield expertise and political muscle in volatile situations. Its primary mission would be to enable the international community to sustain global order in the face of a bioviolence challenge. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Ever since someone harnessed a new technology to create a weapon with more devastating effects, there has been a link—a double helix—between the progress of science and the pursuit of security. This is inevitable.</span> These dangers of bioviolence do not a rg u e f o r re l i n q u i s h i n g s c i e n t i f i c progress, but they disprove notions tha t n ew cha l l eng e s can b e e ff e ct ive ly addre s s ed wi th ye s t e rday’ s policies. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">At bottom is a condition unique to this historical era: Scientific progress is intertwined with escalating malevolence threatening human security. Progressing capabilities improve our lives and yet, inextricably, enable truly harmful weapons against humanity. Here are the challenges to international peace and security at the beginning of the third millennium. Failing to do the right thing in response to these challenges could have dire consequences for all humanity. </span><br />

A variety of <span style="font-size: 10pt;">sensors</span> deployed on the transportation infrastructure can help <span style="font-size: 10pt;">provide an early warning system to detect large-scale emergencies including natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, blizzards, tsunamis, etc.) and technological and man-made disasters (hazardous materials incidents, nuclear power plant accidents, and acts of terrorism including nuclear, chemical, biological, and radiological weapons attacks). In the event of a large-scale emergency, ITS applications can assist with response management through services such as the tracking of emergency vehicle fleets using </span>automated vehicle location (<span style="font-size: 10pt;">AVL) technology and two-way communications between emergency vehicles and dispatchers.</span> When responding to emergencies of any scale, emergency vehicle signal preemption implemented through coordination with arterial management agencies, can speed the safe arrival of emergency responders on scene. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Evacuation operations often require a coordinated emergency response involving multiple agencies, various emergency centers, and numerous response plans.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">ITS is a rapidly developing field that requires a specialized workforce familiar with emerging technologies. Staff responsible for managing ITS systems need knowledge in a variety of areas, including project management and systems engineering, according to two FHWA division office ITS engineers. Workforce demographic changes, the competitive labor market, new technologies, and new expectations in the transportation industry combine to make attracting and retaining a capable workforce difficult for state and local transportation agencies</span>. In addition, a 2011 National Cooperative Highway Research Program study found that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">U.S. universities produce too few skilled applicants for state and local DOTs. These issues combine to affect the ability of state and local agencies, especially smaller agencies, to manage ITS.</span> Many <span style="font-size: 10pt;">state and local transportation agencies struggle to maintain inhouse staff with the skills and knowledge needed to manage ITS projects</span>. Eight of the 15 experts we spoke with noted that agencies face challenges in maintaining staff with the expertise and skills needed for ITS. For example, 1 expert noted that ITS requires skills that civil engineers—with whom transportation agencies are generally well staffed—are not specifically trained in, such as understanding electrical systems, communication networks, and interagency relationship building. Another expert noted difficulty finding staff with other skills necessary to ITS management, such as contract management, systems integration, and information technology troubleshooting skills. In addition<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, the fast pace of technological change and resource limitations put more demands on transportation officials and limit training opportunities.</span> RITA officials told us that transportation agencies need systems engineers to manage ITS deployment and operations but do not have them in sufficient numbers. For example, a local government official told us he has been unable to fill a vacant ITS-related engineering position because of a hiring freeze that has been in effect for over 3 years. According to this official, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">this makes it difficult to complete ITS projects even when funds for projects are available.</span><br />

At the outset, this report provided a taxonomy classifying ITS applications into five categories. But another lens to categorize ITS applications, one more relevant to understanding ITS challenges, is to distinguish between two classes of ITS applications: 1) Those that can be deployed locally on an independent basis and deliver value, and 2) Those that must be deployed as part of a scalable interrelated system to deliver meaningful value. The distinction is useful because <span style="font-size: 10pt;">many ITS applications are subject to system interdependency challenges, require system coordination to deploy, and must operate at scale to be effective.</span>In this dichotomy, the first class includes ITS applications such as ramp meters, computerized smart signals, roadside cameras, and even local traffic operations centers. Communities or regions can make independent decisions about whether to fund and deploy ramp meters or adaptive traffic signal lights, and these applications will deliver local benefits to motorists without having to be connected to a scaled system or without travelers having to adopt these technologies at the same time. (That is, traffic will flow more smoothly if a city or region optimizes its traffic lights or implements ramp metering, as the Minneapolis region experienced.) But <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the vast majority of ITS applications—and certainly the ones primed to deliver the most extensive benefits to the transportation network—must operate at scale, often must operate at a national level, and must involve adoption by the overall system and by individual users at the same time to be effective, raising a set of system interdependency, network effect, and system coordination challenges.</span> ITS applications that must operate at scale include VII and V2V systems, real-time traffic information systems, electronic toll collection systems, and vehicle miles traveled systems. For example, real-time traffic information systems are system interdependent. If a region or state makes all its roadways intelligent with real-time traffic data, such efforts do little good if motorists do not have telematics displays in their vehicles (or on mobile phones) to receive and act on that information. Likewise, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">consumers are unlikely to demand such devices for their vehicles if a large share of communities does not make that real-time traffic information available.</span> VII and V2V systems such as the United States’ IntelliDrive initiative also experience network effects. Each additional IntelliDrive-equipped vehicle on the roadway adds value to the network (and over time, each addition to that network has a positive, downward effect on individual systems’ marginal costs). Moreover, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">VII systems like IntelliDrive must work on a national basis to be truly effective: it does a driver little good to purchase an IntelliDrive-equipped vehicle in Michigan if the system doesn’t operate when he or she is driving in Indiana.</span> Likewise, electronic toll collection systems present a far better driver experience when motorists can traverse a country with a single fare payment system, instead of having to acquire multiple passes to pay tolls in differing jurisdictions. The same holds true for vehicle miles traveled systems: <span style="font-size: 10pt;">it makes little sense for states to independently develop a VMT system because, in addition to requiring a device in the vehicle</span> (ideally as part of the original factory-installed equipment), VMT requires a satellite system and a back-end payment system, and it makes little sense for each state independently to replicate investments in the infrastructure. Thus, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">many intelligent transportation systems are subject to network effect and scale challenges, thus requiring extensive system coordination—often needed at the national level—to deploy and integrate ITS systems.</span><br />

Total Funding Levels<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> and the Highway Trust Fund MAP-21 authorizes federal transportation funding through September 2014, at an annual level of $52.6 billion. This represents a </span>total increase <span style="font-size: 10pt;">of close to 5 percent over the SAFETEA-LU annual average from FY 2006-09. Much of this increase is driven by federal transit spending, which will rise 13 percent on an average annual basis, compared to an inflation-indexed 3.13-percent increase for the federal highway obligation limitation</span>. The bill contains no earmarks, which is a major departure from SAFETEA-LU. As such, MAP-21 apportions 92.6 percent of its funds by formula, compared to 83 percent under SAFETEA-LU. <br />
