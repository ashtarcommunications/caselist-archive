Carrier Gap
Contention 1 is the Carrier Gap
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">First, Carriers are getting cut now and the Navy is shifting away – the Plan is key to solve political fights</span>**

On the surface, the [[http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/navy/|Navy]]’s cherished fleet of 11 active aircraft carriers seems safe
AND
arrived, the [[http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/navy/|Navy]] may grow accustomed to operating with only 10 carriers.”









<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The Navy is being overstretched between Iran and China now</span>

, the Littoral Combat Ship is something the Navy needs to get right.


=Plan= 

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thus the plan, the United States federal government should substantially increases its investment in its aircraft carriers in the United States.</span>**

=Hegemony= 
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Advantage 1 Hegemony</span>**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">First, Failure to shore up the carrier fleet will embolden potential adversaries- that risks great power war</span>
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Brookes 08</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">- Senior Fellow in National Security Affairs at the Heritage Foundation, Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Affairs (Peter, May 2nd, “Flattop Follies: Navy Cuts Back on Carriers”, http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/05/flattop_follies_navy_cuts_back.html)</span>
CHECK this: After cutting the number of active aircraft carriers from 12 to 11
AND
high-tech warfare world, quantity has a quality all its own.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">US naval power guarantees hegemony - prevents attacks on the US mainland and deters potential rivals</span>
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Friedman 07</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(George, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and founder of STRATFOR, “The Limitations and Necessity of Naval Power,” April 10, http://www.stratfor.com/limitations_and_necessity_naval_power)</span>
This raises a more fundamental question: What is the value of naval power in
AND
fundamentally indispensable role the Navy plays in U.S. national security.
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">And, Naval superiority is the foundation of U.S. geopolitical dominance- It provides the “bandwidth” needed to confront all other threats</span>**

The geographic position of the United States, situated comfortably between the Atlantic and Pacific
AND
, insulated as it is by the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hegemony is sustainable – but we have to maintain it</span>
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kagan 12</span>**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">(Robert Kagan, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute, B.A., Yale University, M.P.P., John F.

The challenges today are great, and the rise of China is the most obvious
AND
both to Americans and to the nature of the world they live in.

We take a lot for granted about the way the world looks today -- the
AND
what the world looked like right before the American order came into being.

Andrew Mack and his colleagues at the Human Security Report Project are to be congratulated
AND
in part by the emergence of the United States as the global hegemon.

=Deterrence= 
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Advantage 2 is Deterrence – </span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">First, carriers are key to power projection – ground forces are not sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Thompson 09</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(Loren, Chief Operating Officer at the Lexington Institute, PhD in government from Georgetown, March 10th, “Navy Will Offer Up Carrier & Air Wing in Quadrennial Review”, http://lexingtoninstitute.org/1383.shtml)</span>
Of course, today's carriers make World War Two carriers look like toys. With
AND
So cutting carriers to build a bigger ground force doesn't make much sense.




<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Second, Carriers ensure rapid response to any region in the world – they’re successful __even when the US has no allied support__</span>
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Eaglen 08</span>**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">(Mackenzie Eaglen is Senior Policy Analyst for National Security at The Heritage Foundation, “Aircraft Carriers Are Crucial,” July 31, Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/30/AR2008073003078.html)</span>
For any U.S. president, the aircraft carrier embodies the ultimate crisis
AND
of events and deliver a psychological message of U.S. interest.

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Carrier-based deterrence maintains world peace- they prevent conflicts from escalating</span>**

Also this morning, United States Navy amphibious assault ships carrying 4,400 combat
AND
right force, tailor-made for these uncertain and sometimes fiery times.

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Even if conflict occurs, carriers solve the terminal impact – they’re key to all other operations</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Swan and Horres 08 </span>**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">(Swan, Brigadier General, Director, Concept Development and Experimentation Directorate, Army Capabilities Integration Center, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), National Security Program Fellow at the John F.

The services must provide Joint Force Commanders (JFC) with the maximum number of
AND
time the commander-in-chief asks "Where are the carriers?"
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Only deterrence is an empirically verifiable solution to war</span>

Center for Security Law @ University of Virginia, 7-time Presidential appointee, & Honorary Editor of the American Journal of International Law, Solving the War Puzzle: Beyond the Democratic Peace, John Norton Moore, page 27-31.</span>
As so broadly conceived, there is strong evidence that deterrence, that is,
AND
totality of external factors, that is, deterrence, that become crucial.

=Turkey Syria=
