===Growth Advantage=== 

**Confidence is collapsing now and destroying investment – a national infrastructure bank is the best short term stimulus that doesn’t drive up the deficit**
Robert <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Skidelsky and</span> Felix <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Martin</span>, Emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of Warwick and macroeconomist and bond investor, 03-30-20<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">11</span>, “For a National Investment Bank,” http://www.skidelskyr.com/site/article/for-a-national-investment-bank/
But could a National Investment Bank also help with the urgent problem of the weak
AND
likely be attractive assets for pension funds and other long-term investors.

**It’ll kill resiliency**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">RAMPELL ’11</span> – economics reporter for The New York Times; wrote for the Washington Post editorial pages and financial section (Catherine, “Second Recession in U.S. Could Be Worse Than First”. August 7. http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/business/a-second-recession-could-be-much-worse-than-the-first.html?pagewanted=all)
If the economy falls back into recession, as many economists are now warning, the bloodletting could be a lot more painful than the last time around.
AND
“The one precedent you might consider is 1937, when there was also a premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, and the economy fell into another recession more painful than the first.”

**Even small fluctuations in quality of transportation infrastructure has major impacts on the economy**
Dr. Jean-Paul <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Rodriguez</span>, Department of Global Studies and Geography at Hofstra University, and Dr. Theo Notteboom, is a professor at and the president of the Institute of Transport and Maritime Management Antwerp of the University of Antwerp, 20<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">09</span>, “The Geography of Transport Systems”, [[http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch7en/conc7en/ch7c1en.html]]
Contemporary trends have underlined that economic development has become less dependent on relations with the
AND
are themselves based on transport services, their availability, costs and capacity.

**Infrastructure is key to the economy through exports, efficiency and GDP but it’s declining now – An NIB makes targeted investments that avoids earmarks, inefficient allocations and systemic state deferral of maintenance while capturing private capital**
Robert <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Puentes et al</span>, Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution Felix G. Rohatyn, Special Advisor to the Chairman and CEO, Lazard Freres and Co. LLC Richard Little, Director, Keston Institute for Public Finance and Infrastructure Policy Stephen Goldsmith, New York City Deputy Mayor for Operations, 04-05-20<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">11</span>, “Infrastructure Investment and U.S. Competitiveness”, [[http://www.cfr.org/united-states/infrastructure-investment-us-competitiveness/p24585]] [RR]
Most experts agree the United States must address the nation's aging network of roads,
AND
politics, America can bridge the infrastructure divide and ensure our continued prosperity.

**Keynesian theory is right - return revenues, the multiplier effect, the shock effect, interest rates, self- financing – our evidence is from a literature review**

AND
enough to generate enough extra future government revenue to pay for the stimulus.

====Scenario 1: Recovery==== 
**US crisis tanks the global economy**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">RAHMAN ‘11</span> - former Ambassador and Chairman of the Centre for Foreign Affairs Studies. (Ashfaqur . “Another global recession?”. August 21. http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=199461)
Several developments, especially in Europe and the US, fan this fear. First
AND
we may be in a new double dip or W-shaped recession.

**Double-dip risks nuclear war**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">FORDHAM ‘10</span>(Tina Fordham, “Investors can’t ignore the rise of geopolitical risk”, Financial Times, 7-17-2010, [[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dc71f272-7a14-11df-9871-00144feabdc0.html]])
Geopolitical risk is on the rise after years of relative quiet – potentially creating further
AND
would be a very unwelcome time to see the return of geopolitical risk.”

**Global economic crisis causes war – strong statistical support proves**

Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.

**Growth eliminates the only rational incentives for countries to go to war**
Erik <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Gartzke</span>, associate Professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego PhD from Iowa and B.A. from UCSF Erik, 20<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">11</span>, "SECURITY IN AN INSECURE WORLD", www.cato-unbound.org/2011/02/09/erik-gartzke/security-in-an-insecure-world/
Almost as informative as the decline in warfare has been where this decline is occurring
AND
the consolidating forces of prosperity prevail, that war becomes a durable anachronism.

====Scenario 2: Protectionism==== 

**Unemployment causes backlash against free trade and China bashing**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">JIMENEZ ‘12</span> - Master's student at Georgetown University; degree in political science and international relations from CIDE, Mexico City. (“Protectionism Makes Comeback As Recovery Stalls”, http://atlanticsentinel.com/2012/01/protectionism-makes-comeback-as-recovery-stalls/)
As a result, protectionism could gain weight in the upcoming months and while it may be vilified by conventional wisdom which rightfully points out the benefits of free trade, there is a “human face” which legitimizes it.
Supporters of protectionism tend to justify their demands through what they regard as the direct negative effects of trade with other countries. Some of these effects are caused by the “unfair” practices of governments as China’s. Others are due to the abundance of cheap labor in countries as Mexico.
Whatever the reason, according to protectionists unchecked trade liberalization causes unemployment and income inequality. America’s disturbing trade deficit with China is one of the favorite arguments of trade critics in the United States.
AND
.The politicization of industrial policy that aims to “correct” market imbalances unfortunately often leads democratic governments to privilege certain interest groups, whether they’re corporations or unions, at the expense of their economy’s competitiveness as a whole. Perhaps, in this sense, China’s comparative advantage is its very authoritarianism?

**Protectionism snowballs and causes nuclear war**
Panzner 8<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – faculty at the New York Institute of Finance, 25-year veteran of the global stock, bond, and currency markets who has worked in New York and London for HSBC, Soros Funds, ABN Amro, Dresdner Bank, and JPMorgan Chase (Michael, “Financial Armageddon: Protect Your Future from Economic Collapse,” p. 136-138)</span>
Continuing calls for curbs on the flow of finance and trade will inspire the United
AND
between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.

**China bashing causes war with China**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">REUTERS ‘11</span> (“Analysis: Obama to challenge China on trade as election nears”, http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/13/us-usa-china-trade-idUSTRE79C72820111013)
Analysts cautioned the highly charged political atmosphere in Washington -- as Republicans and Democrats struggle
AND
whether it will spill over into open warfare that could be mutually harmful."

**Extinction**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Cheong ’00</span>(Ching, 6-25, Lexis, No one gains in war over Taiwan)
THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating
AND
cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.

**Unemployment causes widespread suffering and death – that’s a systemic impact**
Dean <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Baker</span>, Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">and</span> Kevin <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Hassett</span>, Senior Fellow and Director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, former served as a senior economist at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and an associate professor of economics and finance at the Graduate School of Business of Columbia University, holds a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, 05-12-20<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">12</span>, “The Human Disaster of Unemployment,” http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-&-columns/op-eds-&-columns/the-human-disaster-of-unemployment
Long-term unemployment is experienced disproportionately by the young, the old, the
AND
is their occupation. Few events rival the emotional strain of job loss.

===Solvency=== 

**A __one-time investment__ into the Infrastructure Bank empirically solves and avoids all turns**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">LIKOSKY ‘11</span> – a senior fellow at the Institute for Public Knowledge, New York University (Michael B., July 12, “Banking on the Future”, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/opinion/13likosky.html)
