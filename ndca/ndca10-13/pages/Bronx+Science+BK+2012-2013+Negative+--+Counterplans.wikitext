**Text: The United States federal government should [plan] as temporary-effect legislation mandating a review in five-years to determine the policy’s effectiveness. Based on the review, the policy can be re-authorized, altered, or terminated.**

Counterplan is competitive—questions of policy timing are even more important than questions of content.

==NB- Complexity== 
Transportation infrastructure is defined by systematic uncertainty—unless we rethink planning around adaptability and flexible governance, we lock-in a status quo unable to deal with alternative futures and increasingly deadly outcomes

Sunset legislation solves the fundamental uncertainty of transportation policy. It allows dynamic, adaptable investment not constrained by forecasting failures

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Most discussions of temporary legislation or sunset legislation tend to focus on terminating unnecessary statutes </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is particularly likely to be the case in policy contexts dominated by uncertainty</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

Temporary and Permanent legislation are mutually exclusive—their default rules are incompatible. The permutation severs the perpetuity of legal validity

More evidence—sunset legislation is not a historical oddity—it’s a widespread legislative strategy throughout history. Should be debated.

Third—it’s their burden to specify a sunset in the plan text, otherwise the default rule is permanence. Cp is not just plan-plus, it’s an entirely different and mutually exclusive policy.
