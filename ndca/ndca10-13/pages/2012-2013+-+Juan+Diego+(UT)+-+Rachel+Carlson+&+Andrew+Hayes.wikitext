=Note From Another Member of Juan Diego= 

Hey all,
Those of you debating him may already have noticed, but Mr. Hayes has a nasty habit of saying "YOLO" whenever and wherever possible. In an effort to help him overcome this problem, we're fining him every time he says it at a debate tournament (don't worry, the money is going to a good cause). If you catch him saying it, please report it by sending an email to ryan.patrick.keenan@gmail.com.
Thanks,
Ryan

===Contention 1=== 

**Contention 1 is the Status Quo**

**Status quo mass transit policy attempts to separate the social from the economic – the result is the privileging of rich, white communities**

**Contention 2 is the Universal**
