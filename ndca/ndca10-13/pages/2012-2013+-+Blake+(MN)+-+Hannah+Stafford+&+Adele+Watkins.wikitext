===Plagiarism CP=== 
**We advocate the entirety of the 1AC except the author citations.**

**Plagiarism solves and avoids the net benefits-it allows us to create radical change and opens up space for us and others to listen. There is no such thing as intellectual property only by sharing their ideas as our own can we solve the 1AC**
<span style="font-size: 80%;">Michael McGrath, Minnesota Debate champion, place in semis in novice glennbrooks, known as the future, is a big shot, pretty cool guy, and partners with Kentucky Morrow, Minnesota debate Champion, known as ktux, is a pretty big deal, most qualified author about this arg, um yeah pretty much an all around bad ass, NOW, http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/harbinger/</span>

<span style="font-size: 80%;">So we can see that our acceptance of the tradition of "intellectual property" has negative effects upon our endeavors to think critically and learn from our artistic and philosophical heritage. What can we do to address this problem? One of the possible solutions is plagiarism.II. Plagiarism and the Modern Revolutionary Plagiarism is an especially effective method of appropriating and reorganizing ideas, and as such it can be a useful tool for a young man or woman looking to encourage new and exciting thinking in others. And it is a method that is revolutionary in that it does not recognize "intellectual property" rights but rather strikes out against them and all of the negative effects that recognizing them can have. Plagiarism focuses attention on content and away from incidental issues, by making the genuine origins of the material impossible to ascertain. Besides, as suggested above, it could be argued that the genuine origins of the contents of most inspirations and propositions are impossible to determine anyway. By signing a new name, or no name at all, to a text, the plagiarizer puts the material in an entirely new context, and this may generate new perspectives and new thinking about the subject that have not appeared before. Plagiarism also makes it possible to combine the best or most relevant parts of a number of texts, thus creating a new text with many of the virtues of the older ones—and some new virtues, as well, since the combination of material from different sources is bound to result in unforeseeable effects and might well result in the unlocking of hidden meanings or possibilities that have been dormant in the texts for years. Finally, above all, plagiarism is the reappropriation of ideas: when an individual plagiarizes a text which those who believe in intellectual property would have held "sacred," she denies that there is a difference in rank between herself and the thinker she takes from. She takes the thinker's ideas for herself, to express them as she sees fit, rather than treating the thinker as an authority whose work she is duty-bound to preserve as he intended. She denies, in fact, that there is a fundamental difference between the thinker and the rest of humanity, by appropriating the thinker's material as the property of humanity. After all, a good idea should be available to everyone—should belong to everyone—if it really is a good idea. In a society organized with human happiness as the objective, copyright infringement laws and similar restrictions would not hinder the distribution and recombination of ideas. These impediments only make it more difficult for individuals who are looking for challenging and inspiring material to come upon it and share it with others. So, if there truly is "nothing new under the sun," take them at their word, and act accordingly. Take what seems relevant to your life and your needs from the theories and doctrines prepared by those who came before you. Don't be afraid to reproduce word for word those texts which seem perfect to you, so you can share them with others who might also benefit from them. And at the same time, don't be afraid to plunder ideas from different sources and rearrange them in ways that you find more useful and exciting, more relevant to your own needs and experiences. Seek to create a personally constructed body of critical and creative thought, with elements gathered from as many sources as possible, rather than choosing from one of the prefabricated ideologies that are offered to you. After all, do we have ideas, or do they have us?</span>

**The impact is the worst forms of violence imaginable you must meet our demands to end the demand for intellectual property**
<span style="font-size: 80%;">Michael McGrath, Minnesota Debate champion, place in semis in novice glennbrooks, known as the future, is a big shot, pretty cool guy, and partners with Kentucky Morrow, Minnesota debate Champion, known as ktux, is a pretty big deal, most qualified author about this arg, um yeah pretty much an all around bad ass, NOW, http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/harbinger/</span>

<span style="font-size: 80%;">Unless you grant our demands, from the close of the millennium at midnight, New Year’s Eve, onwards, - happiness, self-esteem, and mental clarity will be held hostage from the populace by a ruthless elite of advertising executives and other psychologists, utilizing a constant barrage of propagandaupon all five senses to maintain their power [Figure A]; -corporations will steal the most precious hours from the lives of millions of human beings, converting them into useless trinkets, pollution, tedium, and work-related injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome [Figure B];-those trapped within the frontiers of this ever-expanding hell will take their apathy and anger out on themselves and each other with firearms, addictive drugs, and abusive relationships [Figure C];-governments will lay claim to what lives remain, to destroy in more efficient ways [Figure D]; -and all those who contest this will be mocked, starved, beaten, jailed. . . branded terrorists by the real terrorists [Figure E].These travesties will continue without mercy or quarter until all our demands are met. This is not negotiable. These are no idle threats. Hell, all these things are happening right now, and have been for decades.</span>


**Without revolution we are doomed to extinction. This round is key though it allows us to live free as individuals and change the system and process to one that allows for anarchy.**

<span style="font-size: 80%;">Can we get along? Even for those of us who would prefer to be hermits, there is no question today more important than this one—the fate of our species and planet will be decided by it. There is no shortcut around this dilemma. Any kind of capital-R Revolution, any redistribution of wealth and power, will be short-lived and irrelevant without a fundamental change in our relationships—for social structure is an expression of these relationships, not a factor external to them. Revolution, then, is not a single moment, but a way of living: anarchy and hierarchy always coexist in varying proportions, and the important question is simply which you foster in your own life. We are ill-qualified to reconstruct human relations if we can’t even get along with each other in the attempt—and nothing seems to create dissension and division like those attempts. Often it seems that the people who know least how to relate to others are the self-professed activists who set out to save them. Yet these conflicts are not an inescapable consequence of human nature, but rather a pattern of cause and effect—which can and must be altered. This is a starting place to consider what the challenges are in undertaking this, and why we’ve had such a hard time to date.</span>
