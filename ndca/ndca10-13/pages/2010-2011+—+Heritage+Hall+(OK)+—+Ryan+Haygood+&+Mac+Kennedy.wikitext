**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Contention one is Enframing </span>**

The tactical nuclear weapons currently based in Turkey are tools used by the West to defend against the growing uncertainty in the Middle East in a hubristic attempt to deter and preempt irrationality itself.

The result is a violent ontology that refuses to question itself in favor of remaining a champion certainty and arbiter metaphysical truths guaranteeing systematic error replication and conservativism

Thus, we affirm that:

The United States federal government should withdraw all of its nuclear weapons from the Republic of Turkey. Our affirmation of the resolution is an act of dissent against the ideological violence of the status quo’s weapons policy. 

Our dissent is an effective engagement with the entrenched forms of discourse in the status quo.
