The status quo’s approach to space is one of domination and mastery. We attempt to force our concept of what space is and used for. The state seeks to reveal the mysteries of the universe through the application of rigid reason creating an inside/outside binary. We must resist this urge to confine space and impose this binary, embracing a politics that steps outside the traditional framing and interrogates the inside/outside binary!

This is also true of the State’s approach to spatialty – It attempts to map, territorialize and control it. This control creates hierarchy that results in subordination. However, abstract space cannot and should not be forced to fit into rigid lines. We must embrace the smooth space of the nomad.

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Nothing can have imposed lines on it. Forcing lines and limits leads us to desire</span>our own servitude. Doing so allows the state to become an ideal system of total power which emphasizes disciplinary regimentation and seeks to suppress all criticism. It is only when we defer and allow these imposed lines that fascism to be created at the molar level. Hitler and Mussolini’s actions didn’t begin with the state, but they began in the hearts and minds of the masses that come to be led. It isn’t what Hitler did that was scary; it’s that it was only able to happen because the masses asked him to.

When the nomadic war machine becomes appropriated by the State, total war becomes the object of the State. Beyond total war is a terrifying peace – the same desires of the masses to go to war in Vietnam have been replicated in Iraq, transforming the State into a militarist war machine. The impact is total war, fascism, and eventually nuclear catastrophe. There is no topical version of the aff – we cannot allow our war machine to be co-opted by the state.

Jeremy and I affirm that United States Federal Government should substantially increase nomadic exploration of space beyond the earth’s mesosphere.
My partner and I affirm a politics of nomadology. This is a continuous process with no beginning and no end; a politics of constant evolution. We would like to change the way that we relate to the State. Rather than learning about what we want to advocate and then picketing Capitol Hill chanting for change, we maintain experimentation with what the politics means, with what being an activist means. Activism should be a site for infinite combinations, a nomadic approach in which politics is an immanent process rather than a goal. We will defend the consequences of exploring space, but we must note the political climate and ideologies that have to exist for that to happen. We will never say that the plan won’t happen; rather, we will only describe the context in which its passage is pragmatic. Our plan will be passed because the micropolitical resistance that an aff ballot creates will pervert the state, rather than being perverted by the state.
<span style="text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Contention 2: U Mad? No I nomad!</span></span></span>
Our advocacy is nomadic. This politics is exterior to the state, and allows us to effectuate real change in the political. We must resist the fascism of the state’s attempt to striate space and politics by embracing a politics of nomadology. Under this politic, we have no end goal, but just continue on a journey through space, and a journey through politics.

=UFO-Affirmative= 
Contention 1: The Palisades
Despite thousands of incident reports, there is functionally no systematic investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects in the status quo. Instead, the resources of the state and the scientific community alike are marshalled to dismiss the possibility of extraterestial intelligence, insisting that we already know what UFOs are NOT. The result is a general taboo on taking the UFO seriously. It seems that the sovereign has something to hide.


Wendt and Duvall, 2008. [Alexander and Raymond, Mershon Professor of International Security at The Ohio State University and Morse-Alumni Professor and Chair of Political Science Department at University of minnesota, “Sovereignty and the UFO,” Political Theory 36.4]

On March 30-31, 1990, two Belgian F-16s …..

We are saying they cannot ask the question.
This is peculiar. Modern sovereignty thrives on its ability to identify and securitize spatio-temporal threats like that posed by the UFO. The UFO remains undecidable because it poses an additional metaphysical challenge to the anthropocentric logic that is the necessary condition of modern sovereignty.
Wendt and Duvall, 2008. [Alexander and Raymond, Mershon Professor of International Security at The Ohio State University and Morse-Alumni Professor and Chair of Political Science Department at University of minnesota, “Sovereignty and the UFO,” Political Theory 36.4]

If the limits of the governmental regime are exposed, ……………..r form undecidability takes in the UFO case disrupts its usual operation.

This means that the question of the UFO is one that the sovereign simply CANNOT ask. The undecidability of the UFO – at once object and subject – confounds antrhopocentric sovereignty by undermining the ontological certainty of the human ideal. Sovereignty deploys the resources of governmentality to maintain the UFO taboo, ensuring that the profound threat it poses is never actualized.
Wendt and Duvall, 2008. [Alexander and Raymond, Mershon Professor of International Security at The Ohio State University and Morse-Alumni Professor and Chair of Political Science Department at University of minnesota, “Sovereignty and the UFO,” Political Theory 36.4]

Something is undecidable when it “does not conform…………………….

, on the palisades, the sovereign is nowhere to be found.
This mode of anthropocentric sovereignty only functions by separating human life from the animality that contaminates it. This mode of separation simultaneously produces a thrid category of bare life, the abjection and sacrifice of which is necessary for human being to retain its privilege. The anthropological machine sustained by modern governmentality requires as its condition RITUAL and UNSTOPPABLE VIOLENCE against the subhuman.

Oliver 07 (Kelly, Stopping the Anthropological Machine: Agamben with Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, PhaenEx, Fall/Winter 2007)

Man’s humanity is dependent ……………………….than human, can we hope to stop it.
It is within this context that the search for extra-terrestial intelligence project finds itself underfunded and misguided – monitoring far off galaxies for evidence of extraterrestial intelligence while ignoring the possibility of UFOs close to home.

Cornet and Stride ’03 (Bruce and Scot, P.H.D. Paleo-botany Pennsylvania State University, Solar System SETI Using Radio Telescope Arrays, April 28, 2003, http://cic.setileague.org/cic/v1i2/s3eti-ata.pdf)

The working hypothesis and assumptions……………………….., thereby offering unequivocal evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence.




Plan Text: The United States federal government should substantially increase the search for unidentified flying objects beyond the Earth’s mesosphere.


The plan is not principally an effort at discovering extraterestrial intelligence. It is a challenge to modern sovereignty, which cannot afford to take that possibility seriously. A systematic, public, and scientific inquiry into the UFO is necessary to turn governmentality back against the sovereign. voting aff means channeling resistance toward sovereignty’s achilles heal – its utter reliance on the empty ideal of the human being.


Wendt and Duvall, 2008. [Alexander and Raymond, Mershon Professor of International Security at The Ohio State University and Morse-Alumni Professor and Chair of Political Science Department at University of minnesota,

—……………………….

that requires and sustains it.

Contention 2: Encounter.


The Unidentified nature of the UFO poses the quintessential ethical question: How do we relate to the faceless Other? The status quo is non-responsible, refusing to even acknowledge it as such. The plan represents an ethical gesture toward the unknowable – an attempt at encounter with the non-human.

Wendt and Duvall, 2008.[Alexander and Raymond, Mershon Professor of International Security at The Ohio State University and Morse-Alumni Professor and Chair of Political Science Department at University of minnesota, “Sovereignty and the UFO,” Political Theory 36.4]


Modern rule and its ………………………….structure of rule that requires and sustains it.
An open engagement with the UFO challenges territorialized accounts of space exploraton and ethics alike, offering hospitality to the non-human other excluded in the production of anthropocentric sovereignty.
Battaglia 2010 (Debbora, Sociocultural Anthropologist at Mt. Holyoke, "Arresting Hopsitlaity: The Case of the Handshake in Space, forthcoming in the Journal of Royal Anthropology, academia.edu)

Without denying the function of the ……………………or spacecraft from other countries (say, China's) space programs.


Moreover, the aff’s challenge to anthropocentric sovereignty is prerequisite to an hospitable ethics that refuses to reduce the Other to an object vis-a-vi human exceptionalism.

Battaglia 2010 (Debbora, Sociocultural Anthropologist at Mt. Holyoke, "Arresting Hopsitlaity: The Case of the Handshake in Space, forthcoming in the Journal of Royal Anthropology, academia.edu)

It is because purposeful ruptures of ……………… controlling the thing.
Conditional hospitality degenerates into the worst forms of violence. Refused hospitality, the Other easily comes to represent a threat to the collective identity of the community. The resulting exclusion of alterity takes the form of oppressive border politics and preemptive foreign policy.

Kearney ’99[ Richard; “Aliens and Others: Between Girard and Derrida”; Cultural Values, 13625179, Jul99, Vol.3, Issue 3 //les AMB]

The tendency of media hype…………………. something that is ultimately impossible: unconditional hospitality to the alien (Derrida, 1992 and 1997a; Dillon, 1999).


Contention 3: A Novel Experiment


The aff turns scientific discourses against their own presumed objectivity. The UFO taboo is produced in an attempt at policing the scientific discipline in order to protect its hegemony from subversive thought. In the UFO context, SCIENCE IS CRITICAL THEORY. Scientific study of the UFO challenges the modern cartesian subject and the power sturctures it produces by contaminating the public sphere with unassimilable knowledge.

Blaney 2009 (Doug, Senior Seminar at Appalachian State's Interdisciplinary Studies Program, So qualified it's not worth mentioning, "From the Fringe: UFOlogy as Critique," http://dougblaney.blogspot.com/2009/12/from-fringe-ufology-as-critique_10.html)

Meanwhile, the UFO phenomenon …………….

obscured in the public sphere.


This marriage of science and critique is necessary to avert the totalizing tendencies of the modern scientific discipline, which can only reduce what it studies to an object. This mode of objectification is makes possible oppressive modes of social relations that assimilate difference into violent hierarchies.
