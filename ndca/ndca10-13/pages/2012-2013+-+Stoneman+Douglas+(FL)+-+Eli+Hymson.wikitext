Due to the competitive nature of debate, I've decided to only disclose after my last round of TOC. Debaters use the wiki too often for prep-outs and scouting as opposed to finding books to investigate further or helping their junior varsity members learn about debate. I am a huge proponent of increasing younger debaters' access to the material I and other debaters read, but the incentive to free-ride and scout is too great for any of those goals to be achieved while I'm still competing. After TOCs, I'll post the full text of every card of every case I've read the past two years so that the only incentive for looking at my page will be education. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">In the meantime, contact me at eli.hymson@gmail.com with any questions or specific cite requests. I enjoy discussing the philosophy behind what I run and would love to see more people interested in reading the original works.</span>

====<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Warning- If you're here to mine for cards, you will make a fool of yourself explaining shit you don't understand/haven't read background lit on. I spent way too much of my life immersing myself in Nietzsche/Zizek/Deleuze stuff, but that's the only way to ensure that these positions will make any sense. That said, if you understand this without prior knowledge of the author/position, I don't care what you do with it. I would love to see more K debates in LD, so spread the gospel however you want.</span>====
