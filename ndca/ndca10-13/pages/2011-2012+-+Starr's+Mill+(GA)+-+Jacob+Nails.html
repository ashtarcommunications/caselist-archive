 (Wake Forest, St James)<br />
Combining the definition of “animal” with the definition of “rights” fails to capture the full meaning of the term “animal rights”. “Animal rights” is a term of art that has moved beyond the strict definition of “side constraints on animal treatment”. In common usage, it refers broadly to the pro-animal movement.<br />
David <strong><u>Pearce</u></strong> explains<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Korscards%20AC%202.0.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The Animal Welfare movement acknowledges the suffering of nonhumans and attempts to reduce that suffering through &quot;humane&quot; treatment, but it does not have as a goal elimination of the use and exploitation of animals. The Animal Rights movement goes significantly further by rejecting the exploitation of animals and according them rights in that regard. A person committed to animal welfare might be concerned that cows get enough space, proper food, etc., but would not necessarily have any qualms about killing and eating cows, so long as the rearing and slaughter are &quot;humane&quot;. The Animal Welfare movement is represented by such organizations as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Humane Society. Having said this, it should be realized that</span><strong><u>some hold a broad</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">er</span> <strong><u>interpretation of the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> AR </span><strong><u>[Animal Rights] movement.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> They would argue that the AW groups do, in fact, support rights for animals (e.g., a dog has the right not to be kicked).</span><strong><u>Under this interpretation,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> AR</span><strong><u>[Animal Rights] is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> viewed as </span><strong><u>a broad umbrella covering the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> AW</span><strong><u>[Animal Welfare] and strict</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> AR</span><strong><u>[Animal Rights] groups. This interpretation has the advantage of moving</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> AR </span><strong><u>[Animal Rights] closer to the mainstream.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Nevertheless, there is a valid distinction between the animal welfare and animal rights groups, as described in the first paragraph.</span><br />
<br />
Further, prefer the broad interpretation of animal rights because it creates clear grounds for conflict on the topic. The aff defends that animals are due respect, and the neg defends that they are not. A more strict interpretation of animal rights would allow the negative to side-step the central question of the topic entirely by simply agreeing that animals matter and arguing that they should be respected in a different way than having rights, such as advocating animal welfare.<br />
Such neg advocacies are bad because:<br />
(a) they would make the affirmative constructive moot, as well as destroying any clash between the two advocacies; and,<br />
(b) they move the debate away from the values conflict underlying animal rights and instead towards the implementation of the animal rights movement. However, any debate on implementation would be unfeasible because the resolution has no actor, action, context, or timeframe.<br />
<br />
Further, the lack of context indicates that the resolution is a question of the nature of justice rather than its application to specific policies because the resolution does not imply any policy in particular. Moreover, any interpretation that focused on implementation would be inconsistent with the term “recognition” in the resolution, which implies consideration rather than action.<br />
<br />
Finally, arguments proving that justice does not exist are not negative ground because the negation of the resolution is that “justice does not require the recognition of animal rights” which still presumes that some conception of justice exists. Proving that justice does not exist would simply make the topic’s truth value indeterminate, as statements about justice would have no meaning and the resolution would be no more false than true. In the absence of offense, presumption goes aff because of time-skew.<br />
<br />
Prefer the aff interp as long as it’s reasonable because it’s easier for the neg to adapt to a reasonable interp than for me to start over in the 1AR.<br />
<br />
The value is justice. Justice is a normative term, used to guide actions, so it makes no sense to say “We should take this action, even though it is unjust” as the definition of an unjust action is one that ought not be taken. What is just is therefore equivalent to what one ought to do.<br />
<br />
The meta-ethical basis for what one ought to do is practical reason. David Velleman explains<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Korscards%20AC%202.0.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2</a>]<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">As we have seen,</span><strong><u>requirements that depend for their force on some external source of authority turn out to be escapable because the authority behind them can be questioned. We can ask, “why should I act on this desire?” or “why should I obey the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">U.S.</span><strong><u>government?”</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or even “Why should I obey God?” And as we observed in the case of the desire to punch someone in the nose,</span><strong><u>this question demands a reason for acting.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The authority we are questioning would be vindicated, in each case, by the production of a sufficient reason. What this observation suggests is that any purported source of practical authority depends on reasons for obeying it—and hence on the authority of reasons. Suppose, then, that we attempted to question the authority of reasons themselves, as we earlier questioned other authorities. Where we previously asked “Why should I act on my desire?”</span><strong><u>let us now ask. “Why should I act for reasons?”</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">shouldn’t this question open up a route of escape from all requirements? As soon as we ask why we should act for reasons, however, we can hear something odd in our question. To ask “why should I?” is to demand a reason; and so </span><strong><u>to ask “why should I act for reasons?” is to demand a reason for acting for reasons. This demand implicitly concedes</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">the very authority that it purports to question—namely,</span><strong><u>the authority of reasons.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Why would we demand a reason if we didn’t envision acting for it? If we really didn’t feel required to act for reasons, then a reason for doing so certainly wouldn’t help. So there is something self-defeating about asking for a reason to act for reasons.</span><br />
<br />
Further, acting for reasons is a natural aspiration of rational beings.<br />
Velleman-2 explains<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Korscards%20AC%202.0.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">[3</a>]</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Kant offered an explanation for this oddity. His explanation was that </span><strong><u>acting for reasons is essential to being a person, something to which you unavoidably aspire.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In order to be a person, you must have an approach to the world that is sufficiently coherent and constant to qualify as a single, continuing point-of-view. And part of what gives you a single, continuing point-of-view is your acceptance of particular considerations as having the force to reasons whenever they are true. We might be tempted to make this point by saying that you are a unified, persisting person and hence that you do approach practical questions from a point-of-view framed by constant reasons. But this way of making the point wouldn’t explain why you feel compelled to act for reasons; it would simply locate action for reasons in a broader context, as part of what makes you a person. One of Kant’s greatest insights, however, is that a unified, persisting person is something that you are because it is something that you aspire to be. Antecedently to this aspiration, you are merely aware that you are capable of being a person. But </span><strong><u>any creature aware that it is capable of being a person</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, in Kant’s view </span><strong><u>is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> ipso facto </span><strong><u>capable of appreciating the value of being a person and is therefore</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> ineluctably </span><strong><u>drawn toward personhood.</u></strong><br />
<br />
It follows from practical reason, that rational beings have inherent value.<br />
Christine <strong><u>Korsgaard 96</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Korscards%20AC%202.0.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">[4</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">This is just a fancy new model of an argument that first appeared in a much simpler form, Kant’s argument for his Formula of Humanity. The form of relativism with which Kant began was the most elementary one we encounter - the relativity of value to human desires and interests. He started from the fact that when we make a choice we must regard its object as good. His point is the one I have been making - that being human we must endorse our impulses before we can act on them. Kant asked</span> <strong><u>what</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> it is that</span> <strong><u>makes</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> these</span> <strong><u>objects good</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, and, rejecting one form of realism, he decided that the goodness wa</span><strong><u>[i]s not in the objects themselves. Were it not for our desires</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">and inclinations,</span> <strong><u>we would not find</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> their </span><strong><u>objects good.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Kant saw that</span> <strong><u>we take things to be important because they are important to us</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">- and he concluded that</span> <strong><u>we must therefore take ourselves to be important.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In this way, the value of humanity itself is implicit in every human choice. If normative skepticism is to be avoided -</span> <strong><u>if there is any such thing as a reason for action</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> -</span> <strong><u>then humanity as the source of all reasons</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and values</span> <strong><u>must be valued for its own sake.</u></strong><br />
<br />
However, insofar as animals can also place values on things, such as their own pleasure or pain, it follows that they, too, matter for their own sakes. <strong><u>Korsgaard 09</u></strong><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Korscards%20AC%202.0.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">[5</a>]<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">There is a more general, if more controversial, way to put this point. We are ourselves animals, who evolved on this planet along with the other animals. Like every animal, we have certain desires and interests that are given to us by our nature, as well as those we have developed through culture and education. Like every animal, we pursue the satisfaction of our desires and interests and those of our loved ones as if it were an urgent matter. Unlike the other animals, we do this consciously and of our own free choice. We do not just pursue the fulfillment of our interests; we consciously value the fulfillment of our interests, and demand that others do so as well. The other animals, or so I believe, do not do that. And yet they do pursue their own interests as an urgent matter, for it is the very nature of an animal to do that. That, in a way, is what an animal essentially is, a being that actively pursues his or her own health and survival, and, in various ways, that of his or her offspring. To that extent, the other </span><strong><u>animals</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> are in the same position as ourselves: they are animate beings, with </span><strong><u>[have] an urgent concern</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, given to them by nature, </span><strong><u>to look after their own interests and the interests of those to whom they are attached. That natural concern is the origin of all value: there are things</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">in this world </span><strong><u>that are good and bad, precisely because there are creatures for whom things can be good or bad. Those who share that natural concern</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> for themselves and their families therefore </span><strong><u>share the feature of our nature for which we demand respect. They, like us, are beings for whom things can be good or bad.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The </span><strong><u>other animals therefore have a claim</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">both </span><strong><u>on our reason</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and on our feelings of solidarity. </span><strong><u>We should therefore respect them as ends-in-themselves.</u></strong><br />
<br />
Therefore the criterion is self-awareness, defined as the capacity to recognize oneself and one’s values, as this is the capacity that makes a being valuable.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the sufficient affirmative burden is to prove that animals are self-aware.<br />

I contend that many animals are demonstrably self-aware.<br />
First, the mirror test proves that many animals have conceptions of themselves. <strong><u>Palmer 03</u></strong><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Korscards%20AC%202.0.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">[6</a>]<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The first requisite in having a bonafide theory of mind, i.e., a conscious theory of mind, is self-awareness. By self-awareness we mean that an individual has a mental construct of oneself as a distinct entity, separate from everyone and everything else. In 1970, Gordon Gallup reported an experiment which he claimed to demonstrate self-awareness in chimpanzees. His experiment was a variation of the rouge test, which had been used by developmental psychologists for many years to demonstrate the point in human development when very young children first demonstrate self-awareness. In the developmental test, a mark of rouge, or some other distinctive</span><strong><u>coloring, is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">clandestinely</span><strong><u>placed on the forehead of the young child</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. The child</span><strong><u>[who] is then placed in front of a mirror</u></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Very young</span><strong><u>[one year old] children</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, around one year in age,</span><strong><u>will</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">typically look at the mirror image and react to it as if they were looking at another child. They will</span><strong><u>attempt to play with this other child they see in the mirror.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Most human children around 18 months of age show a different response. They look in the mirror, note there is a mark of coloring upon their foreheads, and then they try to wipe it away. This response is seen as being indicative of a concept of self. More conservative critics say it does not really demonstrate self-concept but only mirror recognition, which may be a different quality.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Gallop (1970) used this same procedure when a chimpanzee was anesthetized for its’ periodical medical checkup; an odorless red dye was applied to the chimps forehead while it lay unconscious. When the animal regained consciousness a mirror was placed next to its’ cage, and the chimpanzee showed all the behaviors indicative of mirror self-recognition. </span><strong><u>The</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> animal </span><strong><u>[chimpanzee] tried to wipe the dye from its’ forehead and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> it </span><strong><u>also positioned its’ body at various angles in front of the mirror</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in order to see places it could not ordinarily see on its’ own body. Since Gallop’s early</span><strong><u>experiment[s with]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, numerous other</span><strong><u>chimpanzees</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> have passed the mirror test as well as other species of great apes including the</span><strong><u>orangutan[s]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and some</span><strong><u>gorillas</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">that had been reared by humans (Gallup &amp; Suarez, 1986; Patterson, &amp; Cohn, 1994; Patterson, 1984; Povinelli, 1993). Because of the inherent adaptive differences in intelligent marine species such as the</span><strong><u>[and] bottlenose dolphin[s]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, procedures used to demonstrate self-awareness in primates are highly problematic with cetacean species (Marino, Reiss &amp; Gallup, 1994). Nevertheless, studies using mirrors and TV monitors in mirror mode</span><strong><u>make a compelling case for the existence of self-recognition in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the bottlenose dolphin (Marten &amp; Psarakos, 1994). Not all great apes immediately pass the mirror test and often they require prolonged exposure to mirrors before they understand what they are looking at. However, regardless of the length of time that the individuals are exposed to mirrors, no member of any other species, outside of the humans, great apes, and possibly bottlenose dolphins have ever passed this mirror recognition test (Gallup, 1994). Monkeys can be in the presence of a mirror for thousand of hours without ever acquiring this level of awareness (Gallup, 1977). At first they react to it as an intruding member of their own species, but eventually they habituate and ignore the mirror all together. Based on these findings, it would seem that the best place to look for theory of mind in</span><strong><u>non-human species</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> would be in our close relatives the chimpanzees.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Second, neuroscience shows all mammals to be conscious beings.<br />
<strong><u>Wise 2000</u></strong><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Korscards%20AC%202.0.docx#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">[7</a>]<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Some objective evidence does exist for the consciousness of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> nonhuman </span><strong><u>animals</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, if we are conscious. Here's some of the most intriguing evidence. Scientists think there are two forms of memory. Some experiences can be remembered consciously. These are called explicit, or declarative, memories and are what we nonscientists normally think of as &quot;memory.&quot; Our explicit (or declarative, or conscious) memories emerge in our consciousness as words or images. But we can nonconsciously &quot;remember&quot; other experiences as well. We just don't know that we remember them. But they influence our behavior just the same. These memories are implicit or nondeclarative. The part of the brain known as the cerebellum, which all mammals and many other animals have, seems to be required for implicit memory. </span> <strong><u>Conscious awareness</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, however, </span><strong><u>is thought to require coordination between the medial temporal lobes of the brain</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, which includes the hippocampus and its supporting structure, </span><strong><u>and the cortex. The brains of all mammals have both.</u></strong><br />

Third, more recent evidence shows that even non-mammals consciously feel pain.<br />
<strong><u>Allen 11</u></strong><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Korscards%20AC%202.0.docx#_ftn8" rel="nofollow">[8</a>]<br />

Fourth, monkeys empirically can empathize with the concerns of others.<br />
<strong><u>Dunayer 04</u></strong><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Korscards%20AC%202.0.docx#_ftn9" rel="nofollow">[9</a>]<br />
<br />
<strong><u>In experiments by</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> psychologist </span><strong><u>Stanley Milgram, human subjects were told to give a man an electric shock every time</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that </span><strong><u>he answered a question incorrectly. Subjects faced no penalty if they refused to comply. Nevertheless, the majority pressed switches signaling increasingly powerful shocks, even after the man</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> had </span><strong><u>started to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> plead and </span><strong><u>scream.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Unknown to the subjects, the electrical shocks were fake.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In similar experiments using rhesus monkeys, the shocks were real. Monkeys learned to pull chains for food. Then one of the chains was linked to a shock generator. Now, in addition to releasing food, this chain would inflict an electric shock on another monkey, visible in an adjoining cage. To get adequate food, a monkey to needed to pull both chains. Unlike Milgram’s subjects, the </span><strong><u>[rhesus] monkeys were forced to choose between</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">equally grave alternatives: </span><strong><u>shock[ing] another monkey, or go[ing] hungry. Most monkeys went hungry.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Apparently </span><strong><u>unwilling to</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">risk </span><strong><u>giv[e]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">ing </span><strong><u>even a single shock, two</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> stopped pulling either chain and </span><strong><u>went</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">completely</span> <strong><u>without food</u></strong>—<strong><u>one for five days, the other for twelve.</u></strong><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In the human experiments, most subjects believed that they were inflicting pain on a man guilty of nothing worse than incorrect answers. In the monkey experiments, humans robbed innocent beings of their freedom, deprived them of food, and subjected them to electric shocks. In contrast, most of the </span><strong><u>monkeys showed altruism, at considerable expense to themselves.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Who’s consciously moral?</span><br />
<br />
This shows the ability of monkeys to identify with others and recognize values not reducible to their own physical wellbeing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fifth, chimpanzees respect the concerns of others, even when it is not in their own interest. <strong><u>Johnson 10</u></strong><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Korscards%20AC%202.0.docx#_ftn10" rel="nofollow">[10</a>]<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Perhaps unsurprisingly, chimpanzees</span> <strong><u>[chimps]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> behaved the same way that</span><strong><u>[and] capuchins</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">did and</span><strong><u>objected if they only received a carrot when their group mate was given a delicious grape for the same price</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Out of 76 trials the chimpanzees were significantly more likely to refuse a carrot in these tests compared to times where both received the same low-value food reward. Likewise, when both individuals received a carrot after first being shown a grape, they were significantly more likely to refuse than in cases where no expectation of a better reward had been presented. The bottom line was that if things weren't fair a tantrum would ensue.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">If this sounds eerily familiar, you're right on the mark. Parents will testify to how careful they must be to make sure that siblings are always treated equally and fairly, and chimpanzees are known to have the cognitive abilities of three-year-old children. What these results suggest then is that chimpanzees have an expectation of fairness and will protest in cases where this expectation is not met. This existed both in cases where rewards were handed out unequally and when a prior agreement was not honored.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">However, chimpanzees </span><strong><u>[chimps]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in this study</span><strong><u>went beyond the basic tenets of the social contract</u></strong> <strong><u>and demonstrated</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> what could be considered </span><strong><u>the foundation of social solidarity.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In 95 trials</span><strong><u>chimpanzees that received a grape were significantly more likely to refuse the high-value reward when their group mate only received a carrot. Even those who benefited from inequality</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> recognized that the situation was unfair and they</span><strong><u>refused to enjoy their own reward if it meant someone else had to suffer.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, prefer aff studies because experiments are biased against animals. <strong><u>Andrews 2011</u></strong><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Korscards%20AC%202.0.docx#_ftn11" rel="nofollow">[11</a>]<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">However, Sober also argues thatthe empirical methodology of psychology places a greater burden of proof on animal cognition research than it does on human cognition research. He suggests that comparative</span><strong><u>psychologists accept as the null hypothesis that different</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> cognitive</span><strong><u>mechanisms are at work in humans and animals. Given that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> type 1 errors (</span><strong><u>reporting a false positive</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and rejecting a (possibly true) null hypothesis) are</span><strong><u>[is] taken to be more serious</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> errors</span><strong><u>than</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> are type 2 errors (</span><strong><u>reporting a false negative</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and not rejecting a null hypothesis when it should be rejected),</span><strong><u>the practice</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of science</span><strong><u>results in a bias against attributing psychological traits to animals</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (Sober 2005). The debate about how to interpret the results of animal studies in comparison to human studies can be viewed as a debate about an inconsistent application of what the psychologist C. Lloyd Morgan advanced as his Cannon. Morgan's Canon states: “In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale” (Morgan 1894, 53). Though this is a longstanding rule of thumb in animal cognition research, sometimes referred to as the “principle of conservatism,” it is not a principle commonly used in human cognition research. To complicate matters, attempts to determine which psychical faculties are higher or lower, a task that Morgan's Canon instructs a researcher to perform, have raised worries about its meaningfulness (Allen-Hermanson 2005; Sober 2005).</span><br />

<strong>First</strong>, the affirmative burden is not to justify rights for all species of the kingdom Animalia, only highly developed macro-organisms. <u>Waldau 11</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Reductionism%20AC3.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Nonetheless, given that science reveals that so much of “life” is micro, or inaccessible to humans, claims about humans protecting “all animals” or “all life” need to be understood in context. Otherwise, they will seem a serious overstatement, because the goal of protecting “all animals” is, it turns out, no simple matter.</span> <u>For all practical purposes, the focus of animal protectionists from ancient time until today has been macro forms of life that we can easily identify. These include most mammals, some birds, and certain reptiles like turtles, but often not fish and certainly not</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> many of </span><u>the micro forms</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that are </span><u>impossible to notice without the aid of a microscope</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or other technology. The invisible forms of life that science has been so diligent in indentifying may constantly surround us, but we simple are not the kind of beings who can factor protecting them into our daily lives. Importantly, there are indications in our daily language that we take this into account, for while talk about killing animals is so morally charged that it regularly elicits challenges, talk about “killing germs” or using antibiotics (literally, “against life”) does not.</span><br />
<br />
Prefer this interpretation because it best adheres to historical usage and topic literature, which are the source of ground on the topic and thus key to fair and educational debate.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second</strong>, rights are general side constraints on treatment, but they need not be absolute.<br />
<u>Kamm 07</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Reductionism%20AC3.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">However,</span><u>the concept of a right need not imply that respecting a right will always take precedence over the greater good</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (either at the act or the rule level).</span><u>Rights need not be absolute, but rather</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, may</span><u>have thresholds beyond which the calculation of goods and evils is reintroduced.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">37 I may have a right that you give me something, but if a great good is possible only by transgressing my right, this may be permitted. In such a case, the right will have been infringed rather than violated. The more good we must sacrifice rather than transgress the right, the more stringent is the right by at least one measure. It has been claimed that some fundamental human rights are stringent enough to stand in the way of even great goods, whose achievement they prevent. This may be because the rights represent the worth of the person, which is the presupposition of the importance of promoting interests. But rights can also conflict with the personal interests of agents who have to act in accord with them.</span><br />
<br />
Prefer this interpretation because it is most consistent with common usage. We talk of a right to free speech even though it can sometimes be restricted, and a right to property, even though property can be seized in certain instances.<br />
<br />
Third, the aff burden is not to defend that rights are good in-and-of themselves because no moral theory defends this. Deontology says rights good as a means of respecting persons, and contractarianism says rights are good as a means of increasing self-interest. Therefore, my burden is only to defend that rights are instrumentally good to some higher goal of justice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Fourth</strong>, the resolution is a general principle, so discussion of particular animal rights policies has no bearing on it. Specification is unfeasible because there are no practical limits on the topic, and holding the aff to the standard of categorical proof skews burdens vastly in favor of the negative. Only a general principle ensures reciprocity.<br />
<br />
[Util justifications omitted]<br />
Therefore the <strong>standard</strong> is <strong>maximizing utility</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
I contend that recognizing animal rights maximizes utility.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sub-point A</strong>. Animals matter.<br />
<br />
Neuroscience shows all mammals to be conscious beings.<br />

<strong><u>Some objective evidence does exist for the consciousness of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> nonhuman </span><strong><u>animals</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, if we are conscious. Here's some of the most intriguing evidence. Scientists think there are two forms of memory. Some experiences can be remembered consciously. These are called explicit, or declarative, memories and are what we nonscientists normally think of as &quot;memory.&quot; Our explicit (or declarative, or conscious) memories emerge in our consciousness as words or images. But we can nonconsciously &quot;remember&quot; other experiences as well. We just don't know that we remember them. But they influence our behavior just the same. These memories are implicit or nondeclarative. The part of the brain known as the cerebellum, which all mammals and many other animals have, seems to be required for implicit memory. </span> <strong><u>Conscious awareness</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, however, </span><strong><u>is thought to require coordination between the medial temporal lobes of the brain</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, which includes the hippocampus and its supporting structure, </span><strong><u>and the cortex.

<u>Rhesus monkeys will not feed when they know another will get an electric shock as a consequence.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Frans de Waal (Primates and Philosophers: How Morality Evolved, 2006) explains that a rhesus monkey was subjected to an experiment in which it pulled a chain to get food. Monkeys learn such tricks immediately. But then the experiment was arranged so that, besides delivering food, another monkey in the next cage got an electric shock when the chain was pulled. The monkey pulling the chain soon realized it was causing the other monkey distress, and it stopped doing it, and would not do it again for five days, until it was really hungry. Another starved itself for twelve days before it was forced to by hunger to pull the chain again. The monkeys would rather starve than cause pain to another monkey nearby, and it was not only when the other monkey was kin. When the monkeys were related, the longer they would starve themselves rather than cause distress, showing that genes and evolution were invoved even though the concern the monkeys had for each other was not limited to close kin. In monkeys and apes, as well as humans, the compassionate trait has extended to unrelated creatures in close enough proximity to notice distress in others of their kind.</span><br />
<u>Rats will not</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> depress a lever to </span><u>get food once they realize that by so doing they cause a[nother] rat</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in an adjacent cage </span><u>pain through an electric shock.

In another experiment with rats, one was suspended uncomfortably in the air, but another rat perfectly free to do as it wished could press a lever to release the suspended rat. The free rats did just that!</span><br />
<u>Even mice have been shown to</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> be capable of </span><u>feel</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">ing </span><u>empathy. They are</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> observably</span><u>distressed when nearby mice are tortured. Empathy in small mammals like mice shows it is probably common to all mammals</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, and certainly to more sophisticated species. Once it is accepted that many mammals can sense the pain of another of the same kind, the basis of morality must exist.</span><br />
<br />
Sub-point B. Rights are key.<br />
<br />
Trying to calculate utility in every instance fails. Only adopting a general rights-based framework can actually maximize utility. <u>Chappell 05</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Reductionism%20AC3.docx#_ftn11" rel="nofollow">[11</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Utilitarianism is a much maligned moral theory, in part because it's so easily abused. It's easy for people to misunderstand the theory, and use it, for example, to argue for totalitarianism. But of course utilitarianism properly understood recommends no such thing. In fact, it tends to support our common-sense moral intuitions. Strange as it may seem, utilitarianism recommends that we do not base our everyday moral decision-making on calculations of utility. Why is this? Well, </span><u>util</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">itarianism</span> <u>says that we ought to</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> do whatever would </span><u>maximize utility. But attempting to reason in a utilitarian fashion</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> tends to have disastrous consequences, and </span><u>fails miserably to maximize utility. Therefore, we ought not to reason in a utilitarian manner.

<br />
<strong>Further</strong>, welfare alone is insufficient because as long as animals are considered property, their rights will be meaningless. <u>Francione 04</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Aff/Reductionism%20AC3.docx#_ftn12" rel="nofollow">[12</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<u>The property status of animals renders meaningless any balancing</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that is supposedly</span><u>required under</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the humane treatment principle or </span><u>animal welfare laws, because what we really balance are the interests of property owners against the interest of their animal property</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. It is, of course, absurd to suggest that we can balance human interests, which are protected by claims of right in general and of a right to own property in particular, against the interests of property, </span><u>which exists only as a means to the ends of humans.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Although we claim to recognize that we may prefer animal interests over human interests only when there is a conflict of interests, </span><u>there is always a conflict between</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the interests of </span><u>property owners who want to use their property and the interests of their</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> animal </span><u>property.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The human property interest will almost always prevail. The animal in question is always a “pet” or a “laboratory animal,” or a “game animal,” or a “food animal,” or a “rodeo animal,” or some other form of property that exists solely for our use and has no value except that which we give it. </span><u>There is</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> really </span><u>no choice</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to be made </span><u>between the human and the animal</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> interest </span><u>because the choice has already been predetermined by the property status of the animal;</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the “suffering” of property owners who cannot use their property as they wish counts more than animal suffering. We are allowed to impose any suffering required to use our animal property for a particular purpose even if that purpose is our mere amusement or pleasure. As long as we use our animal property to generate an economic benefit there is no effective limit on our use or treatment of animals.</span><br />
<br />
Finally, harm to animals outweighs harm to humans on scope because there are quantitatively more of them and on scale because humans can adapt to life without animals.<br />
<br />
Presumption goes aff because most governments have codified restrictions on animal treatment in the status quo and because the aff is disadvantaged by timeskew.<br />
<br />
Prefer the aff interp as long as it’s reasonable to check back the rampant abuse of theory. Competing interps encourages the neg to go for theory every round as a timeskew because they can always find a debatably marginally better interpretation. Topic lit is a sufficient brightline for reasonability because it guarantees predictable ground will exist for both sides. Therefore, insofar as my interpretation is the most stock definition of animal rights, it is reasonable.<br />
<br />
Further, theory and T should not be no-risk voting issues because it encourages theory as a timeskew rather than as a check on abusive arguments. Therefore, the impact of theory must either be to drop the argument, or theory should be an RVI.<br />

<br />
The value is justice, defined as giving each their due. The prior question to what we are due is the question of who we are. A flawed conception of our own ontology would misinform us to the true purposes and needs of humans and animals, making justice impossible. It is therefore crucial to establish what it means to be human.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Human beings are species-beings. We do not exist in isolation but in relation to other humans and to nature. Laura <strong><u>Hudson</u></strong> writes<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Though in Agamben’s analysis bare life often seems only negative, an absence or a void, the positive potential in the concept might be more clearly conveyed by placing it in conversation with Marx. In many ways, bare life seems to be the negative iteration of Marx’s early definition of species-being and may provide a clearer understanding of what species-being might become. In the <em>Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts</em>, Marx distinguishes between human being and mere animal being on the basis of free production: “The animal is immediately identical with its life-activity. It does not distinguish itself from it. It is its <em>life-activity</em>. Man makes his life-activity itself the object of his will and of his consciousness. He has conscious life-activity. It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life-activity directly distinguishes man from animal life-activity.” Like Ferry, Marx suggests that self-consciousness allows human beings to separate themselves from the immediacy of instinct. Yet, </span><strong><u>in contrast to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Ferry’s anti-natural, rootless, and steadfastly</span><strong><u>individualis[m]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tic man,</span><strong><u>Marx suggests that human beings are</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">likewise</span><strong><u>“species-beings,” characterized by social organization as well as free, conscious production</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> rooted in interaction with nature and with each other. It is because humans can produce freely and consciously, beyond what is immediately necessary for their natural life (the drives of self-preservation and reproduction), that they are different from other animals. This conscious activity takes place within the realm of the natural world, for humans act on and transform nature. Species-being is not merely another name for human nature, nor does it simply indicate the biological characteristics that make any animal a member of a species.</span><strong><u>Humans are species-beings because</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> they not only produce what is necessary for their own existence but also because </span><strong><u>they understand themselves <em>as</em> members of a species, enabling them to produce socially, in concert with one another.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> They produce not only goods but concepts: species do not “exist” in nature but in the human imagination. That the human being is a species-being is important, because it is clear that the cost of species-being is alienation from nature; the ability to look on nature as the raw material for human creative expression allows for a level of freedom, but it also isolates humanity from the longed-for harmonious unity with the Nature of deep ecology. Alienation from nature is a rupture that cannot be wholeheartedly celebrated; but the result, at least potentially, is the full development of human capacities for creative production beyond the satisfaction of individual needs. As in Agamben, Marx suggests that the harmony of the human animal with nature is lost, but in its place is the potential for the universality and fellow feeling of species-being. </span><strong><u>Species-being thus both describes what the human <em>is</em> by definition</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> as a member of the species <em>Homo sapiens</em></span><strong><u>and describes the human potential to be something <em>more</em>: a true humanity based in the whole of human society rather than merely</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> its</span><strong><u>particular</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">s as nations or</span><strong><u>individuals, and including both the natural and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">the</span><strong><u>conceptual life of human beings.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is where Kant got it wrong. The Enlightenment-era philosophy that undergirds Western society ignores our social context, abstracting us from nature and from one another. Hudson-2 continues<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, Horkheimer and Adorno suggest that Enlightenment has always been totalitarian in its drive to disenchant the natural world: “Humans believe themselves free of fear when there is no longer anything unknown. This has determined the path of demythologization, of enlightenment, which equates the living with the nonliving as myth had equated the nonliving with the living.”</span> <strong><u>Enlightenment assimilates the living world to nonliving concept, seeing everywhere the same “chaotic stuff of mere classification.”</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Even the living existence of the individual is obliterated in its relegation to the realm of the concept. </span><strong><u>This process transforms subjects from ends in themselves to the means to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> an end: the </span><strong><u>control</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and disenchantment of </span><strong><u>the natural world.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Instrumental reason incorporates humanity into its calculations as surely as it does nature. The antithesis of nature and history (as enlightenment) is most clearly revealed in the antithesis between animal and human being. No longer seen as gods, </span><strong><u>animals become part of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> nonliving nature, part of </span><strong><u>“the mass of things</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and creatures </span><strong><u>in the external world” from which the logos of the human has split off.</u></strong> <strong><u>The human being becomes separated from nature, and from sympathy with the dominated earth. In the process, reason becomes self-preservation run wild; to save ourselves from domination by nature, we must dominate it in turn.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> From the perspective of enlightenment, to do otherwise is to be marked as anti-human and anti-progress — vide Ferry’s stigmatizing of deep ecologists and animal rights advocates. Domination by nature or domination by human nature: the choice is no choice as both depend on mere self-preservation. If we are no longer captivated by nature, we are captivated by our own domination of nature.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The result of this separation from nature has been the fast-paced expansion of capitalism into every aspect of life. When we view nature as beneath us, it becomes permissible to control and commodify it in terms of capital. Hudson-3<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">This potential is shaped by social forms.</span><strong><u>Under capitalism, human beings are alienated</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> not only from nature but </span><strong><u>from the potential to reconcile with nature that is the foundation of species-being. Commodities confront us as alien forces rather than as expressions of human creative potential.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In producing commodities, the worker also produces the social relations of commodification, under which labor itself is a commodity. The free, creative production that would allow us to become true species-beings becomes the force under which we must labor in order to live — that which frees us from the unconscious life-activity of the animal world becomes that which enslaves us. Alienated labor under capitalism requires human beings to produce in order to maintain and reproduce themselves, like animals.</span> <strong><u>The alienation from nature that provides the basis for human freedom is shaped into a second nature that creates a new realm of necessity and self-preservation. Human beings are pitted against one another</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">in the struggle for survival,</span><strong><u>producing competition and antagonism rather than universal freedom.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This domination of nature is harmful not only to the animals we use as mere means to our ends, but to human beings themselves. The capitalist conception of the human as being completely free from nature justifies oppression of the lower class by ignoring the material conditions that constrain them. Hudson-4<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>If human beings are, by definition, anti-natural, then love of nature becomes opposed to human freedom. Nature is the realm of <em>determinations</em>, while human beings exist in the realm of <em>situations</em>. This distinction causes</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Ferry </span><strong><u>[the capitalist] some trouble: he is forced to explain why we should care about humans who seem determined by their situation, such as the old, the infirm, [and] the mentally retarded</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, and, most problematic, the very pre-colonial, pre-industrial peoples after which deep ecology models itself. The natural codes or instincts that Ferry claims are determinations for animals are the very things from which humanity has triumphantly distanced itself, making room for history and politics. Describing humanness as fluid, essence-less, particularly situated but never universally determined, knowing no boundaries: he might be quoting the passages of Marx’s <em>Capital</em> that describe exchange value. Free market capitalism is the backdrop for the kind of freedom he imagines, masked by his attempt to ground philosophically humanity’s moral status in some special capacity other than species membership. Human ability to <em>break free</em> from nature pits humanity <em>against</em> nature in a battle for mastery; in order to prove our uniqueness, we must resist natural codes, resist being merely use-values for Nature’s overarching Subject. Ironically, Ferry suggests that proof of our separation from natural codes lies in our ability to commit suicide: we are so free we can die of our freedom. What might this mean for human society as it enters a period of ecological crisis? Would continuing along a path that seems sure to lead to our destruction as a species be the grandest proof of Ferry’s hypothesis, or its ultimate negation? The triumph of capital seems to tend toward achieving universality in death: in death we are all equal. And this is the problem: Ferry’s </span><strong><u>“freedom” is so ill defined that it is difficult to tell exactly what it entails aside from its reactionary resistance to natural codes</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> — how we are to separate natural codes from anti-natural impulses is never explained. </span><strong><u>So-called human freedom is disconnected from the lived experiences of real human beings for whom exploitation and oppression continue unchecked. Only a select few have the material means to enjoy the full benefits of the system and thus experience full humanity.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Basing his understanding of freedom in Kantian philosophy, Ferry’s analysis runs into </span><strong><u>the same problem</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that </span><strong><u>plagues Kant.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Freedom becomes an abstraction divorced from the unfreedom experienced by human beings through their reification as commodities. </span><strong><u>He fails to address the actual conditions in which “freedom” is experienced, avoiding sustained discussion of the material, social, and economic conditions that might limit human freedom in ways analogous to natural codes</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, as a second nature. If deep ecologists err in attempting to make an idealized Nature the arbiter of morality, Ferry commits a similar error in supposing that the market offers a better model. Deep ecology is problematic for Ferry not just because it challenges human autonomy but because it challenges the market by suggesting that some things are not for sale: the anti-modern impulses of deep ecology are also anti-capitalist. His alternative to the restrictions of radical ecology is reform based not in a revision of values but in the ability of the market to adapt.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This form of oppression has been codified into our laws, which grant rights to freedom in the abstract, while failing to address the material conditions that constrain our freedom. Hudson-5<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Marx suggests that capitalism does not merely strip human beings of the capabilities that make them unique in the animal world but denies them even the basic dignity of other animals. At the same time that humans produce commodities and the social conditions of the exchange economy, they produce concepts that bolster these conditions.</span><strong><u>Human rights granted by contract with the nation become abstract concepts that have little bearing on the material lives of unfree citizens. The civil liberties promised by the nation are a fiction; stripping them away is a mere formality when the worker is already little more than bare life.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">This state of affairs is an inversion of his previous position; it is now ironically the animal in nature that is <em>more</em> free than the human in “free” society. </span><strong><u>The formal freedom granted to human beings under liberal democracy leaves them destitute, lacking any recourse to lord or law, and entraps them in a second nature just as driven by the needs of self-preservation as the natural world of animals.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Therefore the criterion is resisting capitalism<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I contend that recognizing animals rights is necessary to challenge the capitalist dualism between human and nature. Hudson-6<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Marx argues that we must come to recognize the sensual reality of nature and the supersession of the abstract thought-entity. </span><strong><u>As elements of nature ourselves, we must move beyond the abstract forms through which we recognize ourselves and come to terms with the fact that we are natural, sensual beings</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, animals who may be captivated, who may also be processed, objectified, reified things as well as transcendent beings. In bare life, perhaps, we find the first moment of this supersession: Under modern capitalist sovereignty, we are all equally abandoned by the law we have created to free us from nature. We are all equally reduced to mere specimens of human biology, mute and uncomprehending of the world in which we are thrown. Species-being, or “humanity as a species,” may require this recognition to move beyond the pseudo-essence of the religion of humanism. </span><strong><u>Recognizing that what we call “the human” is an abstraction that fails to fully describe what we are, we may come to find a new way of understanding humanity</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that recuperates the natural without domination.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The bare life that results from expulsion from the law removes even the illusion of freedom. Regardless of one’s location in production, the threat of losing even the fiction of citizenship and freedom affects everyone. This may create new means of organizing resistance across the particular divisions of society. Furthermore, the concept of bare life allows us to gesture toward a more detailed, concrete idea of what species-being may look like. Agamben hints that in the recognition of this fact, that in our essence we are all animals, that we are all living dead, might reside the possibility of a kind of redemption. Rather than the mystical horizon of a future community, the passage to species-being may be experienced as a deprivation, a loss of identity. Species-being is not merely a positive result of the development of history; it is equally the absence of many of the features of “humanity” through which we have learned to make sense of our world. It is an absence of the kind of individuality and atomism that structure our world under capitalism and underlie liberal democracy, and which continue to inform the tenets of deep ecology. </span><strong><u>The development of species-being requires the collapse of the distinction between human and animal in order to change the shape of our relationships with the natural world.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> A true species-being depends on a sort of reconciliation between our “human” and “animal” selves, a breakdown of the distinction between the two both within ourselves and in nature in general. Bare life would then represent not only expulsion from the law but the possibility of its overcoming. Positioned in the zone of indistinction, no longer a subject of the law but still subjected to it through absence, what we equivocally call “the human” in general becomes virtually indistinguishable from the animal or nature. But </span><strong><u>through this</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> expulsion and </span><strong><u>absence, we may see not only the law but the system of capitalism that shapes it from a position no longer blinded</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or captivated </span><strong><u>by its spell. The structure of the law is revealed as always suspect in the false division between natural and political life, which are never truly separable.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Though clearly the situation is not yet as dire as Agamben’s invocation of the Holocaust suggests, we are all, as citizens, under the threat of the state of exception. With the decline of the nation as a form of social organization, the whittling away of civil liberties and, with them, the state’s promise of “the good life” (or “the good death”) even in the most developed nations, with the weakening of labor as the bearer of resistance to exploitation, how are we to envision the future of politics and society?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">[…]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Natural life can no longer exist outside politics. But this realization must be tempered by the recognition that what we may be losing was never of much value compared to what we might gain. A split and reified consciousness that sees the human only in contradistinction to the animal and a system of law that is always preparing us to be banned and excluded are not to be mourned. Overcoming this split opens the possibility that we might unify humanity through common compassion rather than reveal human unity as specimens, the kind of unity that leads to Auschwitz: the pure identity of death, and the unity of interchangeability that makes any life commensurable with another rather than particular and unique. Questions of labor cannot be separated from questions of environmental justice, nor can animal welfare or rights be separated from worker health and safety. The rise of environmentalism and the need for politics to address environmental questions merely in order to sustain human existence proves that there is no easy way back to a pure politics. But such pure politics also never existed — it was always haunted by that which was excluded. Neither is there a return to nature because the state of human being is always already alienation from nature. Capitalism, in alienating us from our fellows, takes from us not only our identities as human beings but also our potential to realize a global humanity that would include animals, rocks, and trees not in a primordial animism but as necessary parts of an anthropomorphic, humanized, and reenchanted nature. Problematic as the rhetoric employed by ecology and animal rights may be,</span> <strong><u>the questions posed [by animal rights] are thus</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> <em>not</em> peripheral but </span><strong><u>central to coming to a new understanding of the relationship between humanity and nature, and thus coming to understand humanity itself.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In seeking to save what appears outside human society, both ecology and animal rights enter into that zone of indistinction that may, once fully revealed, provide a means to fundamentally alter socioeconomic relations. Rather than seeing ecological and animal rights movements as misanthropic distractions from the real need for human liberation, we might begin to see them as fruitful places to begin to shape a resistance to a capitalist order that denies us our ability to be what we have never yet been: human.</span><br />

Finally, struggles against capitalism must take place on an ideological as opposed to a political level. Actions taken within a capitalist political system only serve to reproduce the system itself.<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Indeed, since the “normal” functioning of capitalism involves some kind of disavowal of the basic principle of its functioning (</span><strong><u>today’s model capitalist is someone who, after ruthlessly generating profit, then</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> generously </span><strong><u>shares parts of it,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> giving large donations to churches, victims of ethnic or sexual abuse, etc., </span><strong><u>posing as a humanitarian</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">)</span><strong><u>, the ultimate</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> act of </span><strong><u>transgression is to assert this principle directly, depriving it of its humanitarian mask</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. I am therefore tempted to reverse Marx’s Thesis 11: </span><strong><u>the first task today is precisely not</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to succumb to the temptation </span><strong><u>to act</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, to intervene directly and change things (</span><strong><u>which</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> then inevitably </span><strong><u>ends in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a cul-de-sac of </span><strong><u>debilitating impossibility</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">: “What can we do against global capital?”), </span><strong><u>but to question the hegemonic ideological co-ordinates.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In short, our historical moment is still that of Adorno: To the question “What should we do?” I can most often truly answer only with “I don’t know.” I can only try to analyse rigorously what there is. Here people reproach me: When you practise criticism, you are also obliged to say how one should make it better. To my mind, this is incontrovertibly a bourgeois preiudice. Many times in history it so happened that the very works which pursued purely theoretical goals transformed consciousness, and thereby also social reality. If, today, we follow a direct call to act, this act will not be performed in an empty space — it will be an act within the hegemonic ideological coordinates: </span><strong><u>those who</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> “</span><strong><u>really want to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> do something to help people” </span><strong><u>get involved in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (undoubtedly honourable) exploits like Mediecins sans frontieres, </span><strong><u>Greenpeace</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, feminist </span><strong><u>and anti-racist campaigns,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> which</span><strong><u>are</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> all </span><strong><u>not only tolerated but even supported by the media</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, even if they seemingly encroach on economic territory (for example, denouncing and boycotting companies which do not respect ecological conditions, or use child labour) — they are tolerated and supported </span><strong><u>as long as they do not get too close to a certain limit.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">6 </span><strong><u>This</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> kind of activity </span><strong><u>provides the perfect example of interpassivity:</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">7 </span><strong><u>of doing things not</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in order </span><strong><u>to achieve something, but to prevent something from really happening</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, really changing.</span><br />

Instead, capitalism should be challenged as an ideology. Capitalism will only have power as long as it is accepted as the objective state of things. Rejecting capitalist ideology is the key first step to dismantling it.<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Perhaps the absence of a detailed political roadmap in Zizek's recent writings isn't a major shortcoming. Maybe, at least for the time being, </span><strong><u>the most important task is simply the negativity of the critical struggle</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, the effort </span><strong><u>to cure</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> an intellectual constipation resulting from </span><strong><u>capitalist ideology and thereby</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">to truly </span><strong><u>open up the space for imagining</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">authentic </span><strong><u>alternatives</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">to the prevailing state of the situation. Another definition of materialism offered by Zizek is that it amounts to accepting the internal inherence of what fantasmatically appears as an external deadlock or hindrance (Zizek, 2001d, pp 22-23) (with fantasy itself being defined as the false externalization of something within the subject, namely, the illusory projection of an inner obstacle, Zizek, 2000a, p 16). From this perspective, seeing through ideological fantasies by</span><u><strong>learning</strong></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">how </span><strong><u>to think again outside the confines of current restrictions has</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, in and of itself, </span><strong><u>the potential to operate as a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">form of real </span><strong><u>revolutionary practice</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (rather than remaining merely an instance of negative/critical intellectual reflection). Why is this the case? Recalling the analysis of commodity fetishism, the social efficacy of money as the universal medium of exchange (and the entire political economy grounded upon it) ultimately relies upon nothing more than a kind of &quot;magic,&quot; that is, the belief in money's social efficacy by those using it in the processes of exchange.</span><u><strong>Since the value of currency is</strong></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, at bottom,</span><strong><u>reducible to the belief that it has the value attributed to it</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">(and that everyone believes that everyone else believes this as well)<u>,</u> </span><strong><u>derailing capitalism</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">by destroying its essential financial substance </span><strong><u>is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, in a certain respect,</span><strong><u>as easy as dissolving the mere belief in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> this substance's </span><strong><u>[money’s] power</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">s. </span><strong><u>The &quot;external&quot; obstacle of the capitalist system exists</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">exclusively on the condition that</span><strong><u>[because] subjects</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, whether consciously or unconsciously, </span><strong><u>&quot;internally&quot; believe in it</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">--capitalism's life-blood, money, is simply a fetishistic crystallization of a belief in others' belief in the socio-performative force emanating from this same material. And yet, this point of capitalism's frail vulnerability is simultaneously the source of its enormous strength: its vampiric symbiosis with individual human desire, and the fact that the late-capitalist cynic's fetishism enables the disavowal of his/her de facto belief in capitalism, makes it highly unlikely that people can simply be persuaded to stop believing and start thinking (especially since, as Zizek claims, many of these people are convinced that they already have ceased believing). Or, the more disquieting possibility to entertain is that some people today, even if one succeeds in exposing them to the underlying logic of their position, might respond in a manner resembling that of the Judas-like character Cypher in the film The Matrix (Cypher opts to embrace enslavement by illusion rather than cope with the discomfort of dwelling in the &quot;desert of the real&quot;): faced with the choice between living the capitalist lie or wrestling with certain unpleasant truths, many individuals might very well deliberately decide to accept what they know full well to be a false pseudo-reality, a deceptively comforting fiction (&quot;Capitalist commodity fetishism or the truth? I choose fetishism&quot;). </span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Some 2,000 chimpanzees are maintained in U.S. laboratories,1 and approximately 100 chimps are born each year to captive mothers.2 There are numerous problems with using chimpanzees as experimental subjects. One concern is their depleted status in the wild. </span><strong><u>[Chimps] are considered a threatened species</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. </span><strong><u>Though import</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">ation </span><strong><u>of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> free-living </span><strong><u>[chimps] from Africa is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> currently </span><strong><u>restricted, some fear that the restrictions will be lifted because of increasing demands by pharmaceutical industries, among others.

<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Unfortunately, the examples of sustainable use are few and far between when distant commercial markets depend on populations of wild fauna and flora. If the level of hunting is causing a decline in the population, there will be ecological ramifications. </span><strong><u>Primates are often keystone species in their habitat, and their disappearance can lead to significant changes in the remaining ecosystem. Plants which depend on them for seed dispersal</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, for example, </span><strong><u>will decline, as will any animal species which feed</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or otherwise depend </span><strong><u>on those species of plant.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Thus there are good ecological arguments for limiting hunting for bush-meat - and if the habitat is a sustainable source of other revenues, good economic ones too. Whether for ethical or ecological reasons, however, there is now a consensus among conservation and animal welfare NGOs that the bush-meat trade is out of control. Extinctions will follow if nothing is done to control it. Perhaps today we can agree on how we as primatologists can best respond.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">This creates a dilemma because any moral system not grounded in moral truths would seem to be arbitrary and give persons no reason to adhere to it.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Morals by agreement begin from an initial presumption against morality, as a constraint on each person's pursuit of his own interest. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">A person</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> is conceived as an independent centre of activity, endeavoring to direct his capacities and resources to the fulfillment of his interests.

How does a person come to recognize a moral dimension to choice, if morality is not initially present? Morals by agreement offer a contractarian rationale for distinguishing what one may and may not do. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Moral principles are introduced as the objects of </span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">fully </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">voluntary</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> ex ante </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">agreement among rational persons.</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Such agreement is hypothetical, in supposing a pre-moral context for the adoption of moral rules and practices. But the parties to agreement are real, determinate individuals, distinguished by their capacities, situations, and concerns. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">In so far as they would agree to constraints on their choices</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">, restraining their pursuit of their own interests, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">they acknowledge a distinction between what they may and may not do.</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">As rational persons understanding the structure of their interaction, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">they recognize a place for mutual constraint, and so for a moral dimension in their affairs.</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> That there is a contractarian rationale for morality must of course be shown. That is the task of our theory. Here our immediate concern is to relate the idea of such a rationale to the introduction of fundamental moral distinctions. This is not a magical process. Morality does not emerge as the rabbit from the empty hat. Rather, as we shall argue, it emerges quite simply from the application of the maximizing conception of rationality to certain structures of interaction: Agreed mutual constraint is the rational response to these structures. Reason overrides the presumption against morality. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Therefore, the criterion is adhering to mutually self-interested agreements.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">I contend that contractarianism would not give weight to animal rights.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">First, animals lack the capacity to engage in contractarian agreements. </span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">But consider rational beings. Figuring out what it would be rational for them to do is useful, because being rational, there is a pretty significant probability that they will do what it is rational for them to do. Hence it will be well to deal with them as rational beings; and this, as we have painfully learned and are still learning, drives us rather strongly in the direction of what we presently call &quot;morality&quot;, that is, a set of restrictions on our behavior which are not just reactions to immediate threat or prospect of short-term obvious gain, but rather, broad-gauged, long-term commitments to certain patterns of behavior provided that the others generally speaking conform as well. These commitments are, then, the product of self-interest and are very like (and in many cases explicitly are) agreements. Now here is where rights are something substantial to found &quot;oughts&quot;, and are not mere restatements of &quot;ought&quot; propositions from, as it were, the other end. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">To talk of &quot;rights&quot;</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> here</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">is to talk of</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> the basis of </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">claims which we have self-interested reason to make</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> and do make, in varying ways; </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">and the reason</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> for </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">others</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> to </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">concede these rights to us is that they have an interest in our respecting</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> them </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">[their rights]</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> in their case, an interest </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">which rationally induces them to close the deal,</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> as it were, and commit themselves to paying the price of respecting them in our case. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">No such basis of morality is</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">, however, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">available for beings which cannot make this kind of</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> claims and </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">commitment</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">s, that is, for beings which, whatever interest they may have in coming in for these benefits, simply do not have the sort of rational equipment which would enable them to pose the right kind of threat if we don't, or to make the advantages of our extending these rights conditional upon their accepting similar limitations. </span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">[…]</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Now,</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">this perspective puts animals out of the reach of morality without</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> at all </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">denying that they are capable of suffering</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">, etc. Instead, it provides the basis for a frank, and of course heartless, rejection of the relevance of their sufferings. In this resFGpect, it is simply non-Kantian and non-(classical) utilitarian. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">There is plenty of room</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> within it </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">to argue</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">, say, that we would be better people if we did respect animals, or </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">that animals are really quite lovable and</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> we </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">would do better</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> to treat them </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">as pets</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> than as potential meals, and so on.</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">But none of this will get us to animal rights, as part of the fundamental apparatus of morality.</span></u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> What I am saying here, then, is that egoism seems to give a coherent and quite theoretically smooth account of our moral intuitions and of our attitudes about animals which preserves the latter rather than rejecting them. Or, more guardedly, what I should say is that if the apparent difficulties with egoism can be solved, then it does this; and I am far less certain that those difficulties cannot be solved than I once was. Obviously, one has the alternative of judging that if we have to go to the length of embracing this nasty doctrine in order to salvage our affection for filet mignon, then that is just all the more reason for giving up the filthy habit. I don't propose to try to resolve that one in this article. But at any rate, I hope it will by now be apparent that this question about the moral status of animals being one of the real watershed issues of moral philosophy has been amply confirmed. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Second, even if animals could engage in contractarian agreements, humans would have no reason to submit to them since animals have no counter-balancing benefit to offer. For example, factory farmers have no reason to constrain their practices toward livestock, since their farms will run equally well with or without animals’ consent.</span><br />
<br />
<em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Third, even given the choice, animals would not push for rights because animals suffer less under human ownership than in the wild. </span></em><br />
<br />
<strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Epstein</span></u></em></strong><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"> writes<span style="color: #a6a6a6;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Neg/NCs/Contractarianism%20NC%204.0.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">**[5]**</a></span></span></em><br />
<br />
<em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">The historical backdrop invites a further inquiry: why is it that anyone assumes the human ownership of animals necessarily leads to their suffering, let alone their destruction? Often, quite the opposite is true. Animals that are left to their own devices may have no masters; nor do they have any peace. </span></em><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Life in the wild leaves</span></u></em></strong><em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> them </span></em><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">[animals] exposed to</span></u></em></strong><em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> the elements; to </span></em><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">attacks by other animals;</span></u></em></strong><em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> to the inability to find food or shelter; to </span></em><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">accidental injury; and</span></u></em></strong><em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> to </span></em><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">disease</span></u></em></strong><em><u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">.</span></u></em><em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> The expected life of animals in the wild need not be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short. But it is often rugged, and rarely placid and untroubled. </span></em><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Human ownership changes</span></u></em></strong><em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> this natural state </span></em><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">animals for the better</span></u></em></strong><em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> as well as for the worse. </span></em><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Because they use and value animals, owners will spend resources for their protection</span></u></em></strong><em><u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">.</span></u></em><em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> Veterinary medicine may not be at the level of human medicine, but it is only a generation or so behind. When it comes to medical care, it’s better to be a sick cat in a middle-class United States household than a sick peasant in a third-world country. Private ownership of many pets (or, if one must, “companions”) gives them access to food and shelter (and sometimes clothing) which creates long lives of ease and comfort. </span></em><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Even death can be done in more humane ways than in nature, for any slaughter that spares cattle, for example, unnecessary anxiety, tends to improve the amount and quality of the meat</span></u></em></strong><em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> that is </span></em><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">left behind. </span></u></em></strong><em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">No one should claim a perfect concurrence between the interests of humans and animals: ownership is not tantamount to partnership. But by the same token there is no necessary conflict between owners and their animals. Over broad areas of human endeavor, the ownership for animals worked to their advantage, and not to their detriment.</span></em><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Finally, proving that humans would contract with each other to respect animals doesn’t justify animal rights because the entity being respected is a human, not an animal. If we agree not to kill each other’s pets, I am respecting your right to property over the animal, not any right that the animal can claim independently. </span><br />

 (Saint James)<br />
The <strong>value</strong> is <strong>justice</strong>, defined as giving each their due. Justice is distinct from morality because morality focuses on what one ought to do, while justice focuses on what one deserves. For example, while it may be morally praiseworthy to donate to charity, it cannot be said that justice requires that you donate to charity because the poor are not entitled to the fruits of your labor.<br />
<br />
Therefore, to clarify what people are entitled to, I tender the <strong>criterion</strong> of <strong>reciprocity</strong>. The obligation to do to others as they have done to you is what separates deserved reward or punishment from undeserved.<br />
<br />
This criterion is best for 3 reasons:<br />
<br />
<strong>First</strong>, reciprocity is the nearly universally accepted standard for justice. Almost all religions contain some form of the golden rule, and almost every legal system, from Hammurabi’s Code to the US criminal justice system, is based on punishment proportional to crime.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second</strong>, reciprocity is intuitively the basis for justice. For example, it is the reason why we would not punish someone for failing to donate money but would punish them for failing to return money that had been lent to them. In one case, the recipient had a reciprocal claim to the money; in the other, they didn’t.<br />
<br />
<strong>Third</strong>, reciprocity gives people a reason to be just. If you did not expect others to treat you based on how you treat them, then you would have little practical incentive to treat others fairly. Only reciprocity provides such an incentive. Professor of philosophy at the University of Alabama (Roll Tide!), James <u>Rachels</u>, furthers<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Neg/NCs/Reciprocity%20NC.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">To these reasons a third may be added. Morality includes (some would say it consists in) how we choose to treat other people in our myriad interactions with them. But if reciprocity could not be expected, the morality of treating others well would come to occupy a less important place in people’s lives. In a system that respects deserts,</span> <u>someone who treats others well may expect to be treated well in return, while someone who treats others badly cannot. If this aspect of moral life were eliminated, morality would have no reward, and</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">immoralitywouldhavenobadconsequence;so</span><u>there would be less reason</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> for one </span><u>to be concerned with it.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> If people were perfectly benevolent, of course, such incentives would not be needed. But for imperfectly benevolent beings such as us the acknowledgment of deserts</span> <u>[This] provides the reason for being moral that is required for the</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> whole</span> <u>system to be effective.</u><br />
<br />
Therefore, my sole <strong>contention</strong> is that reciprocity does not require animal rights.<br />
<br />
Animals cannot understand the concept of human rights, and even if they could, they would not respect our rights, as their primary concern is their own survival and well-being. There is therefore no more reason to value a lion’s rights than the rights of someone who is attempting to murder you, as both place the same value on your life, namely a value of 0. Moreover, even if we did have some obligation to animals, that obligation would not be to provide rights, as animals cannot understand or utilize their rights. Rights are therefore useless to animals, and focusing on animal welfare instead would be preferable in such a case. Thus, you should negate.<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">The alternative doomsday scenario, of course, is war. And at some point, war does become the best choice for North Korea if they are forced to choose between an offense against the south and famine &amp; internal implosion.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">THE DEPROLIFERATOR --</span> <strong><u>Paul</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> R.</span> <strong><u>Hill was an aerodynamics scientist who led</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">some</span> <strong><u>key projects for NASA</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">. Also, like moon-walking astronaut Edgar Mitchell,</span> <strong><u>he believed in UFOs</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">, in part</span> <strong><u>because of two personal sightings</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">. In fact,</span> <strong><u>Hill marshaled his</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> aerodynamic and mathematical</span> <strong><u>expertise to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> the task of</span> <strong><u>determin[e]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">ing</span> <strong><u>what made them fly. . . and stop on a dime. . . and change directions in a heartbeat.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">The book that was the result of his labors,<em>Unconventional Flying Objects</em> (Hampton Roads Publishing, 1995), is one of the most respected works in UFO lore, as well as great fun to read (despite all the equations). </span><strong><u>Hill determined that their means of propulsion were</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">-- no surprise --</span> <strong><u>an anti-gravity force field.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Of course, he wasn't able to conceptualize a working model. Had he been, NASA would no doubt have yanked him out of retirement and become involved in a tug of war with the Pentagon for his services...</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">What? You didn't get the memo that the Pentagon and aliens were, well, sending memos to each other? Be that as it may, what exactly is it about nukes that aliens object to? Dr. Salla again: [Former SAC man] Salas believes that UFOs interfere with</span> <strong><u>nuclear weapons</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> out of an altruistic desire to prevent nuclear war on Earth. Dedrickson, however. ... claims that a nuclear weapons test over the Pacific in the 1960s was [something] that the extraterrestrials were really concerned about because it</span> <strong><u>affect</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">ed</span> <strong><u>our ionosphere.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> In fact, the ET</span> <strong><u>spacecraft were unable to operate because of the pollution in the magnetic field</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> which they depended upon. Furthermore, Dr. Salla writes that French UFO researcher Eric Julien, who wrote the visionary <em>The Science of Extraterrestrials,</em> &quot;argues that</span> <strong><u>there is a correlation between UFO behavior around nuclear tests and 74</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">alleged</span> <strong><u>UFO crashes</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">documented in Ryan Wood's book, <em>Majic Eyes Only.&quot;</em> Seventy-four! Odds are that adds up to a higher crash rate per flight than earthly aircraft. If so, it's a testament to how, as Julien sees it, &quot;the use of</span> <strong><u>nuclear weapons affect</u></strong>s <strong><u>the time/space continuum in ways that disrupt UFO</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">/extraterrestrial</span> <strong><u>navigation and propulsion systems.&quot;</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Dr. Salla concludes that</span> <strong><u>the use of nuclear weapons may be a threat to extraterrestrial civilizations. Planning to use them &quot;could provoke extraterrestrials to respond in a preemptive manner.&quot;</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">However open to the possibility of the existence of extraterrestrials, disarmament advocates shouldn't hold their breath waiting for aliens to ride to their rescue. (It's as chimerical as hawks who seek to huddle under missile defense systems.) But if extraterrestrials are darting about our atmosphere, it's a safe bet that they can't be happy about past tests of nuclear detonations and the prospect of their use in warfare. Apparently extraterrestrials perceive a truth about <u><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 9pt;">nuclear weapons</span></strong></u> that many of us on earth don't -- that they're a<u><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 9pt;"> rip</span></strong></u></span> <span style="font-size: 60%;">in</span> <strong><u>the fabric of the space-time continuum.</u></strong><br />

<u>A new</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> study gives a much-needed booster shot to the beleaguered AIDS vaccine field. The </span><u>experiment</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, led</span> <u>by</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> immunologist and pathologist Louis Picker of </span><u>the Oregon Health &amp; Science University</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in Beaverton, </span><u>showed that a</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">n unusual approach to vaccinating</span> <u>[vaccine] against SIV (a simian cousin of HIV) protected 12 of 24 monkeys from</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">a “challenge” with a particularly virulent strain of</span> <u>that virus.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Specifically, all monkeys became infected, but</span> <u>in half of the animals, their immune systems drove the virus down to undetectable levels for more than a year.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">“It’s the best result I’ve seen against the worst SIV known,” says the University of Wisconsin’s David Watkins, an immunologist who tests AIDS vaccines in monkeys and was not involved with the work. “I’m very excited by this approach.” The vaccine contains SIV genes stitched into cytomegalovirus (CMV), a herpesvirus that harmlessly infects many humans and serves as the delivery vehicle [delivers], or vector, for the AIDS virus proteins. Typically, AIDS vaccines use vectors that quickly die, but CMV stays alive indefinitely and constantly confronts the immune system with the mock version of the enemy. As a result, Picker contends, the immune system stays on high alert and can respond to an attack by SIV much more quickly. “The whole game changes when you talk about early interception of the virus,” he says. AIDS researchers have long debated which specific immune responses correlate with protection, and this study—published online today in <em>Nature—</em>is reigniting that discussion. Picker contends that a novel type of T cell response plays a critical role in why the vaccine works, but others find the evidence for that less than compelling. “I’m not sure what the protective mechanism is in these experiments,” Watkins says. Most vector-based AIDS vaccines train what are known as central memory T cells to recognize the virus. Upon a real infection, these cells expand and mount an attack. But, Picker says, “it’s too late and too little to handle [AIDS] viruses.” With the CMV vector, </span><u>monkeys developed high levels of</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">so-called</span> <u>effector memory T cells, which</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">do not go through an expansion phase and</span> <u>remain ready to do battle at all times.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Other experiments suggested that these cells were key and that only CMV rouses them.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">It could transmit additional variants of SIV which then could mutate and recombine into novel HIV types and further expand the pernicious AIDS plague faced worldwide. Virologists have begun to present their evidence in journals and at major international conferences (Hahn, 1999). They are telling the public two things. First, we must stop the hunting and butchering of wild chimpanzees in order to avoid transmission of new strains of SIV. Second, we must launch new programs to protect and study wild apes in their natural habitat. </span><u>Global human health could depend on</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> saving the </span><u>apes</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and their homelands.</span> <u>Chimpanzees are identical to humans in over 98% of their genome, yet</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">they appear to be</span> <u>[are] resistant to</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> damaging </span><u>effects of</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">the</span> <u>AIDS</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> virus </span><u>on their immune system.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">As noted in an earlier quote from Regan, </span><u>once inherent value is granted, there is little ground for making distinctions between individuals. This applies to the distinction between animals that are</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> rare or </span><u>endangered versus those that are more common. According to the rights view, a rare individual has no higher moral standing than one who is common</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, since all share equally the basis on which they are granted inherent value. Regan (1983), in an oft quoted comment states, “That an individual animal is among the last remaining members of a species confers no further right to that animal, and its right not be harmed must be weighed equitably with the rights of any others who have this right.” </span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Taken to its logical conclusion, </span><u>this view allows for no special treatment in protecting threatened ecosystems by culling unwanted animals, nor can it condone invasive technologies and the attendant suffering of individuals that are intended to secure their future</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> as a taxon on the grounds of rareness. Animal rights philosophers do not oppose efforts to save endangered species, but neither to they single them out for special treatment. According to Regan (1983), “</span><u>the general policy recommended by the rights view is: let them be!” In contrast, the</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> zoo </span><u>biologist or the park manager will usually opt in favor of steps that insure the survival of species</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> over survival of individual members.</span><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-family: Times-Roman,serif;">Basic economic theory argues that fisheries should be self-sustaining</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Times-Roman,serif; font-size: 10pt;">—when fish populations (stocks) get low and/or the cost of fishing rises, fishing will be less profitable, and people and capital assets will move out of the business, thus allowing stocks to recover. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Times-Roman,serif;">This</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Times-Roman,serif; font-size: 10pt;"> theory, however, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Times-Roman,serif;">cannot translate into practice when fisheries receive government subsidies, as this enables </span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Times-Roman,serif; font-size: 10pt;">otherwise </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Times-Roman,serif;">unprofitable fleets to continue fishing</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Times-Roman,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. In the 1950s and 1960s, the more capacity-enhancing subsidies a country gave, the more catch it got—because at that time, the majority of stocks were largely underexploited (</span><span style="color: #000066; font-family: Times-Roman,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Fig. 1</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman,serif; font-size: 8pt;">).

Sanctions cause severe poverty and destroy the target country’s economy. Winkler 99<br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Such effects from sanctions are predictable. Similar</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to the Iraqi situation<strong><u>,</u></strong></span> <strong><u>the embargo against Haiti</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">also</span><strong><u>had a profound impact on ordinary citizens.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">According to official US estimates,</span><strong><u>240,000 manufacturing</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and associated industry </span><strong><u>jobs were lost</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in 1991</span> <strong><u>due to sanctions</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> imposed by the Organization of American States. Likewise, an</span> <strong><u>analysis of the sanctions against Serbia</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">-Montenegro reported</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the <em>British Journal of Medicine</em></span><strong><u>details the devastating impact of sanctions on the health care of ordinary Serbs. Indeed, this is the very premise of sanctions: to inflict such harm upon the economy</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, and consequently on the target population,</span> <strong><u>that leaders will be forced to alter undesirable policies</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Nevertheless, it may be that some of these numbers are exaggerated. However, even if, for example, only one percent of the</span> <strong><u>estimated 500,000 Iraqi children died due to sanctions,</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">moral consideration of this deadly instrument of foreign policy is warranted.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Unfortunately<strong><u>,</u></strong></span> <strong><u>even if</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the implementers of </span><strong><u>smart sanctions become more sophisticated, smart sanctions are still likely to be a noble failure</u></strong>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The contributors to Smart Sanctions acknowledge some of the reasons for this, but not all. For example<strong><u>,</u></strong></span> <strong><u>the case studies show that smart sanctions still impose significant costs on a target state's populace</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Michael Brzoska notes that an arms embargo increases the costs of weapons procurement, </span><strong><u>[by] leading &quot;to a major shift in government spending priorities and a consequent reduction in the economic well-being of the general population</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in the targeted state&quot; (p. 126). De Vries acknowledges that </span><strong><u>&quot;financial sanctions probably caused the greatest negative impact on non-targeted sectors of Serbian society,&quot;</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> with the sanctions triggering severe stagflation in the Yugoslav economy (p. 102). The flight ban also imposed greater costs on the Yugoslav opposition than on the Milosevic regime, leading the European Union to reverse course. Moreover, travel sanctions can disrupt the shipment of food and cold-storage medicine to war-torn societies. </span><strong><u>In short, all sanctions impose costs on innocents.</u></strong><br />

The concept of rights is antithetical to the animal liberation movement.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Second, </span><strong><u>moving beyond “animal rights” allows us to develop new ways to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> morally and </span><strong><u>ethically relate to animals.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> My point here is that a committment to animal rights is a false start–and I say this as someone who believes that it is clearly the case that humans ought not to make instrumental use of animals–for two reasons. First, rhetorically, “animal rights” is not going to get animals anywhere; second,</span><strong><u>rights</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">–</span><strong><u>whether</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">they are</span><strong><u>animal rights or human rights</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">–</span><strong><u>are</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">concepts</span><strong><u>derived from liberal humanism:</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> once again we bump up against</span><strong><u>a tradition that excludes animals from</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">serious</span><strong><u>moral consideration.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In effect,</span><strong><u>animals do not have rights because animals cannot have rights.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Animals are the sort of beings that, by definition, cannot possibly have rights: it is nearly impossible to convince any serious supporter of the concept of rights–beyond those already committed to animal rights–that animals are the sort of beings that have rights.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The strange result of this is that</span><strong><u>we have to move [to a]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">in a direction similar to Wolfe’s concept of posthumanism (although I’d prefer the term “inhumanism”) which posits a new</span><strong><u>moral theory that is not based upon rights.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> What it would be based upon is not entirely clear to me, but I think we could do worse than start with the feminist care ethic, as well as some of Jacques Derrida’s, Emmanuel Levinas’s, and Hannah Arendt’s works–although I expect we won’t find everything we are looking for there. A fringe benefit of</span><strong><u>this move</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">is that it</span><strong><u>enables us to escape an erro[r]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">neous premise present</span><strong><u>in most animal rights talk:</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that is,</span><strong><u>the axiomatic belief in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a fundamentalist</span><strong><u>pacifism.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">(Best is correct to make this criticism of the abolitionist strain of animal rights thinking.) The problem with</span><strong><u>this strain of thinking</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">is that it</span><strong><u>negates political solutions because politics</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">fundamentally</span><strong><u>presupposes the potential for violence</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and recognizes the morally complex relation between law, power and violence. While I don’t, as a matter of course, endorse killing humans or animals, I don’t, at the same time, rule it out entirely.</span><br />

<strong>This is specifically true in the context of endangered species. Animal rights directly interfere with efforts to conserve biodiversity. Animal welfare solves</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">As noted in an earlier quote from Regan, </span><u>once inherent value is granted, there is little ground for making distinctions between individuals. This applies to the distinction between animals that are rare or endangered versus those that are more common</u>. <u>According to the rights view, a rare individual has no higher moral standing than one who is common</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, since all share equally the basis on which they are granted inherent value. Regan (1983), in an oft quoted comment states, “That an individual animal is among the last remaining members of a species confers no further right to that animal, and its right not be harmed must be weighed equitably with the rights of any others who have this right.” Taken to its logical conclusion, </span><u>this view allows for no special treatment in protecting threatened ecosystems by culling unwanted animals, nor can it condone invasive technologies and the attendant suffering of individuals that are intended to secure their future</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> as a taxon on the grounds of rareness. Animal rights philosophers do not oppose efforts to save endangered species, but neither to they single them out for special treatment. According to Regan (1983), “</span><u>the general policy recommended by the rights view is: let them be!” In contrast, the</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> zoo </span><u>biologist or the park manager will usually opt in favor of steps that insure the survival of species</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> over survival of individual members.</span><br />

 A. Interpretation – Animal rights must prohibit human exploitation of animals.<br />
<br />
Non-exploitation is the one aspect that separates animal rights from animal welfare.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Regan and Francione</u></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Neg/AT%20Overfishing%20AC/T%20-%20exploitation%20fish.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">There are fundamental and profound differences between the philosophy of animal welfare and that of animal rights.</span><strong><u>Animal rights philosophy rests on the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> recognition of the </span><strong><u>moral inviolability of the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> individual, both human and </span><strong><u>non-human.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Just as people of color do not exist as resources for whites, or women for men, so other animals do not exist as resources for human beings. The goal of the animal rights movement is nothing less than the <em>total</em> liberation of non-human animals from human tyranny. No one who accepts the philosophy of animal rights would be satisfied with a continuation of our society’s rapacious consumption of farm animals, for example, even if those animals were raised in an ecologically sustainable fashion, and were transported and slaughtered “humanely.” Animal welfarists, by contrast, are committed to the pursuit of “gentle usage.” They believe it morally permissible to use nonhumans for human benefit. </span><strong><u>Thus, whereas welfarists seek to <em>reform</em> current practices of animal exploitation, rights advocates oppose all such exploitation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in principle and seek to <em>abolish</em> all such exploitation in practice.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
B. Violation – the plan only takes actions to limit exploitation of fish, not to end all exploitation.<br />
<br />
C. Reasons to prefer<br />
<br />
1. Limits – his interpretation kills limits because any action that causes an increase in animal welfare affirms. Only my interpretation sets a concise limit on which plans are topical, which is all plans that abolish a method of exploitation of animals, e.g. banning factory farms or animal testing.<br />
<br />
2. Predictability – non-exploitation is the one common aspect that defines the animal rights movement. It is included in every dictionary definition of animal rights and is universal among animal rights advocates, thus it’s the only predictable interpretation. Topic lit determines predictability because words only gain meaning based on usage.<br />
<br />
Fairness is a gateway issue. T is an issue of competing interpretations because reasonability is arbitrary and requires judge intervention. The only way to ensure that you vote for the best interpretation is to consider the impacts to debate as a whole, not just this round.<br />

<strong><u>An extensive</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> telephone </span><strong><u>survey of producers [was conducted]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> farming </span><strong><u>in the critical areas of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the 21 RCWP [Rural </span><strong><u>Clean Water</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Program] </span><strong><u>projects</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> was conducted to evaluate differences between farmers who chose to participate in the RCWP and those who did not (Gale et al., 1993). Farm structure, farm operator characteristics, and water quality awareness and attitudes were assessed.</span><br />
<strong><u>Participation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in RCWP projects </span><strong><u>was highly correlated with strong economic indicators</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, such as comparatively larger total acreage farmed, higher gross farm sales, and greater property and farm equipment values. Producers who were employed off-farm, or who received only part of their income from agriculture, were less likely to participate in NPS pollution control projects than were farmers who worked solely on the farm and earned most of their income from agriculture.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Water quality awareness and attitudes were also important in determining participation rates in the RCWP projects. Producers who were more aware of water pollution (in general, in the specific area, or on individual farms) participated in greater numbers than farmers who were less well informed. Producers who received most of their water quality and conservation information from government agencies and farm magazines were more likely to change agricultural practices that affected water quality than producers who did not receive information from these sources.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Many of </span><strong><u>the results</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of the farm operator survey </span><strong><u>were similar to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> conclusions of </span><strong><u>previous studies</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> evaluating factors that influence conservation. </span><strong><u>Farmers who run large-scale operations</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, are better educated and more willing to take risks, and have access to government information </span><strong><u>generally participate at a higher rate in conservation programs</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> than producers without these characteristics. Although farm structure and producer characteristics were important factors in determining which farmers chose to participate in the RCWP projects, external incentives also affected participation. Financial incentives are extremely important, and may be the most important factor, in obtaining voluntary implementation of BMPs. Financial incentives for voluntary environmental compliance include cost-share funds, tax relief, payment transfers, and government subsidies. The primary financial incentive in the RCWP projects was federal cost-share funding. Each producer could receive up to 75% of the cost of each recommended BMP implemented (up to a maximum per farm of $50,000). The cost-share rate for the Alabama RCWP project was originally set at 60%. Few farmers chose to participate until the cost-share rate was raised to 75%. Participation then increased to 100% of the producers in the critical area.</span><br />
<strong><u>A significant barrier to implementation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of BMPs </span><strong><u>is poor economic status</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of producers. The farm operator survey (Gale et al., 1993) found a lower rate of participation among farmers who had relatively lower economic indicators. During the early 1980s, many farmers in Oregon were unable to participate in the Tillamook Bay RCWP project because high interest rates limited cash flow, making it difficult for farmers to pay their portion of the cost of installing BMPs. Another hindrance is the high cost of some BMPs, such as animal waste management systems. For many dairy farmers, the maximum cost-share payment of $50,000 was insufficient to make the construction of animal waste storage units economically feasible.</span><br />

 Counter-plan text: The United States should substantially subsidize <strong>biogas digesters</strong> for all Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations.<br />
<br />
<em>[Counter-plan text: Factory farms should adopt biogas digesters as their primary waste-disposal system.]</em><br />
<br />
The counter-plan is mutually exclusive because it relies on the existence of CAFOs. It is also net-beneficial.<br />
<br />
Biogas digestion uses microbes to breakdown harmful waste into biogas, which can be used as fuel. The excess can be used as fertilizer. This solves harmful emissions and makes factory farms a green energy source which turns the case.<br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">But Ye, who’s 30, isn’t your typical farmer — he studied business in England and has a bachelor’s degree, and he prefers loafers to boots. His farm is also different than the American pig farms you usually detect with your nose before you see any animals: it smells only faintly of waste. He says that’s because it’s </span><strong><u>an ecological CAFO</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, which sounds a bit like an oxymoron. “The whole system </span><strong><u>is pollution-free, zero-emission, and energy saving,</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">” says Ye. </span><strong><u>“The key is the biogas digester.”</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Biogas digestion takes</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the nuisances of most large animal farms — </span><strong><u>solid, liquid, and gaseous wastes</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> — </span><strong><u>and turns them into resources that farmers can use and even sell.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Raw pig waste is usually a liability for farmers: It’s full of pathogens and compounds like ammonia that can ruin crops and soil if applied directly. It also is prone to running off into waterways and leaching into groundwater. Water pollution is rampant in China, and animal farms large and small are a big part of the problem. The 2010 national pollution survey revealed that the livestock industry was responsible for dumping 243 million tons of feces and 163 million tons of urine into water resources in 2007, causing eutrophication and high chemical oxygen demand (COD). Some of that waste eventually ends up in the ocean, where the organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus overwhelm the marine ecosystem. The South China Sea today is largely a dead zone with frequent red tides and little remaining life because of run-off from upstream agriculture. Ye thinks his biogas digester may be part of the solution. It cost about $600,000, but Ye only paid for half while the central, provincial, and local governments picked up the rest with subsidies. It is a round green tank about 15 feet high with a bulbous white top. The bottom half is a chamber where wet waste piped from the nearby pig sheds and dry waste delivered from the sheds by trucks are mixed with straw and water. The chamber is airtight, and inside microbes thrive in the anaerobic environment. As they eat away at the waste, the microbes release gases — the stinky ones — which, instead of irritating the noses of neighbors and eventually escaping to the atmosphere, are stored in the spherical upper compartment of the tank. </span><strong><u>The anaerobic digestion also kills most pathogens, lowers the</u></strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> COD [Chemical </span><strong><u>Oxygen Demand</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">], </span><strong><u>and makes nutrients better available to plants.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> One reason Ye likes the system is that </span><strong><u>it’s a free source of nutrient-rich fertilizer</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> he can </span><strong><u>[to] use on crops</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that he grows to feed his pigs. Unlike American farmers who typically buy animal feed like corn and soy wholesale, some large Chinese farmers grow their own feed — a combination of green crops like alfalfa and ryegrass. Ye calls it “salad for pigs.”</span><br />

 A. Uniqueness – the US economy is recovering now, precisely because of the food industry. <strong><u>White 10</u></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Neg/AT%20CAFO%20AC/CAFO%20Econ%20DA.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Recent estimates released by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) show that agricultural exports are predicted to rise $107.5 billion for the fiscal year 2010, the second highest year ever, with the previous such highs recorded in 2008 when a commodity boom fueled agriculture exports worldwide. A delighted USDA stated that</span><u>“agriculture is one of the only major sectors of the American economy with a trade surplus</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> – expected to be $30</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 1pt;">.5 </span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">billion this year.” </span><u>Next year</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> is supposed to be even better with </span><u>exports</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> increasing </span><u>[will increase] to $113 billion.</u><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The U.S. has benefited from a fall in fortunes from key competitors like Russia, whose wheat crop has been scorched by record heat, and even the Ukraine and Kazakhstan have struggled to match export grain targets. This leaves the U.S. in the enviable position of being able to take advantage of rising demand from markets in the Middle East and North Africa – markets that the U.S. so far has failed to dominate. And then there is the giant called China, whose voracious demand is forecasted to make it the America’s second largest market, overtaking Mexico in the process. The U.S. is benefiting from China’s transition from being a net exporter of corn to a net importer of corn. Chinese corn imports are expected to grow to 5.8 million tons in 2011, up from 1.7 million tons this year. Figures like these have helped the agricultural sector sustain its momentum in what has been a rocky year for the U.S. economy. </span><u>The agriculture industry</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, in its quiet way, </span><u>has been generating jobs, sustaining rural America’s economy.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The USDA estimates that ‘</span><strong><u>every billion dollars worth of agricultural exports supports more than 8,000 jobs</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and generate $1.4 billion in economic activity.’</span><br />
<u>As the world economy continues to recover, global trade in</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> grain, </span><u>meat</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and commodities </span><u>is only going to rise.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The U.S. has worked itself up to this lofty position, and it is an advantage it is not going to surrender anytime soon. There are risks, no doubt. A double-dip recession in the U.S., a widening trade surplus with China or an economic plunge in the European Union. But </span><u>having weathered many a storm in the past three years, there is a</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> steely </span><u>resilience to this sector.

Our industry can be proud that we provide millions of quality jobs in every state and every sector of the U.S. economy&quot;, commented Boyle. According to the study, the meat and poultry industry directly employs 1.8 million people, paying $45.5 billion in wages and benefits. An estimated 524,000 people have jobs in production and packing, importing operations, sales, packaging and direct distribution of meat and poultry products. Wholesaling directly employs an estimated 63,000 individuals in every state in the country, and 1,227,600 employees' retail jobs depend on the sale of meat and poultry products to the public. In addition to the direct economic impact, the study also captures the economic impact of suppliers to the industry and the total induced impact, or multiplier effect, on the economy of the spending by employees of the direct industry and supplier firms.</span><br />

Organic farming doesn’t solve. <strong><u>Green et al 09</u></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Neg/AT%20CAFO%20AC/CAFO%20Econ%20DA.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">[3</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Since the late 1990s, U.S. organic production has more than doubled, but the consumer market has grown even faster. Organic food sales have more than quintupled, increasing from 3.6 billion US Dollars in 1997 to 18.9 billion US Dollars in 2007. More than two-thirds of U.S. consumers buy organic products at least occasionally, and 28 percent buy organic products weekly, according to the Organic Trade Association. This fast-paced growth has led to input and product shortages in organic supply chains, and several new issues — concern about premium-priced product sales in a tight U.S. economy, as well as competition from new environmental labels — are emerging in the organic industry.</span><br />
<strong><u>A recent report by the [USDA]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Economic Research Service ERS of the United States Deparment of Agriculture analyses the current status of organic agriculture in the US. The study drew on a range of ERS studies and surveys on organic production and handling, and conducted an extensive literature review to better characterize the U.S. organic sector.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The main finding are: </span><strong><u>[found that]</u></strong><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Significant price premiums, fast-paced growth in demand, and fluctuating market conditions have characterized the U.S. organic sector since the beginning of the decade. Early in the decade, demand for organic products outpaced supply, and market participants reported that a supply squeeze was limiting growth in the overall sector.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">More recently, U.S. organic producers and manufacturers have had to contend with the impact of a weaker U.S. economy on organic food sales. Surveys suggest that many organic consumers may not be particularly sensitive to the price premium paid for organic products. While frequent buyers of organic products may not change their organic purchasing habits even with the current economic slowdown, infrequent buyers may limit their purchases of organic products, and the rate of gain for new organic consumers may decline.</span><br />

<strong>Economic decline kills U.S. primacy. <u>Pape 09</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">[Robert Pape, Prof. of Political Science @ University of Chicago, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, 3/8/09, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11375:http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-perspec0308diplomacymar08,0,4785661.story --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-perspec0308diplomacymar08,0,4785661.story" rel="nofollow">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-perspec0308diplomacymar08,0,4785661.story</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11375 -->]</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">For nearly two decades, </span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics/government/national-government/united-states-ORGOV0000001.topic" rel="nofollow">the U.S.</a></span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> has been viewed as a global hegemon—vastly more powerful than any major country in the world. Since 2000, however, our global dominance has fallen dramatically. During the Bush administration, the self-inflicted wounds of the Iraq war, growing government debt, increasingly negative current account balances and other internal</span><strong><u>economic weaknesses cost the U.S.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">real</span><strong><u>power</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">in a world of rapidly spreading knowledge and technology</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6;">. </span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Simply put, the main legacy of the Bush years has been to leave the U.S. as a declining power. From Rome to the United States today, the rise and fall of great nations have been driven primarily by economic strength. At any given moment,</span> <strong><u>a state's power depends on the size and quality of its military</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">forces and other power</span> <strong><u>assets. Over time</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, however,</span> <strong><u>power is a result of economic strength—the prerequisite for building and modernizing military forces. And so the size of the economy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">relative to potential rivals</span> <strong><u>ultimately determines the limits of power in international politics.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The power position of the U.S. is crucial to the foreign policy aims that it can achieve. Since the Cold War, America has maintained a vast array of overseas commitments, seeking to ensure peace and stability not just in its own neighborhood, the Western hemisphere, but also in Europe, Asia and the oil-rich Persian Gulf. Maintaining these commitments requires enormous resources, but American leaders in recent years chose to pursue far more ambitious goals than merely maintaining the status quo.</span><br />

<strong>U.S. primacy solves war. <u>Walt 02</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">[Stephen Walt, Professor of International Affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. &quot;American Primacy: Its Prospects and Pitfalls.&quot; Naval War College Review, Vol. 55, Iss. 2. pg. 9. Spring 2002.]</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">A second consequence of</span> <strong><u>U.S. primacy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">is a decreased danger of great-power rivalry and a higher level of overall international tranquility. Ironically, those who argue that primacy is no longer important, because the danger of war is slight, overlook the fact that the extent of American primacy</span> <strong><u>is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">one of the main reasons</span> <strong><u>why the risk of great-power war is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">as</span> <strong><u>low</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">as it is</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6;">. </span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Formost of the past four centuries, relations among the major powers have been intensely competitive, often punctuated by major wars and occasionally by all-out struggles for hegemony. In the first half of the twentieth century, for example, great-power wars killed over eighty million people. Today, however, the dominant position of the United States places significant limits on the possibility of great-power competition, for at least two reasons. One reason is that</span><strong><u>because the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited</span> <strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates</span> <strong><u>is</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">currently</span> <strong><u>so far ahead</u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span></u></strong><strong><u>other major powers are not inclined to challenge it</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">sdominant position. Not only is there no possibility of a “hegemonic war” (because there is no potential hegemon to mount a challenge), but the risk of war via miscalculation is reduced by the overwhelming gap between the United States and the other major powers. Miscalculation is more likely to lead to war when the balance of power is fairly even, because in this situation both sides can convince themselves that they might be able to win. When the balance of power is heavily skewed, however,the leading state does not need to go to war and weaker states dare not try. The second reason is thatthe continued deployment of roughly two hundred thousand troops in Europe and in Asia provides a further barrier to conflict in each region.</span> <strong><u>[And,] So long as U.S. troops are committed abroad, regional powers know that launching a war is likely to lead to a confrontation with the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited</span> <strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tate</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">s</span><strong><u>.</u></strong><strong><u>Thus, states</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">within these regions</span> <strong><u>do not worry as much about each other, because</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">the</span> <strong><u>U.S. presence</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">effectively</span><strong><u>prevents regional conflicts from breaking out.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">What Joseph Joffe has termed the “American pacifier” is not the only barrier to conflict in Europe and Asia, but it is an important one. This tranquilizing effect is not lost on America’s allies in Europe and Asia. They resent U.S. dominance and dislike playing host to American troops, but they also do not want “Uncle Sam” to leave. Thus, U.S. primacy is of benefit to the United States, and to other countries as well, because it dampens the overall level of international insecurity. World politics might be more interesting if the United States were weaker and if other states were forced to compete with each other more actively, but a more exciting world is not necessarily a better one.</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">I am grateful that </span><strong><u>the rate of wild species extinction is now as low as it has been since the sixteenth century</u></strong><u>. We lost only half as many known species</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of birds, animals and/or fish </span><u>in the last third of the twentieth century</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (twenty species) </span><u>as we did during the last third of the nineteenth century</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (forty species), </span><u>according to the UN</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Environmental Program. I am startled to realize that </span><u>only during the last sixty years or so has the world been able to feed all people without</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> either </span><u>hunting wild species to extinction</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or stealing hunting/farming land from other people.</span><br />

B. Link – factory farms are 78 times more land efficient than open range farms per pound of beef. <strong><u>Ray 11</u></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Neg/AT%20CAFO%20AC/CAFO%20Biodiversity%20DA.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>The average “factory farm”</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> occupies 16,000 acres of land. On this land it </span><strong><u>raises</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> an average of </span><strong><u>3,800 cattle at a time. That’s 0.23</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">75 </span><strong><u>acres per animal</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that the average factory farm can raise. </span><strong><u>The average grass-fed beef operation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> – a.k.a., open area with cattle in it – is estimated to </span><strong><u>require[s]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> an average of </span><strong><u>18</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">.75 </span><strong><u>acres per cattle.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> This is </span><strong><u>based on a representative sample of US</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> grass-fed </span><strong><u>beef</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> operations that required between 2.5 acres and 35 acres per cattle in the US.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In addition to the fact that </span><strong><u>one grass-fed cattle requires <em>seventy-eight times as much land</em> to grow on as one “factory” animal</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (see above), grass-fed cattle emits a type of greenhouse gas that is much worse for the environment than corn-fed (a.k.a., factory) cattle.</span><br />

<br />
Organic farms would prevent nitrogen fertilizer, which makes land usage insanely inefficient. <strong><u>Avery 02</u></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Animal%20Rights/Neg/AT%20CAFO%20AC/CAFO%20Biodiversity%20DA.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">[3</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and other U.S. environmental groups have long demanded that America shift to organic farming, giving up &quot;man-made chemicals&quot; that they say harm wildlife. The New York Times and Hollywood stars enthusiastically endorse organic food. </span><strong><u>Congress</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and government regulators are </span><strong><u>[is] forcing U.S. farmers in the organic direction by restricting</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> safety-proven pesticides, </span><strong><u>fertilizers</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, </span><strong><u>and farming systems.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Unfortunately, our city-wise society may not have thought this countryside question all the way through. Nitrogen is the key chemical in farming. If we don't replace the nitrogen crop plants take from our soils as they grow, our fields will become barren, as they did during the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s. (That's when the nitrogen, built up in Great Plains soils by eons of bison manure, began to run out.) To keep their soils fertile, today's American farmers apply about 11 million tons of &quot;chemical&quot; nitrogen per year. This is pure nitrogen, taken literally from the air (which is 78 percent N) through an industrial process. Worldwide, high-yield farmers apply about 80 million tons of chemical N per year.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u>But the first and foremost rule of organic is &quot;no chemical fertilizer.&quot;</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The organic movement was founded in the 1930s on the precept that chemical fertilizer poisons the soil. Organic farmers are allowed to use only organic nitrogen, mainly from cattle manure and &quot;green manure crops&quot; like rye and clover. Now comes University of Manitoba's Vaclav Smil, a top expert on crops and fertilizer. His latest book &quot;Enriching the Earth,&quot; (2002, MIT Press) focuses on nitrogen and food production. Smil says 100 years of experience prove that chemical N keeps soil healthy, especially in high-yield farming where plenty of stalks, stems and other organic matter go back on the fields. He notes that plants can't even use organic nitrogen; they must wait until the N decomposes into its pure mineral form. Smil says </span><strong><u>a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> traditional </span><strong><u>19th century</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> European </span><strong><u>farm had to use half its land to produce nitrogen</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (clover, pasture grasses and field beans) </span><strong><u>for crop growth instead of food</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to feed people! </span><strong><u>Without chemical nitrogen,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Smil estimates </span><strong><u>our crops would need the manure from another 7</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">-8</span><strong><u>billion cattle.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (The world now has about 1.3 billion cattle.) Where would we grow the feed for those cattle?</span> <strong><u>It would</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> probably</span> <strong><u>take</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">at least two acres of forage land per animal, and some rangelands are so dry it takes 30 acres to feed one cow.The United States, a big agricultural producer and a heavy use of nitrogen fertilizer, would need to accept nearly one billion additional cattle. That means</span><strong><u>at least another two billion acres of U.S. land for forage crops</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Two billion acres</span> <strong><u>[which] is equal to all the land in America except Alaska</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, and Alaska can't support cattle anyway.</span><br />

<em><u>Despite the ease</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and potentially severe implications </span><u>of carrying out biological attacks against agriculture, to date only a handful</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of actual or threatened incidents </span><u>have occurred.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> If there are no real technological or psychological constraints to employing biological weapons against agriculture, why haven't terrorists made more use of this modus operandi, especially given its potential to cause significant economic, political and social upheaval? One reason could be that terrorists haven't thought through the full implications of deliberately targeting agricultural livestock and produce. According to this interpretation, it may only be a matter of time before more instances of this type of aggression take place. Another possibility may be that deliberate sabotage is traditionally not something health officials have actively looked for when investigating crop or animal disease outbreaks. The implication here is that more acts may have actually taken place than are known about. Animal and plant health officials in Washington concede this is a possibility, acknowledging that in most countries (including the USA) the tendency is to automatically assume that disease outbreaks are naturally occurring events. The inevitable consequence has been epidemiological investigations that seldom consider the possibility of deliberate pathogenic introduction. </span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Finally, it could be that </span><u>terrorists consider this form of aggression</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to be </span><strong><u>too 'dry'</u></strong> <u>in comparison to</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> traditional </span><u>bombing</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">s, in the sense that </span><u>attacks against</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> crops and </span><u>animals do not produce <strong>immediate, visible effects</strong>. The impact</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, while significant, </span><u>is delayed, lacking a single point for the <strong>media to focus on.</strong></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> As such, the fact that biological agro-terrorism has not emerged as more of a problem is perhaps understandable.</span></em><br />

<em><strong>3. Detection solves agroterror</strong></em><br />

<br />
<em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">While Mr. Nichols is free to differ,</span><u>the history of agriculture in this country is one of a safe and bountiful food supply</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. It is true that agriculture has become big business. But big business in the Midwest is small business here in West Virginia - 12,000 small businesses producing cattle that feed our nation and bring new dollars into our state. Our society has changed dramatically since I was a boy. Everybody lived on a farm back then. Today, few people live on farms, and large business conglomerates produce vast amounts of food in a highly efficient, and, yes, safe, manner. Today we have 24-hour supermarkets and fast-food restaurants that feed a vibrant and productive nation, even more so with the threat of agroterrorism.</span><u>As agriculture has grown and evolved, so too have government regulation and</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> institutionalized </span><u>attention to safety</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. The ban on downed cattle is a thing whose time has come - for health reasons, if nothing else - even though the large majority of downer animals will likely have only broken bones. Although there is always room for improvement in any system,</span><u>the early detection and rapid response of the US[DA]</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Department of Agriculture </span><u>to the bovine spongiform</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> encephalopathy</span><u>incident shows that the plan we have in place is an <strong>effective system</strong> for dealing with</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> animal</span><u>emergencies</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Granted, it would be easier for the mad cow investigators now if there were a national animal identification system in place. It is a measure I have advocated in the past. And it is likely to become a reality in the near future. There is always room for improvement. But the fact is, despite all the attention given to it, mad cow disease never really posed a human health threat. But it did show that America is vulnerable to foreign animal diseases, even ones it has successfully protected itself against for years. Disease surveillance needs to be a priority in this state and nation.</span></em><br />

<em><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">It may seem to many that we are living in a period in which there are potentially insurmountable problems facing us on every side. Certainly</span><u>the world is on the precipice of a population explosion</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">that we will be unable to sustain. The consumption of our natural resources and the destruction of our environment continue on a scale never imagined by the majority of us. However, nearly every generation of mankind has seen periods of hard times and some of us have experienced some very good times as well. The very nature of life on earth has been a history of turmoil and upheaval, from subsistence and mere survival to prosperity and a degree of security, and sometimes, back again. Don’t expect things to change for the better in the very near future regardless of our sophisticated economy. Consider the single aspect of food prices in the western world. Food has been relatively inexpensive in the western world, except in war-torn areas for the entire lifetime of our generation. This will probably not be the case for the next generation. It was only a few years ago that the population explosion was in the news all the time, almost to the same extent that we are currently preoccupied with the energy crunch usually referred to as “peak oil”, and the erosion of the western standard of living by “globalization”. The media let up on the problems of population growth because people got tired of hearing about it. After all, the western world didn’t appear to be particularly affected by it. The population explosion has since been generally ignored in the news until recently. That is not to infer that the problem went away. It took thousands of years of human history to produce and sustain a population of a billion people by the early nineteenth century. In the past 200 years, we have multiplied that population by six.</span><u>There are now over six billion people</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">in the world</span><u>and we will add the next billion</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">people</span><u>in only</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">about</span><u>a dozen years.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> With the advent of the industrial revolution, the western world became trade oriented over the last couple of centuries. Since the cold war has ended, our international companies have seized opportunities to sharply increase their profits by arbitraging the labor markets of Asia while selling products at home; sometimes referred to as globalization. This employment of large numbers of people has given impetus and acceleration to the already rising prosperity of a small percentage of the population in various parts of Asia. This small increase in prosperity affecting such large numbers of people has spawned a demand for resources and commodities around the world. Suddenly, a few people in the more populated parts of the world have the monetary wherewithal to improve their standard of living and have hopes for a better life for their children. They have needs of infrastructure, electricity and transportation as well as food. Now the western world finds itself competing for limited resources, especially energy. The most efficient forms of energy are oil and gas.</span><u>The owners of oil and gas</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">find themselves in an enviable position where they have an asset worthy of preservation. They</span><u>will</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> probably </span><u>never again allow the prices to fall very much</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">for any extended period of time.</span><u>The cost of energy and fertilizer</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (usually made from natural gas)</span><u>are substantial costs in food production, not to mention the cost of transporting that food.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The 2006 crops will be affected by the recent increase of prices in oil and gas. Expect food prices to accelerate their rise in the next year and continue to rise thereafter. </span><u>To exacerbate the problem, many farmers around the world can now make more money raising crops for bio-diesel fuels than they can make raising food.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Across South Asia, in the Amazon and elsewhere, farmers are razing the forests to plant crops capable of making biofuels. Even in this country, laws will be enacted to require some percentage of ethanol or the addition of some kind of bio-fuels to gasoline and diesel fuels to further subsidize and satisfy the farm lobby.</span></em><br />

The <strong>value</strong> is <strong>morality</strong>, as prescribed by the resolution.<br />
<br />
The <strong>criterion</strong> is <strong>maximizing preference satisfaction</strong> for 4 reasons.<br />
<br />
1. We all know that happiness is good simply from experience. Arguing otherwise would contradict our most basic moral beliefs.<br />
<br />
Professor of philosophy at NYU Thomas <u>Nagel 86</u> writes<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Beneficence/Existentialism%20AC.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">There is nothing self-contradictory inthis proposal </span><u>[the proposal that pleasure and pain have no value]</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, but it</span><u>seems</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> nevertheless</span> <u>insane</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Without some positive reason to think there is nothing in itself good or bad about having an experience you intensely like or dislike,</span><span style="color: #bfbfbf; font-size: 6pt;">we can't seriously regard the common impression to the contrary as a collective illusion.</span><u>Such things are at least good or bad for us, if anything is.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> What seems to be going on here is that</span><u>we cannot from an objective standpoint withhold</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a certain kind of </span><u>endorsement of the most direct and immediate subjective value judgments we make concerning the contents of our own consciousness. We regard ourselves as too close to those things to be mistaken</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in our immediate, nonideological evaluative impressions. </span><u>No objective view we can attain could possibly overrule our subjective authority in such cases.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> There can be no reason to reject the appearances here.</span><br />
<br />
2. Morality must take the form of a universal rule.<br />
<br />
Professor of philosophy at Princeton Peter <u>Singer 09</u><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Beneficence/Existentialism%20AC.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<u>When I prescribe [an action]</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> something, using moral language, my prescription</span><u>[it] commits me to a</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">substantive</span><u>moral judgment about all relevantly similar cases.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> This includes hypothetical cases in which I am in a different position from my actual one.</span><u>So to make a moral judgment, I must put myself</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in the position of the other person affected by my proposed action – or to be more precise,</span><u>in the position of <em>all</em> those affected</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> by my action.</span><u>Whether I can accept the judgment</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">– that is, whether I can prescribe it universally –</span><u>will</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> then </span><u>depend on whether I could accept</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> it if I had to</span><u>liv[ing] the lives of all those affected</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> by the action.</span><br />
<br />
The requirement of universalizability commits actors to maximizing preference fulfillment. <u>Singer 93</u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Beneficence/Existentialism%20AC.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">[3</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The universal aspect of ethics, I suggest, does provide a persuasive, although not conclusive, reason for taking a broadly utilitarian position. My reason for suggesting this is as follows.</span> <u>In accepting that</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> [since]</span> <u>ethical judgments must be</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> made from a </span><u>universal</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> point of view, </span><u>I am accepting that my own interests cannot</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, simply because they are my interests,</span> <u>count more than the interests of anyone else</u><u><span style="color: windowtext;">. Thus my</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> very natural</span> <u>concern that my own interests be looked after must</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, when I think ethically,</span> <u>be extended to</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">the interests of</span> <u>others.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Now, imagine that I am trying to decide between two possible courses of action - perhaps whether to eat all the fruits I have collected myself, or to share them with others. Imagine, too, that I am deciding in a complete ethical vacuum, that I know nothing of any ethical considerations - I am, we might say, in a pre-ethical stage of thinking. How would I make up my mind? One thing that would be still relevant would be how the possible courses of action will affect my interests. Indeed, if we define 'interests' broadly enough, so that we count anything people desire as in their interests (unless it is incompatible with another desire or desires), then it would seem that at this pre-ethical stage, only one's own interests can be relevant to the decision. Suppose I then begin to think ethically, to the extent of recognizing that my own interests cannot count for more, simply because they are my own, than the interests of others. In place of my own interests, I now have to take into account the interests of all those affected by my decision.</span> <u>This requires me to weigh</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> up</span> <u>all</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> these</span> <u>interests and adopt the course of action most likely to maximize the interests of those affected.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Thus at least at some level in my moral reasoning I must choose the course of action that has the best consequences, on balance, for all affected. </span><br />
3. There is no distinction between acts and omissions. We are equally accountable for both.<br />

Thus, just as all persons have the right to informed control, so far as possible, over the conditions relevant to their incurring cancer and other serious harms, so the causal and moral responsibility for inflicting cancer can be attributed to persons who have informed control over other persons’ suffering the lethal harms of cancer.</span><br />

4. Neuroimaging shows that utilitarianism is the most rational moral theory. Other moral intuitions arise as a result of emotional bias.<br />
<br />
Professor Joshua<u>Greene 07 of Harvard</u> writes<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Past%20Years/Beneficence/Existentialism%20AC.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">[5</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">To summarize, people’s moral judgments appear to be products of at least two different kinds of psychological processes. First, both</span><u>brain imaging and reaction-time data suggest</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">that there are prepotent negative</span><u>emotion[s]</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">al responses that</span><u>drive people to</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">disapprove of the personally harmful actions proposed in cases like the footbridge and crying baby dilemmas. These responses are characteristic of</span><u>deontology</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">but not of consequentialism. Second, further brain imaging results suggest that “cognitive” psychological processes can compete with the aforementioned emotional processes, driving people to approve of personally harmful moral violations, primarily when there is a strong consequentialist rationale for doing so, as in the crying baby case.</span><u>The [active] parts of the brain</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">that exhibit increased activity</span><u>when people make</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">characteristically</span><u>consequentialist judgments are those</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">that are</span><u>most closely associated with higher cognitive functions such as executive control</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (Koechlin et al., 2003; Miller and Cohen, 2001),</span><u>complex planning</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> ( Koechlin, Basso, Pietrini, Panzer, &amp; Grafman, 1999), deductive</span><u>and</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> inductive</span><u>reasoning</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (Goel &amp; Dolan, 2004), taking the long view in economic decision making (McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein, &amp; Cohen., 2004), and so on. Moreover, these brain regions are among those most dramatically expanded in humans compared with other primates (Allman, Hakeem, &amp; Watson, 2002).</span><br />

<u>Contention 1 is Poverty</u><br />
<br />
In the status quo, the third world is subject to dire conditions due to poverty.<br />
<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">McNamara has summed up</span> <u>absolute poverty [is]</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">as 'a condition of life so</span> <u>characterised by malnutrition, illiteracy, disease,</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">squalid surroundings, high infant mortality</span> <u>and low life expectancy</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> as to be beneath any reasonable definition of human decency'</span>. <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Absolute </span><u>poverty is</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, as McNamara has said,</span><u>responsible for</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">the</span><u>loss of countless lives, especially</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">among</span> <u>infants and</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">young</span> <u>children.</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">When absolute poverty does not cause death, it </span><span style="color: #bfbfbf; font-size: 6pt;">still causes misery of a kind not often seen in the affluent nations. Malnutrition in young children stunts both physical and mental development. According to the United Nations Development Programme, 180 million children under the age of five suffer from serious malnutrition. Millions of people on poor diets suffer from deficiency diseases, like goitre, or blindness caused by a lack of vitamin A. The food value</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of what the poor eat is further reduced by parasites such as hookworm and ringworm, which are endemic in conditions of poor sanitation and health education.</span><u>Death and disease apart,</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> absolute</span> <u>poverty remains a miserable condition of life, with inadequate food, shelter,</u><span style="color: #bfbfbf; font-size: 6pt;"> clothing, sanitation, health services</span> <u>and education.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The Worldwatch Institute estimates that as many as 1.2 billion people - or 23 per cent of the world's population - live in absolute poverty. For the purposes of this estimate, absolute poverty is defined as &quot;the lack of sufficient income in cash or kind to meet the most basic biological needs for food, clothing, and shelter.&quot; Absolute</span> <u>poverty is</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> probably</span> <u>the principal cause of human misery today.</u><br />
<br />
The cyclical harms of poverty massively outweigh any harm to charity. Even the poorest Americans could afford to donate at little comparative expense to themselves.<br />
<br />
Peter <u>Singer 09</u> continues<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Individuals/Existentialism%20AC.docx#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">[7</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In wealthy societies, most poverty is relative. People feel poor because many of the good things they see advertised on television are beyond their budget—but they do have a television.</span> <u>In the U</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited</span> <u>S</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates,</span> <u>97 percent of those classified</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">by the Census Bureau</span><u>as poor own a color TV. Three quarters</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of them</span> <u>own a car</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Three quarters of them</span> <u>[and] have air-conditioning.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Three quarters of them have a VCR or DVD player. All have access to health care. I am not quoting these figures in order to deny that the poor in the United States face genuine difficulties. Nevertheless, for most, [but] these difficulties are of a different order than those of the world’s poorest people.</span><u>The 1.4 billion</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">people living</span> <u>in extreme poverty</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> are poor by an absolute standard tied to the most basic human needs. They</span><u>are likely</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">to be</span><u>hungry for</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">at least</span> <u>part of each year.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Even if they can get enough food to fill their stomachs, they will probably be malnourished because their diet lacks essential nutrients. In children, malnutrition stunts growth and can cause permanent brain damage. The poor may not be able to afford to send their children to school. Even minimal health care services are usually beyond their means.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">If you’re shaking your head at the excesses of the superrich, though, don’t shake too hard. Think again about some of the ways Americans with average incomes spend their money. In most places in the United States, you can get your recommended eight glasses of water a day out of the tap for less than a penny, while a bottle of water will set you back $1.50 or more. And in spite of the environmental concerns raised by the waste of energy that goes into producing and transporting it, Americans are still buying bottled water, to the tune of more than 31 billion liters in 2006. Think, too, of the way many of us get our caffeine fix: You can make coffee at home for pennies rather than spending three dollars or more on a latte. Or have you ever casually said yes to a waiter’s prompt to order a second soda or glass of wine that you didn’t even finish? When Dr. Timothy Jones, an archaeologist, led a U.S. government–funded study of food waste, he found that 14 percent of household garbage is perfectly good food that was in its original packaging and not out of date. More than half of this food was dry-packaged or canned goods that keep for a long time. According to Jones, $100 billion of food is wasted in the United States every year.14 Fashion designer Deborah Lindquist claims that</span> <u>the average woman owns more than $600 worth of clothing that she has not worn in the last year.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Whatever the actual figure may be, it is fair to say that almost all of us, men and women alike, buy things we don’t need, some of which we never even use.</span> <u>Most</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of us are absolutely certain that we</span> <u>wouldn’t hesitate to save a drowning child</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, and that we would do it at considerable cost to ourselves.</span> <u>Yet while thousands of children die each day, we spend money on things we take for granted and would hardly notice if they were not there</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Is that wrong? If so, how far does our obligation to the poor go?</span><br />

<span style="color: #bfbfbf; font-size: 6pt;">Last week's brutal suicide bombings in Baghdad and Jerusalem have once again illustrated dramatically that</span><u>the international community failed</u><span style="color: #bfbfbf; font-size: 6pt;">, thus far at least,</span><u>to understand the magnitude</u><span style="color: #bfbfbf; font-size: 6pt;"> and implications</span><u>of</u><span style="color: #bfbfbf; font-size: 6pt;"> the</span><u>terrorist threats to the very survival of civilization itself.</u><span style="color: #bfbfbf; font-size: 6pt;"> Even the United States and Israel have for decades tended to regard terrorism as a mere tactical nuisance or irritant rather than a critical strategic challenge to their national security concerns. It is not surprising, therefore, that on September 11, 2001, Americans were stunned by the unprecedented tragedy of 19 al Qaeda terrorists striking a devastating blow at the center of the nation's commercial and military powers. Likewise, Israel and its citizens, despite the collapse of the Oslo Agreements of 1993 and numerous acts of terrorism triggered by the second intifada that began almost three years ago, are still &quot;shocked&quot; by each suicide attack at a time of intensive diplomatic efforts to revive the moribund peace process through the now revoked cease-fire arrangements [hudna]. Why are the United States and Israel, as well as scores of other countries affected by the universal nightmare of modern terrorism surprised by new terrorist &quot;surprises&quot;? There are many reasons, including misunderstanding of the manifold specific factors that contribute to terrorism's expansion, such as lack of a universal definition of terrorism, the religionization of politics, double standards of morality, weak punishment of terrorists, and the exploitation of the media by terrorist propaganda and psychological warfare.Unlike their historical counterparts,</span> <u>contemporary terrorists have introduced a new scale of violence</u><span style="color: #bfbfbf; font-size: 6pt;"> in terms of conventional and unconventional threats and impact.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">It is a considerable comfort and undoubtedly a key to our survival that, so far, the main lines of defense against this threat have not depended on explicit policies or organized efforts. In the long course of evolution, the human body has developed physical barriers and a biochemical immune system whose sophistication and effectiveness exceed anything we could design or as yet even fully understand. But evolution is a sword that cuts both ways:</span> <u>New diseases emerge, while old diseases mutate and adapt.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Throughout history,</span><u>there have been epidemics during which human immunity has broken down on an epic scale</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. An infectious agent believed to have been the plague bacterium killed an estimated 20 million people over a four-year period in the fourteenth century, including nearly one-quarter of Western Europe's population at the time. </span><u>Since</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> its recognized appearance in </span><u>1981,</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> some 20 variations of </span><u>the HIV virus ha[s] infected</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> an estimated </span><u>29</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">.4 </span><u>million worldwide, with 1.5 million</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> people currently </span><u>dying of AIDS each year. Malaria, tuberculosis, and cholera</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> - once thought to be under control - </span><u>are now making a comeback. As we enter the twenty-first century, changing conditions have enhanced the potential for widespread contagion.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The rapid growth rate of the total world population, the unprecedented freedom of movement across international borders, and scientific advances that expand the capability for the deliberate manipulation of pathogens are all cause for worry that the problem might be greater in the future than it has ever been in the past.</span> <u>The threat of</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> infectious </span><u>pathogens is not just an issue of public health, but a</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> fundamental </span><u>security problem for the species as a whole.</u><br />

<u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">The argument from relativity has as its premises the well-known variation of moral codes from one society to another and from one period to another,</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> and also the differences between different groups and classes within a complex community. Such variation is in itself merely a truth of descriptive morality, a fact of anthropology which entails neither first order nor second order ethical views. Yet it may indirectly support subjectivism: </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">radical differences between</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> first order </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">moral judgments make it difficult to treat those judgments as apprehensions of objective truths…</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">In short, the argument from relativity has some force simply because </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">the</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">actual </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">variations in</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">the </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">moral codes are more readily </span></u><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">explained by</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> the hypothesis that they reflect </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">different ways of life than by</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> the hypothesis that they express </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">perceptions</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">, most of them seriously inadequate and badly distorted, </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">of objective values. </span></u><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Therefore, morality cannot be grounded in any objective sense of right and wrong. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">This creates a dilemma because any moral system not grounded in moral truths would seem to be arbitrary and give persons no reason to adhere to it. Only self-interested contractarianism escapes this dilemma: we follow moral rules because it is in our mutual self-interest to do so. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">David <u>Gauthier</u> explains<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Individuals/Mactrax%20NC.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">[3</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Morals by agreement begin from an initial presumption against morality, as a constraint on each person's pursuit of his own interest. </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">A person</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> is conceived as an independent centre of activity, endeavoring to direct his capacities and resources to the fulfillment of his interests. He considers what he can do, but </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">initially d</span></u><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">raws no distinction between what he may and may not do.</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> How then does he come to acknowledge the distinction? How does a person come to recognize a moral dimension to choice, if morality is not initially present? Morals by agreement offer a contractarian rationale for distinguishing what one may and may not do. </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Moral principles are introduced as the objects of </span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">fully </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">voluntary</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> ex ante </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">agreement among rational persons.</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Such agreement is hypothetical, in supposing a pre-moral context for the adoption of moral rules and practices. But the parties to agreement are real, determinate individuals, distinguished by their capacities, situations, and concerns. </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">In so far as they would agree to constraints on their choices</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">, restraining their pursuit of their own interests, </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">they acknowledge a distinction between what they may and may not do.</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">As rational persons understanding the structure of their interaction, </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">they recognize a place for mutual constraint, and so for a moral dimension in their affairs.</span></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> That there is a contractarian rationale for morality must of course be shown. That is the task of our theory. Here our immediate concern is to relate the idea of such a rationale to the introduction of fundamental moral distinctions. This is not a magical process. Morality does not emerge as the rabbit from the empty hat. Rather, as we shall argue, it emerges quite simply from the application of the maximizing conception of rationality to certain structures of interaction: Agreed mutual constraint is the rational response to these structures. Reason overrides the presumption against morality. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Therefore, the <strong>criterion</strong> is <strong>adhering to mutually self-interested agreements</strong>.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">I contend that self-interested contractors would not agree to an obligation to assist people in need.</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">This aspect of our moral views can seem very puzzling, especially if one supposes that moral feelings derive from sympathy and concern for others.

In other worlds, although everyone could agree to a strong principle concerning the avoidance of harm, it would not be true that everyone would favor an equally strong principle of mutual aid. It is likely that only a weaker principle of the latter sort would gain general acceptance. So the hypothesis that morality derives from an understanding among people of different powers and resources can explain (and, according to me, does explain) why in our morality avoiding harm to others is taken to be more important than helping those who need help.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Second</span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">, a moral obligation to assistance would be over-demanding as it would entail sacrificing all of one’s surplus time and money to helping others, leaving no time for self-fulfillment. Thus, while some might voluntarily donate in certain instances, no one would consent to an obligation to help others generally.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Third</span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">, even the poor wouldn’t consent to a general principle of assistance because assisting those in need fosters dependency which creates a cycle of poverty.</span><br />

The counter-plan is mutually exclusive with the aff because every unit of time or money spent on space trades off with helping the needy.<br />
<br />
It’s also net beneficial.<br />

Space colonization would solve every major existential risk. <u>Baum 09</u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Individuals/Colonization%20CP.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">“Another non-market benefit of space exploration is reduction in the risk of the extinction of humanity and other Earth-originating life.</span> <u>Without space colonization, the survival of humanity</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and other Earth-originating life</span> <u>becomes extremely difficult</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">- perhaps impossible-</span> <u>over the very long-term</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. This is</span> <u>because the Sun</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, like all stars,</span> <u>changes</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in its composition and </span><u>radiative output over time</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. The Sun is gradually converting hydrogen into helium, thereby getting warmer. In approximately 500 million to one billion years, this warming is projected to render Earth uninhabitable to life as we know it [25–26]. Humanity, if it still exists on Earth then, could conceivably develop technology by then to survive on Earth despite these radical conditions. Such technology may descend from present proposals to “geoengineer” the planet in response to anthropogenic climate change [27–28].3 However, the Sun later- approximately seven billion years later- loses mass that spreads into Earth’s orbit, causing Earth to slow, be pulled into the Sun, and evaporate. The only way life could survive on Earth may be if Earth, by sheer coincidence (the odds are on the order of one in 105 to one in 106 [29]) happens to be pulled out of the solar system by a star system that passes by. This process might enable life to survive on Earth much longer, although the chance of this is quite remote.While space</span> <u>colonization</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">would provide a hedge against these very long-term astrological threats, it</span> <u>would also</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> provide a </span><u>hedge against</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><u>more immediate threats</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that face humanity and other species. These threats</span> <u>includ[ing] nuclear war</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">fare,</span> <u>pandemics</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, anthropogenic</span> <u>climate change, and disruptive technology</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">[30].</span> <u>Because these threats</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> would generally </span><u>only affect life on Earth</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and not life elsewhere, self-sufficient</span> <u>space colonies would survive</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> these catastrophes, enabling life to persist in the universe. For this reason, space colonization has been advocated as a means of ensuring long-term human survival [32–33]. Space exploration projects can help increase the probability of long-term human survival in other ways as well: technology developed for space exploration is central to proposals to avoid threats from large comet and asteroid impacts [34–35].”</span><br />

Existential risk outweighs every other impact by orders of magnitude because of the lost potential for future generations.

The <strong><u>value is morality</u></strong> as implied by the resolution.<br />
<br />
Morality must take the form of a universal rule.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #999999; font-size: 6pt;">Professor of philosophy at Princeton Peter</span> <strong><u>Singer 09</u></strong> writes<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Aff/Cases/Pyre%20AC.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]<br />
<br />
<strong><u>When I prescribe [an action]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> something, using moral language, my prescription </span><strong><u>[it] commits me to a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> substantive </span><strong><u>moral judgment about all</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> relevantly </span><strong><u>similar cases. This includes hypothetical cases in which I am in a different position from my actual one. So to make a moral judgment, I must put myself</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in the position of the other person affected by my proposed action – or to be more precise, </span><strong><u>in the position of <em>all</em> those affected</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> by my action. Whether I can accept the judgment – that is, whether I can prescribe it universally – will then depend on whether I could accept it if I had to live the lives of all those affected by the action.</span><br />
<br />
Universalizability justifies util.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #999999; font-size: 6pt;">Peter</span> <strong><u>Singer 93</u></strong> continues<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Aff/Cases/Pyre%20AC.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The universal aspect of ethics, I suggest, does provide a persuasive, although not conclusive, reason for taking a broadly utilitarian position. My reason for suggesting this is as follows. </span><strong><u>In accepting that ethical judgments must be</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> made from a </span><strong><u>universal</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> point of view, </span><strong><u>I am accepting that my own interests cannot,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> simply because they are my interests, </span><strong><u>count more than the interests of anyone else. Thus my</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">very natural </span><strong><u>concern that my own interests be looked after must</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, when I think ethically, </span><strong><u>be extended to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the interests of </span><strong><u>others.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Now, imagine that I am trying to decide between two possible courses of action - perhaps whether to eat all the fruits I have collected myself, or to share them with others. Imagine, too, that I am deciding in a complete ethical vacuum, that I know nothing of any ethical considerations - I am, we might say, in a pre-ethical stage of thinking. How would I make up my mind? One thing that would be still relevant would be how the possible courses of action will affect my interests. Indeed, if we define 'interests' broadly enough, so that we count anything people desire as in their interests (unless it is incompatible with another desire or desires), then it would seem that at this pre-ethical stage, only one's own interests can be relevant to the decision. Suppose I then begin to think ethically, to the extent of recognizing that my own interests cannot count for more, simply because they are my own, than the interests of others. In place of my own interests, I now have to take into account the interests of all those affected by my decision. </span><strong><u>This requires me to weigh</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">up </span><strong><u>all</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">these </span><strong><u>interests and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> adopt the course of action most likely to </span><strong><u>maximize the interests of those affected.</u></strong><br />
<br />
Therefore the <strong>criterion</strong> is <strong>maximizing utility</strong>. Also, conflicting side-constraints would paralyze state action, so states must use util to weigh deontological violations.<br />
<br />

<br />
Plans are good for education because:<br />
<br />
(a) Plans increase depth of education because we can focus on one specific issue each round instead of touching briefly on each aspect of the topic.<br />
<br />
Depth is better than breadth. If we go in-depth on a <em>different</em> issue each round, then we’ll get a breadth of info any way, but if we spread ourselves thin discussing a breadth of issues each round, we’ll never have an in-depth discussion of the topic.<br />
<br />
(b) Broad interpretations are key to incentivize continued research. If the same stock arguments are going to apply every round, there’s no incentive to do new work.<br />
<br />

<br />
Piracy drains the global economy – 5 warrants. <strong><u>Halliburton 2010</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Aff/Cases/Pyre%20AC.docx#_ftn8" rel="nofollow">[8</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Despite its relatively small human impact, </span><strong><u>piracy exacts a significant economic toll.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The economic cost of piracy can be divided into the following categories: ransom payments, increased insurance premiums, indirect economic costs, the cost of deploying naval forces to the area, and, in a more recent trend, the cost of providing armed security teams aboard ships. </span><strong><u>[First,] Ransoms</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Because insurers and shippers typically do not disclose the amounts of ransom payments, or even the fact of their payment, it is only possible to give rough estimates. The most widely-cited </span><strong><u>estimates of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> aggregate </span><strong><u>ransom payments</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to Somali pirates </span><strong><u>are $60</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">–80 </span><strong><u>million in 2008 and $150 million in 2009.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The available evidence tends to indicate a trend toward more sophisticated operations resulting in seizures of larger, more valuable ships, with larger ransom demands and payments per ship.</span><br />
<strong><u>[Second,] Avoidance</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Most of the ships attacked by Somali pirates are commercial shipping vessels sailing between continents. The only way to assure avoiding piracy in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean is to avoid those areas entirely—usually by re-routing ships around the Cape of Good Hope instead of through the Suez Canal. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration estimates that </span><strong><u>diverting one tanker’s normal route</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> between Saudi Arabia and the United States around the Cape of Good Hope</span> <strong><u>would add $3.5 million per year in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> additional </span><strong><u>fuel costs while cutting</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> its delivery </span><strong><u>capacity by 26%.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>[Third,] Insurance</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In 2008 alone, the cost of additional war-risk insurance for a ship’s passage through the Gulf of Aden rose from $500 to $20,000 per trip. Applied to the 21,000 ships transiting the Gulf annually, </span><strong><u>the total annual cost to insure these ships could be</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> as high as </span><strong><u>$400 million.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> To the extent this represents a new revenue source for insurers and is greater than their overall payouts, insurers may prefer the status quo to stronger anti-piracy measures. One would therefore expect demands for stronger protection to come from the shippers themselves, as has mostly been the case. Indirect Economic Costs Piracy imposes other indirect economic costs. For example, whenever a ship avoids the Gulf of Aden by re-routing around the Cape of Good Hope, Egypt loses out on revenue from the Suez Canal, the second-most central port in the global shipping network. </span><br />
<strong><u>[Fourth,]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Unarmed </span><strong><u>Defensive Measures</u></strong><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In 2009, the IMO promulgated a set of “best management practices” for avoiding and repelling pirate attacks. The recommendations include coordinating transits with military vessels in the area, pressurizing fire hoses with which to hit attacking pirates, and posting more lookouts. Other defensive measures include “greasing or electrifying of hand rails and the installation of barbed wire in vulnerable parts of ships.” More sophisticated equipment has also been employed with mixed success. One non-lethal device, the long-rage acoustical device (“LRAD”)—which sells for over $20,000—emits directionally-focused and painfully-loud sound as one way to deter approach by potential attackers. However, after a few initial successes against pirates, the LRAD has since proven ineffective. After using an LRAD to no effect, one British security guard said, “We thought it would make the pirates back off, but they just laughed. It was a total waste of time.” Another as-yet unproven non-lethal measure on the market is a set of polypropylene rope nets called Propeller Arresters, which are even more expensive than the LRAD. The company marketing the system claims that a set of Propeller Arrestors, laid out around a ship’s perimeter, will tangle the propellers of approaching boats to stop and deter pirate attacks. In sum, although there are several documented instances of non-lethal defenses stopping pirate attacks, Somali pirates have proven to be determined adversaries capable of overcoming any such defenses employed thus far. Armed Security Recently, shippers have begun to place armed guards aboard vessels transiting the Gulf of Aden and western Indian Ocean. In some instances, shipping companies contract with private security companies to provide such guards. Some states have also provided military personnel to protect ships sailing under their flags. For example, France—which has taken an aggressive stance against piracy generally—has provided teams of marines to French fishing vessels. </span><strong><u>Hiring private</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">armed </span><strong><u>guards costs</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> approximately </span><strong><u>$40,000</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">–$60,000 </span><strong><u>per voyage.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The cost of providing armed security is substantial, and, when combined with the simultaneous increase in insurance premiums, imposes a substantial burden on ship owners. </span><strong><u>[Fifth,] Military Response</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>The European Union’s</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> high-profile </span><strong><u>combined naval operation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, EU NAVFOR (also called Atalanta), had a budget of €8.3 million for 2009, its first year. However, this figure does not include any of the costs of the military personnel and equipment used, which are borne individually by the contributing states. Taking those costs into account, one analyst estimates the total </span><strong><u>cost</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of the European operation at </span><strong><u>upwards of $300 million for one year.</u></strong><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">For nearly two decades, </span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics/government/national-government/united-states-ORGOV0000001.topic" rel="nofollow">the U.S.</a></span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> has been viewed as a global hegemon—vastly more powerful than any major country in the world. Since 2000, however, our global dominance has fallen dramatically. During the Bush administration, the self-inflicted wounds of the Iraq war, growing government debt, increasingly negative current account balances and other internal</span><strong><u>economic weaknesses cost the U.S.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">real</span><strong><u>power</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">in a world of rapidly spreading knowledge and technology</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6;">. </span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Simply put, the main legacy of the Bush years has been to leave the U.S. as a declining power. From Rome to the United States today, the rise and fall of great nations have been driven primarily by economic strength. At any given moment,</span> <strong><u>a state's power depends on the size and quality of its military</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">forces and other power</span> <strong><u>assets. Over time</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, however,</span> <strong><u>power is a result of economic strength—the prerequisite for building and modernizing military forces. And so the size of the economy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">relative to potential rivals</span> <strong><u>ultimately determines the limits of power in international politics.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The power position of the U.S. is crucial to the foreign policy aims that it can achieve. Since the Cold War, America has maintained a vast array of overseas commitments, seeking to ensure peace and stability not just in its own neighborhood, the Western hemisphere, but also in Europe, Asia and the oil-rich Persian Gulf. Maintaining these commitments requires enormous resources, but American leaders in recent years chose to pursue far more ambitious goals than merely maintaining the status quo. </span><br />

U.S. primacy solves war. <strong><u>Walt 02</u></strong> writes<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Aff/Cases/Pyre%20AC.docx#_ftn12" rel="nofollow">[12</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">A second consequence of</span> <strong><u>U.S. primacy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">is a decreased danger of great-power rivalry and a higher level of overall international tranquility. Ironically, those who argue that primacy is no longer important, because the danger of war is slight, overlook the fact that the extent of American primacy</span> <strong><u>is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">one of the main reasons</span> <strong><u>why the risk of great-power war is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">as</span> <strong><u>low</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">as it is</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6;">. </span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Formost of the past four centuries, relations among the major powers have been intensely competitive, often punctuated by major wars and occasionally by all-out struggles for hegemony. In the first half of the twentieth century, for example, great-power wars killed over eighty million people. Today, however, the dominant position of the United States places significant limits on the possibility of great-power competition, for at least two reasons. One reason is that</span><strong><u>because the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited</span> <strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates</span> <strong><u>is</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">currently</span> <strong><u>so far ahead</u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span></u></strong><strong><u>other major powers are not inclined to challenge it</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">sdominant position. Not only is there no possibility of a “hegemonic war” (because there is no potential hegemon to mount a challenge), but the risk of war via miscalculation is reduced by the overwhelming gap between the United States and the other major powers. Miscalculation is more likely to lead to war when the balance of power is fairly even, because in this situation both sides can convince themselves that they might be able to win. When the balance of power is heavily skewed, however,the leading state does not need to go to war and weaker states dare not try. The second reason is thatthe continued deployment of roughly two hundred thousand troops in Europe and in Asia provides a further barrier to conflict in each region.</span> <strong><u>[And,] So long as U.S. troops are committed abroad, regional powers know that launching a war is likely to lead to a confrontation with the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited</span> <strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tate</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">s</span><strong><u>.</u></strong><strong><u>Thus, states</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">within these regions</span> <strong><u>do not worry as much about each other, because</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">the</span> <strong><u>U.S. presence</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">effectively</span><strong><u>prevents regional conflicts from breaking out.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">What Joseph Joffe has termed the “American pacifier” is not the only barrier to conflict in Europe and Asia, but it is an important one. This tranquilizing effect is not lost on America’s allies in Europe and Asia. They resent U.S. dominance and dislike playing host to American troops, but they also do not want “Uncle Sam” to leave. Thus, U.S. primacy is of benefit to the United States, and to other countries as well, because it dampens the overall level of international insecurity. World politics might be more interesting if the United States were weaker and if other states were forced to compete with each other more actively, but a more exciting world is not necessarily a better one.</span><br />

<strong><u>The scale and sophistication of Somali pirate operations</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">—often involving extended voyages, multiple fast boats deployed from larger “motherships,” and an organized investment market—</span><strong><u>show that today’s pirates are</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> sophisticated and </span><strong><u>rational economic actors.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Fundamentally, deterring maritime piracy boils down to altering pirates’ risk-reward assessments. Unfortunately, </span><strong><u>pirates’ hostages serve dual purposes: they are both bargaining chips</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> for ransom negotiations </span><strong><u>and human shields</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> used to dissuade attempts to recover ships by force. </span><strong><u>The presence of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> innocent </span><strong><u>hostages makes retaking a hijacked vessel</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> by force </span><strong><u>infeasible</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in most circumstances, although it has been done successfully in a small number of instances. French forces, for example, have staged at least three rescues; one resulted in the death of a hostage. </span><strong><u>Hostages are</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> indeed </span><strong><u>pirates’ most powerful bargaining chips, which allow them to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> negotiate and </span><strong><u>obtain large ransom payments with little threat of reprisal. Therefore, reducing the expected reward for hijacking a ship is essentially impossible.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Because of this threat to innocent human life, </span><strong><u>counter-piracy strategy should focus on increasing the risk to pirates outside the context of any ongoing hijacking</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or ransom negotiation: any effective </span><strong><u>action against pirates must be proactive, not reactive.</u></strong><br />

Prosecution fails. <strong><u>Gopalan 10</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Aff/Cases/Pyre%20AC.docx#_ftn20" rel="nofollow">[20</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">On paper, there are adequate legal tools to tackle piracy. Conceptualized as a crime against the &quot;law of nations,&quot; there is universal jurisdiction over piratical acts. Accordingly, all states enjoy jurisdictional competence to adjudicate upon individuals accused of piracy, regardless of their nationality or where on the high seas the alleged crimes took place. Despite this legal mandate, states have not shown a willingness to prosecute pirates. The typical response was a policy of catch-and-release, and navies were reduced to ferrying captured pirates to the beach. The best example of this phenomenon was the Dec. 18 release—after giving them food and water—of 13 Somali pirates captured after a failed attack on the ship MV BBC Togo by the Dutch warship Eversten. European </span><strong><u>states are afraid of bringing Somali pirates to trial</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on their territory, </span><strong><u>largely based on</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> imaginary </span><strong><u>fears about the misuse of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> their</span> <strong><u>human-rights laws</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> by pirates and their lawyers. To dodge this phantom menace, the U.K. entered into a secret agreement with the Kenyan government to prosecute captured pirates in Kenya. The EU concluded a similar agreement with the Kenyans in March 2009, with much celebration about Kenya guaranteeing human-rights protections to pirates. These agreements do not seem to be working, based on the MV BBC Togo incident—the EU instructed the Dutch authorities to release the Somalis after the Kenyan government refused to prosecute them. Why should Kenya do Europe's dirty work? Apart from having other national priorities, piracy might be to Kenya's benefit. There are reports that Somali </span><strong><u>pirates are investing heavily in Kenya's economy—</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">house prices have gone up two- to threefold in the past few years, and Nairobi's Little Mogadishu neighborhood is thriving with the new found fortunes of its Somali denizens. </span><strong><u>Such an infusion of capital into a poor country will inevitably create incentives for the Kenyan government to go soft on international promises to prosecute</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Aside from asymmetric incentives, simply dumping pirates in Kenya and relying on that country's justice system to deal with them effectively is foolish. Kenya's courts face a backlog of over 800,000 cases, and suspects languish in jail for more than a year before they are brought before a judge. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">International military efforts off the coast of Somalia focus on deterring piracy through a strong military presence protecting designated shipping lanes. </span><strong><u>Despite</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the impressive array of international cooperation and </span><strong><u>naval firepower, pirate attacks</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in the region </span><strong><u>have simply shifted outward into the Indian Ocean and beyond the easy reach of international patrols. Deterrence is further hampered by the frequent failure to prosecute those pirates who are captured by naval forces</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">—a policy derided as “catch and release.” States have advanced several justifications for their refusals to prosecute suspected pirates, including cost and fears that pirates will claim asylum once released. Most of the pirates now facing prosecution were turned over to Kenyan authorities, who have since refused to take any more cases. Piracy has not subsided since the multinational armada arrived on the scene, and insignificantly few pirates have been brought to justice. Despite the hundreds of millions of dollars the international community has spent to fight them, pirates still have little to fear. The international community’s current approach has failed to create sufficient risk to deter pirates.</span><br />

<br />
<strong><u>Somalia’s ruined economy presents few compelling alternatives to piracy.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Most of the country’s economy is based on agriculture and remittances from abroad, and</span> <strong><u>its per-capita GDP is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> estimated at </span><strong><u>$600</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">—the fifth-lowest in the world. </span><strong><u>In contrast,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> one conservative analysis estimates </span><strong><u>an average</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> individual </span><strong><u>pirate could expect to earn $15,000 for a year’s work.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Lucky participants in a multi-million dollar ransom stand to earn far more.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">One justification pirates often claim for their actions is to expel foreign fishing vessels operating illegally in Somali waters. At one point, such poaching was a serious problem, and overfishing by foreign vessels led to a significant depletion of certain fish stocks. Today, although piracy has largely driven foreign fishing vessels away from Somalia and deep into the Indian Ocean, pirates have continued to ply their new trade instead of returning to fishing—presumably because it is far more lucrative.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Some authors advocate co-opting pirates into a legitimate coast guard under TFG auspices. However, given the TFG pays its nascent coast guard recruits under $750 per year,</span> <strong><u>few pirates</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> are likely to </span><strong><u>opt for a government job when they stand to earn twenty times that salary as pirates.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> “High profits with low costs and little risk of consequences in a failed and starving State ensure that Somali pirate groups have almost unlimited human resources and do not lack for recruits and support.”</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In addition to these legal authorizations for the legitimate use of lethal force,</span> <strong><u>the U.S.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> also </span><strong><u>needs to extend the successful targeted killing policy that is being used in Afghanistan and Pakistan, to Somalia</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and Yemen. Under this policy, expanded recently by the Obama administration, targeted strikes are conducted by drones and missiles against al Qaeda and Taliban leaders. They are permissible under international law. The targeted killing strategy must be used to hit pirates in Somalia—when they set off from Somali shores to hijack ships, and more easily when they return with ransom money. This is the only way forward. It is regrettable that</span> <strong><u>the failure of the legal system</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to bring pirates to justice effectively </span><strong><u>has created a perverse incentive to kill rather than prosecute.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Until Somalia has a legal system capable of convicting pirates, </span><strong><u>killing them is the only option.</u></strong><br />

 Counter-interpretation: Aff can defend any subset of targeted killing with multiple qualified solvency advocates.<br />
<br />
First, the defense.<br />
<br />
1. The fact that I have solvency advocates for the plan means there’s no predictability or ground loss because neg ground exists in literature if he’d do the research.<br />
<br />
2. Neg flex solves predictability loss because he can adapt in the NC.<br />
<br />
3. Philosophy ground solves predictability and ground loss. If he isn’t prepared to debate about pirates, he could challenge the aff on a philosophical level instead.<br />
<br />
Next, the offense.<br />
<br />
1. <strong>Side Bias</strong> – plans are key to check neg side bias because they give the aff strategic choice in framing the topic which checks back neg flexibility and longer speech times. Also, this means I control uniqueness on the fairness debate because the neg already has a massive side bias in the status quo, so even if the aff skews ground that only serves to even the playing field.<br />
<br />
2. <strong>Ground</strong> – Plans are key to breadth of aff ground because the topic is otherwise incredibly narrow and essentially the only aff advantage is terrorism. He over-limits the topic which allows the neg to exploit the timeskew by prepping out the few stock affs that his interp allows for.<br />
<br />
3. Cross-apply the 2 reasons aff gets plans in the AC. Plans are key to <strong>education</strong> because (<strong>a</strong>) the topic would be too shallow otherwise, and (<strong>b</strong>) broad interps incentivize continued research instead of falling back onto stock arguments.<br />
<br />
Education outweighs fairness:<br />
<br />
1. it’s the only impact with long-term, <strong>out-of-round</strong> implications. Fairness only matters until you sign your ballot.<br />
<br />
2. Education is more easily <strong>quantifiable</strong> whereas fairness is contingent on subjective preferences of what “better debating” means and external constraints such as resource disparities and side-bias.<br />
<br />

 States have a unique moral obligation to their citizens. Hans <strong><u>Morgenthau</u></strong> argues<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Aff/Cases/Demo%20AC.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Realism maintains that universal moral principles cannot be applied to the actions of states in their abstract universal formulation, but that they must be filtered through the concrete circumstances of time and place. </span><strong><u>The individual may say for himself</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> “Fiat justitia, pereat mundus (</span><strong><u>Let justice be done, even if the world perish</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">),”</span><strong><u>but the state has no right to say so in the name of those who are in its care.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Both the individual and state must judge political action by universal moral principles, such as that of liberty. Yet while the individual has a moral right to sacrifice himself in defense of such a moral principle, </span><strong><u>the state has no right to let its moral disapprobation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of the infringement of liberty </span><strong><u>get in the way of successful political action, itself inspired by the moral principle of national survival.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> There can be no political morality without prudence; that is, without consideration of the political consequences of seemingly moral action. Realism, then, considers prudence- the weighing of the consequences of alternative political actions-to be [is] the supreme virtue in politics. Ethics in the abstract judges action by its conformity with the moral law; political ethics judges action by its political consequences.</span><br />
<br />
Therefore the <strong>value</strong> is <strong>optimum policy-making</strong>.<br />
<br />
Democratic procedures arrive at the best decisions. Thomas <strong><u>Christiano</u></strong> writes<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Aff/Cases/Demo%20AC.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Two kinds of in instrumental benefits are commonly attributed to democracy: relatively good laws and policies and improvements in the characters of the participants. John Stuart Mill argued that a democratic method of making legislation is better than non-democratic methods in three ways: strategically, epistemically and via the improvement of the characters of democratic citizens (Mill, 1861, Chapter 3). Strategically, </span><strong><u>[First,] democracy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> has an advantage because it </span><strong><u>forces decision-makers to take into account the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> interests, </span><strong><u>rights</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and opinions </span><strong><u>of most people in society. Since democracy gives</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> some </span><strong><u>political power to each, more people are taken into account than under aristocracy or monarchy.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The most forceful contemporary statement of this instrumental argument is provided by Amartya Sen, who argues, for example, that “no substantial famine has ever occurred in any independent country with a democratic form of government and a relatively free press” (Sen 1999, 152). The basis of this argument is that politicians in a multiparty democracy with free elections and a free press have incentives to respond to the expressions of needs of the poor. Epistemologically, </span><strong><u>[Second,] democracy is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> thought to be </span><strong><u>the best decision-making method</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on the grounds that it is generally more reliable in helping participants discover the right decisions. </span><strong><u>Since democracy brings a lot of people into the process of decision making, it can take advantage of many sources of information</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and critical assessment of laws and policies. Democratic decision-making tends to be more informed than other forms about the interests of citizens and the causal mechanisms necessary to advance those interests.</span><br />

This means democracy sets better norms than international law.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>McGinnis and Somin 07</u></strong> write<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Aff/Cases/Demo%20AC.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">[3</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">If we are right to argue that raw international has a relative democracy deficit compared to U.S. domestic law, this conclusion undermines claims that the United States should simply evaluate international law norms on a case-by-case basis, following only those that have beneficial consequences. The key question is: who does the evaluating? If it is the ordinary domestic lawmaking process, then this approach is fully in accord with our position: that the United States should only allow international law to override domestic law if the former has been ratified by the domestic political process. If, on the other hand, the mere existence of a norm of raw international law is taken as justification for the claim that it is likely to have beneficial consequences, then the democracy deficit provides good reason to reject this conclusion.</span> <strong><u>To the extent that international law suffers from a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> comparative </span><strong><u>democracy deficit, allowing it to override domestic law will</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, on average, </span><strong><u>result in beneficial norms being replaced by</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> relatively more </span><strong><u>harmful ones</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. n104 This point holds true even if most rules of raw international law actually produce beneficial results. For example, let us assume that raw international law promotes &quot;good&quot; results 70% of the time, but because of its relatively smaller democracy deficit, domestic law does so 75% of the time. Even in this stylized situation, domestic law is likely to produce better results than raw international law when the two conflict. Assuming that there are only two alternative legal rules, one &quot;good&quot; and the other &quot;bad,&quot; in this scenario domestic law is likely to pick the good option and international law the bad one in about 56% of the cases where the two diverge. n105 It is important to remember that </span><strong><u>our argument is comparative. International norms are less likely to be of sound quality than those created by an established democracy such as the United States.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> This will be true both in cases where U.S. law and international law directly conflict and in those situations where international law seeks to regulate an issue that American law has left to executive discretion or to the private sector. A domestic decision to leave an issue to official discretion or to private initiative is just as likely to be superior to a competing international law norm as a domestic decision to impose a legal rule by statute.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Therefore the <strong>criterion</strong> is <strong><u>consistency with democratic procedure.</u></strong><br />
<br />
Prefer the criterion for 4 more reasons:<br />
<br />
<strong>First</strong>, only democracy respects the equality of persons.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Christiano 2</u></strong> writes<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Many democratic theorists have argued that </span><strong><u>democracy is a way of treating persons as equals when there is good reason to impose</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> some kind of </span><strong><u>organization on their shared lives but they disagree about how best to do it.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> On one version, defended by Peter Singer (1973, pp. 30-41), </span><strong><u>when people</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> insist on </span><strong><u>differ</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">ent ways of arranging matters properly, </span><strong><u>each person</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in a sense </span><strong><u>claims a right to be dictator</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> over their shared lives. </span><strong><u>But these claims to dictatorship cannot all hold up</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, the argument goes. </span><strong><u>Democracy embodies a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> kind of peaceful and</span> <strong><u>fair compromise among these conflicting claims</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to rule. </span><strong><u>Each compromises equally on what he claims as long as the others do, resulting in each having an equal say over decision making.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Second,</strong> only democracy fosters the conditions necessary for autonomy.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Christiano 3</u></strong> provides 3 warrants<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Furthermore,</span> <strong><u>[First,]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the broad based discussion typical of </span><strong><u>democracy enhances</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><strong><u>critical assessment of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the different </span><strong><u>moral ideas</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that guide decision-makers. Many have endorsed democracy on the basis of the proposition that democracy has beneficial effects on character. Many have noted with Mill and Rousseau that</span> <strong><u>democracy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> tends to </span><strong><u>make[s] people stand up for themselves</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> more than other forms of rule do </span><strong><u>because it makes collective decisions depend on them</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> more than monarchy or aristocracy do. Hence, in democratic societies individuals are </span><strong><u>encourag[ing]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">ed </span><strong><u>[individuals] to be more autonomous.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In addition,</span> <strong><u>[Second,] democracy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> tends to </span><strong><u>get[s] people to think carefully and rationally</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> more than other forms of rule </span><strong><u>because it makes a difference whether they do or not. Finally,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> some have argued that</span> <strong><u>democracy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> tends to </span><strong><u>enhance[s] the moral qualities of citizens. When they participate in making decisions, they have to listen to others,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> they are called upon to</span> <strong><u>justify themselves to others and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> they are forced to </span><strong><u>think</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in part </span><strong><u>in terms of the interests of others.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Some have argued that when people find themselves in this kind of circumstance,</span> <strong><u>they come</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> genuinely </span><strong><u>to think in terms of the common good</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and justice. </span><br />
<br />
<u>Actual autonomy precedes theoretical autonomy</u> because the Kantian notion of an ideal autonomous agent fails to take into account the material conditions that limit autonomous choice.<br />
<br />
<strong>Third,</strong> only democracy respects humans as ends in themselves.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Christiano 4</u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Some argue that the basic principles of democracy are founded in the idea that each individual has a right to liberty.</span> <strong><u>Democracy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, it is said,</span> <strong><u>extends the idea that each ought to be master of his</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or her </span><strong><u>life to the domain of collective decision making.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> First, </span><strong><u>each person's life is deeply affected by the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> larger </span><strong><u>social</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, legal and cultural </span><strong><u>environment in which he or she lives.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Second, </span><strong><u>only when each person has an equal</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">voice and </span><strong><u>vote</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in the process of collective decision-making </span><strong><u>will each</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> have </span><strong><u>control</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> over </span><strong><u>this</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> larger </span><strong><u>environment.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Thinkers such as Carol Gould (1988, pp.45-85) conclude that only when some kind of democracy is implemented, will individuals have a chance at self-government. </span><br />
<strong><u>Since individuals have a right of self-government, they have a right to democratic participation. This right is established</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> at least partly </span><strong><u>independently of the worth of the outcomes of democratic decision making</u></strong>.<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The idea is that the right of self-government gives one a right, within limits, to do wrong. </span><strong><u>Just as an individual has a right to make</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> some </span><strong><u>bad decisions for himself</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or herself, </span><strong><u>so a group</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of individuals have </span><strong><u>[has] a right to make</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> bad or </span><strong><u>unjust decisions for</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> themselves regarding those </span><strong><u>[their shared] activities</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> they share.</span><br />

The experience of this century offers important lessons. Countries that govern themselves in a truly </span><strong><u>democratic [countries]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> fashion </span><strong><u>do not go to war with one another.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> They do not aggress against their neighbors to aggrandize themselves or glorify their leaders. Democratic governments do not ethnically &quot;cleanse&quot; their own populations, and they are much less likely to face ethnic insurgency. Democracies do not sponsor terrorism against one another. They do not build weapons of mass destruction to use on or to threaten one another. Democratic countries form more reliable, open, and enduring trading partnerships. In the long run they offer better and more stable climates for investment. </span><strong><u>They are more environmentally responsible because they must answer to their own citizens</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, who organize to protest the destruction of their environments. They are better bets to honor international treaties since they value legal obligations and because their openness makes it much more difficult to breach agreements in secret. </span><strong><u>Precisely because</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, within their own borders, </span><strong><u>they respect competition, civil liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a new world order of </span><strong><u>international security</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and prosperity </span><strong><u>can be built.</u></strong><br />

These risks are proportionally greater than the decline or benefits of further democratization. Thus, there is strong evidence that</span> <strong><u>democratization</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> has a monadic effect: It</span> <strong><u>reduces the probability</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that a country will be involved in a</span> <strong><u>[of] war</u></strong>.<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Although the probability of war involvement does not decrease linearly, it does decrease</span> <strong><u>monotonically</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, so that over the entire range of democracy minus autocracy values, there is a reduction of about</span> <strong><u>[by] 50%.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> During the democratic transition, at every point along the way as well as at the end points, there is an attendant reduction in the probability of a polity being at war.</span><br />

Lesser megamurderers include WWII Japan, Khmer Rouge Cambodia, WWI Turkey, communist Vietnam, post-WWII Poland, Pakistan, and communist Yugoslavia.

The findings also highlight the quandary for <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wapo.st/ujkm0i" rel="nofollow">Mitt Romney</a> and other Republican candidates, who have portrayed Obama as weak abroad and politically motivated inmoving to end America’s two long wars. Attacking Obama’s national security policies, the poll suggests, may do GOP challengers more harm than good when many Americans favor a national security approach that relies more on technology than troops. By a margin of more than 2 to 1, Americans say the president’s handling of terrorism is a major reason to support rather than oppose his bid for reelection. The survey shows that 70 percent of respondents approve of Obama’s decision to keep open the prison at Guantanamo Bay. He pledged during his first week in office to close the prison within a year, but <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/guantanamo-bay-how-the-white-house-lost-the-fight-to-close-it/2011/04/14/AFtxR5XE_story.html" rel="nofollow">he has not done so.</a> Even the party base appears willing to forgive that failure. The poll shows that 53 percent of self-identified liberal Democrats — and 67 percent of moderate or conservative Democrats — support keeping Guantanamo Bay open, even though it emerged as a symbol of the post-Sept. 11 national security policies of President George W. Bush, which many liberals bitterly opposed. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/18/AR2010011803594.html" rel="nofollow">Obama has also relied on armed drones</a> far more than Bush did, and he has expanded their use beyond America’s defined war zones. The Post-ABC News poll found that </span><strong><u>83 percent of Americans approve of Obama’s drone policy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, which administration officials refuse to discuss, citing security concerns.</span><br />

<strong><u>The major premise behind assassination is that the elimination of an undesirable political actor will create</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a </span><strong><u>policy change.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Because prisoners can be released, exiled leaders can return to power, and those without financial means can become wealthy, international </span><strong><u>policies which aim at jailing, denigrating, or removing the financial base of enemy politicians</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in order to supplant them </span><strong><u>can become reversed</u></strong>.<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> As well, </span><strong><u>such policies</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> often </span><strong><u>require long-term commitments and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> also </span><strong><u>involve</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a significant amount of </span><strong><u>uncertainty</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. The same is true of more constructive policies—promoting economic trade or working through democratic channels can be very slow and indirect. As a result, </span><strong><u>the most surefire</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, direct, </span><strong><u>and quick way to eliminate a politician is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to do so </span><strong><u>permanently</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, through assassination. This is especially so if the politician does not appear to be diplomatically responsive, and is wedded to the idea of using violence, such as in the case of an authoritarian or a terrorist. Lastly, assassination seems to be the cheapest and the easiest manner of changing policy, if indeed there are as effectual alternatives. </span><strong><u>Because assassination is more targeted and only involves the death of one or several individuals, it is preferable to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> war, economic sanctions, international denunciation, or </span><strong><u>other</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> forms of political </span><strong><u>tools</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> currently </span><strong><u>available to democratic states.</u></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Finally, one might argue that a nation should follow raw international law to take into account the interests of foreign nationals. But it seems almost axiomatic that the touchstone of the American regime should be the welfare of Americans. But even assuming that the United States should take a more encompassing view of human welfare, American law may actually be better than international law at protecting the interests of citizens around the world. First, not all of the activities purportedly covered by modern customary international law generate substantial negative spillovers from one nation to another. For example, most of the American government’s decisions about human rights directly affect only those who have subjected themselves to the jurisdiction of the United States. Yet, </span><strong><u>the United States’ power to determine its own law</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">in this regard </span><strong><u>has benefits for foreigners.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> One benefit is that some individuals may choose to move to America, as millions do each decade, to take advantage of its particular bundle of rights and responsibilities. Moreover, </span><strong><u>all democratic nations may evaluate American rights and embrace as many as are good for them. If the United States had followed the prevailing norms at the time of the Declaration of Independence, it would never have declared the truths about the nature of man and government that have become the foundations of democratic processes around the world. By forcing a convergence of domestic law to some international standard,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> customary </span><strong><u>international law may preclude similar gifts that American exceptionalism might still deliver to the world.</u></strong><br />
<br />
This is a turn to any I-Law good offense. US law is a better model for international norms.<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Even in activities where there are spillovers, such as law on the use of force,</span> <strong><u>American law is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> probably </span><strong><u>better than international law.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The United States is the world’s great power, some</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 6pt;">‐</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> times called the global hegemon in international relations theory.26 It stands to gain the lion’s share of resources from the peace and prosperity of the world. </span><strong><u>Its political process has incentives to provide laws that contribute to peace and prosperity</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, such as appropriate use of force. </span><strong><u>Moreover, as a hegemon composed of immigrants</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> who remain </span><strong><u>concerned about</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the welfare of </span><strong><u>their former nations, America affords citizens from all over the world</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> some virtual </span><strong><u>representation in its political process.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> These guarantees of beneficence for foreigners are surely imperfect, but they seem better than those provided by customary international law. Thus, by insisting that United States courts follow American law and not raw international law, Americans serve both themselves and others around the globe. America helps the world most by remaining true to her own democratic genius.</span><br />

 The <strong>value</strong> is <strong>morality</strong>. Neuro<span style="font-size: 10pt;">-</span>imaging shows that util is the most rational moral theory<br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">To summarize, people’s moral judgments appear to be products of at least two different kinds of psychological processes. First, both</span><u>brain imaging and reaction-time data suggest</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">that there are prepotent negative</span><u>emotion[s]</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">al responses that</span><u>drive people to</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">disapprove of the personally harmful actions proposed in cases like the footbridge and crying baby dilemmas. These responses are characteristic of</span><u>deontology</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">but not of consequentialism. Second, further brain imaging results suggest that “cognitive” psychological processes can compete with the aforementioned emotional processes, driving people to approve of personally harmful moral violations, primarily when there is a strong consequentialist rationale for doing so, as in the crying baby case.</span><u>The [active] parts of the brain</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">that exhibit increased activity</span><u>when people make</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">characteristically</span><u>consequentialist judgments are those</u> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">that are</span><u>most closely associated with higher cognitive functions such as executive control</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (Koechlin et al., 2003; Miller and Cohen, 2001),</span><u>complex planning</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> ( Koechlin, Basso, Pietrini, Panzer, &amp; Grafman, 1999), deductive</span><u>and</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> inductive</span><u>reasoning</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (Goel &amp; Dolan, 2004), taking the long view in economic decision making (McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein, &amp; Cohen., 2004), and so on. Moreover, these brain regions are among those most dramatically expanded in humans compared with other primates (Allman, Hakeem, &amp; Watson, 2002).</span><br />
<br />
Therefore the <strong>standard</strong> is <strong>maximizing happiness</strong>. My standard controls the link to any practical reason or contract frameworks because rational agents would consent to a universal law to maximize utility to increase the chance of their own interests being satisfied.<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Osama bin Laden has always had a very soft spot in his heart for Yemen, saying that it is “one of the best Arab and Muslim countries in terms of its adherence to tradition and the faith … [its] topography is mountainous, and its people are tribal and armed, and allow one to breathe clean air unblemished by humiliation.” Yemen is, of course, also the site of his family’s origin and he has often praised the Kindah tribe of which his family is part. The bin Ladens hail from the village of al-Rubat in the Hadramaut region, and Osama took his fourth wife from there. Bin Laden also has referred often to the religious importance of Yemen, noting the Prophet Muhammad’s high regard for Yemen because of its quick adoption of Islam after the faith’s founding and because he believed that from Yemen “would come 12,000 [fighters] who would support God and His Prophet, and they are among the best of us” (al-Islah, September 2, 1996).

After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, moreover, bin Laden and several of his colleagues sent guns, money and Arab veterans of Afghanistan into Yemen to fight alongside the Salih-led insurgents who eventually defeated the communist regime of southern Yemen to reunify the country in 1990 (al-Qatan al-Arabi, December 27, 1996). Al-Qaeda’s first anti-U.S. attack—against U.S. troops on the way to Somalia—was conducted in Aden, Yemen, in December 1992. More recently, 80 percent of those involved in the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole were Saudis of Yemeni origin. The members of the al-Qaeda cell that the FBI dismantled in Lackawanna, New York in 2002 were all Yemenis. Furthermore, a significant number of the non-Iraqi mujahideen fighting U.S. forces in Iraq are Yemenis. Indeed, in late 2007 the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Hamzah al-Muhajir, called specifically on the Yemeni Islamists to provide more fighters to support the Iraqi mujahideen. On November 29, 2007, al-Qaeda’s chief in Yemen, Nasir al-Wihayshi (aka Abu Basir), publicly answered that he would immediately send more fighters. “Oh Abu Hamzah, here we come, oh, Iraq, here we come,” Abu Basir pledged (Message from the Amir of al-Qaeda in Yemen to Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, November 29, 2007). Lasting Geographic Importance Beyond “the extended manpower fighting for God in happy Yemen,” bin Laden and </span><strong><u>al-Qaeda have always valued what they refer to as “the strategic depth” that Yemen affords</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">(al-Islah, September 2, 1996; al-Quds al-Arabi, March 9, 1994). While bin Laden and his organization were based in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, for example, they established a sort of “naval bridge” that permitted the flow of guns and fighters between Yemen and Port Sudan in support of Hasan al-Turabi’s Islamist regime in Khartoum. In the other direction, bin Laden sent al-Qaeda operatives from Port Sudan to Yemen and from there infiltrated them into Saudi Arabia across the imperfectly guarded Saudi-Yemeni border as well as into Oman. In Yemen, bin Laden also cultivated ties with President Salih and prominent Islamist shaykhs—including Shaykh Abdul Majid al-Zindani, head of the Yemen Reform Party—and by doing so facilitated the growth of substantial al-Qaeda infrastructure across the country. Al-Qaeda’s presence in Yemen also brought it into closer contact with the Egyptian Islamist groups based there: the Gama’a al-Islamiyah and Ayman al-Zawahiri’s Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the latter of which later united with al-Qaeda. Finally, al-Qaeda has found that some of its Yemeni members are of great assistance in inserting al-Qaeda operatives into the states of East Africa, the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific, because of the Yemeni diaspora that was established centuries ago in those regions by Yemeni sailors and commercial traders. Operational Key and Base of Last Resort </span><strong><u>For al-Qaeda, Yemen provides a pivotal, central base that links its theaters of operation in Afghanistan, Iraq, East Africa and the Far East; it also provides a base for training Yemeni fighters</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">and for the rest and refit of fighters from multiple Islamist groups after their tours in Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia. Today, it appears to be an especially important safe haven for Somali Islamist fighters and the leaders of the Union of Islamic Courts who fled their country after the late-2006 invasion of Ethiopian forces. </span><br />

Terrorists need a safe haven for a large-scale attack<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Although the group [Al Qaeda] has been significantly weakened since late 2001, </span><strong><u>the only chance al Qaeda has of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> rebuilding its capability to </span><strong><u>conduct[ing] a large-scale</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> terrorist </span><strong><u>operation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> against the United States </span><strong><u>is under</u></strong> <strong><u>the Taliban's umbrella of protection.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Objections like Haass's are rooted in the following arguments: that terrorists don't need physical space because they can plot online; that the London and Madrid bombings prove deadly attacks can be planned in restrictive, Western, urban locations under the noses of local security services; and that denying terrorists one safe haven will simply compel them to move to another lawless region. I spent five years as a counterterrorism analyst for the Pentagon and rigorously studied plots from Madrid to London to 9/11. The above arguments may have merit in a piecemeal or abstract sense, but fall apart in the specific case of what we all dread: a large-scale, al Qaeda operation aimed at the United States. It is certainly true, for example, that terrorist groups can accomplish much online. Individuals can maintain contact with groups via chat rooms, money can be transferred over the Web (if done with extreme caution), and plotters can download items like instruction manuals for bomb-making, photographs of potential targets, and even blueprints for particular buildings. But all the e-mail accounts, </span><strong><u>chat rooms</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, and social media available </span><strong><u>will never account for the human touch. There is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> simply </span><strong><u>no substitute for the trust</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and confidence </span><strong><u>built by physically meeting</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, jointly conceiving, </span><strong><u>and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> then </span><strong><u>training together for a large-scale</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, complex </span><strong><u>operation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on the other side of the world. As the 9/11 plot developed, mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM) put the future operatives through a series of training courses along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Courses included physical fitness, firearms, close combat, Western culture, and English language. The 9/11 Commission report notes the extreme physical and mental demands KSM put on the participants -- even if the operation didn't require extensive firearms usage, KSM would have wanted the </span><strong><u>operatives</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to </span><strong><u>[should] be proficient under intense pressure</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, should the need arise. </span><strong><u>Juxtapose that with</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> an </span><strong><u>online learning environment.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> While you can no doubt learn some amazing things from online courses, </span><strong><u>it is far preferable to have a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> dedicated </span><strong><u>professor physically present</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to supervise students and monitor their progress. Or think of it another way: You wouldn't want the U.S. Marine Corps to send recruits into battle without training under a drill instructor, would you? KSM was somewhere between a professor and sergeant. Second, critics argue that the Madrid bombings of 2004 (which killed 191) as well those in London a year later (which killed 56) were largely -- though not entirely -- conceived, prepared, and executed within their respective countries, thus obviating the need for a safe haven. True enough. However, unlike 9/11 (which killed nearly 3,000), those plots' successes were possible due to their simple concept and small scale. In both cities, the playbook was essentially the same: Four to eight individuals had to find a safe house, download bomb-making instructions, purchase explosive agents, assemble the devices, and deliver charges to the attack points. Without trivializing the tragic loss of life in the European attacks, building those explosive devices was akin to conducting a difficult high-school chemistry experiment. On that scale, </span><strong><u>9/11 was like constructing a nuclear warhead</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. In every sense, it was a grander vision, </span><strong><u>involving 20 highly skilled operatives</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> infiltrating the U.S. homeland, who conducted a series of hijackings and targeted four national landmarks </span><strong><u>with</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> enough </span><strong><u>know-how, preparation, and contingency plans</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to be success. In one instance, KSM taught the 9/11 operatives to shoot a rifle from the back of a moving motorcycle, just in case. </span><strong><u>You can't do that in someone's bedroom -- you need space, [and] time</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, and the ability to work </span><strong><u>without worrying that the cops are listening in.</u></strong><br />

Targeted terrorists can’t find safe havens. They are shunned by communities.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Communicating</span><span class="ReadSource">targeted</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> killings can be done by informing wanted individuals that they are marked for death or capture. The easiest way to do that is to publish wanted lists and disseminate them within the community in which a target is suspected of hiding. Israel, as the aforementioned example illustrates, did so often. When it proved able to target individuals with precision force (capability), illustrated its resolve to do so repeatedly (credibility), and ensured that individuals appreciated that they were wanted (communication), Israel managed to change the behavior of some would-be terrorists. In an enlightening story published in Israel’s national newspaper Haaretz in 2007, Avi Issacharoff follows a group of Fatah-affiliated Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade militants known to be wanted by Israel. Issacharoff relates that the </span><span class="ReadSource">men</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">each have “social problems” due to their status as wanted individuals. They </span><span class="ReadSource">are unwelcome even in their own communities:</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> when the men visit coffee shops, patrons are quick to leave, lest they get inadvertently caught up in an Israeli raid; </span><span class="ReadSource">taxis refuse to give them lifts</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">; barbers and shop owners shut their doors when the men approach. “The most difficult problem the wanted men face,” Issacharoff writes, “is that they have become ineligible for marriage.” </span><span class="ReadSource">Fathers refuse to allow their daughters to marry the blacklisted men</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> so as to protect their families from the dangers association with known terrorists might entail. In the West Bank</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, Israel has capitalized on the despondency by offering amnesty to wanted men if and when they hand over their weapons, “swear off terror,” and agree to some form of surveillance on a probationary period. So long as wanted individuals refrain from terrorism, Israel will refrain from targeting them. To date, hundreds of individuals have joined the program. Issacharoff concludes that “the ‘glory days’ of Raed al-Karmi the legendary Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade leader who sowed terror in [Israel] until he was killed,” by Israeli commandos who planted</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> a bomb next to his home in 2002, “are over.”68 The message, repeated among once-active terrorists in the West Bank, is that terrorism simply does not pay. </span><br />

<strong><u>The very threat of coercion forces leaders to worry about their safety, hinders their freedom of movement, and requires that they spend time and resources in avoiding their own death rather than planning the death of others.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In a 2004 letter to bin Laden, AQI’s al-Zarqawi stresses this persistent dilemma. “What is preventing us from making a general call to arms,” he protests, “is the fact that the country of Iraq has no mountains in which to seek refuge, or forest in which to hide. Our presence is apparent and our movement is out in the open. Eyes are everywhere.”44</span> <strong><u>Leaders in hiding face the related problem of motivating and leading their followers; championing a cause from the frontline is far more effective than doing so from the safety of a bunker</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or villa in a neighboring region. Likewise, by eliminating skilled facilitators, organizations become de-professionalized. Finding individuals that are able and willing to replace eliminated bombmakers and tactical planners, for instance, takes time, notwithstanding the fact that not just any substitute will do. Few individuals have the skill sets needed to design and build effective bombs that do not prematurely detonate or the leadership characteristics required to successfully manage a military organization. While reports suggest that many of today’s top terrorist leaders are highly educated individuals, holding graduate, legal, and medical degrees, this does not necessarily translate into solid military and strategic know-how. Furthermore, </span><strong><u>attracting and recruiting the right people to a life of violent hardship</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that invariable comes with joining a terrorist organization </span><strong><u>can be difficult.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Even in the case of suicide bombings, </span><strong><u>it is not enough to simply equip and send out a great many operatives</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on suicide missions—</span><strong><u>the individuals need to have the intellect and training to know where to go, who to target,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> how and when to detonate their bombs, </span><strong><u>and what to do in case of mishap.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">45 They must also be trained not to renege on their decision to die and to know, too, never to get caught. In fact, there is very real danger in sending out poorly trained or intellectually unstable suicide operatives. “Dud bombers”—those that fail in their attempt to detonate their explosives—get caught and can crack under interrogation, causing irreparable damage to their group, cell, or operator.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Several other benefits of Israel's policy of targeted killing became apparent from its heightened practice during the second intifada. First, targeted killings have impeded the effectiveness of Palestinian terrorist organizations where leadership, planning, and tactical skills are confined to a few key individuals. </span><span class="ReadSource">There are a limited number of people who [can]</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> have the technical ability to </span><span class="ReadSource">make bombs and plan attacks</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.

<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Insurgent leaders, knowing they are targeted by government forces, must make the critical decision to name a successor or not to name a successor. Some insurgent leaders name a successor to prevent internal power struggles or infighting when the leader is killed or captured. The presence of a second-in-command allows the insurgent leader to transfer his leadership legitimacy to his successor and also facilitates the continuation of insurgent operations once the leader is captured or killed by government forces. However, by naming a successor, the leader allows government forces to target the second-in-command as well as the leader, But In organizations where no successor is named, </span><span class="ReadSource">new leaders must establish themselves in the hierarchy </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">which results in delays in operations. For example, </span><span class="ReadSource">following the death of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Baitullah Mehsud, </span><span class="ReadSource">the leader of the Taliban in Pakistan, numerous people claimed authority</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to lead the Tehrik-i-Taliban. The </span><span class="ReadSource">infighting resulted in the deaths of several</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Taliban </span><span class="ReadSource">leaders and the loss of time to conduct operations</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> against the Pakistani Government.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The results in Table 2 show that very few groups have radicalized after a crisis in leadership. Indeed, </span><span class="ReadSource">of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><span class="ReadSource">thirty-one </span><strong><u>cases of leadership crisis</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that we </span><span class="ReadSource">examined, only one group became more radical.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> In that case, the radicalization occurred after the arrest of the group’s leader. This finding differs from what we expected. Our second hypothesis was that assassinations would most likely lead groups to become more radical. Making a martyr out of a leader, we assumed, would lead to a strengthening of resolve and the subsequent radicalization of the group. Our findings provide no evidence to suggest that our hypothesis is correct. In fact, </span><span class="ReadSource">a group appears much more likely to disband or become less radical after the assassination of a leader.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> This suggests that the psychological impact of the assassination of a leader is not sufficient to spark a radical transformation in a group’s ideology. An additional explanation for our finding is that the assassination of a leader might often be accompanied by widespread attacks on the movement that disrupt much more than the top leadership, precipitating the failure of the group. Another possibility is that the assassination of a leader often greatly disrupts the movement, possibly causing a loss of funding, internecine fighting, and/or the loss of the leader’s unifying and charismatic personality. A related finding is that the </span><span class="ReadSource">assassination</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of a leader </span><span class="ReadSource">is more likely to cause a group to fail or disband than is</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> an </span><span class="ReadSource">arrest</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of the leader. This may be because a group is more likely to remain intact if members believe that their leader will eventually return to power. Alternatively, as in the case of Action Directe in France, leaders may be communicating with active members of the group from their prison cells, thereby perpetuating their influence (Dartnell 1995).</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Something more than correlation was at work here. Contrary to popular myth, the</span> <strong><u>number of skilled terrorists is quite limited.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">This group of </span><strong><u>85 experts judged that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><strong><u>possibility of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a </span><strong><u>WMD attack</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> against a city or other target somewhere in the world</span> <strong><u>is real and increasing over time</u></strong><u>.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The median estimate of the risk of a nuclear attack somewhere in the world by 2010 was 10 percent.

On September 11, 2001, the world witnessed the destructive potential of international terrorism. But the September 11 attacks do not come close to approximating the destruction that would be unleashed by a nuclear weapon. Weapons of mass destruction have made it possible for a small nation, or even a sub-national group, to kill as many innocent people in a day as national armies killed in months of fighting during World War II. &quot;The bottom line is this,&quot; Lugar concluded: &quot;For the foreseeable future, the United States and other </span><strong><u>nations will face an existential threat</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> from the intersection of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.&quot; It's paradoxical that a diminished threat of a superpower nuclear exchange should somehow have resulted in a world where the danger of at least a single nuclear explosion in a major city has increased (and that city is as likely, or likelier, to be Moscow as it is to be Washington or New York). We tend to think that a terrorist nuclear attack would lead us to drive for the elimination of nuclear weapons. I think the opposite case is at least equally likely: </span><strong><u>A terrorist nuclear attack would almost certainly be followed by a retaliatory nuclear strike</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on whatever country we believed to be sheltering the perpetrators. That response would surely </span><strong><u>initiat[ing]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">e </span><strong><u>a new round of nuclear armament</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and rearmament in the name of deterrence, however illogical. Think of how much 9/11 frightened us; think of how desperate our leaders were to prevent any further such attacks; think of the fact that we invaded and occupied a country, Iraq, that had nothing to do with those attacks in the name of sending a message. </span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Biological materials are more ubiquitous and less secure than nuclear.

While the rugged and persistent anthrax spores remain the pathogen of first resort, the last two decades have seen an explosion of biological dangers. Since 9/11, the federal government has poured billions into defensive research on pathogens that might be used for bioterrorism. </span><strong><u>There are now 14,000 US scientists</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> authorized to </span><strong><u>work[ing] on these materials, increasing the risk of a few bad apples with access.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Shockingly, there continues to be no comprehensive regulation within the United States or internationally of the sites where lethal pathogens are produced or of the scientists capable of their production. </span><strong><u>Al Qaeda remains intent on securing lethal pathogens</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> for use against the United States. </span><strong><u>Agents of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Osama </span><strong><u>bin Laden</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> have been intercepted </span><strong><u>attempt[ed]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">ing </span><strong><u>to procure bio</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">logical capabilities and </span><strong><u>materials in Europe and Asia.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The laboratories we discovered in Kandahar after the October 2001 invasion of Afghanistan have been relocated to the tribal areas of Pakistan.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control.</span> <strong><u>Bio</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">logical</span> <strong><u>weapons</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, on the other hand, </span><strong><u>can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attack has demonstrated.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because </span><strong><u>very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or be grown </span><strong><u>to horrendous proportions.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. </span><strong><u>With</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> nuclear and</span> <strong><u>bio</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">logical </span><strong><u>weapons, the killing will probably never end.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. Potentially worse than that, bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation. </span><strong><u>AIDS and ebola</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> viruses </span><strong><u>are just a small example of recent</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">ly emerging </span><strong><u>plagues with no known cure</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or vaccine.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">According to security analysts and intelligence specialists, cyberterrorism is a bigger challenge than supposed. </span><strong><u>The propensity of Al Qaeda</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">and other terror groups </span><strong><u>to harness [cyberterror]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> these means into a potentially lethal offensive capability </span><strong><u>has handed them a crucial advantage, one they have used with</u></strong> <strong><u>considerable success.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Not only are terrorist groups culpable, but major world powers such as China and Russia too have been accused of launching cyber attacks against other states. Take for example the attacks on Estonia in 2007 or the one on Georgia in 2008 that brought the respective governments almost to a standstill.

Cyberterror causes nuclear war. <strong><u>Fritz 09</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Aff/Cases/Yemen%20AC.docx#_ftn16" rel="nofollow">[16</a>]</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">This paper will analyse the threat of cyber terrorism in regard to nuclear weapons. Specifically, this research will use open source knowledge to identify the structure of nuclear command and control centres, how those structures might be compromised through computer network operations, and how doing so would fit within established</span> <strong><u>cyber terrorists</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">’ capabilities, strategies, and tactics. If access to command and control centres is obtained, terrorists </span><strong><u>could fake or actually cause one nuclear</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">-armed </span><strong><u>state to attack another</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, thus provoking a nuclear response from another nuclear power. This may be an easier alternative for terrorist groups than building or acquiring a nuclear weapon or dirty bomb themselves. […] [Full Text Available] Efforts by militaries to place </span><strong><u>increasing reliance on computer networks</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, including experimental technology such as autonomous systems, </span><strong><u>and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> their desire to have </span><strong><u>multiple launch options</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, such as nuclear triad capability, </span><strong><u>enables multiple entry points for terrorists</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. For example, if a terrestrial command centre is impenetrable, perhaps isolating one nuclear armed submarine would prove an easier task. There is evidence to suggest multiple attempts have been made by hackers to compromise the extremely low radio frequency once used by the US Navy to send nuclear launch approval to submerged submarines. Additionally, </span><strong><u>the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> alleged </span><strong><u>Soviet system</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> known as Perimetr was designed </span><strong><u>to automatically launch nuclear weapons</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> if it was unable to establish communications with Soviet leadership. This was intended as a retaliatory response in the event that nuclear weapons had decapitated Soviet leadership; however it </span><strong><u>did not account for the possibility of cyber terrorists blocking communications</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> through computer network operations in an attempt to engage the system. Should a warhead be launched, damage could be further enhanced through additional computer network operations. By using proxies, multi-layered attacks could be engineered. Terrorists could remotely commandeer computers in China and use them to launch a US nuclear attack against Russia. Thus Russia would believe it was under attack from the US and the US would believe China was responsible. Further, emergency response communications could be disrupted, transportation could be shut down, and disinformation, such as misdirection, could be planted, thereby hindering the disaster relief effort and maximizing destruction. </span><strong><u>Disruptions in communication and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the use of </span><strong><u>disinformation could also</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> be used to </span><strong><u>provoke uninformed responses.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> For example, a nuclear strike between India and Pakistan could be coordinated with Distributed Denial of Service attacks against key networks, so they would have further difficulty in identifying what happened and be forced to respond quickly. Terrorists could also knock out communications between these states so they cannot discuss the situation. Alternatively, amidst the confusion of a traditional large-scale terrorist attack, </span><strong><u>claims of responsibility</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and declarations of war </span><strong><u>could be falsified</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in an attempt to instigate a hasty military response. These false claims could be posted directly on Presidential, military, and government websites. E-mails could also be sent to the media and foreign governments using the IP addresses and e-mail accounts of government officials. A sophisticated and all encompassing combination of traditional terrorism and </span><strong><u>cyber terrorism could be enough to launch nuclear weapons on its own</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, without the need for compromising command and control centres directly.</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">There has (thankfully) been no large-scale terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, and the number of American civilians who have died worldwide in terrorist attacks remains small. But as the chart compiled by the <em>Economist</em> and reprinted below shows, </span><u>terrorism deaths worldwide remain stunningly high. More than 7,000</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> people </span><u>died in terrorist attacks</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> around the world </span><u>in 2010, and that</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> number </span><u>was</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> actually </span><u>down from a high of nearly 13,000</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in 2007. The spike in terrorism deaths in the middle of the decade reflects the insurgency that developed in Iraq after the U.S. invasion. Sixty percent of the terrorism fatalities recorded in 2007 occurred in Iraq. So the “war on terrorism” is a long way from being won.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In the rapidly mutating world of international terrorist organizations, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has become one of the most serious threats facing the United States. The recent AQAP attempt to use parcel bombs against U.S.-bound aircraft is only the most recent manifestation of this problem. The Christmas 2009 attempted bombing of a U.S. passenger aircraft in Detroit by a Nigerian radical trained by Yemeni terrorists was an earlier warning to the United States about the dangers of neglecting events in this country. Both of these near catastrophic episodes underscored the necessity for serious U.S. efforts to support all reasonable endeavors to defeat this organization with an informed, careful, and meticulous strategy based on a comprehensive understanding of Yemen and the terrorists. This requirement may be especially clear when one considers the chain of events that could be set off </span><strong><u>if AQAP is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> eventually </span><strong><u>able to implement a spectacular terrorist event</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Apart from the human cost of such a tragedy, </span><strong><u>severe public pressure will undoubtedly exist for military intervention in Yemen with U.S. ground combat troops</u></strong>.<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Such an</span> <strong><u>intervention would infuriate virtually the entire Yemeni population</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> regardless of the objective merits of the U.S. case for the offensive use of U.S. ground combat forces. It could lead to what al Qaeda refers to as a “bleeding war,” a struggle by the United States to pacify a hostile population which dissipates U.S. power in a hope to drive it from the region. </span><strong><u>Yemen could become</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> like the Iraq city of Fallujah in 2004, </span><strong><u>a cauldron of radicalism and anti-American hate</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. To head this off, AQAP’s capacity for spectacular terrorist strikes must correspondingly be ended soon while the organization itself must eventually be destroyed. </span><br />

Evaluate the round under an offense/defense paradigm.<br />
The role of the ballot is to weigh the offense in favor of the aff advocacy against the offense in favor of a functionally competitive post-fiat negative advocacy. Two reasons:<br />
<br />
First, this interp is most fair because it gives reciprocal burdens to both sides instead of allowing the neg to moot the AC by questioning one of its infinite assumptions, giving the neg a no-risk, insufficient burden which the aff can’t weigh against or win offense on.<br />
<br />
Second, this interp is most educational because it deals with how philosophy is actually applied to the real world, i.e. as a guide for action instead of a pointless thought experiment.<br />
<br />
Finally, the neg must defend one unconditional advocacy. Conditionality is bad because it makes the neg a moving target which kills 1AR strategy. He’ll kick it if I cover it and extend it if I undercover it, meaning I have no strategic options. Also, it’s unreciprocal because I can’t kick the AC.<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Osama bin Laden has always had a very soft spot in his heart for Yemen, saying that it is “one of the best Arab and Muslim countries in terms of its adherence to tradition and the faith … [its] topography is mountainous, and its people are tribal and armed, and allow one to breathe clean air unblemished by humiliation.” Yemen is, of course, also the site of his family’s origin and he has often praised the Kindah tribe of which his family is part. The bin Ladens hail from the village of al-Rubat in the Hadramaut region, and Osama took his fourth wife from there. Bin Laden also has referred often to the religious importance of Yemen, noting the Prophet Muhammad’s high regard for Yemen because of its quick adoption of Islam after the faith’s founding and because he believed that from Yemen “would come 12,000 [fighters] who would support God and His Prophet, and they are among the best of us” (al-Islah, September 2, 1996). Abundant Manpower But affection is always overruled by the requirements of war-fighting in bin Laden’s mentality and</span> <strong><u>Yemen has long figured</u></strong> <strong><u>prominently in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the conduct of the defensive jihad in terms of </span><strong><u>manpower and geographic</u></strong> <strong><u>importance. Yemenis</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, for example, </span><strong><u>have had significant representation in al-Qaeda since its founding</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">: Tariq al-Fahdli, from southern Yemen, fought alongside bin Laden against the Soviets and was on Yemeni President Salih’s senior council; Nasir Ahmad Nasir al-Bahri (Abu Jandal), who was the longtime chief of his bodyguard unit, is also from Yemen (al-Quds al-Arabi, August 3, 2004). After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, moreover, bin Laden and several of his colleagues sent guns, money and Arab veterans of Afghanistan into Yemen to fight alongside the Salih-led insurgents who eventually defeated the communist regime of southern Yemen to reunify the country in 1990 (al-Qatan al-Arabi, December 27, 1996). Al-Qaeda’s first anti-U.S. attack—against U.S. troops on the way to Somalia—was conducted in Aden, Yemen, in December 1992. More recently, 80 percent of those involved in the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole were Saudis of Yemeni origin. The members of the al-Qaeda cell that the FBI dismantled in Lackawanna, New York in 2002 were all Yemenis. Furthermore, a significant number of the non-Iraqi mujahideen fighting U.S. forces in Iraq are Yemenis. Indeed, in late 2007 the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Hamzah al-Muhajir, called specifically on the Yemeni Islamists to provide more fighters to support the Iraqi mujahideen. On November 29, 2007, al-Qaeda’s chief in Yemen, Nasir al-Wihayshi (aka Abu Basir), publicly answered that he would immediately send more fighters. “Oh Abu Hamzah, here we come, oh, Iraq, here we come,” Abu Basir pledged (Message from the Amir of al-Qaeda in Yemen to Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, November 29, 2007). Lasting Geographic Importance Beyond “the extended manpower fighting for God in happy Yemen,” bin Laden and </span><strong><u>al-Qaeda have always valued what they refer to as “the strategic depth” that Yemen affords</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">(al-Islah, September 2, 1996; al-Quds al-Arabi, March 9, 1994). While bin Laden and his organization were based in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, for example, they established a sort of “naval bridge” that permitted the flow of guns and fighters between Yemen and Port Sudan in support of Hasan al-Turabi’s Islamist regime in Khartoum. In the other direction, bin Laden sent al-Qaeda operatives from Port Sudan to Yemen and from there infiltrated them into Saudi Arabia across the imperfectly guarded Saudi-Yemeni border as well as into Oman. In Yemen, bin Laden also cultivated ties with President Salih and prominent Islamist shaykhs—including Shaykh Abdul Majid al-Zindani, head of the Yemen Reform Party—and by doing so facilitated the growth of substantial al-Qaeda infrastructure across the country. Al-Qaeda’s presence in Yemen also brought it into closer contact with the Egyptian Islamist groups based there: the Gama’a al-Islamiyah and Ayman al-Zawahiri’s Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the latter of which later united with al-Qaeda. Finally, al-Qaeda has found that some of its Yemeni members are of great assistance in inserting al-Qaeda operatives into the states of East Africa, the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific, because of the Yemeni diaspora that was established centuries ago in those regions by Yemeni sailors and commercial traders. Operational Key and Base of Last Resort </span><strong><u>For al-Qaeda, Yemen provides a pivotal, central base that links its theaters of operation in Afghanistan, Iraq, East Africa and the Far East; it also provides a base for training Yemeni fighters</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">and for the rest and refit of fighters from multiple Islamist groups after their tours in Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia. Today, it appears to be an especially important safe haven for Somali Islamist fighters and the leaders of the Union of Islamic Courts who fled their country after the late-2006 invasion of Ethiopian forces. </span><br />

Terrorists need a safe haven for a large-scale attack<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Although the group [Al Qaeda] has been significantly weakened since late 2001, </span><strong><u>the only chance al Qaeda has of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> rebuilding its capability to </span><strong><u>conduct[ing] a large-scale</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> terrorist </span><strong><u>operation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> against the United States </span><strong><u>is under</u></strong> <strong><u>the Taliban's umbrella of protection.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Objections like Haass's are rooted in the following arguments: that terrorists don't need physical space because they can plot online; that the London and Madrid bombings prove deadly attacks can be planned in restrictive, Western, urban locations under the noses of local security services; and that denying terrorists one safe haven will simply compel them to move to another lawless region. I spent five years as a counterterrorism analyst for the Pentagon and rigorously studied plots from Madrid to London to 9/11. The above arguments may have merit in a piecemeal or abstract sense, but fall apart in the specific case of what we all dread: a large-scale, al Qaeda operation aimed at the United States. It is certainly true, for example, that terrorist groups can accomplish much online. Individuals can maintain contact with groups via chat rooms, money can be transferred over the Web (if done with extreme caution), and plotters can download items like instruction manuals for bomb-making, photographs of potential targets, and even blueprints for particular buildings. But all the e-mail accounts, </span><strong><u>chat rooms</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, and social media available </span><strong><u>will never account for the human touch. There is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> simply </span><strong><u>no substitute for the trust</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and confidence </span><strong><u>built by physically meeting</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, jointly conceiving, </span><strong><u>and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> then </span><strong><u>training together for a large-scale</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, complex </span><strong><u>operation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on the other side of the world. As the 9/11 plot developed, mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM) put the future operatives through a series of training courses along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Courses included physical fitness, firearms, close combat, Western culture, and English language. The 9/11 Commission report notes the extreme physical and mental demands KSM put on the participants -- even if the operation didn't require extensive firearms usage, KSM would have wanted the </span><strong><u>operatives</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to </span><strong><u>[should] be proficient under intense pressure</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, should the need arise. </span><strong><u>Juxtapose that with</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> an </span><strong><u>online learning environment.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> While you can no doubt learn some amazing things from online courses, </span><strong><u>it is far preferable to have a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> dedicated </span><strong><u>professor physically present</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to supervise students and monitor their progress. Or think of it another way: You wouldn't want the U.S. Marine Corps to send recruits into battle without training under a drill instructor, would you? KSM was somewhere between a professor and sergeant. Second, critics argue that the Madrid bombings of 2004 (which killed 191) as well those in London a year later (which killed 56) were largely -- though not entirely -- conceived, prepared, and executed within their respective countries, thus obviating the need for a safe haven. True enough. However, unlike 9/11 (which killed nearly 3,000), those plots' successes were possible due to their simple concept and small scale. In both cities, the playbook was essentially the same: Four to eight individuals had to find a safe house, download bomb-making instructions, purchase explosive agents, assemble the devices, and deliver charges to the attack points. Without trivializing the tragic loss of life in the European attacks, building those explosive devices was akin to conducting a difficult high-school chemistry experiment. On that scale, </span><strong><u>9/11 was like constructing a nuclear warhead</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. In every sense, it was a grander vision, </span><strong><u>involving 20 highly skilled operatives</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> infiltrating the U.S. homeland, who conducted a series of hijackings and targeted four national landmarks </span><strong><u>with</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> enough </span><strong><u>know-how, preparation, and contingency plans</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to be success. In one instance, KSM taught the 9/11 operatives to shoot a rifle from the back of a moving motorcycle, just in case. </span><strong><u>You can't do that in someone's bedroom -- you need space, [and] time</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, and the ability to work </span><strong><u>without worrying that the cops are listening in.</u></strong><br />

Targeted terrorists can’t find safe havens. They are shunned by communities.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Communicating</span><span class="ReadSource">targeted</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> killings can be done by informing wanted individuals that they are marked for death or capture. The easiest way to do that is to publish wanted lists and disseminate them within the community in which a target is suspected of hiding. Israel, as the aforementioned example illustrates, did so often. When it proved able to target individuals with precision force (capability), illustrated its resolve to do so repeatedly (credibility), and ensured that individuals appreciated that they were wanted (communication), Israel managed to change the behavior of some would-be terrorists. In an enlightening story published in Israel’s national newspaper Haaretz in 2007, Avi Issacharoff follows a group of Fatah-affiliated Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade militants known to be wanted by Israel. Issacharoff relates that the </span><span class="ReadSource">men</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">each have “social problems” due to their status as wanted individuals. They </span><span class="ReadSource">are unwelcome even in their own communities:</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> when the men visit coffee shops, patrons are quick to leave, lest they get inadvertently caught up in an Israeli raid; </span><span class="ReadSource">taxis refuse to give them lifts</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">; barbers and shop owners shut their doors when the men approach. “The most difficult problem the wanted men face,” Issacharoff writes, “is that they have become ineligible for marriage.” </span><span class="ReadSource">Fathers refuse to allow their daughters to marry the blacklisted men</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> so as to protect their families from the dangers association with known terrorists might entail. In the West Bank</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, Israel has capitalized on the despondency by offering amnesty to wanted men if and when they hand over their weapons, “swear off terror,” and agree to some form of surveillance on a probationary period. So long as wanted individuals refrain from terrorism, Israel will refrain from targeting them. To date, hundreds of individuals have joined the program. Issacharoff concludes that “the ‘glory days’ of Raed al-Karmi the legendary Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade leader who sowed terror in [Israel] until he was killed,” by Israeli commandos who planted</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> a bomb next to his home in 2002, “are over.”68 The message, repeated among once-active terrorists in the West Bank, is that terrorism simply does not pay. </span><br />

<strong><u>The very threat of coercion forces leaders to worry about their safety, hinders their freedom of movement, and requires that they spend time and resources in avoiding their own death rather than planning the death of others.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In a 2004 letter to bin Laden, AQI’s al-Zarqawi stresses this persistent dilemma. “What is preventing us from making a general call to arms,” he protests, “is the fact that the country of Iraq has no mountains in which to seek refuge, or forest in which to hide. Our presence is apparent and our movement is out in the open. Eyes are everywhere.”44</span> <strong><u>Leaders in hiding face the related problem of motivating and leading their followers; championing a cause from the frontline is far more effective than doing so from the safety of a bunker</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or villa in a neighboring region. Likewise, by eliminating skilled facilitators, organizations become de-professionalized. Finding individuals that are able and willing to replace eliminated bombmakers and tactical planners, for instance, takes time, notwithstanding the fact that not just any substitute will do. Few individuals have the skill sets needed to design and build effective bombs that do not prematurely detonate or the leadership characteristics required to successfully manage a military organization. While reports suggest that many of today’s top terrorist leaders are highly educated individuals, holding graduate, legal, and medical degrees, this does not necessarily translate into solid military and strategic know-how. Furthermore, </span><strong><u>attracting and recruiting the right people to a life of violent hardship</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that invariable comes with joining a terrorist organization </span><strong><u>can be difficult.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Even in the case of suicide bombings, </span><strong><u>it is not enough to simply equip and send out a great many operatives</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on suicide missions—</span><strong><u>the individuals need to have the intellect and training to know where to go, who to target,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> how and when to detonate their bombs, </span><strong><u>and what to do in case of mishap.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">45 They must also be trained not to renege on their decision to die and to know, too, never to get caught. In fact, there is very real danger in sending out poorly trained or intellectually unstable suicide operatives. “Dud bombers”—those that fail in their attempt to detonate their explosives—get caught and can crack under interrogation, causing irreparable damage to their group, cell, or operator.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Several other benefits of Israel's policy of targeted killing became apparent from its heightened practice during the second intifada.

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Insurgent leaders, knowing they are targeted by government forces, must make the critical decision to name a successor or not to name a successor. Some insurgent leaders name a successor to prevent internal power struggles or infighting when the leader is killed or captured. The presence of a second-in-command allows the insurgent leader to transfer his leadership legitimacy to his successor and also facilitates the continuation of insurgent operations once the leader is captured or killed by government forces. However, by naming a successor, the leader allows government forces to target the second-in-command as well as the leader, But In organizations where no successor is named, </span><span class="ReadSource">new leaders must establish themselves in the hierarchy </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">which results in delays in operations. For example, </span><span class="ReadSource">following the death of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Baitullah Mehsud, </span><span class="ReadSource">the leader of the Taliban in Pakistan, numerous people claimed authority</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to lead the Tehrik-i-Taliban.

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The results in Table 2 show that very few groups have radicalized after a crisis in leadership. Indeed, </span><span class="ReadSource">of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><span class="ReadSource">thirty-one </span><strong><u>cases of leadership crisis</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that we </span><span class="ReadSource">examined, only one group became more radical.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> In that case, the radicalization occurred after the arrest of the group’s leader. This finding differs from what we expected. Our second hypothesis was that assassinations would most likely lead groups to become more radical. Making a martyr out of a leader, we assumed, would lead to a strengthening of resolve and the subsequent radicalization of the group. Our findings provide no evidence to suggest that our hypothesis is correct. In fact, </span><span class="ReadSource">a group appears much more likely to disband or become less radical after the assassination of a leader.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> This suggests that the psychological impact of the assassination of a leader is not sufficient to spark a radical transformation in a group’s ideology. An additional explanation for our finding is that the assassination of a leader might often be accompanied by widespread attacks on the movement that disrupt much more than the top leadership, precipitating the failure of the group. Another possibility is that the assassination of a leader often greatly disrupts the movement, possibly causing a loss of funding, internecine fighting, and/or the loss of the leader’s unifying and charismatic personality. A related finding is that the </span><span class="ReadSource">assassination</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of a leader </span><span class="ReadSource">is more likely to cause a group to fail or disband than is</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> an </span><span class="ReadSource">arrest</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of the leader. This may be because a group is more likely to remain intact if members believe that their leader will eventually return to power. Alternatively, as in the case of Action Directe in France, leaders may be communicating with active members of the group from their prison cells, thereby perpetuating their influence (Dartnell 1995).</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The response was very different among nuclear and national security experts when Indiana Republican Sen. Richard Lugar surveyed PDF them in 2005. </span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">This group of </span><strong><u>85 experts judged that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><strong><u>possibility of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a </span><strong><u>WMD attack</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> against a city or other target somewhere in the world</span> <strong><u>is real and increasing over time</u></strong><u>.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The median estimate of the risk of a nuclear attack somewhere in the world by 2010 was 10 percent. The risk of an attack by 2015 doubled to 20 percent median. </span><strong><u>There was strong</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, though not universal, </span><strong><u>agreement that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a </span><strong><u>nuclear attack is more likely</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to be carried out </span><strong><u>by a terrorist organization than by a government.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The group was split 45 to 55 percent on whether terrorists were more likely to obtain an intact working nuclear weapon or manufacture one after obtaining weapon-grade nuclear material. &quot;The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is not just a security problem,&quot; Lugar wrote in the report's introduction. &quot;It is the economic dilemma and the moral challenge of the current age. On September 11, 2001, the world witnessed the destructive potential of international terrorism. But the September 11 attacks do not come close to approximating the destruction that would be unleashed by a nuclear weapon. Weapons of mass destruction have made it possible for a small nation, or even a sub-national group, to kill as many innocent people in a day as national armies killed in months of fighting during World War II. &quot;The bottom line is this,&quot; Lugar concluded: &quot;For the foreseeable future, the United States and other </span><strong><u>nations will face an existential threat</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> from the intersection of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.&quot; It's paradoxical that a diminished threat of a superpower nuclear exchange should somehow have resulted in a world where the danger of at least a single nuclear explosion in a major city has increased (and that city is as likely, or likelier, to be Moscow as it is to be Washington or New York). We tend to think that a terrorist nuclear attack would lead us to drive for the elimination of nuclear weapons. I think the opposite case is at least equally likely: </span><strong><u>A terrorist nuclear attack would almost certainly be followed by a retaliatory nuclear strike</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on whatever country we believed to be sheltering the perpetrators. That response would surely </span><strong><u>initiat[ing]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">e </span><strong><u>a new round of nuclear armament</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and rearmament in the name of deterrence, however illogical. Think of how much 9/11 frightened us; think of how desperate our leaders were to prevent any further such attacks; think of the fact that we invaded and occupied a country, Iraq, that had nothing to do with those attacks in the name of sending a message. </span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories.

Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. </span><strong><u>With</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> nuclear and</span> <strong><u>bio</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">logical </span><strong><u>weapons, the killing will probably never end.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">This paper will analyse the threat of cyber terrorism in regard to nuclear weapons.

For example, if a terrestrial command centre is impenetrable, perhaps isolating one nuclear armed submarine would prove an easier task. There is evidence to suggest multiple attempts have been made by hackers to compromise the extremely low radio frequency once used by the US Navy to send nuclear launch approval to submerged submarines. Additionally, </span><strong><u>the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> alleged </span><strong><u>Soviet system</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> known as Perimetr was designed </span><strong><u>to automatically launch nuclear weapons</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> if it was unable to establish communications with Soviet leadership. This was intended as a retaliatory response in the event that nuclear weapons had decapitated Soviet leadership; however it </span><strong><u>did not account for the possibility of cyber terrorists blocking communications</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> through computer network operations in an attempt to engage the system. Should a warhead be launched, damage could be further enhanced through additional computer network operations. By using proxies, multi-layered attacks could be engineered. Terrorists could remotely commandeer computers in China and use them to launch a US nuclear attack against Russia. Thus Russia would believe it was under attack from the US and the US would believe China was responsible. Further, emergency response communications could be disrupted, transportation could be shut down, and disinformation, such as misdirection, could be planted, thereby hindering the disaster relief effort and maximizing destruction. </span><strong><u>Disruptions in communication and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the use of </span><strong><u>disinformation could also</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> be used to </span><strong><u>provoke uninformed responses.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> For example, a nuclear strike between India and Pakistan could be coordinated with Distributed Denial of Service attacks against key networks, so they would have further difficulty in identifying what happened and be forced to respond quickly. Terrorists could also knock out communications between these states so they cannot discuss the situation. Alternatively, amidst the confusion of a traditional large-scale terrorist attack, </span><strong><u>claims of responsibility</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and declarations of war </span><strong><u>could be falsified</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in an attempt to instigate a hasty military response. These false claims could be posted directly on Presidential, military, and government websites. E-mails could also be sent to the media and foreign governments using the IP addresses and e-mail accounts of government officials. A sophisticated and all encompassing combination of traditional terrorism and </span><strong><u>cyber terrorism could be enough to launch nuclear weapons on its own</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, without the need for compromising command and control centres directly.</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In the rapidly mutating world of international terrorist organizations, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has become one of the most serious threats facing the United States. The recent AQAP attempt to use parcel bombs against U.S.-bound aircraft is only the most recent manifestation of this problem. The Christmas 2009 attempted bombing of a U.S. passenger aircraft in Detroit by a Nigerian radical trained by Yemeni terrorists was an earlier warning to the United States about the dangers of neglecting events in this country. Both of these near catastrophic episodes underscored the necessity for serious U.S. efforts to support all reasonable endeavors to defeat this organization with an informed, careful, and meticulous strategy based on a comprehensive understanding of Yemen and the terrorists. This requirement may be especially clear when one considers the chain of events that could be set off </span><strong><u>if AQAP is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> eventually </span><strong><u>able to implement a spectacular terrorist event</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Apart from the human cost of such a tragedy, </span><strong><u>severe public pressure will undoubtedly exist for military intervention in Yemen with U.S. ground combat troops</u></strong>.<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Such an</span> <strong><u>intervention would infuriate virtually the entire Yemeni population</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> regardless of the objective merits of the U.S. case for the offensive use of U.S. ground combat forces. It could lead to what al Qaeda refers to as a “bleeding war,” a struggle by the United States to pacify a hostile population which dissipates U.S. power in a hope to drive it from the region. </span><strong><u>Yemen could become</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> like the Iraq city of Fallujah in 2004, </span><strong><u>a cauldron of radicalism and anti-American hate</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. To head this off, AQAP’s capacity for spectacular terrorist strikes must correspondingly be ended soon while the organization itself must eventually be destroyed. </span><br />

<strong><u>U.S.-Russian relations have gone from bad to worse</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Last month, Russian President Dmitry </span><strong><u>Medvedev threatened to deploy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> mid-range </span><strong><u>nuclear missiles targeted at Europe</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. This month, Prime Minister Vladimir </span><strong><u>Putin called</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Sen. John</span> <strong><u>McCain a crazy man.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Though the Russian media are generally blaming Washington for this nosedive, the Obama Administration did the right thing when it took a principled stand on the recent parliamentary election in Russia, refusing to look the other way in the name of maintaining appearances of &quot;rebooted&quot; relations. Anti-West and anti-U.S. comments fired by Mr. Putin and his &quot;Mini-me,&quot; Mr. Medvedev, have to do with the rigged elections that delivered the parliamentary majority this month to the party that Mr. Putin leads. After Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized Russia's election process, Senator McCain alluded to massive anti-Putin protests in Russia in a tweet about Mr. Putin. &quot;Mr. McCain was imprisoned in Vietnam,&quot; Mr. Putin responded last week on Russian TV. &quot;They put him in a hole for several years. Anyone would go insane.&quot; It all started on the eve of the elections when Mr. Medvedev told the media that Russia will target the American missile-defense system in Europe with Russian missiles if the Kremlin does not reach an agreement with Washington and NATO on how the system would be built and operated. Mr. </span><strong><u>Medvedev</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, who led the ruling United Russia party to the polls in the country's Dec. 4 parliamentary elections, said Russia reserved the right to halt its arms-control efforts. He </span><strong><u>accuses the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates and its NATO allies </span><strong><u>of failing to negotiate</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> with Russia </span><strong><u>in good faith.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">To maintain the myth that the United States is a cause of all Russia's troubles, the Kremlin had long claimed that the deployment of such a system would tip the nuclear parity between United States and Russia in the U.S. favor, an allegation that most experts reject.</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">An enduring existential reality has been lost in Washington’s post–cold war illusions and the fog of subsequent US wars: </span><strong><u>the road to American</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> national </span><strong><u>security still runs through Moscow.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Despite the Soviet breakup twenty years ago,</span> <strong><u>only Russia</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> still </span><strong><u>possesses devices of mass destruction capable of destroying the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates </span><strong><u>and tempting international terrorists for years</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to come. </span><strong><u>Russia</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> also remains the world’s largest territorial country, a crucial Eurasian frontline in the conflict between Western and Islamic civilizations, with </span><strong><u>[has] a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> vastly </span><strong><u>disproportionate share of the planet’s essential resources including oil, natural gas</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, iron ore, nickel, gold, timber, fertile land </span><strong><u>and fresh water.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In addition, </span><strong><u>Moscow’s military and diplomatic reach can still thwart</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, or abet,</span> <strong><u>vital US interests around the globe</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, from Afghanistan, Iran, China and North Korea to Europe and Latin America. In short, without an expansive cooperative relationship with Russia, there can be no real US national security. And yet, when President Obama took office in January 2009, relations between Washington and Moscow were so bad that some close observers, myself included, characterized them as a new cold war. Almost all cooperation, even decades-long agreements regulating nuclear weapons, had been displaced by increasingly acrimonious conflicts. Indeed, the relationship had led to a military confrontation potentially as dangerous as the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. The Georgian-Russian War of August 2008 was also a proxy American-Russian war, the Georgian forces having been supplied and trained by Washington. What happened to the “strategic partnership and friendship” between post-Soviet Moscow and Washington promised by leaders on both sides after 1991? For more than a decade, the American political and media establishments have maintained that such a relationship was achieved by President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s but destroyed by the “antidemocratic and neo-imperialist agenda” of Vladimir Putin, who succeeded Yeltsin in 2000. In reality, the historic opportunity for a post–cold war partnership was lost in Washington, not Moscow, when the Clinton administration, in the early 1990s, adopted an approach based on the false premise that Russia, having “lost” the cold war, could be treated as a defeated nation. (The cold war actually ended through negotiations sometime between 1988 and 1990, well before the end of Soviet Russia in December 1991, as all the leading participants—Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, President Ronald Reagan and President George H.W. Bush—agreed.) The result was the Clinton administration’s triumphalist, winner-take-all approach, including an intrusive crusade to dictate Russia’s internal political and economic development; broken strategic promises, most importantly Bush’s assurance to Gorbachev in 1990 that NATO would not expand eastward beyond a reunited Germany; and double-standard policies impinging on Russia (along with sermons) that presumed Moscow no longer had any legitimate security concerns abroad apart from those of the United States, even in its own neighborhood. The backlash came with Putin, but it would have come with any Kremlin leader more self-confident, more sober and less reliant on Washington than was Yeltsin. Nor did Washington’s triumphalism end with Clinton or Yeltsin. Following the events of September 11, 2001, to take the most ramifying example, Putin’s Kremlin gave the George W. Bush administration more assistance in its anti-Taliban war in Afghanistan, including in intelligence and combat, than did any NATO ally. In return, Putin expected the long-denied US-Russian partnership. Instead, the Bush White House soon expanded NATO all the way to Russia’s borders and withdrew unilaterally from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which Moscow regarded as the bedrock of its nuclear security. Those “deceptions” have not been forgotten in Moscow. Now </span><strong><u>Russia’s political class</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, alarmed by the deterioration of the country’s essential infrastructures since 1991,</span> <strong><u>is locked in a struggle</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> over the nation’s future—one </span><strong><u>with profound consequences for its foreign policies.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> One side, associated with Putin’s handpicked successor as president, Dmitri Medvedev, is calling for a “democratic” transformation that would rely on “modernizing alliances with the West.” The other side, which includes ultra-nationalists and neo-Stalinists, insists that only Russia’s traditional state-imposed methods, or “modernization without Westernization,” are possible. As evidence, they point to NATO’s encirclement of Russia and other US “perfidies.” The choice of “modernizing alternatives” will be made in Moscow, not, as US policy-makers once thought, in Washington, but </span><strong><u>American policy will be a crucial factor. In the centuries-long struggle between reform and reaction in Russia, anti-authoritarian forces have had a political chance only when relations with the West were improving.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In this regard, Washington still plays the leading Western role, for better or worse.</span><br />

Evaluate the round under an offense/defense paradigm.<br />
The role of the ballot is to weigh the offense in favor of the aff advocacy against the offense in favor of a functionally competitive post-fiat negative advocacy. Two reasons:<br />
<br />
First, this interp is most fair because it gives reciprocal burdens to both sides instead of allowing the neg to moot the AC by questioning one of its infinite assumptions, giving the neg a no-risk, insufficient burden which the aff can’t weigh against or win offense on.<br />
<br />
Second, this interp is most educational because it deals with how philosophy is actually applied to the real world, i.e. as a guide for action instead of a pointless thought experiment.<br />
<br />
Finally, the neg must defend one unconditional advocacy. Conditionality is bad because it makes the neg a moving target which kills 1AR strategy. He’ll kick it if I cover it and extend it if I undercover it, meaning I have no strategic options. Also, it’s unreciprocal because I can’t kick the AC.<br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Several other benefits of Israel's policy of targeted killing became apparent from its heightened practice during the second intifada.

<strong><u>The very threat of coercion forces leaders to worry about their safety, hinders their freedom of movement, and requires that they spend time and resources in avoiding their own death rather than planning the death of others.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In a 2004 letter to bin Laden, AQI’s al-Zarqawi stresses this persistent dilemma. “What is preventing us from making a general call to arms,” he protests, “is the fact that the country of Iraq has no mountains in which to seek refuge, or forest in which to hide. Our presence is apparent and our movement is out in the open. Eyes are everywhere.”44</span> <strong><u>Leaders in hiding face the related problem of motivating and leading their followers; championing a cause from the frontline is far more effective than doing so from the safety of a bunker</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or villa in a neighboring region. Likewise, by eliminating skilled facilitators, organizations become de-professionalized. Finding individuals that are able and willing to replace eliminated bombmakers and tactical planners, for instance, takes time, notwithstanding the fact that not just any substitute will do. Few individuals have the skill sets needed to design and build effective bombs that do not prematurely detonate or the leadership characteristics required to successfully manage a military organization. While reports suggest that many of today’s top terrorist leaders are highly educated individuals, holding graduate, legal, and medical degrees, this does not necessarily translate into solid military and strategic know-how. Furthermore, </span><strong><u>attracting and recruiting the right people to a life of violent hardship</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that invariable comes with joining a terrorist organization </span><strong><u>can be difficult.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Even in the case of suicide bombings, </span><strong><u>it is not enough to simply equip and send out a great many operatives</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on suicide missions—</span><strong><u>the individuals need to have the intellect and training to know where to go, who to target,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> how and when to detonate their bombs, </span><strong><u>and what to do in case of mishap.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">45 They must also be trained not to renege on their decision to die and to know, too, never to get caught. In fact, there is very real danger in sending out poorly trained or intellectually unstable suicide operatives. “Dud bombers”—those that fail in their attempt to detonate their explosives—get caught and can crack under interrogation, causing irreparable damage to their group, cell, or operator.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Insurgent leaders, knowing they are targeted by government forces, must make the critical decision to name a successor or not to name a successor. Some insurgent leaders name a successor to prevent internal power struggles or infighting when the leader is killed or captured. The presence of a second-in-command allows the insurgent leader to transfer his leadership legitimacy to his successor and also facilitates the continuation of insurgent operations once the leader is captured or killed by government forces. However, by naming a successor, the leader allows government forces to target the second-in-command as well as the leader, But In organizations where no successor is named, </span><span class="ReadSource">new leaders must establish themselves in the hierarchy </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">which results in delays in operations. For example, </span><span class="ReadSource">following the death of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Baitullah Mehsud, </span><span class="ReadSource">the leader of the Taliban in Pakistan, numerous people claimed authority</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to lead the Tehrik-i-Taliban. The </span><span class="ReadSource">infighting resulted in the deaths of several</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Taliban </span><span class="ReadSource">leaders and the loss of time to conduct operations</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> against the Pakistani Government.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The results in Table 2 show that very few groups have radicalized after a crisis in leadership. Indeed, </span><span class="ReadSource">of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><span class="ReadSource">thirty-one </span><strong><u>cases of leadership crisis</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that we </span><span class="ReadSource">examined, only one group became more radical.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> In that case, the radicalization occurred after the arrest of the group’s leader. This finding differs from what we expected. Our second hypothesis was that assassinations would most likely lead groups to become more radical. Making a martyr out of a leader, we assumed, would lead to a strengthening of resolve and the subsequent radicalization of the group. Our findings provide no evidence to suggest that our hypothesis is correct. In fact, </span><span class="ReadSource">a group appears much more likely to disband or become less radical after the assassination of a leader.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> This suggests that the psychological impact of the assassination of a leader is not sufficient to spark a radical transformation in a group’s ideology. An additional explanation for our finding is that the assassination of a leader might often be accompanied by widespread attacks on the movement that disrupt much more than the top leadership, precipitating the failure of the group. Another possibility is that the assassination of a leader often greatly disrupts the movement, possibly causing a loss of funding, internecine fighting, and/or the loss of the leader’s unifying and charismatic personality. A related finding is that the </span><span class="ReadSource">assassination</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of a leader </span><span class="ReadSource">is more likely to cause a group to fail or disband than is</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> an </span><span class="ReadSource">arrest</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of the leader. This may be because a group is more likely to remain intact if members believe that their leader will eventually return to power. Alternatively, as in the case of Action Directe in France, leaders may be communicating with active members of the group from their prison cells, thereby perpetuating their influence (Dartnell 1995).</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">There has (thankfully) been no large-scale terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, and the number of American civilians who have died worldwide in terrorist attacks remains small. But as the chart compiled by the <em>Economist</em> and reprinted below shows, </span><u>terrorism deaths worldwide remain stunningly high. More than 7,000</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> people </span><u>died in terrorist attacks</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> around the world </span><u>in 2010, and that</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> number </span><u>was</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> actually </span><u>down from a high of nearly 13,000</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in 2007. The spike in terrorism deaths in the middle of the decade reflects the insurgency that developed in Iraq after the U.S. invasion. Sixty percent of the terrorism fatalities recorded in 2007 occurred in Iraq. So the “war on terrorism” is a long way from being won.</span><br />

Experts agree – nuclear terrorism poses the greatest risk of extinction.<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The response was very different among nuclear and national security experts when Indiana Republican Sen. Richard Lugar surveyed PDF them in 2005. </span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">This group of </span><strong><u>85 experts judged that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><strong><u>possibility of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a </span><strong><u>WMD attack</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> against a city or other target somewhere in the world</span> <strong><u>is real and increasing over time</u></strong><u>.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The median estimate of the risk of a nuclear attack somewhere in the world by 2010 was 10 percent. The risk of an attack by 2015 doubled to 20 percent median. </span><strong><u>There was strong</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, though not universal, </span><strong><u>agreement that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a </span><strong><u>nuclear attack is more likely</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to be carried out </span><strong><u>by a terrorist organization than by a government.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The group was split 45 to 55 percent on whether terrorists were more likely to obtain an intact working nuclear weapon or manufacture one after obtaining weapon-grade nuclear material. &quot;The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is not just a security problem,&quot; Lugar wrote in the report's introduction. &quot;It is the economic dilemma and the moral challenge of the current age. On September 11, 2001, the world witnessed the destructive potential of international terrorism. But the September 11 attacks do not come close to approximating the destruction that would be unleashed by a nuclear weapon. Weapons of mass destruction have made it possible for a small nation, or even a sub-national group, to kill as many innocent people in a day as national armies killed in months of fighting during World War II. &quot;The bottom line is this,&quot; Lugar concluded: &quot;For the foreseeable future, the United States and other </span><strong><u>nations will face an existential threat</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> from the intersection of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.&quot; It's paradoxical that a diminished threat of a superpower nuclear exchange should somehow have resulted in a world where the danger of at least a single nuclear explosion in a major city has increased (and that city is as likely, or likelier, to be Moscow as it is to be Washington or New York). We tend to think that a terrorist nuclear attack would lead us to drive for the elimination of nuclear weapons. I think the opposite case is at least equally likely: </span><strong><u>A terrorist nuclear attack would almost certainly be followed by a retaliatory nuclear strike</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on whatever country we believed to be sheltering the perpetrators. That response would surely </span><strong><u>initiat[ing]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">e </span><strong><u>a new round of nuclear armament</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and rearmament in the name of deterrence, however illogical. Think of how much 9/11 frightened us; think of how desperate our leaders were to prevent any further such attacks; think of the fact that we invaded and occupied a country, Iraq, that had nothing to do with those attacks in the name of sending a message. </span><br />

The Supreme Court's abandonment in the 1980s of federalism as a substantive limit on federal power was justified by the premise that state interests were protected in Congress by the &quot;internal safeguards of the political process.&quot; But this political process justification for federal intrusion into state prerogatives does not apply when federal courts apply CIL as federal common law in the absence of political branch authorization. </span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Finally, one might argue that a nation should follow raw international law to take into account the interests of foreign nationals. But it seems almost axiomatic that the touchstone of the American regime should be the welfare of Americans. But even assuming that the United States should take a more encompassing view of human welfare, American law may actually be better than international law at protecting the interests of citizens around the world. First, not all of the activities purportedly covered by modern customary international law generate substantial negative spillovers from one nation to another. For example, most of the American government’s decisions about human rights directly affect only those who have subjected themselves to the jurisdiction of the United States. Yet,</span> <strong><u>the United States’ power to determine its own law</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">in this regard</span> <strong><u>has benefits for foreigners.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> One benefit is that some individuals may choose to move to America, as millions do each decade, to take advantage of its particular bundle of rights and responsibilities. Moreover, </span><strong><u>all democratic nations may evaluate American rights and embrace as many as are good for them. If the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates </span><strong><u>had followed the prevailing norms at the time of the Declaration of Independence, it would never have declared the truths about the nature of man and government that have become the foundations of democratic processes around the world.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Nuclear, chemical and biological weapons continue to proliferate. The very source of life on Earth, the global ecosystem, appears increasingly endangered. Most of these new and unconventional threats to security are associated with or aggravated by the weakness or absence of democracy, with its provisions for legality, accountability, popular sovereignty and openness. The experience of this century offers important lessons. Countries that govern themselves in a truly democratic fashion </span><strong><u>[democracies] do not go to war with one another.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> They do not aggress against their neighbors to aggrandize themselves or glorify their leaders. Democratic governments do not ethnically &quot;cleanse&quot; their own populations, and </span><strong><u>they are much less likely to face ethnic insurgency. Democracies do not sponsor terrorism against one another.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> They do not build weapons of mass destruction to use on</span> <strong><u>or</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to</span> <strong><u>threaten one another [with nukes].</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Democratic countries form more reliable, open, and enduring trading partnerships. In the long run they offer better and more stable climates for investment. </span><strong><u>They are more environmentally responsible because they must answer to their own citizens</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, who organize to protest the destruction of their environments. They are better bets to honor international treaties since they value legal obligations and because their openness makes it much more difficult to breach agreements in secret. </span><strong><u>Precisely because</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, within their own borders,</span> <strong><u>they respect competition, civil liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">a new world order of</span> <strong><u>international security</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">and prosperity</span> <strong><u>can be built.</u></strong><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">If we are right to argue that raw international has a relative democracy deficit compared to U.S. domestic law, this conclusion undermines claims that the United States should simply evaluate international law norms on a case-by-case basis, following only those that have beneficial consequences. The key question is: who does the evaluating? If it is the ordinary domestic lawmaking process, then this approach is fully in accord with our position: that the United States should only allow international law to override domestic law if the former has been ratified by the domestic political process. If, on the other hand, the mere existence of a norm of raw international law is taken as justification for the claim that it is likely to have beneficial consequences, then the democracy deficit provides good reason to reject this conclusion.</span> <strong><u>To the extent that international law suffers from a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> comparative </span><strong><u>democracy deficit, allowing it to override domestic law will</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, on average, </span><strong><u>result in beneficial norms being replaced by</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> relatively more </span><strong><u>harmful ones</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. n104 This point holds true even if most rules of raw international law actually produce beneficial results. For example, let us assume that raw international law promotes &quot;good&quot; results 70% of the time, but because of its relatively smaller democracy deficit, domestic law does so 75% of the time. Even in this stylized situation, domestic law is likely to produce better results than raw international law when the two conflict. Assuming that there are only two alternative legal rules, one &quot;good&quot; and the other &quot;bad,&quot; in this scenario domestic law is likely to pick the good option and international law the bad one in about 56% of the cases where the two diverge. n105 It is important to remember that </span><strong><u>our argument is comparative. International norms are less likely to be of sound quality than those created by an established democracy such as the United States.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> This will be true both in cases where U.S. law and international law directly conflict and in those situations where international law seeks to regulate an issue that American law has left to executive discretion or to the private sector. A domestic decision to leave an issue to official discretion or to private initiative is just as likely to be superior to a competing international law norm as a domestic decision to impose a legal rule by statute.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">None of this alters the equally impeccable strategic logic underlying the use of law enforcement mechanisms in some circumstances. Nor does it alter the logic behind other forms of intelligence activities, such as surveillance or financial interdiction or even the use of open, full-on war. The United States can by no means rule out toppling a regime in pursuit of counterterrorism goals during the next ten or twelve years. But these are not disjunctive policies. </span><span class="ReadSource">Targeted killing is likely to increase as a policy preference as full-scale wars</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> decrease in number and intensity and </span><span class="ReadSource">become less desirable</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> as a means of effectuating counterterrorist objectives. </span><span class="ReadSource">Bush’s Iraq adventure has</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> surely </span><span class="ReadSource">reduced the US appetite for invading the tribal regions of Pakistan</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, for example, </span><span class="ReadSource">and something has to fill the gap.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> That need is in part what has augmented the Predator’s appeal, especially to the Obama administration. No doubt there will be political pushback—claims that the effect of the Predator campaigns in Pakistan are backfiring by mobilizing Pakistani anger over civilian casualties, for example. But given the political unreliability and military ineffectiveness of the Pakistani arm and its preference for artillery barrages over focused counterinsurgency operations, those arguments are not likely to persuade. </span><br />

Although the effect is quite large in magnitude, it is only marginally significant ( <em>p</em>-value of 0.08 parametrically and 0.13 non-parametrically) and is not significant when we restrict to the post–World War II period. The post-war results are difficult to interpret, however, because there are few observations of intense wars after 1946. Overall, we conclude that there is some evidence, but only weak evidence, for an effect on intense wars.</span><br />

<strong>Wars in the Middle East are of a new type</strong><strong>.</strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Formerly, the possession of nuclear weapons by the United States and the Soviet Union had prevented them, under the balance of the nuclear terror, from launching war against each other. </span><strong>In the Middle East, the possession of nuclear weapons</strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and other weapons of mass destruction </span><strong>leads to military clashes and wars.</strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Instead of eliminating weapons of mass destruction, the United States and Israel are using military force to prevent others from acquiring them, while they insist on maintaining their own weapons to pose deadly threats to other nations. But the production, proliferation and</span><strong>threat or use of [WMD]</strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> weapons of mass destruction (nuclear chemical and biological) are among the major global problems which </span><strong>could lead</strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, if left unchecked, </span><strong>to the extinction of life on earth.</strong> <strong>Different from the limited character of former wars, the current wars in the Middle East manipulate global problems and escalate their dangers instead of solving them.</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The moral legitimacy of targeted killing becomes even clearer when compared to the alternative means of fighting terror—that is, the massive invasion of the community that shelters and supports the terrorists in an attempt to catch or kill the terrorists and destroy their infrastructure. This mode of operation was adopted, for example, by the US and Britain in Afghanistan and by Israel in its “Operation Defensive Shield” carried out after the terrorist Passover massacre in March 2002. While many claim this method to be morally preferable to targeted killing—probably because it bears more of a resemblance to “real” war—I believe the opposite to be true. </span><strong>First, invading a civilian area inevitably leads to the de</strong><span class="ReadSource">ath</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">sand </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">injury </span><span class="ReadSource">of far more</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> people, mostly </span><span class="ReadSource">innocent people, than does</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> carefuluse </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">of </span><span class="ReadSource">targeted killing. </span><strong>Second, such actions bring death</strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, misery, </span><strong>and destruction to people who are only minimally involved</strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (if at all) in, or responsible for, terror or military attacks, </span><strong>whereas w</strong><span class="ReadSource">ith targeted killing, collateral damages is significantly reduced</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (though not prevented altogether). </span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Hence, targeted</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> killing is the preferable method not only because, on a utilitarian calculation, it saves lives—a very weight moral consideration—but also because it is more commensurate with a fundamental condition of justified self-defense, namely, that </span><span class="ReadSource">those killed are responsible for the threat posed.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Members of Hamas in Gaza are far more responsible for the threat of terror to Israel than their non-activist neighbors are; hence it is preferable from a moral standpoint to target the former directly rather than invade Gaza and inevitably cause great injury to the latter and to the general populations. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The change had meant </span><span class="ReadSource">the Predators ha[ve]</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">d </span><span class="ReadSource">a new job</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, one which was </span><span class="ReadSource">of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> absolutely </span><span class="ReadSource">vital importance.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> It was essential to find out </span><span class="ReadSource">if human weapons</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, human technology</span><span class="ReadSource"> could be sent into Hell and return</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.

The Predators were the vanguard of this exploration, the information they gained within the next few minutes would mark the start of the investigation. It was, quite literally, reconnaissance by fire. It’s orders received, the MQ-1B obediently turned around and headed for the shadowy ellipse that marked the Hellmouth. </span><br />
<br />
Also, Predator drones work very well.<br />
<br />
<span class="ReadSource">Slade-2</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">“Phase Two complete! Two solid hits, it’s chaos down there. Wherever it is, whatever it is, </span><span class="ReadSource">our weapons work there</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Look at that people, boy have we just kicked an anthill over.” The CIA Agent’s voice was triumphant, the camera on the Predator was showing </span><span class="ReadSource">[causing] a boiling mass of confusion</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> where the target had been. He </span><span class="ReadSource">[the demons] ha[ve]</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">d </span><span class="ReadSource">no idea of who or what</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> he had </span><span class="ReadSource">just killed</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, if indeed he had killed</span><span class="ReadSource">them, but there [is]</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">was </span><span class="ReadSource">no doubt of the destruction.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> The reviewing stand had gone, its position marked by a pyre of smoke and flame. There was just one thing to check and that was coming up soon. The Predator approached the Hellmouth and flew through it. It took a second for the optics to readjust but when they did they showed the blue sky and yellow sand of the Iraqi Desert. </span><br />
<br />
Satan comes first. It is the only impact with literally infinite magnitude. Absent drone strikes, people will suffer for eternity in Hell.<br />

 God exists:<br />
<br />
<strong>First</strong>, Pascal’s Wager means any risk of God outweighs aff offense. <strong><u>Kreeft 94</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/NCs/Consult%20Jesus%20NC%20(Long).docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">But </span><strong><u>the only chance of doing infinite justice is if God exists and we believe, while the only chance of doing infinite injustice is if God exists and we do not believe.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> If God does not exist, there is no one there to do infinite justice or infinite injustice to.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Second</strong> is the Cosmological argument. <strong><u>Kreeft-2</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/NCs/Consult%20Jesus%20NC%20(Long).docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">[non-bolded text is optional]</span><br />
<u>Everything that is has some</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> adequate or sufficient </span><u>reason why it is.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Philosophers call this the Principle of Sufficient Reason. We use it every day, in common sense and in science as well as in philosophy and theology.</span> <u>If we saw a rabbit</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> suddenly </span><u>appear</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on an empty table, </span><u>we would not blandly say, &quot;Hi, rabbit. You came from nowhere</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, didn't you?</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 11pt;">&quot;</span><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> No, we would look for a cause, assuming there has to be one. Did the rabbit fall from the ceiling? Did a magician put it there when we weren't looking? If there seems to be no physical cause, we look for a psychological cause: perhaps someone hypnotized us. As a last resort, we look for a supernatural cause, a miracle, but there must be some cause. We never deny the Principle of Sufficient Reason itself. No one believes the Pop Theory: that things just pop into existence for no reason at all. Perhaps we will never find the cause but there must be a cause for everything that comes into existence. Now the whole universe is a vast, interlocking chain of things that come into existence. Each of these things must therefore have a cause. My parents caused me, my grandparents caused them, et cetera. But it is not that simple. I would not be here without billions of causes, from the Big Bang through the cooling of the galaxies and the evolution of the protein molecule to the marriages of my ancestors. </span><strong><u>The universe is a vast</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and complex </span><strong><u>chain of causes. But does the universe</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> as a whole </span><strong><u>have a cause?</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Is there a first cause, an uncaused cause, a transcendent cause of the whole chain of causes? </span><strong><u>If not, then there is an infinite regress of causes</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, with no first link in the great cosmic chain. If so, then there is an eternal, necessary, independent, self-explanatory being with nothing above it, before it, or supporting it. It would have to explain itself as well as everything else, for if it needed something else as its explanation, its reason, its cause, then it would not be the first and uncaused cause. Such a being would have to be God, of course. </span><strong><u>If</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> we can prove </span><strong><u>there is such a first cause,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> we will have proved </span><strong><u>there is a God.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Why must there be a first cause? </span><strong><u>Because if there isn’t then the whole universe is unexplained</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and we have violated our Principle of Sufficient Reason for everything. </span><strong><u>If there is no first cause, each particular thing in the universe is explained</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in the short run, or proximately, </span><strong><u>by some other thing, but nothing is explained</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in the long run, or </span><strong><u>ultimately</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, and the universe as a whole is not explained. </span><br />
<br />
<strong>Third</strong> is the ontological argument. <strong><u>Plantinga 74</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/NCs/Consult%20Jesus%20NC%20(Long).docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">[3</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u>There is a possible world in which maximal greatness is instantiated.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> And the analogues of (27) and (28) spell out what is involved in maximal greatness: (30) Necessarily, a being is maximally great only if it has maximal excellence in every world. And (31)</span> <strong><u>Necessarily, a being has maximal excellence</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in every world </span><strong><u>only if it has omniscience, omnipotence, and moral perfection in every world.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Notice that (30) and (31) do not imply that there are possible but nonexistent beings -- any more than does, for example, (32) Necessarily, a thing is a unicorn only if it has one horn. But if (29) is true, then there is a possible world <em>W</em> such that if it had been actual, then there would have existed a being that was omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect; this being, furthermore, would have had these qualities in every possible world. </span><strong><u>So it follows that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> if <em>W</em> had been actual, </span><strong><u>it would have been impossible that there</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> be no such being. That is, if <em>W</em> had been actual, (33) “There </span><strong><u>is no omnipotent</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, omniscient, </span><strong><u>and morally perfect being</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">” would have been an impossible proposition.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Fourth</strong> is the argument from mathematical reality<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/NCs/Consult%20Jesus%20NC%20(Long).docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">[4</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Mathematical truths are necessarily true.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (There is no possible world in which, say, 2 plus 2 does not equal 4, or in which the square root of 2 can be expressed as the ratio of two whole numbers.) The truths that describe our physical world, no matter how fundamental, are empirical, requiring observational evidence. (So, for example, we await some empirical means to test string theory, in order to find out whether we live in a world of eleven dimensions.) Truths that require empirical evidence are not necessary truths. (We require empirical evidence because there are possible worlds in which these are not truths, and so we have to test that ours is not such a world.) The truths of our physical world are not necessary truths (from 2 and 3).</span><strong><u>The truths of our physical world cannot explain mathematical truths [because]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (from 1 and 4). </span><strong><u>Mathematical truths exist on a different plane</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of existence </span><strong><u>from physical truths</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (from 5). </span><strong><u>Only something which itself exists on a different plane of existence from the physical can explain mathematical truths</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (from 6). 8. </span><strong><u>[Therefore] Only god can explain mathematical truths</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (from 7).</span><br />
<br />
By virtue of being omniscient and perfect, God’s will represents the most accurate conception of moral law. Thus, the <strong>standard</strong> is <strong>consistency with God’s authority</strong>.<br />

<br />
I <strong>contend</strong> that <strong>God prohibits killing</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>First</strong>, Christianity is most likely correct. Only the existence of the Christian God can explain historical facts. For example, in the Old Testament there were over 300 prophesies made about Jesus hundreds of years before his birth, and every one was correct. The probability of any one man fulfilling just 8 of these prophesies by present day was found to be 1 in 10 to the 17th power. <strong><u>Stoner and Newman</u></strong> write<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/NCs/Consult%20Jesus%20NC%20(Long).docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">[5</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Suppose</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that </span><strong><u>we take 1017 silver dollars and lay them on</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the face of </span><strong><u>Texas. They will cover all of the state two feet deep.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Now mark one of these silver dollars and stir the whole mass thoroughly, all over the state. Blindfold a man and</span> <strong><u>tell [a man]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> him that he can travel as far as he wishes, but </span><strong><u>he must pick</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> up </span><strong><u>one</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> silver dollar and say that this is the right one. </span><strong><u>What chance would he have of getting the right one? Just the same chance that the prophets would have had of writing these eight prophecies and having them all come true in any one man</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, from their day to the present time, </span><strong><u>providing they wrote using their own wisdom.</u></strong><br />
<br />
When considering all 300 prophecies, the odds are even smaller.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Stoner and Newman-2</u></strong> explain5<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">There are more than three hundred prophecies dealing with Christ's first advent. If this number is correct, and it no doubt is, you could set your estimates ridiculously low on the whole three hundred prophecies and still obtain tremendous evidence of inspiration. </span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">For example </span><strong><u>you may place all of your estimates at one in four. You may say that one man in four has been born in Bethlehem: that one</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of these children </span><strong><u>in four was taken to Egypt,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">to avoid slaughter;that one in four of thesecame back andmade hishomeinNazareth;that one in four of these was a carpenter;</span><strong><u>that one in four</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of these </span><strong><u>was betrayed for thirty pieces of silver;</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that one in four of these has been crucified on a cross; that one in four was then buried in a rich man's tomb; yes, </span><strong><u>even that one in four rose from the dead</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on the third day; </span><strong><u>and so on for all</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of the </span><strong><u>three hundred prophecies and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> from them I will </span><strong><u>build a number much larger than the one</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> we obtained </span><strong><u>from</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><strong><u>forty-eight prophecies.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Second</strong>, Christianity prohibits killing. <strong><u>Exodus 20:13</u></strong> explains<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/NCs/Consult%20Jesus%20NC%20(Long).docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">[6</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Thou shalt not kill.</u></strong><br />
<br />
It’s in the New Testament also. Turn the other cheek. <strong><u>Saint Peter</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/NCs/Consult%20Jesus%20NC%20(Long).docx#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">[7</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">19 For </span><strong><u>it is commendable if a man bears</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> up under </span><strong><u>the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> 20But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But </span><strong><u>if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> before God. 21 To this you were called,</span> <strong><u>because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> 22 “He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.” 23 When they hurled their insults at him, </span><strong><u>he did not retaliate;</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> when he suffered, </span><strong><u>he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.</u></strong><br />

The ontological argument proves that God exists. <strong><u>Plantinga 74</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/NCs/Consult%20Jesus%20NC%20(Medium).docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />

<strong><u>There is a possible world in which maximal greatness is instantiated.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> And the analogues of (27) and (28) spell out what is involved in maximal greatness: (30) Necessarily, a being is maximally great only if it has maximal excellence in every world. And (31)</span> <strong><u>Necessarily, a being has maximal excellence</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in every world </span><strong><u>only if it has omniscience, omnipotence, and moral perfection in every world.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Notice that (30) and (31) do not imply that there are possible but nonexistent beings -- any more than does, for example, (32) Necessarily, a thing is a unicorn only if it has one horn. But if (29) is true, then there is a possible world <em>W</em> such that if it had been actual, then there would have existed a being that was omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect; this being, furthermore, would have had these qualities in every possible world. </span><strong><u>So it follows that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> if <em>W</em> had been actual, </span><strong><u>it would have been impossible that there</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> be no such being. That is, if <em>W</em> had been actual, (33) “There </span><strong><u>is no omnipotent</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, omniscient, </span><strong><u>and morally perfect being</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">” would have been an impossible proposition.</span> <br />

By virtue of being omniscient and perfect, God’s will represents the most accurate conception of moral law. Thus, the <strong>standard</strong> is <strong>consistency with God’s authority</strong>.<br />

<strong>First</strong>, Christianity is most likely correct. Only the existence of the Christian God can explain historical facts. For example, in the Old Testament there were over 300 prophesies made about Jesus hundreds of years before his birth, and every one was correct.

Also, even if Christianity is wrong, no religion explicitly says we should kill other people, so Pascal’s Wager still applies.<br />

Further, even if some religions say killing is justified in certain cases, we could always misjudge when those cases are, so it's better to never kill in order to prevent misapplications that lead to infinite harms.<br />

The value is morality. The criterion is <strong>respecting due process</strong>.<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The analogy between fair hearings, in legal and administrative proceedings, and participation in political affairs shows why the connection between procedures and outcomes is not merely instrumental. Just as democratic participation cannot guarantee the enactment of good laws, so </span><strong><u>fair hearings cannot always ensure the accurate application of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> authoritative </span><strong><u>legal standards. In each case, however, the process affords moral grounds for accepting the outcome, even when it is otherwise unjust.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> It is not merely that procedures are inherently imperfect, so that the correct outcome can never be guaranteed. More fundamentally, </span><strong><u>the right outcome is itself usually a matter of controversy</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">: divergent views can reasonably be taken both about the justice of (actual or proposed) legal rules and the appropriateness of their application in the particular case. These matters are, of course, closely connected because any particular case can raise questions about the meaning and scope of the general rule and, ultimately, in so far as there is no room left for argument over meaning and scope, questions about whether it should ever be applied at all.</span> <strong><u>When procedures allow genuine participation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, in the sense that questions of justice can be raised and answered, and where every rule is ultimately open to challenge and, accordingly, modification, </span><strong><u>the citizen is treated with the respect which his dignity deserves.</u></strong><br />

The state is obliged to respect and ensure the rights of every person to life and due process of law.” Thus, state actions are scrutinized according to international human rights law in order to assess the legality and justification for the action.</span> <strong><u>Amnesty International</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, in its report criticizing the Israeli policy of targeted killing, </span><strong><u>defined an extra-judicial execution as:</u></strong> <br />
“<strong><u>an unlawful</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">and deliberate</span> <strong><u>killing</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">carried out</span> <strong><u>by</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> order of</span> <strong><u>a government</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or with its acquiescence. Extra judicial killings are killings which can reasonably be assumed to be the result of a policy at any level of government </span><strong><u>to eliminate specific individuals as an alternative to arresting them</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">and bringing them to justice.</span> <strong><u>These killings take place outside of any judicial framework</u></strong>.”<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Currently, there is no specific evidence that the</span> <strong><u>targeted killing</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">program has been used for illegitimate purposes other than national defense and security. However, the Executive's exercise of authority in identifying and pursuing threats of terror</span> <strong><u>has produced a worrisome error rate.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> According to an analysis of Predator drone strikes in Pakistan conducted by the New America Foundation, since 2004, the non-militant fatality rate has been roughly 20 percent. In other words,</span> <strong><u>about one-fifth of those killed by Predator drone strikes have been non-military targets</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, including innocent civilians. </span><strong><u>In</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">June of</span> <strong><u>2010</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, it was reported that</span> <strong><u>the government lost</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> nearly </span><strong><u>75 percent of the cases involving habeas petitions</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">filed</span> <strong><u>by detainees at Guantanamo Bay.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> This suggests that </span><strong><u>for the majority of detained enemy combatants, the government has had insufficient evidence</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> for the assertion </span><strong><u>that the[y]</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> detained individuals</span> <strong><u>were involved in hostilities against the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates. The rate of error in these instances only adds to the concern over the procedural guarantees of the targeted killing process and the need for a more standardized process with a robust system of screening and oversight.</span><br />

Targeted killing is the key first step toward high-speed, technological warfare. Drones fundamentally alter the laws of war.<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Reapers and </span><strong><u>Predator</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">s – the grimly-named missile-firing </span><strong><u>drones remotely piloted by American agents with `Playstation mentalities' – blur the laws of war</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and threaten a new era of assassinations without accountability, </span><strong><u>warns the United Nations</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings.

Mr. Alston, </span><strong><u>an international law scholar</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and human rights expert, concluded there was nothing inherently criminal about firing missiles from drones, but </span><strong><u>warned that without clear rules and accountability, it could usher in a new era of chaotic, long-distance</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and </span><strong><u>anonymous warfare.</u></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Hence, phenomenal </span><strong><u>new military technologies</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> are being produced in the Third Millennium, described as the instruments of an emergent postmodern warfare, and envisaged earlier by Philip K. Dick and other SF writers. These military technologies, described in Messy Wars, are changing the nature of warfare and are part of a turbulent technological revolution with wide-ranging effects. They are helping to </span><strong><u>engender</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a novel type of highly intense &quot;hyperwar,&quot; </span><strong><u>cyberwar</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, or technowar, </span><strong><u>where technical systems make military decisions and humans are put out of the loop</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, or are forced to make instant judgments based on technical data. As computer programs displace military planners and computer simulations supplant charts and maps of the territory, technology supersedes humans in terms of planning, decision making and execution. […] Critics of cyberwar worry that </span><strong><u>as technology supplants human beings,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> taking humans out of decision-making loops, </span><strong><u>the possibility of accidental firing of arms</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> at inappropriate targets </span><strong><u>and even nuclear war increases.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Since the 1980s, </span><strong><u>Virilio criticized the accelerating speed of modern technology and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> indicated </span><strong><u>how it was</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> producing developments that were </span><strong><u>spinning out of control, and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that, </span><strong><u>in the case of military technology, could</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> lead to the </span><strong><u>end</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of </span><strong><u>the human race</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> (see Virilio and Lotringer’s Pure War 1983). For Virilio, the acceleration of events, technological development, and speed in the current era unfolds such that &quot;the new war machine combines a double disappearance: the disappearance of matter in nuclear disintegration and the disappearance of places in vehicular extermination&quot; (Virilio 1986: 134). </span><strong><u>The increased pace of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> destruction in </span><strong><u>military technology is moving toward the speed of light with laser weapons and computer-governed networks</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> constituting a novelty in warfare in which there are no longer geostrategic strongpoints since from any given spot we can now reach any other, creating &quot;a strategy of Brownian movement through geostrategic homogenization of the globe&quot; (Virilio 1986: 135). Thus, &quot;strategic spatial miniaturization is now the order of the day,&quot; with microtechnologies transforming production and communication, shrinking the planet, and preparing the way for what Virilio calls &quot;pure war,&quot; a situation where military technologies and an accompanying technocratic system come to dominate every aspect of life. In Virilio's view,</span> <strong><u>the war machine is the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> demiurge of technological growth and an </span><strong><u>ultimate threat to humanity, producing &quot;a state of emergency&quot; where nuclear holocaust threatens the very survival of the human species. This consists of a shift</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> from a &quot;geo-politics&quot; to a &quot;chrono-politics,&quot;</span> <strong><u>from a politics of space to a politics of time, in which whoever commands the means of instant information</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, communication, </span><strong><u>and destruction is a dominant</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> sociopolitical </span><strong><u>force.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> For Virilio, every technological system contains its specific form of accident and a nuclear accident would be catastrophic. Hence, in the contemporary era, in which weapons of mass destruction could create an instant world holocaust, we are thrust into a permanent state of emergency with hightech networks that enables military state to impose its imperatives on ever more domains of political and social life, as shown in Messy Wars’ chapter 3 about war environment. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Engaging in war gives us a goal to achieve and values to uphold through valor. Striving for peace creates life without purpose, resulting in “psychic numbness”. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">James <u>Hillman</u> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/NCs/Hillman%20NC%20(Short).docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span></span><br />

<u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When Neville Chamberlain</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and his umbrella </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">returned from Munich</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in 1938 after utterly failing to grasp the nature of Hitler, </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">he told the British people he had achieved peace in our time and</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that now </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">everyone should &quot;go home and get a nice quiet sleep.&quot;</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> These pages are thick with death in order to disturb the peace. The worst of war is that it ends in peace, that is, it absents itself from remembrance, a syndrome Chris Hedges calls &quot;collective or blanket amnesia,&quot; beyond understanding, beyond imagining. &quot;Peace is visible already,&quot; writes Marguerite Duras. &quot;It's like a great darkness falling, it's the beginning of forgetting.&quot; I will not march for peace, nor will I pray for it, because it falsifies all it touches. It is a cover-up, a curse. Peace is simply a bad word. &quot;Peace,&quot; said Plato, &quot;is really only a name.&quot; Even if states should &quot;cease from fighting,&quot; wrote Hobbes, &quot;It is not to be called peace; but rather a breathing time.&quot; Truce, yes; cease-fire, yes; surrender, victory, mediation, brinkmanship, standoff-these words have content, but peace is darkness falling. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When peace follows war, the</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> villages and </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">towns erect memorials with tributes to the honor of the fallen</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, sculptures of victory, angels of compassion, and local names cut in granite. We pass by these strange structures like obstacles to traffic. Even the immediate presence of war's aftermath, the rubble of London, the rubble of Frankfurt, the desolation through Russia, the Ukraine, become unremarkable to its citizens in the anesthesia of peace. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The survivors themselves enter a state of unperturbed quiescence; they don't want to talk about it.</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> The dictionary's definition, an exemplary of denial, fails the word, peace. Written by scholars in tranquillity, the definition fixates and perpetuates the denial. If </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">peace is merely an absence of, a freedom from</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, it is both an emptiness and a repression.</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> A psychologist must ask how is the emptiness filled, since nature abhors a vacuum; and how does the repressed return, since it must? The emptiness left by repressing war from the definition of peace bloats it with idealizations-another classic defense mechanism. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fantasies</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of rest, </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">of calm security, life as &quot;normal,&quot; eternal peace,</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> heavenly peace, the peace of love that transcends understanding; peace as ease <em>(shalvah</em> in the Hebrew Bible) and completeness <em>(shalom).</em> The peace of naivete, of ignorance disguised as innocence.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <u>Longings for peace become both simplistic and utopian</u></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> with programs for universal love, disarmament, and an Aquarian federation of nations, or retrograde to the status quo ante of Norman Rockwell's apple pie. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">These are the options of psychic numbing that &quot;peace&quot; offers</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and which must have so offended Jesus that he declared for a sword. To dispel such quieting illusions, writers along with those hounded by Mars roil the calm. The pages are thick with death because writers do not hold their peace, keep silent, play dumb. Books of war give voice to the tongue of the dead anesthetized by that major syndrome of the public psyche: &quot;peace.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">We must therefore accept and engage in war. It is precisely because war can make life solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short that war gives meaning and value to life. <u>Hillman-2</u></span><br />
<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 6pt;">[Hobbes] may also be understood psychologically so that the anarchic state of &quot;Warre&quot; awakens the citizen from the psychic numbing fostered by peace. Then &quot;solitary&quot; does not mean the lonely isolation of heroic individualism in competition with all others. Rather, &quot;solitary&quot; would mean the single focus of the soul which is one's invisible and indivisible companion. We are solitaries each with our own dying, and from this comes our values of courage and dignity and honor</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, those qualities of character</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that sometimes appear only under the ruthless conditions of battle.</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Solitary, as Camus wrote in a late ironic work, may be indistinguishable from solidarity----</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 6pt;">steadfastness, side by side with one's soul. The other four terms in Hobbes's famous dictum describing war also reshape their meanings. &quot;Brutish&quot; affirms the strength of our animal natures; &quot;poore&quot; restricts our human hubris. We simply do not have the means for the rampant exaggeration that pushes too far and asks too much, humbly recognizing as did Lear on the heath and the soldier in the trench that &quot;man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal&quot; (3.4.113). &quot;Nasty&quot; invites inspections of oneself and every other as the enemy, to plumb for shadows of ugliness, to sharpen street smarts, to perceive below the smiles and shibboleths that maintain the peaceful sheepish flock, worshipp</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 6pt;">ing the lamb of innocence. &quot;Nasty&quot; is the tiger who educates the lamb. And finally &quot;short&quot;:</span></em><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">war does not permit the childishness that looks forward to a long life wrapped in the security of expectancy statistics.</span></u><em><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> &quot;Short&quot; states that</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <u>there is no security in the human condition;</u></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> <em>&quot;short</em> </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">[war]&quot; exposes all of us to the arbitrary carelessness of the gods,</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> without insurance; and </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">that the length of life expectancy is not the measure of life. Life is better measured by the intensity and greatness of our expectations, because life is &quot;short.&quot; When these stark truths are steadily before us what comes to our hearts</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and habits </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">is</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> not more brutish nastiness only, but frequent instances of civility, </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">decency</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, fairness, </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">and kindness, because the soul recognizes these virtues to be supremely important when</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> limned </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">[portrayed] against the normalcy of &quot;Warre.&quot; This</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> surprising fact, though seldom and imperfect, </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">has been witnessed in reports from concentration camps, combat soldiers, prisoners of war, and others under extremes of duress where the conditions of the day were solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. These civilized virtues arise as from</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the underworld of </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">death rather than as preached moralities</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to be imposed </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">from above.</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Kant finds war serving a purpose in advancing history toward civilization, and he uses words such as courage and nobility. Freud writes (in the midst of the Great War, 1915), &quot;It might be said that we owe the fairest flowers of our love-life to the reaction against the hostile impulse which we divine in our breasts.&quot;sl He goes on to say: &quot;war is not to be abolished; so long as the conditions of existence among nations are so varied, and the repulsions between peoples so intense, there will be, must be, wars.&quot; The question then arises: &quot;Is it not we who must give in, who must adapt ourselves . .. would it not be better to give death the place in actuality and in our thoughts which properly belongs to it?&quot; When Kant and Freud in distinctly different times and modes of thought consider that civilization gains its progressive impetus from its base in the naturalness of death and the normality of war, they are confirming Heraclitus: yes, war is the generative principlewar fathers awakening, which was, I believe, Heraclitus's, the psychologist's, main and urgent message.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Therefore, the <strong>criterion</strong> is <strong>preventing aversion to war.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Loving war is not the utilitarian nightmare that you might think it is. It is rather our <em>aversion</em> to war that justifies the most violent methods of warfare, including the use of nuclear weapons. <u>Hillman-3</u></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Our American consciousness has extreme difficulty with Mars. Our founding documents and legends portray the inherent nonmartial bias of our civilian democracy. You can see this in the Second, Third and Fourth constitutional amendments which severely re strict military power in the civilian domain. You can see this in the stories of the Massachusetts Minutemen versus European mercenar ies and redcoats, and in the Green Mountain boys and the soldiers of the Swamp Fox—civilians all. And you can see it in the casual individualistic Texans at San Jacinto versus the Mexican officers trained in the European mold. Compared with our background in Europe, Americans are idealistic: war has no place. It should not be. War is not glorious, triumphal, creative as to a warrior class in Europe from Rome and the Normans through the Crusades even to the Battle of Britain. We may be a violent people but not a warlike people—and</span> <u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">our hatred of war makes us use violence against even war itself. Wanting</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to put </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a stop to it was a major cause of</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the Los Alamos project and </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Truman’s decision to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a bomb to “save lives,”</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> a bomb to end bombs, like the idea of </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a war to end all wars</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. “The object of war,”</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> it says on General Sherman’s statue in Washington, </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">“is a more perfect peace.” Our</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> so-called </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">double-speak</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> about armaments </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">as “peacemakers” reflects truly how we think. War is bad, exterminate war and keep peace violently: punitive expeditions, preemptive strikes</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, send in the Marines. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">More firepower means surer peace</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> We enact the blind god’s blindness (Mars Caecus as the Ro mans called him, and Mars insanus, furibundus, omnipotens), like General Grant in the wilderness, like the bombing of Dresden, overkill as a way to end war.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">I <strong>contend</strong> that <strong>targeted killing represents aversion to warfare.</strong></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Drone strikes eliminate the concept of a battlefield.

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Why dwell on this archaic god of war when war has moved on, when </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the entire action of battle has radically changed</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">? Napoleon, Grant, Eisenhower, and Patton too, belong to another era. The fleets of dreadnoughts at Jutland, and the hand-to-hand death struggles at the front-all memories and movies. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">War is now</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> either </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">devastatingly high-tech and executed by skilled experts with their fingertips</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, or so small-scale that war is fought by a single person with a bomb under her blouse or a sneaky kid leaving a school bag at a bus stop. &quot;When the Khmer Rouge marched into Phnom Penh ... the first troops were teenagers. Young girls, young boys, some under fourteen years old, bearing very heavy portable rocket launchers. The girls wore hand grenades around their waists and across their chests like necklaces.&quot; &quot;I was ten years old when a Viet Minh convinced me to go to a secret school. ... At night they took me into a cemetery, behind a gravemound where two people can sit unnoticed ... Sometimes they only train a child for one or two months before they send him somewhere with a hand grenade-inside the city or a marketplace.&quot; </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">No more battle rage;</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> cool. Different styles of war under the aegis of different gods with different styles of imagination. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Instead</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of Mars/ Ares, the strategies and political indoctrination of Athene,</span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> wars of words and leaflets, winning the hearts and minds,</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> conversion to reason, and the long-term planning of countermeasures to the long-term planning of hijackers and plotters. Instead of Mars, Hermes: invisible and instantaneous Internet communications, undercover infiltration, code-breaking, jamming, surveillance with night vision, hearing through walls, bribes, gifts, rewards, and financial laundering. Yet more threatening is the imagination of Apollo, &quot;the fardarter,&quot; as he was called, who killed with arrows shot through the air: the imagination of distancing. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Weapons far from the front, the front itself dissolved as war moves upward into the air, to satellites, [or] outer space</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, transformed by the Apollonic imagination into nuclear visions brighter than a thousand suns. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Where the wars of Mars pit armies against armies on battlefields outside the city, acknowledge[ing]</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">e </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&quot;open cities&quot; preserved from attack, the Apollonic style makes war against cities, against civilians,</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> against civilization-cafes, embassies, office towers-against water lines and power lines. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Children in schools [are] mere collateral damage. Meanwhile, the technician sits in his shelter</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> at the control panel </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">and</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> with the push of an orderly series of buttons </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">fires missiles</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that can take out </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> town </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">hundreds of miles away. He does not know the name of </span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">the place, </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the people, or see the flames.</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> He has commendably done his duty, obeyed orders exactly, even though he is less an actual combatant than the civilians he has killed. Apollonic distancing. Apollo, remember, could not consummate his relations. He chased but failed in closeness. The increasing distance between central command and actual engagement is not overcome by speedy communication. The feeling of distance between headquarters and front, between officers and men, that plagues armies with contempt and murderous hatred is reinforced by the Apollonic structure of vertical hierarchy. There is distancing in language with fancy names for special operations, acronyms for war and the places of engagement, and for casualties and death. It would seem Mars has been eclipsed.</span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Yet</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the ground must still be held under the soldier's boot. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The dead must still be buried. No matter the distance</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, the abstract language, the covert operations, explosions still blast, firefights erupt in close quarters, house to house, street by street, roadblock, check-point, river bank, thicket. War comes down to ground. Beyond the violent occasions of martial action, the god is also there, and essentially so, in the will to fight, the love of war, the rush to win and the rush of winning. And the fanatic 's sacrifice. Mars is the fire that tempers the men and melds them into a deployable team. His is the vision of war as the last resort that is the final life-ordeath determinant, or deterrent, within all strategies, subterfuges, and nuclearism. The impetuous passion of Mars makes war happen in the flesh and blood of history. If war were left only to Apollo or Hermes or Athene, war games, war plans, and maneuvers of the mind would be enough.</span><br />

<strong><u>Haddick 9/16</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/CPs/SFAP%20CP.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Does the Army need to prepare for another Afghanistan-sized training effort? It took 20 hours this week for Afghan police and international troops to subdue the Taliban insurgents who attacked several high-profile sites in downtown Kabul, including the U.S. Embassy compound. U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker described the attack as &quot;not a very big deal,&quot; while the coalition military commander, Marine Gen. John Allen, conceded that the Taliban &quot;did get an IO [information operations] win on this.&quot; Eleven Afghan civilians, four police officers, and 10 insurgents were killed during the battle. Although the attack did not display much Taliban expertise or have much lasting effect, it raises questions about whether the effort to train Afghan security forces is on track. Last week the Rand Corp. released &quot;Security Force Assistance in Afghanistan,&quot; a detailed study of the training program and its lessons for future large-scale training efforts. The report described the immense challenges specific to the Afghan case and cataloged numerous suggestions to improve the program.</span> <strong><u>The Pentagon</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and the rest of the U.S. government have </span><strong><u>learned</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> quite </span><strong><u>a lot about security force assistance from</u></strong> <strong><u>Afghanistan. There is a near-consensus among policymakers that successful assistance programs elsewhere in the world should be an effective and low-cost way of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> both </span><strong><u>preventing conflict and lowering the probability of future</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> U.S. </span><strong><u>military intervention</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">s. The question for the Pentagon is whether the Afghanistan case, with its high level of difficulty, should be the standard scenario that U.S. forces prepare for. The Rand authors found numerous shortcomings with the Afghan security force assistance program during the time of their field research. That research wrapped up in 2009 just at the time U.S. policy in Afghanistan was undergoing a major overhaul, many changes in top leadership occurred, and a large infusion of additional troops, equipment, and money came in. The researchers found that the assistance effort in Afghanistan lacked a tight linkage to the actual security requirements in the country, lacked appropriate measurements for tracking progress, and did not match up well with the enfeebled capacities of the rest of the Afghan government. In spite of the steep challenges of training an indigenous army in war-torn and largely illiterate Afghanistan, much has improved since 2009, some perhaps due to the interaction between the researchers and the training staff in Afghanistan. U.S. policymakers have high hopes for using </span><strong><u>security force assistance</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to </span><strong><u>build up regional</u></strong> <strong><u>deterrence, help partners prevent insurgencies and lawlessness, and reduce the demand on U.S. forces</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> for global security. Security force assistance and foreign internal defense training are normally tasks for special operations forces. But </span><strong><u>the training requirements in Afghanistan and Iraq were so large that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> conventional forces were drawn into the effort. </span><strong><u>The U.S. Army established new doctrine and wrote training manuals</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">for conventional combat units reassigned to assistance duties. But a sharp reduction looms for the Pentagon's budget, with the Army facing a substantial cut to both its force structure and very likely its training budget (indeed, the assistance effort in Afghanistan is getting a big cut). The Army envisions its combat forces having mastery of &quot;full spectrum operations,&quot; which could range from complex high-intensity offensives to &quot;wide area security,&quot; peacekeeping, support to civil authorities -- and security force assistance. But reductions in manpower and money for training will likely require officials to set priorities and make choices. Regarding security force assistance, Pentagon leaders will have to make a judgment about how many training resources should be consumed preparing conventional ground combat units for training duties. Do policymakers predict another &quot;worst case&quot; Afghanistan-scale assistance scenario, requiring training resources far above the capacities resident in the special operations forces? If so, in what other areas of conventional readiness are they willing to take risks? </span><strong><u>Over the past decade, U.S. soldiers have learned a lot about training indigenous security forces. Skill at security force assistance is a major U.S. asset</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> just like aircraft carriers, fighter jets, and missiles. And it will have to compete with those other assets during the looming budget crunch. </span><br />

Reliance on the alphabet for communication suppresses right-brain thought.<br />
<br />
Neurosurgeon Leonard <strong><u>Shlain 98</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/CPs/Pic%20PIC.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Aside from the obvious benefits that derived from their ease of use, alphabets produced a subtle change in cognition that redirected human thinking. For sophisticated neurolinguistic reasons the early practitioners could not have known, alphabets reinforced only half of the dual strategy that humans had evolved to survive. As we have seen, this strategy had three components: left brain/right brain, cone/rod, and right hand/left hand. Each tripartite half of this duality perceived and reacted to the world in a different way; a unified response emerged only when both complementary halves were used. </span><strong><u>All forms of writing increase the left brain's dominance over the right.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> As civilization progressed from image-based communication, such as pictographs and hieroglyphs, to non-iconic forms, such as cuneiform, written communication became more left-brain oriented. </span><strong><u>An alphabet, being the most abstract form of writing, enhances left-brain values the most.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Each letter stands only for a singular sound; meaning emerges only when letters are strung together in a row. Unlike icons, which often evolved from images of things, an alphabetic word bears no resemblance to the object or action it symbolizes. Nowhere in the word dog can we discern a dog. There remain some trace correlations, as with the word water, which begins with the letter w. The ancient Egyptians created a hieroglyph for water that resembles our letter w and to indicate water on a map, or in a cartoon, we still use a series of wavy lines. This iconic symbol for water became the alphabetic letter w and is a component of many words associated with the liquid state of matter (e.g., wet, wave, wash, wade, wallow, winnow, womb, and woman). However, we no longer connect the letter w with water directly. When we see w in print as part of a word, the brain issues complex directions that instruct the lips to purse so that we can pronounce the phonetic sound of w. </span><strong><u>Alphabets have long divorced themselves from the images of concrete things.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> They have washed out of the written language iconic patterns that were apparent in earlier forms of writing. All that remains are letters that stand starkly like rows of pier posts at ebb tide. The versatility of letters becomes evident when they are placed in regular, linear, consensually agreed upon arrangements. Aligning three letters to spell d-o-g results in the English reader instantly seeing a dog in the mind's eye. Yet the mental image of a dog was once attached only to a real dog, or to the invisible spoken word, dog. The induction of any member of society (usually a young child) into alphabet arcana numbs her to the fact that she supplants all-at-once gestalt perception with a new, unnatural, highly abstract one-at-a-time cognition. </span><strong><u>In this fashion, alphabets subliminally elevated</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, within each alphabet user, </span><strong><u>the influence of the left hemisphere at the expense of the right.</u></strong><br />
<br />
Right-brain thought is key to preserve the ecosystem. Left-brain dominance must be challenged to avoid extinction. <strong><u>Reuther 89</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/CPs/Pic%20PIC.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2</a>]</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The notion of dominating the universe from a position of autonomy is an illusion of alienated consciousness. </span><strong><u>We have only two</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> real </span><strong><u>options:</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> either to learn to use our intelligence to </span><strong><u>become servants of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the survival and cultivation of </span><strong><u>nature or</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> to </span><strong><u>lose our own life-support system in a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">n increasingly </span><strong><u>poisoned earth.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> This conversion of our intelligence to the earth will demand a new form of human intelligence. </span><strong><u>The dominant</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> white western </span><strong><u>male rationality has been based on</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> linear, </span><strong><u>dichotomized</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> thought </span><strong><u>patterns</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that divide reality into dualism: </span><strong><u>one is good and the other bad,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> one superior and the other inferior, </span><strong><u>one should dominate and the other should be</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> eliminated or </span><strong><u>suppressed. The biological base of these patterns is specialization in left-brain, rational functions in a way that suppresses the right-brain, relational sense.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> This one-sided brain development seems more dominant in males than in females, possibly because of later verbal development in males. This biological tendency has been exaggerated by socialization into dominant and subordinate social roles. Dominant social roles exaggerate linear, dichotomized thinking and prevent the development of culture that would correct this bias by integrating the relational side. Women and other subordinate groups, moreover, have had their rational capacities suppressed through denial of education and leadership experience and so tend to be perceived as having primarily intuitive and affective patterns of thought. Thus socialization in power and powerlessness distorts integration further and creates what appears to be dichotomized personality cultures of men and women, that is, masculinity and femininity. What we must now realize is that the patterns of rationality of </span><strong><u>left-brain specialization</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> are, in many ways, ecologically dysfunctional. Far from this rationality being the mental counterpart of &quot;natural law,&quot; it </span><strong><u>screens out much of reality as &quot;irrelevant&quot; to science</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and reduces scientific knowledge to a narrow spectrum fitted to dominance and control. </span><strong><u>But the systems it sets up are ecologically dysfunctional because they fail to see</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><strong><u>larger relational patterns</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> within which particular &quot;facts&quot; stand. This rationality tends toward monolithic systems of use of nature. Linear thinking, for example, directs agriculture, or even decorative planting, toward long rows of the same plant. This magnifies the plants' vulnerability to disease. Humans then compensate with chemical sprays, which in turn send a ripple effect of poisons through the whole ecological system. Nature, by contrast, diffuses and intersperses plants, so that each balances and corrects the vulnerabilities of the other. The inability to see the forest for the trees is typical of linear thinking. Linear thinking simplifies, dichotomizes, focuses on parts, and fails to see the larger relationality and interdependence. Ecological thinking demands a different kind of rationality, one that integrates left-brain linear thought and right-brain spatial and relational thought. </span><strong><u>One has to disrupt the linear concept</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of order </span><strong><u>to create a different</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> kind of </span><strong><u>order</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that is truly </span><strong><u>the way nature &quot;orders,&quot;</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that is, balances and harmonizes, but that appears very &quot;disorderly&quot; to the linear, rational mind.</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The proposition that the alphabet has hindered women's aspirations and accomplishments seems, at first glance, to be antithetical to historical facts. Western society, based on the rule of law and constitutional government, has increasingly affirmed the dignity of the individual, and in the last few centuries Western women have won rights and privileges not available in many other cultures. Most people believe that the benefits that have accrued to women are due primarily to a high level of education among the populace. But a study of the origins of writing in less complex times thousands of years ago reveals how writing, first, and then </span><strong><u>the alphabet</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, </span><strong><u>altered the balance of power to women's detriment.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Anthropological </span><strong><u>studies of non-literate</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> agricultural </span><strong><u>societies show that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, for the majority, </span><strong><u>relations between men and women have been more egalitarian than in more developed societies.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Researchers have never proven beyond dispute that there were ever societies in which women had power and influence greater than or even equal to that of men.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The questionable birth certificate: </span><strong><u>Why would any presidential candidate try so desperately to hide a real birth certificate?

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The reptilians make full use of what American Military War Colleges refer to as a &quot;Force Multiplier.&quot; In this case, it is mayhem, sexual predation, ritual murder and Genocide by PROXY. </span><strong><u>Rather than go to the trouble of manifesting in full physical density and having to individually rape</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, </span><strong><u>[and] torture</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and perpetrate genocide upon </span><strong><u>countless humans,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><strong><u>reptilians manipulate</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> individual humans as well as </span><strong><u>entire societies</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and nations </span><strong><u>to do the work for them.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> This is an important point to understand. The reptilians will manipulate individual males into becoming serial sex offenders and serial murderers and on a macro level, they will inculcate notions of racial purity and racial superiority into entire cultures which then serves as the basis and justification for those same cultures to perpetrate Genocide upon other races and societies deemed &quot;inferior&quot; or &quot;sub-human.&quot; If we as a Species ever hope to move beyond the control of the draco-reptilian overlords, we must first recognize the massive deception that has been foisted upon us. We must understand that notions of </span><strong><u>racial purity and racial superiority are inherently reptilian modalities</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. These reptilian modalities than </span><strong><u>[that] provide the justification for</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> individuals and </span><strong><u>entire cultures to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> perpetrate mayhem and </span><strong><u>slaughter</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> upon </span><strong><u>their fellow humans.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> This serves to further the reptilian's ultimate goal of a Global Tyranny because often as not United Nations troops become embroiled in the various regional conflicts. Those of us within the research community must be willing to point out the absurd fallacies of the reptilian propagandist and New Age Globalist. Starry eyed New Agers display the same kind of misplaced enthusiasm that so many young intellectual Communists displayed in the 1920's and 1930's during the worst of the Bolshevik Revolution's excesses. We must come to grips with the fact that </span><strong><u>the worst atrocities</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> perpetrated by humans</span> <strong><u>throughout history</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> has </span><strong><u>[have] been the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> end </span><strong><u>result of Reptilian manipulation.</u></strong><br />

Obama’s weapon of choice is targeted killing.<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The United States adopted targeted killing as an essential tactic to pursue those responsible for the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency have employed the controversial practice with more frequency in recent years, both as part of ongoing combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in counterterrorism efforts in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia (WashPost). </span><strong><u>Since assuming office in 2009, Barack Obama's [reptilian] administration has escalated targeted killings, primarily through</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> an increase in </span><strong><u>unmanned drone strikes</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> on al-Qaeda and Taliban leadership, </span><strong><u>but also through</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> an expansion of </span><strong><u>U.S. Special Operations kill/capture missions.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The successful killing of Osama bin Laden in a U.S. Navy SEAL raid in May 2011 and the September 2011 drone strike on Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born Yemeni cleric and AQAP propagandist, are prime examples of this trend. The White House points to these outcomes as victories, but critics continue to condemn the lethal tactic on moral, legal, and political grounds.</span><br />

Human Rights Council in Geneva on Thursday. It says that while targeted killings may be permitted in armed conflict situations when used against combatants, fighters or civilians who directly engage in combat-like activities, </span><strong><u>they are increasingly being used far from any battlefield</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. It states that &quot;this strongly asserted but ill-defined license to kill without accountability is not an entitlement which the United States or other States can have without </span><strong><u>doing grave damage to the rules designed to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> protect the right to life and </span><strong><u>prevent extrajudicial killings&quot;.</u></strong><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Six Justices on the Rehnquist Court signed on to the conclusion in Roper that the Court may, at least on some occasions, rely upon foreign sources of law. We submit, therefore, that such reliance is not likely to wane anytime soon, even with two new appointments, and that the real question for the future is not whether but when the Court will cite foreign sources of law. This is especially true since </span><strong><u>reliance upon</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> such </span><strong><u>[foreign] sources of law has a self-validating and snowballing aspect to it, wherein the more significant and widespread the Court's use of foreign sources now, the greater the body of precedent the Court will have to cite for using foreign sources of law in the future.</u></strong><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The evolution of international law since World War II is largely a response to the demands of states and individuals living with</span><strong><u>in a global society with a deeply integrated world economy.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In this global society, </span><strong><u>the repercussions of</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><strong><u>actions</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of states, non-state actors, and individuals </span><strong><u>are not confined within borders, whether we look to greenhouse gas</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> accumulations, </span><strong><u>nuclear testing,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the danger of </span><strong><u>accidental nuclear war, or the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> vast </span><strong><u>massacre</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">s </span><strong><u>of civilians</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that have taken place over the course of the last hundred years and still continue. </span><strong><u>Multilateral agreements</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> increasingly have been a primary instrument employed by states to meet extremely serious challenges of this kind, for several reasons. They clearly and publicly embody a set of universally applicable expectations, including prohibited and required practices and policies. In other words, they </span><strong><u>articulate global norms, such as</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the protection of human rights and </span><strong><u>the prohibitions of genocide and use of</u></strong> <u><strong>w</strong></u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">eapons of </span><strong><u>m</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">ass </span><strong><u>d</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">estruction. </span><strong><u>They establish predictability and accountability</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in addressing a given issue. States are able to accumulate expertise and confidence by participating in the structured system offered by a treaty. However, influential U.S. policymakers are resistant to the idea of a treaty-based international legal system because they fear infringement on U.S. sovereignty and they claim to lack confidence in compliance and enforcement mechanisms. This approach has dangerous practical27 implications for international cooperation and compliance with norms. U.S. treaty partners do not enter into treaties expecting that they are only political commitments by the United States that can be overridden based on U.S. interests. </span><strong><u>When a powerful</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and influential </span><strong><u>state like the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates is seen to </span><strong><u>treat[s] its legal obligations as a matter of convenience</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or of national interest alone, </span><strong><u>other states will see this as</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a </span><strong><u>justification to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> relax or </span><strong><u>withdraw from their</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> own </span><strong><u>commitments.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">If the United States wants to require another state to live up to its treaty obligations, it may find that the state has followed the U.S. example and opted out of compliance.</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">It is now possible to conclude that customary</span> <strong><u>i</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nternational </span><strong><u>law requires states to</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">take appropriate steps to</span> <strong><u>protect endangered species.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Customary norms are created by state practice &quot;followed by them</span> <strong><u>from a sense of legal obligation</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">.&quot; 250 Like highly codified humanitarian law norms that have come to bind even states that are not parties to the instruments promulgating them, 251</span> <strong><u>wildlife protection norms</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">also have</span> <strong><u>become binding</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">on nonparties</span> <strong><u>as customary law</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Closely related to this process of norm creation by practice is that of norm creation by convention: </span><strong><u>customary norms are created by international agreements</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">&quot;when such agreements are intended for adherence by states generally and are in fact widely accepted.&quot; 252 Several such [*31] agreements are directed at wildlife protection, 253 and CITES is one of them. It is intended for adherence by states generally 254 and is accepted by the 103 states that have become parties. In addition, some nonparties comply with certain CITES documentary requirements so as to trade with parties. 255 CITES is not &quot;rejected by a significant number of states&quot;; 256 only the United Arab Emirates has withdrawn from the agreement. In such circumstances, the International Court of Justice has observed, international agreements constitute state practice and represent law for nonparties. 257 Moreover, customary norms are created by &quot;the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.&quot; 258 Because CITES requires domestic implementation by parties to it, 259 and because the overall level of compliance seems quite high, 260 the general </span><strong><u>principles</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">embodied </span><strong><u>in states' domestic endangered species laws may be relied upon as another source of customary law.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> 261 Even apart from the CITES requirements, states that lack laws protecting endangered species seem now to be the clear exception rather than the rule. 262 That there exists opinio juris as to the binding character of this obligation 263 is suggested by the firm support given endangered species [*32] protection by the UN General Assembly and various international conferences. 264</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">For these critics, it is troubling that the United States bypassed international institutional involvement when it had been directly affected by the events of September 11, because this time there was United Nations (&quot;U.N.&quot;) sanction of the U.S. position, and international consensus on a suitable course of action was forthcoming. n42 For critics, the status of the United States as a hyper power has allowed it to consider itself as not effectively constrained by or subject to rules of international law, even when it has historically enjoyed a preferential status both legally and in practice within international governmental systems. n43 </span><strong><u>The U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates, however, </span><strong><u>mandates that other nations be bound by the same norms of international law that it routinely violates.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> n44 </span><strong><u>This</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> approach </span><strong><u>undermines the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> role and </span><strong><u>effectiveness of important multilateral systems both in the short and long term.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> n45 Critics maintain that U.S. foreign policy is, broadly speaking, blindly driven by a dangerous interplay of self-interest and short term objectives that encourages it to act paternalistically and also to unwarrantedly intrude into the domestic affairs of foreign nations. n46 </span><strong><u>These unholy alliances</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">between the United States and foreign governments eventually </span><strong><u>give birth to mutual mistrust and may bring about radical regime changes</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or even ignite revolutions. n47 </span><strong><u>Frequently, U.S. allies transform into foes,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or at the very best, the United States is dissatisfied with the performance of these governments and their inability to deliver on its mandate. n48 U.S. transgressions of international law in the form of reprisals are often a result of such processes taking a turn for the worse and are thus a consequence of its own creation.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Soft power is the ability to attract people to our side without coercion. Legitimacy is central to soft power. </span><strong><u>If a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> people or </span><strong><u>nation believes American objectives to be legitimate, we are more likely to persuade them to follow our lead</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> without using threats and bribes. </span><strong><u>Legitimacy can also reduce opposition to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">—and the costs of—</span><strong><u>using hard power when the situation demands.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Appealing to others’ values, interests, and preferences can, in certain circumstances, replace the dependence on carrots and sticks. Cooperation is always a matter of degree, and it is profoundly influenced by attraction…The information age has heightened political consciousness, but also made political groupings less cohesive. Small, adaptable, transnational networks have access to tools of destruction that are increasingly cheap, easy to conceal, and more readily available. Although the integration of the global economy has brought tremendous benefits,</span> <strong><u>threats such as pandemic disease and the collapse of financial markets are more distributed and more likely to arise without warning.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">We may be able for example to use our military power effectively as we did in Afghanistan to remove the Taliban government or as we did in the three and a half week campaign in Iraq, but the problems of wrapping up an organization like </span><strong><u>Al-Qaeda</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or governing a country like Iraq is that they </span><strong><u>are much less susceptible to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> solutions by </span><strong><u>military power</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> alone. Looking at Afghanistan you'll notice that we where able to replace the Taliban Government quickly but we only wrapped up about a quarter of Al Qaeda using military power. </span><strong><u>When you have a terrorist network with cells in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> 50 or </span><strong><u>60 countries you</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> simply</span> <strong><u>can't bomb them all.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Some of these cells are in places like Hamburg or Detroit, where you cant bomb them, </span><strong><u>the only way you can deal with that kind of a threat is through</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> close civilian </span><strong><u>cooperation. Meaning intelligence sharing, police work across borders, tracing financial flows and so forth.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The difficulty I see is if we focus solely on our military power and solely on hard power, we may forget that what we really need is to get others to cooperate with us to deal with these new types of threats…</span><strong><u>when we have less soft power than Bin Laden in those countries it makes it more difficult for us to prevail.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> If you accept my reasoning -that you need cooperation from other countries- when you allow the status or attractiveness of the U.S. to deteriorate to the point where being pro-American is toxic in domestic politics in another country, it's going to make leaders unwilling to cooperate with us. Unless the moderates win in that struggle inside Islam, we're not going to win. In other words, we have to be able to attract moderates if we're going to be able to prevent Bin Laden from attracting them, relating back to Rumsfeld's metric of them getting more than we are able to deter and kill.</span><br />

<strong><u>Soft power has always been a key element of leadership.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The power to attract—to get others to want what you want, to frame the issues, to set the agenda—has its roots in thousands of years of human experience. Skillful </span><strong><u>leaders have always understood that attractiveness stems from credibility and legitimacy.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Power has never flowed solely from the barrel of a gun; </span><strong><u>even the most brutal dictators have relied on attraction</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> as well as fear. </span><strong><u>When the United States paid insufficient attention to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> issues of </span><strong><u>legitimacy and credibility in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the way it went about its policy on </span><strong><u>Iraq, polls showed a dramatic drop in American soft power</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. That did not prevent the United States from entering Iraq, but it meant that it had to pay higher costs in the blood and treasure than would otherwise have been the case. Similarly, if Yasser Arafat had chosen the soft power model of Gandhi or Martin Luther King rather than the hard power of terrorism, he could have attracted moderate Israelis and would have a Palestinian state by now. I said at the start that leadership is inextricably intertwined with power. Leaders have to make crucial choices about the types of power that they use. Woe be to followers of those leaders who ignore or devalue the significance of soft power.</span><br />

<span style="text-align: center;"><span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><strong><u>AT ILaw Won’t be Enforced</u></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
1. That’s non-responsive. The IEER impact is about creating a norm of voluntary compliance through mutual trust. I don’t mention coercive enforcement.<br />
<br />
2. I-Law can be enforced through sanctions. The UN Security Council has effectively imposed sanctions on countries like Libya, Rwanda, and Somalia.<br />
<br />
3. TURN – the reason I-Law can’t be enforced now is because the US hasn’t complied. If the US complied with I-Law, other countries couldn’t get away with violations by pointing to the double standard of the US enforcing I-Law but not complying with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-align: center;"><span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><strong><u>AT Other ILaw Violations</u></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
1. Even if the US violates I-law in other ways, Fisher indicates that targeted killing is the only context where the US is actually getting called out by the UN for doing so.<br />
<br />
2. TURN – targeted killing is the key first step. Adhering to I-Law on targeted killing will set a precedent, leading to other violations being repealed also – that’s the Calabresi evidence.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-align: center;"><span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><strong><u>AT US Not Key</u></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
1. The IEER evidence is specific to the norms that US sets as global hegemon. If the US violates I-Law, it sends a message to other countries that violating I-Law is OK.<br />
<br />
2. The US has the largest economy, the largest military, the largest greenhouse gas emissions, and so on, meaning US compliance has a larger impact on I-Law’s effectiveness than any other country.<br />
<br />
3. Even if the US itself isn’t key, US compliance with I-Law sets the precedent for other countries to comply also.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-align: center;"><span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><strong><u>AT TK Doesn’t Violate ILaw</u></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
1. It doesn’t matter whether the <u>US</u> thinks it is violating ILaw. The problem is that <u>other countries</u> think we do, and it’s the perception that matters in terms of global cooperation.<br />
<br />
2. Even if drones themselves don’t inherently violate ILaw, the secretive and indiscriminate way the US is using them does – that’s the Fisher evidence.<br />
<br />
3. Prefer my Fisher evidence, two reasons. (A) Fisher cites the most recent UN special rapporteur, and (B) only Fisher speaks to the illegal way the drones are being used and not just the drones themselves.<br />

Targeted killing violates transparency. Drone policies are incredibly secretive.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Alston 11</u></strong> writes<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/DAs/Transparency%20DA.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The failure of States to comply with their human rights law and IHL obligations to provide transparency an accountability for targeted killings is a matter of deep concern. To date,</span> <strong><u>no State has disclosed the full</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">legal</span> <strong><u>basis for targeted killings including its interpretation of the legal issues</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">discussed above. Nor has any State disclosed</span> <strong><u>the procedural</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">and other</span> <strong><u>safeguards</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">in place to ensure that killings are lawful and justified,</span> <strong><u>and the accountability mechanisms that ensure wrongful killings are</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">investigated, prosecuted and</span> <strong><u>punished.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The refusal by States who conduct targeted killings to provide transparency about their policies violates the international legal framework that limits the unlawful use of lethal force against individuals. Transparency is required by both IHL and human rights law. A lack of disclosure gives States a virtual and impermissible license to kill. Among the procedural safeguards States must take (and disclose) with respect to targeted killings in armed conflict are: --Ensure that forces and agents have access to reliable information to support the targeting decision. These include an appropriate command and control structure, as well as safeguards against faulty or unverifiable evidence. --Ensuring adequate intelligence on the “effects of the weapons that are to be used…the number of civilians that are likely to be present in the target area at the particular time; and whether they have any possibility to take cover before the attack takes place.” --The proportionality of an attack must be assessed for each individual strike. --Ensure that when an error is apparent, those conducting a targeted killing are able to abort or suspend the attack. In order to ensure that accountability is meaningful, States must specifically disclose the measures in place to investigate alleged unlawful targeted killings and either to identify and prosecute perpetrators, or to extradite them to another state that has made out a prima facie case for the unlawfulness of a targeted killing.</span> <strong><u>States have also refused to provide</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">factual</span> <strong><u>information about who has been targeted</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> under their policies</span> <strong><u>and with what outcome, including whether</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> innocent</span> <strong><u>civilians have been</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> collaterally</span> <strong><u>killed</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or injured. In some instances, targeted killings take place in easily accessible urban areas, and human rights monitors and civil society are able to document the outcome. In others, because of remoteness or security concerns, it has been impossible for independent observers and the international community to judge whether killings were lawful or not. </span><br />

Commitment to transparency is key to avoiding extinction<br />

<strong><u>Boggs 97</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/DAs/Transparency%20DA.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u>The decline of the public sphere</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in late twentieth- century America poses a series of great dilemmas and challenges. Many ideological currents scrutinized here localism, metaphysics, spontaneism, post- moder nism, Deep Ecology intersect with and reinforce each other. While these currents have deep origins in popular movements of the 1960s and 1970s, they remain very much alive in the 1990s. Despite their di¡erent outlooks and trajectories, they all share one thing in common: a depoliticized expression of struggles to combat and over- come alienation. The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses </span><strong><u>is accompanied by a loss of public engagement</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, an erosion of citizenship </span><strong><u>and a depleted capacity of individuals</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in large groups </span><strong><u>to work for</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> social </span><strong><u>change.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> As this ideological quagmire worsens, urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved perhaps even unrecognized only to fester more ominously into the future. And such problems (ecological crisis, poverty, urban decay, spread of infectious diseases, technological displacement of workers) cannot be understood outside the larger social and global context of inter nationalized markets, ¢nance, and communications. Paradoxically, the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or side- step these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impo- tence. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to the increasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger num- bers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions.74 In the meantime, </span><strong><u>the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The unyielding truth is that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the United States, </span><strong><u>it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> This last point demands further elaboration. The shrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehow disappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people's lives. Far from it: </span><strong><u>the space abdicated by a broad citizenry</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, </span><strong><u>can</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in fact </span><strong><u>be filled by authoritarian and reactionary elites, an already familiar dynamic in many lesser-developed countries.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world, not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a reassertion of politics in more virulent guise or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collec- tive interests that had vanished from civil society.75 </span><br />

The report -- the most extensive effort by the United Nations to grapple with the legal implications of armed drones -- also proposed a summit meeting of ''key military powers'' to clarify legal limits on such killings. In an interview, Mr. Alston said</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">the U</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">nited</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">S</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">tates</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">appeared to think</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">that</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">it was ''facing a unique threat from</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">transnational</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">terrorist networks'' that justified its effort to</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">put forward legal justifications that would</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">make the rules ''as flexible as possible.'' But that</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">example, he said,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">could quickly lead to a situation in which dozens of countries carry out ''competing drone attacks'' outside their borders against people </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">''</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">labeled as terrorists by one group or another.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">''</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">''I'm particularly concerned that the United States seems oblivious to this fact when it asserts an ever-expanding entitlement for itself to target individuals across the globe,'</span><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">' </span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">Mr. Alston said in an accompanying statement</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;" class="underline">.

Earlier this month, calls for general strikes on Saturdays and Wednesdays took widespread effect across the country, although they were less well observed in Sanaa. Economic hardship was a driving force behind the initial protests in Yemen, where some 40 percent of its 23-million people live on less than $2 a day and a third face chronic hunger, according to international economic organisations. “There is no work. Most companies and shop workers have joined the protest either in the capital Sanaa or in other provinces,” said another researcher, Khaled al-Khazzan. But many ordinary Yemenis say they are ready to pay the price of their revolt. in the hope of a better future.“I was an employee who left his job because I really hope to find the right post after the revolution,” Ali Mohammed, a former education ministry employee, told AFP. </span><strong><u>Unemployment affects 34 percent of youth in Yemen</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, where under-24s account for 68 percent of the population. Potential donors, including Yemen’s wealthy Gulf neighbours, which have pledged $20 billion for Bahrain and Oman, both hit by sustained protests, have not rushed to aid their neighbour. “If the president agreed to sign the GCC-brokered, the Gulf states will give major support to relieve the economy of Yemen,” said Nasr. “But unfortunately, the president’s rejection really puts us in a serious problem which is the economic collapse that may lead to chaos in the country in the next few days,” he said. Clashes between security forces and followers of powerful tribal chief Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar broke out on Monday after Saleh refused to sign a transition deal with the opposition sponsored by the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. Meanwhile, international pressures have mounted on the veteran leader to sign the deal and prevent further bloodshed. Since late January, security forces and armed Saleh supporters have mounted a bloody crackdown on protests demanding his ouster, killing at least 181 people, according to a toll compiled from reports by activists and medics. The latest fighting alone has brought to at least 68 the number killed since Monday, according to an AFP tally based on reports from medics, the government and tribal sources. Scores of others have been wounded.</span><br />

<strong><u>Troops</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> at the headquarters of Yemen's elite Republican Guard </span><strong><u>opened fire on Sunday at a protest by soldiers demanding the ouster of their brigade chief over corruption charges</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, a military source said.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Soldiers from the fourth brigade of the Republican Guard were demanding the removal of Abdulmalik al-Arar and another top officer named Abdullah al-Hamiya, the source said, adding that no casualties were reported in the shooting.</span><br />
<strong><u>The protest follows similar moves</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> by soldiers and police in other areas of the military </span><strong><u>demanding change</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> since embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh quit the country last week after handing power to his deputy.</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">On Saturday, hundreds of air force personnel in Sanaa and Taez demanded the ouster of air force commander Mohammed Saleh al-Ahmar, a half-brother of Saleh.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">After months of protests, the veteran Saleh finally signed in November a deal under which he agreed to transfer his powers to his deputy Abdrabuh Mansur Hadi.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">He also received blanket immunity against prosecution from parliament, as protesters on the streets insisted that he face trial.</span><br />

<strong><u>An Obama administration plan to increase drone strikes in Yemen</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> may be one way to eliminate Islamic militants hiding within the rugged country, but it </span><strong><u>could prove a risky gambit</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. A US official told The Washington Post this week that the administration may expand its current military drone campaign over Yemen by bringing in a CIA drone group to find and root out Al Qaeda operatives, much like it does in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Washington is concerned that ongoing unrest in Yemen will give Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) cover to organize and plan attacks and intensify fighting between Yemeni forces and Islamic militants, who have recently captured the town of Zinjibar in south-central Yemen But inherent risks come with greater reliance on drones. </span><strong><u>Previous strikes in Yemen</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> have </span><strong><u>had devastating consequences,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> killing innocent people and</span> <strong><u>adding to the economic trouble</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and social turmoil </span><strong><u>of a country in the midst of civil war.

It is a violation of Yemen’s sovereignty and a crime committed against the Yemeni people,&quot; says Ahmed al-Shabwani, whose brother, former deputy governor of the Marib Governorate Jabr al-Shabwani, was accidentally killed in a May 2010 US drone strike.Even after being paid blood money by the Saleh regime,</span> <strong><u>the Al Shabwani family carried out attacks against</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Marib’s </span><strong><u>oil and power infrastructure demanding that</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><strong><u>Yemen</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">i government </span><strong><u>stop cooperating with</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><strong><u>US drone</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and missile </span><strong><u>strikes</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">.“Marib’s sovereignty has been breached.

Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda, is facing unrelenting anti-government protests and fresh defections among the ruling elite that are adding to pressure for him to resign after 32 years in power. Asked whether the United States still supported Saleh or if it was time for him to go, Gates said: &quot;I don't think it's my place to talk about internal affairs in Yemen.&quot;&quot;We are obviously concerned about the instability in Yemen,&quot; Gates said during a trip to Russia.</span> <strong><u>He added that the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates </span><strong><u>considered al Qaeda's Yemen-based branch</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) perhaps </span><strong><u>its most dangerous affiliate.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">&quot;</span><strong><u>And so instability and diversion of attention from dealing with AQAP is</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> my </span><strong><u>[the] primary concern about the situation,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">&quot; he said.

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Osama bin Laden has always had a very soft spot in his heart for Yemen, saying that it is “one of the best Arab and Muslim countries in terms of its adherence to tradition and the faith … [its] topography is mountainous, and its people are tribal and armed, and allow one to breathe clean air unblemished by humiliation.” Yemen is, of course, also the site of his family’s origin and he has often praised the Kindah tribe of which his family is part. The bin Ladens hail from the village of al-Rubat in the Hadramaut region, and Osama took his fourth wife from there. Bin Laden also has referred often to the religious importance of Yemen, noting the Prophet Muhammad’s high regard for Yemen because of its quick adoption of Islam after the faith’s founding and because he believed that from Yemen “would come 12,000 [fighters] who would support God and His Prophet, and they are among the best of us” (al-Islah, September 2, 1996). Abundant Manpower But affection is always overruled by the requirements of war-fighting in bin Laden’s mentality and</span> <strong><u>Yemen has long figured</u></strong> <strong><u>prominently in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the conduct of the defensive jihad in terms of </span><strong><u>manpower and geographic</u></strong> <strong><u>importance. Yemenis</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, for example, </span><strong><u>have had significant representation in al-Qaeda since its founding</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">: Tariq al-Fahdli, from southern Yemen, fought alongside bin Laden against the Soviets and was on Yemeni President Salih’s senior council; Nasir Ahmad Nasir al-Bahri (Abu Jandal), who was the longtime chief of his bodyguard unit, is also from Yemen (al-Quds al-Arabi, August 3, 2004). After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, moreover, bin Laden and several of his colleagues sent guns, money and Arab veterans of Afghanistan into Yemen to fight alongside the Salih-led insurgents who eventually defeated the communist regime of southern Yemen to reunify the country in 1990 (al-Qatan al-Arabi, December 27, 1996). Al-Qaeda’s first anti-U.S. attack—against U.S. troops on the way to Somalia—was conducted in Aden, Yemen, in December 1992. More recently, 80 percent of those involved in the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole were Saudis of Yemeni origin. The members of the al-Qaeda cell that the FBI dismantled in Lackawanna, New York in 2002 were all Yemenis. Furthermore, a significant number of the non-Iraqi mujahideen fighting U.S. forces in Iraq are Yemenis. Indeed, in late 2007 the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Hamzah al-Muhajir, called specifically on the Yemeni Islamists to provide more fighters to support the Iraqi mujahideen. On November 29, 2007, al-Qaeda’s chief in Yemen, Nasir al-Wihayshi (aka Abu Basir), publicly answered that he would immediately send more fighters. “Oh Abu Hamzah, here we come, oh, Iraq, here we come,” Abu Basir pledged (Message from the Amir of al-Qaeda in Yemen to Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, November 29, 2007). Lasting Geographic Importance Beyond “the extended manpower fighting for God in happy Yemen,” bin Laden and </span><strong><u>al-Qaeda have always valued what they refer to as “the strategic depth” that Yemen affords</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">(al-Islah, September 2, 1996; al-Quds al-Arabi, March 9, 1994). While bin Laden and his organization were based in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, for example, they established a sort of “naval bridge” that permitted the flow of guns and fighters between Yemen and Port Sudan in support of Hasan al-Turabi’s Islamist regime in Khartoum. In the other direction, bin Laden sent al-Qaeda operatives from Port Sudan to Yemen and from there infiltrated them into Saudi Arabia across the imperfectly guarded Saudi-Yemeni border as well as into Oman. In Yemen, bin Laden also cultivated ties with President Salih and prominent Islamist shaykhs—including Shaykh Abdul Majid al-Zindani, head of the Yemen Reform Party—and by doing so facilitated the growth of substantial al-Qaeda infrastructure across the country. Al-Qaeda’s presence in Yemen also brought it into closer contact with the Egyptian Islamist groups based there: the Gama’a al-Islamiyah and Ayman al-Zawahiri’s Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the latter of which later united with al-Qaeda. Finally, al-Qaeda has found that some of its Yemeni members are of great assistance in inserting al-Qaeda operatives into the states of East Africa, the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific, because of the Yemeni diaspora that was established centuries ago in those regions by Yemeni sailors and commercial traders. Operational Key and Base of Last Resort </span><strong><u>For al-Qaeda, Yemen provides a pivotal, central base that links its theaters of operation in Afghanistan, Iraq, East Africa and the Far East; it also provides a base for training Yemeni fighters</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and for the rest and refit of fighters from multiple Islamist groups after their tours in Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia. Today, it appears to be an especially important safe haven for Somali Islamist fighters and the leaders of the Union of Islamic Courts who fled their country after the late-2006 invasion of Ethiopian forces. </span><br />

Yemen economic collapse destabilizes the Yemeni government. <strong><u>Boucek 11</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/DAs/Yemen%20Econ%20DA.docx#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">[7</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Interrelated economic, demographic, and domestic security challenges are converging to threaten the stability of Yemen.</span> <strong><u>At the heart of the country’s problems is a looming economic collapse.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Yemen’s oil reserves are fast running out, with few viable options for a sustainable post-oil economy. </span><strong><u>Yemen is the poorest country in the Arab world</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, with most people surviving on less than two dollars per day and, in many places, just one dollar per day. </span><strong><u>Its population growth rate</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, which exceeds 3 percent per year, </span><strong><u>is among the world’s highest.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The government has been unable to provide adequate educational or other public services 2 for the rapidly expanding population, more than two-thirds of which is under the age of 24, and illiteracy stands at over 50 percent in general and close to 70 percent for women. The failing economy and poorly prepared workforce have pushed unemployment to almost 40 percent.</span> <strong><u>The country’s dire economic circumstances will soon limit the government’s ability to deliver the funds needed to hold the country together.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The population is expected to double to 40 million over the next two decades, by which time Yemen will no longer be an oil producer, and its water resources will be severely diminished. </span><strong><u>This is currently the greatest source of violence in the country; an estimated 80 percent of violence in Yemen is about access to water.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> A rapidly expanding and increasingly poorer population places unbearable pressure on the government’s ability to provide basic services. Domestic security is endangered by Islamist terrorism, magnified by a resurgent al-Qaeda organization, an armed insurrection in the North, and an active secessionist movement in the South.</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The violence and </span><strong><u>civil unrest wracking Yemen has</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> almost certainly </span><strong><u>curtailed the ability of American intelligence officers to travel, meet with people and collect</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> much </span><strong><u>information</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> pertaining to AQAP, especially in places that have fallen under militant control. </span><strong><u>Additionally, the attention of U.S. intelligence agencies has</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in all likelihood </span><strong><u>been diverted to</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">the task of trying to gather intelligence pertaining to </span><strong><u>what is happening with</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Saleh and </span><strong><u>the opposition rather than</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> what is happening with</span> <strong><u>AQAP.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> This will likely provide AQAP with some breathing room. The United States has been quietly active in Yemen, albeit in a limited way, under the auspices of the Yemeni government. If the Islamist old guard in the military assumes power, it is quite likely that this operational arrangement will not continue — at least not initially. Because of this, should the United States believe that the Saleh regime is about to fall, it may no longer be concerned about alienating the tribes that have supported Saleh, and if it has somehow obtained good intelligence regarding the location of various high-value AQAP targets, it may feel compelled to take unilateral action to attack those targets. Such an operational window will likely be limited, however, and once Saleh leaves, such opportunities will likely be lost. If the United States is not able to take such unilateral action, </span><strong><u>AQAP will have an excellent opportunity to grow and flourish due to the preoccupation of Yemeni security forces with other things, and</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the possibility of having </span><strong><u>even more sympathizers in the government. Not only will this</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> likely </span><strong><u>result in fewer offensive operations against AQAP</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in the tribal areas, </span><strong><u>but the group will also</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> likely be able to </span><strong><u>acquire additional resources and weapons.</u></strong><br />

Continued drone strikes destabilize Pakistan.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Innocent 09</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/DAs/Pakistan%20DA.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The death of the radical Taliban commander was a success for Pakistan and the United States. However, the method used may well produce dangerous unintended consequences in how it might undermine one of the United States' primary interests. </span><strong><u>Chaos in Afghanistan could spill over and destabilize</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> neighboring </span><strong><u>Pakistan. That's why</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the efficacy of </span><strong><u>missile strikes must be reassessed.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The targeting of tribal safe havens by CIA-operated</span> <strong><u>drone strikes strengthen</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">s the very </span><strong><u>jihadist forces</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that America seeks to defeat, </span><strong><u>by alienating hearts and minds in a fragile, nuclear-armed, Muslim-majority Pakistani state.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> During a recent visit to the frontier region, I spoke with several South Waziri tribesmen about the impact of US missile strikes. They recounted how</span> <strong><u>militants exploit</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><strong><u>popular resentment felt from</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the</span> <strong><u>accidental killing of innocents</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and defined themselves as a force against the injustice of a hostile foreign occupation. The ability to keep militant groups off balance must be weighed against the cost of facilitating the rise of more insurgents. </span><strong><u>Missile strikes alienate thousands of clans</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, sub-clans and extended families </span><strong><u>within a tribal society</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> that places high social value on honor and revenge. To the Pashtun tribes straddling the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, personal and collective vendettas have been known to last for generations, and are invoked irrespective of time and cost involved. Successive waves of Persian, Greek, Arab, Turk, Mughal, British and Soviet invaders have never successfully subdued this thin slice of rugged terrain.On August 12, the US special envoy for the region, Richard Holbrooke, told an audience at the Center for American Progress that the porous border and its surrounding areas served as a fertile recruiting ground for Al-Qaeda. One US military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, called drone operations [are] &quot;a recruiting windfall for the Pakistani Taliban.&quot; Military strikes appear to be the only viable recourse against the tribal region's shadowy insurgents, with US officials pointing to the successful killing of high-value Al-Qaeda militants like Abu Laith al-Libi in January 2008 and chemical weapons expert Abu Khabab al-Masri in July 2008. However, even if tomorrow Osama bin Laden were killed by a UAV, the jihadist insurgency would not melt away. The ability to keep militant groups off balance must be weighed against the cost of facilitating the rise of more insurgents. Citizens living outside the ungoverned tribal areas also detest drones. &quot;Anti-US sentiment has already been increasing in Pakistan … especially in regard to cross-border and reported drone strikes, which Pakistanis perceive to cause unacceptable civilian casualties,&quot; conceded US Central Command chief General David Petraeus in a declassified statement written on May 27, 2009.Drone strikes also contribute to the widening trust deficit between Pakistanis and the US. A recent poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan for Al-Jazeera found that 59 percent believed the US was the greatest threat to Pakistan. Most Pakistanis oppose extremism; they simply disagree with American tactics. America's interests lie in ensuring the virus of anti-American radicalism does not infect the rest of the region. Yet </span><strong><u>Washington</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">'s attempts to stabilize Afghanistan help </span><strong><u>destabilize[s] Pakistan, because its actions serve as a recruiting tool for Pakistani</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Taliban </span><strong><u>militants.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Just as one would not kill a fly with a sledgehammer, using overwhelming firepower to </span><strong><u>kill[ing] a single insurgent creates collateral damage that can recruit 50 more.</u></strong><br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep filled with troops today, killing five and wounding as many as 21, including several children who were waiting for a ride to school. Residents of the region where the attack took place are fleeing in terror as gunfire rings out around them, and government forces have been unable to quell the violence. Two regional government officials were beheaded by militants in retaliation for the killing of other militants by government forces. As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where we have come to expect such terrible events. This, unfortunately, is a whole new ballgame. It is part of another conflict that is brewing, one which puts what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in deep shade, and which represents a grave and growing threat to us all.</span> <strong><u>Pakistan is now trembling on the edge of violent chaos</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, and is doing so</span> <strong><u>with nuclear weapons</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> in its hip pocket, right </span><strong><u>in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the middle of </span><strong><u>one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The situation in brief: Pakistan for years has been a nation in turmoil, run by a shaky government supported by a corrupted system, dominated by a blatantly criminal security service, and threatened by a large fundamentalist Islamic population with deep ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan. All this is piled atop an ongoing standoff with neighboring India that has been the center of political gravity in the region for more than half a century. The fact that </span><strong><u>Pakistan,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and </span><strong><u>India,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and </span><strong><u>Russia, and China all possess nuclear weapons</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and share the same space means any ongoing or </span><strong><u>escalating violence</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> over there </span><strong><u>has</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the real </span><strong><u>potential to crack open the very gates of Hell</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> itself. Recently, the Taliban made a military push into the northwest Pakistani region around the Swat Valley. According to a recent Reuters report: The (Pakistani) army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control. But insecurity mounted after a civilian government came to power last year and tried to reach a negotiated settlement. A peace accord fell apart in May 2008. After that, hundreds — including soldiers, militants and civilians — died in battles. Militants unleashed a reign of terror, killing and beheading politicians, singers, soldiers and opponents. They banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls' schools. About 1,200 people were killed since late 2007 and 250,000 to 500,000 fled, leaving the militants in virtual control. Pakistan offered on February 16 to introduce Islamic law in the Swat valley and neighboring areas in a bid to take the steam out of the insurgency. The militants announced an indefinite cease-fire after the army said it was halting operations in the region. President Asif Ali Zardari signed a regulation imposing sharia in the area last month. But the Taliban refused to give up their guns and pushed into Buner and another district adjacent to Swat, intent on spreading their rule. The United States, already embroiled in a war against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, must now face the possibility that </span><strong><u>Pakistan could collapse under the mounting threat of Taliban forces</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> there. Military and diplomatic advisers to President Obama, uncertain how best to proceed, now face one of the great nightmare scenarios of our time. &quot;Recent militant gains in Pakistan,&quot; reported The New York Times on Monday, &quot;have so alarmed the White House that the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the situation as 'one of the very most serious problems we face.'&quot; &quot;Security was deteriorating rapidly,&quot; reported The Washington Post on Monday, &quot;particularly in the mountains along the Afghan border that harbor al-Qaeda and the Taliban, intelligence chiefs reported, and there were signs that those groups were working with indigenous extremists in Pakistan's populous Punjabi heartland. The Pakistani government was mired in political bickering. The army, still fixated on its historical adversary India, remained ill-equipped and unwilling to throw its full weight into the counterinsurgency fight. But despite the threat the intelligence conveyed, Obama has only limited options for dealing with it. Anti-American feeling in Pakistan is high, and a U.S. combat presence is prohibited. The United States is fighting Pakistan-based extremists by proxy, through an army over which it has little control, in alliance with a government in which it has little confidence.&quot; It is believed</span> <strong><u>Pakistan is currently in possession of between 60 and 100 nuclear weapons</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Because Pakistan's stability is threatened by the wide swath of its population that shares ethnic, cultural and religious connections to the fundamentalist Islamic populace of Afghanistan, fears over what could happen to those nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government collapses are very real. &quot;</span><strong><u>As the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> insurgency of the </span><strong><u>Taliban and Al Qaeda spreads in Pakistan,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">&quot; reported the Times last week, &quot;senior American </span><strong><u>officials</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> say they </span><strong><u>are</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> increasingly </span><strong><u>concerned about new vulnerabilities for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, including the potential for militants to snatch a weapon in transport or to insert</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> sympathizers into laboratories or fuel-production </span><strong><u>facilities.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> In public, the administration has only hinted at those concerns, repeating the formulation that the Bush administration used: that it has faith in the Pakistani Army. But that cooperation, according to officials who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity surrounding the exchanges between Washington and Islamabad, has been sharply limited when the subject has turned to the vulnerabilities in the Pakistani nuclear infrastructure.&quot; &quot;The prospect of turmoil in Pakistan sends shivers up the spines of those U.S. officials charged with keeping tabs on foreign nuclear weapons,&quot; reported Time Magazine last month. &quot;Pakistan is thought to possess about 100 — the U.S. isn't sure of the total, and may not know where all of them are. Still, if Pakistan collapses, the U.S. military is primed to enter the country and secure as many of those weapons as it can, according to U.S. officials. Pakistani officials insist their personnel safeguards are stringent, but a sleeper cell could cause big trouble, U.S. officials say.&quot; In other words, a shaky Pakistan spells trouble for everyone, especially if America loses the footrace to secure those weapons in the event of the worst-case scenario. If Pakistani militants ever succeed in toppling the government, several very dangerous events could happen at once. </span><strong><u>Nuclear-armed India could be galvanized into military action</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> of some kind, </span><strong><u>as could nuclear</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">-armed </span><strong><u>China or nuclear</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">-armed </span><strong><u>Russia.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> If the Pakistani government does fall, and all those Pakistani nukes are not immediately accounted for and secured, the specter (or reality) of </span><strong><u>loose nukes</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> falling </span><strong><u>in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">to </span><strong><u>the hands of terrorist organizations could place the entire world on a collision course with unimaginable disaster.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> We have all been paying a great deal of attention to Iraq and Afghanistan, and rightly so. The developing situation in Pakistan, however, needs to be placed immediately on the front burner. The Obama administration appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all.</span><br />

Targeted killing undermines US soft power.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Cullen</u></strong> <strong><u>07</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/DAs/Soft%20Power%20DA.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Opponents of targeted killing challenge the effectiveness of the policy on a number of grounds. The most frequent criticism is that successful targeted killings are counter-productive in that they create martyrs and generate a desire for revenge or retaliation. As such, they are viewed as motivating the terrorists and their base of support and thereby intensifying the cycle of violence. The counter-argument to this is that terrorists such as AQAM have demonstrated that they are already highly motivated and their terrorism needs no encouragement. Another criticism is that the policy is strategically flawed. </span><strong><u>The U.S.-led global campaign against terror is fundamentally a battle of ideas</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">36 </span><strong><u>in which</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a belief in freedom, democracy and the</span> <strong><u>rule of law competes against terror</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, intolerance, and extremist ideology. In this context, critics argue that </span><strong><u>targeted killings severely diminish global support for the U.S. position among</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> friends and </span><strong><u>allies.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Unfortunately, </span><strong><u>targeted killings have yet to be broadly accepted as</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> a </span><strong><u>legitimate</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> exercise of a state’s right to defend itself against terrorism. </span><strong><u>Criticism of U.S. targeted killing</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">s </span><strong><u>has come from respected entities such as the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><strong><u>N</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">ations Special Rapporteur,37 </span><strong><u>Amnesty International,</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">38 </span><strong><u>and the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">39 The U.S. must counter this position by doing more to promote the legitimacy of the policy. The U.S. must articulate the policy’s legal and moral bases to our international partners and the public-at-large and push for a formal updating of jus in bello to reflect a state’s legitimate right to defend itself against trans- national terrorism.</span><br />

Soft power solves multiple scenarios for extinction<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">Soft power is the ability to attract people to our side without coercion. Legitimacy is central to soft power. </span><strong><u>If a</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> people or </span><strong><u>nation believes American objectives to be legitimate, we are more likely to persuade them to follow our lead</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> without using threats and bribes. </span><strong><u>Legitimacy can also reduce opposition to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">—and the costs of—</span><strong><u>using hard power when the situation demands.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Appealing to others’ values, interests, and preferences can, in certain circumstances, replace the dependence on carrots and sticks. Cooperation is always a matter of degree, and it is profoundly influenced by attraction…The information age has heightened political consciousness, but also made political groupings less cohesive. Small, adaptable, transnational networks have access to tools of destruction that are increasingly cheap, easy to conceal, and more readily available.

Soft power is key to solve terrorism<br />

<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">We may be able for example to use our military power effectively as we did in Afghanistan to remove the Taliban government or as we did in the three and a half week campaign in Iraq, but the problems of wrapping up an organization like </span><strong><u>Al-Qaeda</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> or governing a country like Iraq is that they </span><strong><u>are much less susceptible to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> solutions by </span><strong><u>military power</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> alone. Looking at Afghanistan you'll notice that we where able to replace the Taliban Government quickly but we only wrapped up about a quarter of Al Qaeda using military power. </span><strong><u>When you have a terrorist network with cells in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> 50 or </span><strong><u>60 countries you</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> simply</span> <strong><u>can't bomb them all.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Some of these cells are in places like Hamburg or Detroit, where you cant bomb them, </span><strong><u>the only way you can deal with that kind of a threat is through</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> close civilian </span><strong><u>cooperation. Meaning intelligence sharing, police work across borders, tracing financial flows and so forth.</u></strong> <span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">The difficulty I see is if we focus solely on our military power and solely on hard power, we may forget that what we really need is to get others to cooperate with us to deal with these new types of threats…</span><strong><u>when we have less soft power than Bin Laden in those countries it makes it more difficult for us to prevail.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> If you accept my reasoning -that you need cooperation from other countries- when you allow the status or attractiveness of the U.S. to deteriorate to the point where being pro-American is toxic in domestic politics in another country, it's going to make leaders unwilling to cooperate with us. Unless the moderates win in that struggle inside Islam, we're not going to win. In other words, we have to be able to attract moderates if we're going to be able to prevent Bin Laden from attracting them, relating back to Rumsfeld's metric of them getting more than we are able to deter and kill.</span><br />

Soft power is key to heg.<br />

<strong><u>Soft power has always been a key element of leadership.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> The power to attract—to get others to want what you want, to frame the issues, to set the agenda—has its roots in thousands of years of human experience. Skillful </span><strong><u>leaders have always understood that attractiveness stems from credibility and legitimacy.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Power has never flowed solely from the barrel of a gun; </span><strong><u>even the most brutal dictators have relied on attraction</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> as well as fear. </span><strong><u>When the United States paid insufficient attention to</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> issues of </span><strong><u>legitimacy and credibility in</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the way it went about its policy on </span><strong><u>Iraq, polls showed a dramatic drop in American soft power</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. That did not prevent the United States from entering Iraq, but it meant that it had to pay higher costs in the blood and treasure than would otherwise have been the case. Similarly, if Yasser Arafat had chosen the soft power model of Gandhi or Martin Luther King rather than the hard power of terrorism, he could have attracted moderate Israelis and would have a Palestinian state by now. I said at the start that leadership is inextricably intertwined with power. Leaders have to make crucial choices about the types of power that they use. Woe be to followers of those leaders who ignore or devalue the significance of soft power.</span><br />

<span style="text-align: center;"><span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><strong><u>Asia Impact</u></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
Credibility in the Middle East spills over to Asian influence<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Alterman 11</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/DAs/Soft%20Power%20DA.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">[5</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">An increasing U.S. orientation toward the Pacific is also turning the United States toward seeing the Middle East through Asian eyes. The U.S. Navy secures the increasingly busy sea lanes that connect the Middle East and Asia, utilizing a blue-water capacity that no other country possesses. And as the United States prosecutes two land wars in Asia, U.S. warships sail out of the West Coast for deployments off Iraq and Afghanistan, just as they also sail from the East Coast. </span><strong><u>Asians’ focus on the Middle East is different from Westerners’.</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> Asian states don’t especially feel the ties and burdens of their past history with the Middle East, which are especially thick for Europe in North Africa and the Levant. A more Asian focus on the region will mean a further shift in focus from the “traditional” areas of international concern in the Middle East toward the Gulf, and give the Gulf an even greater voice in regional affairs.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">At the same time, </span><strong><u>Asia’s reliance on the United States for energy security will create greater incentives for Asian states to cooperate in U.S. diplomacy in the Gulf</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">, or at least to not disrupt it. Japan has already trimmed its activities in Iran; it is hard to imagine China really standing up for Iran given China’s deep interest in stability and security. Yet, Asian states tend not to share the Western insistence on improving human rights in foreign countries, professing a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. The U.S. ability to build sanctions against human rights violators is likely to diminish, even if the impulse to advance human rights continues unabated.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">In addition, Asians’ rising reliance on the Middle East will require a different set of relations with the United States and with each other, especially in the Indian Ocean. Whereas European countries have long talked of burden sharing on issue of global security—even when the reality falls short of the rhetoric—many Asian countries feel no special need to contribute substantially to the global commons. Going forward, such an arrangement will be unsustainable as Asian states face their own growing trade and the United States faces a series of sustained budget challenges. Given regional rivalries, especially but not limited to the Chinese rivalry with India, the United States will need to play a role guiding the growing involvement of Asian powers within a broad cooperative framework.</span><br />
<strong><u>The shifts underway in Asia underline the United States’ role as the world’s only truly global power</u></strong><u>.</u><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> While current U.S. commentary bemoans diminishing U.S. global influence, the fact is that</span> <strong><u>only the United States can view the Middle East through both an Atlantic and Pacific lens. For those who advocate a U.S. pullback from the Middle East, the news is not good. It is hard to imagine how the United States can continue its growth as a major Asian power without maintaining a strong position in the Middle East</u></strong><u>.</u><br />

Lack of US incluence in Asia triggers a massive arms race.<br />

<strong><u>Kemp 10</u></strong> writes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/User/Dropbox/SMHS%20Prep/Woodward%20Prep/Neg/DAs/Soft%20Power%20DA.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">[6</a>]</span><br />

<strong><u>With the</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> unilateral decision by the </span><strong><u>U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates to </span><strong><u>draw down</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> its </span><strong><u>[in] presence, the major Asian powers</u>—<u>given that they</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> continue to </span><strong><u>have unresolved problems</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> among themselves—</span><strong><u>expand their own military forces, particularly</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> their </span><strong><u>nuclear</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and maritime capabilities, </span><strong><u>ultimately leading to a triangular Asian arms race among India, China, and Japan</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. Under those circumstances, </span><strong><u>Japan is likely to obtain nuclear weapons, especially if</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> the crisis on the </span><strong><u>Korea</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">n peninsula </span><strong><u>remains unresolved, and the security of the region ultimately will be in the hands of the Asian powers themselves</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">. The sorts of alliances and arrangements that they make with the Gulf states and other Middle East countries would be uncertain. In all probability, India would play a key role, particularly in the Gulf. Indeed, India would be most assertive if it felt that China was encroaching on a region in which India believes that it should have hegemonic control.</span><br />
<span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">A fourth scenario, International Cooperation, assumes that while the world economic situation may not be as rosy as outlined in the first scenario, there nevertheless remains a strong interest on the part of all the major industrial powers in ensuring secure energy supplies; as a result, the price of energy is kept at a reasonable level. The United States does not go through an East of Suez moment and continues to play a responsible and significant role in the maritime peacekeeping operations in the region. However, there is more pressure on the regional powers to share more of the burden and to participate in joint security operations ranging from sea control missions to cooperative ventures to curb terrorism, proliferation, and radicalism. </span><strong><u>Under</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> these circumstances, </span><strong><u>the presence of the U</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">nited</span> <strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;">tates is seen as beneficial and reduces the tendency of the Asian powers to compete among themselves. While the U.S. commitment is not open ended, it serves long—term U.S. interests, in much the same way that the U.S. presence in Europe today continues to serve U.S. national interests. In this cooperative environment,</span> <strong><u>local conflicts are easier to manage since it is in the interests of the all major powers to resist the forces of radicalism</u></strong><span style="color: #a6a6a6; font-size: 6pt;"> and proliferation—</span><strong><u>particularly nuclear terrorism.</u></strong><br />
