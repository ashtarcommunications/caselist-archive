==Advantage 1== 

**Advantage 1– “What is real beauty?”**
**Aesthetic judgments order and give meaning to our understanding of class, race, and sex – the status quo has alienated the aesthetic of the disabled which denies them agency**
**Siebers 10** (Disability Aesthetics” Tom Siebers, Tobin, Prof of Literary and Cultural Criticism at the U of Michigan, 2010)

Oppression is the systematic victimization of one group by another. It is a form AND Disability represents at this moment in time the final frontier of justifiable human inferiority 

**Aesthetic agency should be debate’s top priority**
**Nieutvenhuis 10** Prof Jan Nieutvenhuis, Dept of Education Management and Policy Studies, Faculty of Education, University of Pretoria, Acta Academica 2011: 43(1) – available at: http://up-za.academia.edu/JanNieuwenhuis/Papers/882363/Social_justice_in_education_today

Accept the geo-historical context of the struggle as something that must be reconciled AND to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.

**Those aesthetics permeate our discussions of transportation infrastructure. The aff is a FORCED, VIOLENT confrontation with disability. That shapes our understanding of aesthetic and form**
**Siebers 10** (Tobin, professor of English, University of Michigan, Disability Aesthetics, pgs 58-63)

These two episodes may seem worlds apart, their resemblance superficial. The first turns AND kids that do weird things. (Cited by Fine and Asch 48) 

**The aesthetic lack motivates eugenics from the fear of incompetance**
**Wilson, 2006** (Daniel J., Cultural Locations of Disability, October 8)

In two chapters on the eugenics movement, Snyder and Mitchell ‘analyze eugenics is AND medicine have considered disability as abnormal and in need of repair or elimination.

**This projection is the root cause of genocidal violence**
**Elden 02**, politics at University of Warwick, (Stuart Boundary 2 29.2) 

The reverse side is the power to allow death. State racism is a recoding AND 228–30). As Foucault puts it in La volonté de savoir :


==**Advantage 2**== 


**Advantage 2 is the Pedagogy of the Oppressed**
**Seemingly innocuous investment decision in transportation infrastructure has relegated people with disabilities to the periphery** 
**AAPD 2012** (The American Association of People with Disabilities, “Equity in Transportation for People with Disabilities”, May 23, http://www.infrastructureusa.org/equity-in-transportation-for-people-with-disabilities/)

Transportation and mobility play key roles in the struggle for civil rights and equal opportunity AND on accessible taxis, a lack of requirements has meant very uneven progress.

**When mobility is viewed as a universal characteristic individual problems become de-characterized and the focus degenerates to anesthetization and exclusion of bodies – that’s how status quo transportation planning functions – it is entrenched in a universal model of ablism**
**Imrie 2k** (Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London Rob Disability and discourses of mobility and movement Environment and Planning volume 32 [[http://www.environmentandplanning.com/epa/fulltext/a32/a331.pdf]])

Barnes et al (1999, page 121), for instance, note that UK AND of mobility as ``a messy, unpredictable, diverse and changeable reality''.

**Mobility should not focus on the body’s incompetence but rather shift to lines of flight away from the static hegemonic conception of liberal identity that recognizes difference and targets individual needs of mobility.**
**Imrie 2k**(Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London Rob Disability and discourses of mobility and movement Environment and Planning volume 32 [[http://www.environmentandplanning.com/epa/fulltext/a32/a331.pdf]])

Disabled people's mobility and movement are highly circumscribed by sociocultural attitudes, practices, and AND are demanding, not to have their needs defined and met by others''.

**The function of universalism is always already based on liberal notions of impairment – that does ontic violence to the disabled body which is a prior question to evaluating consequences**
**Hughes 07** (Head of Division of Sociology Glasgow Caledonian University Bill Being disabled: towards a critical social ontology for disability studies Disability & Society 22.7 Taylor & Francis)

In summary, the universalistic approach to ontology in disability studies that I have sketched AND p. 164) that regularly misrepresent and sometimes destroy disabled peoples lives.

**The plan breaks down the societal barriers that oppose immobility and repair ontic negativism**
**Imrie 2k** (Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London Rob Disability and discourses of mobility and movement Environment and Planning volume 32 [[http://www.environmentandplanning.com/epa/fulltext/a32/a331.pdf]])

Mobility and movement are core to people's identities, life experiences, and opportunities.AND for challenging the hegemonic discourses of the body, mobility, and movement.

**Infrastructure is NECESSARY to change design**
Imrie 96(Rob, Professor in Human Geography, Department of Geography, Royal Holloway University of London Rob, 1996 “ Inclusive design, disability and the built environment” http://www.etn-presco.net/workshop/presentations/R_Imrie.pdf)

While the barriers to disabled people's inclusion in the built environment are many and varied AND dropped kerbs and tactile surfaces on completion of regular repair or service work. 

**That puts the fear of death onto the body of the disabled – that results in the invalidation and corruption of identity**
Hughes 07(Bill Head of Division of Sociology Glasgow Caledonian University “Being disabled: towards a critical social ontology for disability studies Disability & Society” 22.7)

Indeed, the invulnerable self is a fantasy and form of self‐deception associated AND fantasy of absolute able bodiedness’ (Thomson, 1997, p. 45).

**The impact to that is authentic existence – impossible with our imposition of fear.**
Park 06 (James, Philosophy Professor at the University of Minnesota, “Our Existential Predicament: Loneliness Depression Anxiety and Death”)

Our fundamental absurdity is disclosed when the mad rush called “life” stops, AND , and security, and floating serenely on a surprising hope and joy.

The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure accessibility investment.

Advantage 3 is “What Really Matters?”

Traditional risk assessment strips us of our relations to others and our dignity—this obscures how structural violence contributes to large-scale destruction

O’Brien 2k (PhD, environmental scientist and activist, Mary, © 2000, MIT Press, “Making Better Environmental Decisions: An Alternative to Risk Assessment”, Gigapedia, p. xvii-xviii,)
This book is based on the understanding that it is not acceptable for people to AND feeling, and a sense of relationship to others to stop socioenvironmental madness.

Federal action is key – devolving authority is an act aof dismissing responsibility – this form of politics leads to serial policy failure

Fine & Hall 10 Prof of Economics U of London & Director of the Public Services International Research Unit – U of Greenwich, Contesting Neoliberalism: Public Sector Alternatives for Service Delivery Working Paper for the Milan European Economy Workshops 2010 http://www.economia.unimi.it/uploads/wp/DEAS-2010_27wp.pdf)
Other areas of policymaking, as with industrial and regional policy, health, education AND obviously in the collaboration between companies, donors and development banks over privatisations.
Apocalypticism creates inevitable cycles of enemy creation and kills value

Der Derian 98 (James, Professor of Political Science – University of Massachusetts, On Security, Ed. Lipschutz, p. 24-25)
No other concept in international relations packs the metaphysical punch, nor commands the disciplinary AND on the otherness of death, and identities calcifying into a fearful sameness.

Security is a tool the biopolitical empire uses to cast disability to the periphery – re-creates problems

McRuer, 2010 (Robert, Professor of English and Deputy Chair of the Department of English at George Washington University, "Disability Nationalism in Crip Times")
Murderball, however, is just one prominent sign—whether marking at this point AND thought and action, for solidarity and coalition. [End Page 176]
