==High Speed Rail== 

===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Plan Text: The United States federal government should increase its development of a high speed train infrastructure system. </span>=== 
==== ==== 
===Contention One is Inherency=== 


<span style="font-size: 12pt;">POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND PERCEPTION OF HIGH COSTS IS KEEPING HIGH SPEED RAIL IN LIMBO – MASSIVE FEDERAL SUPPORT IS KEY TO BREAK THE CYCLE</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">President Obama's vision of bullet trains whizzing through the California countryside, </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">come. The only question is whether we'll see this. I think we can. I hope so."</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">AND, THAT FEDERAL FUNDING IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET HSR PROJECTS MOVING</span>

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">California is moving ahead with the first link of its massive </span>

===Contention Two: Advantages=== 
===Advantage One is Competitiveness=== 
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS HALTED – AMERICA’S TRANSITION TO A KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY IS SLOWING</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But now we find ourselves having the wrong debate—about whether a stimulus is needed or not</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">he saw its components at work at PARC, realized their potential, and put the pieces together.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">AND, THAT IS THE PRIMARY THREAT TO U.S. COMPETITIVENESS – FAILURE TO TRANSITION TO A KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY LEADS TO PERMANENT DECLINE OF PRIMACY</span>

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The current competitive threat is similar to the world-shattering </span>
AND
neither realize that promise nor solve the myriad social problems confronting us today<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

====<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Scenario One is Hegemony </span>==== 
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">FAILURE TO INNOVATE TANKS AMERICA’S HEGEMONIC DIFFERENTIAL AND DESTROYS PRIMACY</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of several specifically Asian problems would invariably contribute to the conclusive attainment of these larger encompassing goals.</span>


<span style="font-size: 14pt;">AND THAT LOSS OF HEGEMONY CAUSES GLOBAL CONFLICT BETWEEN GREAT POWERS – ECONOMIC PRIMACY IS SPECIFICALLY KEY</span>

AND
hegemons in Asia could seize the moment, leading the world toward //a new, dangerous era of multi-polarity//<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

====<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Scenario Two is the Economy</span>==== 
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ECONOMIC GROWTH CAUSES GLOBAL CONFLICT AND THE DEATHS OF MILLIONS</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">FURTHERMORE, ECONOMIC DECLINE MAKES WAR MORE PROBABLE</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.</span>


====<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Scenario Three is Mega-Regions</span>==== 
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">HSR IS SPECIFICALLY KEY TO THE GROWTH AND SUSTAINING OF AMERICAN MEGA-REGIONS – THESE GEOGRAPHIES ARE THE BACKBONE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH </span>

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Building a modern passenger rail network will be a boost to America’s economy. Besides the </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">FURTHERMORE, MEGA-REGIONS CREATE A SPATIAL FIX THAT FACILITATES CONCENTRATION AND CLUSTERING – THAT’S THE ONLY WAY TO SUSTAIN ECONOMIC RECOVERY</span>

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Instead of further encouraging the growth of an auto-housing-suburban complex</span>, the government should
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">AND</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> larger than the sum of their parts; they not only produce but consume, spurring further demand</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

High-speed railprovides the answer to many of the challenges we face today in America. It creates
AND
reducing airport congestion. These aren’t just benefits for San Francisco or Los Angeles—they are solutions<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that benefit the entire state</span>.


A strong signal of federal commitment to HSR is critical to generate investment and confidence in the industry. A federal HSR plan can generate independent revenue to pay for the cost.

Like other modes of transportation and public goods, high-speed rail generally does not pay for itself through ticket
AND
midsummer 2010 prices of $72 per barrel). Five billion dollars of this amount could be dedicated to passenger rail.
