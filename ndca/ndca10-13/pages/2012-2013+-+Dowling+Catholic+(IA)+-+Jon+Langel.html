  i made this mostly because i was bored and thought people might be curious as to how i've been systematically destroying ld and figure it might inspire some people to run more k's and learn how to actually run a k. every card i've ever read in ld is on this page. to those of you who don't know me i promise i know what i'm doing i've won something around 85% of ld rounds i've debated<br />
<br />
p.s. if you read &quot;normative and nowhere to go&quot; by pierre schlag and understand it, you can beat every lder on the circuit.<br />

In order to answer whether due process is truly due, we must ask ourselves, “<u>What is terrorism</u>?” According to Merriam-Webster, terrorism is “the systematic use of terror, especially as a means of coercion.” <u>So what is a terrorist</u>?<br />
<br />
It is the rush to the conclusion that we know the terrorist that creates the violence to begin with. The totalizing us-them nature of terrorism discourse that pervades American politics prevents effective measures to stop the killing, requiring an infinite mimetic war to “win”, to come out on top as America always does. Our only chance is to break with the system, to question and problematize our view to prevent endless cycles of violence. The identity of the terrorist is a prior question to the debate they want to have.<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zulaika writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">This does not entail a compromised notion of shared guilt by terrorists and victims; “</span><span class="underline">the point is, rather, that </span>the two sides are not really opposed,<span class="underline"> that </span>they belong to the same field<span class="underline">. In short, the position to adopt is to accept the necessity of the fight against terrorism, BUT </span>to redefine and expand its terms so that it will include<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> also (some) </span>American<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> and other Western powers’ </span>acts<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">.”23 As widely reported at the time, the Reagan administration, led by Alexander Haig, would self-servingly “confuse terrorism with communism.”24 As the cold war was coming to an end, terrorism became the easy substitute for communism in Reagan’s black-and-white world. Still, when Haig would voice his belief that Moscow controlled the worldwide terrorist network, the State Department’s bureau of intelligence chief Ronald Spiers would react by thinking that “he was kidding.”25 By the 1990s, </span><span class="underline">the Soviet Union no longer constituted the terrorist enemy and only days after the Oklahoma City bombing, Russian president Yeltsin hosted President Clinton in Moscow who equated the recent massacres in Chechnya with Oklahoma City as domestic conflicts. </span>We should be concerned as to what this new Good-versus-Evil war on terror substitutes for<span class="underline">. Its consequences in </span>legitimizing the repression of minorities<span class="underline"> in India, Russia, Turkey, and other countries are all too obvious. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">But the ultimate catastrophe is that </span>such a<span class="underline"> categorically ill-defined, perpetually deferred, </span>simpleminded Good-versus-Evil war<span class="underline"> echoes and </span>re-creates the very absolutist mentality and exceptionalist tactics of the insurgent terrorists. By formally adopting the terrorists’ own game<span class="underline">—one that by definition lacks rules of engagement, definite endings, clear alignments between enemies and friends, or formal arrangements of any sort, military, political, legal, or ethical—</span>the inevitable danger lies in reproducing it endlessly.<span class="underline"> One only has to look at the Palestinian-Israeli or the Basque-Spanish conflicts to see how self-defeating the alleged “victories” against terrorism can be in the absence of addressing the causes of the violence. “</span>A war against terrorism<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, then, mirrors the state of exception characteristic of insurgent violence, and in so doing it </span>reproduces it ad infinitum<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. The question remains: What politics might be involved in this state of alert as normal state? Would this possible scenario of competing (and mutually constituting) terror signify the end of politics as we know it?”27 </span>It is either politics or once again the self-fulfilling prophecy of fundamentalist crusaders<span class="underline"> who will never be able to entirely eradicate evil from the world. </span>Our choice cannot be<span class="underline"> between Bush and bin Laden, nor is our struggle one of “</span>us” versus “them<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">” </span>Such a split leads us into the ethical catastrophe of not feeling<span class="underline"> full </span>solidarity with the victims of either side<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">—since the value of each life is absolute, “</span>the only appropriate stance is the unconditional solidarity with ALL victims.”<span class="underline"> 28 </span>We must question our own involvement with the phantasmatic reality of terrorism discourse, for<span class="underline"> “now </span>even<span class="underline"> the USA and its </span>citizens can be regulated by terrorist discourse<span class="underline">. . . . Now the North American territory has become the most global and central place in the new history that terrorist ideology inaugurates.”29 Resisting the temptation of innocence regarding the barbarian other implies an awareness of a point Hegel made and that applies to the contemporary and increasingly globalized world more than ever: evil, he claims, resides also in the innocent gaze itself, perceiving as it does evil all around itself</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Derrida equally holds this position. In reference to the events of September 11, he said: “My unconditional compassion, addressed to the victims of September 11, does not prevent me from saying it loudly: with </span><span class="underline">regard to this crime, I do not believe that anyone is politically guiltless.”</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">30 In brief, we are all included in the picture, and these tragic events must make us problematize our own innocence while questioning our own political and libidinal investment in the global terrorism discourse.</span><br />

View voting affirmative as an alternative to the exclusionary processes of the status quo; I AM THE TERRORIST. Recognize that the terrorist is not other but self, <u>whether it be granting them their constitutional rights</u> or the way we choose to represent them discursively, ONLY recognizing our oneness with the struggle of the terrorist can allow political progress.<br />

How we as subjects are positioned in debate is a prerequisite to interpreting and understanding the resolution or its implications – how we know and view the world is influenced by construction of social reality through discourses of knowledge. Their view and representations of the terrorist are not neutral; they conflate the terrorist with enemy, creating a real-world sense of insecurity and violence. We have not only an intellectual but ETHICAL obligation to challenge status quo dominant discourse that allows us to open up a critical space to create new, emancipatory forms of knowledge<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The purpose of this article is not to assert that the terrorist threat does not exist or that terrorism and religion are not linked in some fashion. Rather, its central aim is to draw attention to the contestable and politicized character of the dominant narratives, </span>the ways in which<span class="underline"> ‘Islamic </span>terrorism’ is interpreted and socially constructed as an existential threat and the means by which the broader discourse functions to promote<span class="underline"> a number of </span>discrete political projects and reify a particular<span class="underline"> kind of </span>political and social order<span class="underline">. </span>Exposing the ideological effects and political technologies of the discourse has the potential to open up critical space for<span class="underline"> the articulation of </span>alternative<span class="underline">and potentially emancipatory </span>forms of knowledge<span class="underline"> and practice</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, </span>given the enormous<span class="underline"> material and social </span>destruction of the war on terror<span class="underline">ism thus far, the possibility of </span>articulating non-violent or constructive responses<span class="underline"> to acts of terrorism </span>takes on immense<span class="underline"> normative </span>significance<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Fortunately, </span><span class="underline">discourses are never completely hegemonic;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> there is always room for counter-hegemonic struggle and subversive forms of knowledge.

Recent moves by officials of the European Union for example, to review its lexicon of terms regarding ‘Islamic’ or ‘jihadi’ terrorism are indicative of a growing dissatisfaction with the discourse within parts of the political establishment.112 In particular, given their public role</span><span class="underline">, </span>scholars<span class="underline"> in the field </span>have a responsibility to challenge the articulation<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the central labels and narratives </span>of the dominant discourse and<span class="underline"> to </span>explore alternative forms of language<span class="underline"> and knowledge.As an initial starting point, reclaiming the labels and narratives of ‘political vio- lence’, ‘revolutionaries’, ‘militants’, ‘nationalism’, ‘anti-imperialism’, ‘self-determination’, ‘insurgency’, ‘ideology’ and the like to describe the current conflict, could provide a more flexible and ethically responsible alternative to the oppressive confines of the discourse of ‘Islamic terrorism’.</span><br />

The actual speech acts of both teams and how they influence the community around us are the only things that matter, analysis of specific discourse is a prerequisite to gaining offense. All we have after the round is over is the education we’ve gained from the positions and argumentation. The affirmative burden is to prove that the discursive alternative is preferable to the status quo or the negative’s competitive option. The reciprocal negative burden is to prove that the status quo or negating the resolution is preferable to enactment of the alternative. If you are going to vote for them the they must give you a concrete and methodological reason to vote for their specific speech act.<br />
Our discourse not only morphs education to our liking, it shapes knowledge in general; our description of the world around us and how the terrorist other fits in construct the reality that we live.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The same discourse (which characterises a way of thinking or the given state of knowledge at one time) can appear throughout a range of texts, across numerous sites. When these discursive events refer to the same object, say terrorism for example, and share a similar style and support a strategy, they are said to belong to the same <em>discursive formation</em> (Hall, 1997, p.44). </span>It is through<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> these </span>discursive formations that things<span class="underline">/practices </span>acquire<span class="underline"> their </span>meaning<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, </span>discursive representation is not a benign practice, for it is<span class="underline"> often </span>those in positions of power and authority who are able to construct ‘reality’ and<span class="underline"> thus </span>knowledge itself<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As Klein (1994) explains: ‘[a] </span>discourse<span class="Emphasis2">, then, </span>is not a way of learning ‘about’ something out there in the ‘real world’; it is<span class="Emphasis2"> rather </span>a way of producing that something as real, as identifiable<span class="underline">, classifiable, knowable, and therefore, meaningful. </span>Discourse creates the conditions of knowing<span style="font-size: 8pt;">’ (cited in George, 1994, p.30). Foucault contends that </span><span class="underline">knowledge is a form of power, and that power is present or exercised within decisions regarding what circumstances knowledge is applied or not</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, Foucault argues that knowledge (when linked to power) assumes the authority of ‘the truth’ and has the power to make itself true through a variety of regulatory and disciplining practices (Hall, 1997, p.49). </span>Knowledge<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (ways of knowing about others through discursive representations) therefore </span>is constructed by humans through<span class="underline"> their </span>interactions with the world around them and is a reflection of existing social, historical and political factors<span class="underline">, and as such, is never neutral.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In his analysis of the socially constructed nature of knowledge, Foucault explores the production of knowledge through discourse, and particularly how knowledge about the social, the individual, and associated shared meanings are produced in specific periods. In <em>Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason</em> (1988) and <em>The History of Sexuality Volume One</em> (1981),Foucault providesexamples of the shifting historical significance of sexuality and mental illness and the emergence of deviant identities. In this respect, mental illness and sexuality did not exist as independent objects, which remained the same and meant the same thing throughout all periods. Rather, it was through distinct discursive formations that the objects ‘madness’ or ‘heterosexuality’ emerged and appeared as meaningful constructs. Sexual relations and desires have always been present, but the constructs ‘heterosexual’ and ‘homosexual’ were <em>produced</em> through moral, legal, and medical discourses and practices. Through these discourses and practices, behaviours and acts were aligned with the construction of ‘types of’ people or identities - identities which were subject to medical treatment and legal constraints designed to regulate behaviour. In this respect, social and self identities are a consequence of power reflected in historically and institutionally specific systems/sites of discourse. </span><span class="underline">As social constructs, </span>it is important<span class="underline"> therefore </span>to view knowledge and discourse production through the socio-historical conditions in which they are produced<span class="underline">. In this respect, </span>discourses concerning terrorism<span class="underline">, security dilemmas and threat, and world order, </span>are produced within specific<span class="underline"> historical, geographical and socio-political </span>contexts as well as<span class="underline"> within social </span>relations of power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span><span class="underline">the controlling and legitimising aspects of discourse are such that </span>proponents of violence are not likely to construct a narrative that is contrary to their values<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For instance, </span><span class="underline">Al Qaeda is unlikely to construct a narrative that posits them in a contrary manner to their own moral values by engaging in ‘terrorist’ activities. Rather, they would position themselves as acting morally, and as victims of oppression or humiliation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Cobb, 2004). Similarly, </span>the US and her<span class="underline"> coalition </span>allies are<span class="underline"> also </span>likely to construct a narrative which posits their involvement in a ‘fight against terror’ within a discursive framework of liberty and democracy<span class="underline">, rather than expansionist or imperialist terms. </span><br />

It is not just events that are shaped by language; our discourse shapes the identities we see in others – their violent language methodologically constructs dichotomies of “Good and Evil,” “Self and Other,” that are the precondition for the line between “Citizen and Terrorist.”<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Talbot 2 writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In his foundational work <em>Orientalism</em> (1978), Edward </span><span class="underline">Said examines the historical construction of the East (Them/Other) and West (Us/Self) as essentially different entities through discursive practices</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Drawing upon Foucault’s notion of discourse, </span><span class="underline">Said contends that </span>Orientalism is a discourse: by which European culture was able to manage<span class="underline"> – </span>and even produce – the Orient<span class="underline"> politically, sociologically, militarily, ideologically, scientifically, and imaginatively during the post-Enlightenment period</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (p. 3). </span>Such a discourse draws upon assumptions that are imperialist by design, privilege European<span class="underline"> sensibilities and </span>representations of the Other, and reinforce ideas concerning the fixed nature of<span class="underline"> states of being and </span>difference<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (McDowell, 2003). Said argues that </span>Orientalist ideas can be found in<span class="underline"> current </span>representations of ‘Arab’ cultures as backward, lacking democracy, threatening and anti-Western<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (2003). Similarly, Occidentalism</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.socresonline.org.uk/13/1/17.html#fn2" rel="nofollow">2</a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> can be found in stereotypical representations of an “imperialist, corrupting, decadent and alienating West” (Nadje Al-Ali cited in Freund, 2001). As I suggest later, </span>these<span class="underline"> representations </span>have become a feature of<span class="underline"> the current </span>Western perceptions of terrorism<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As a practice, Othering is not solely a province of East versus West relations, but also exists as a strategy within other non-Westerns nations. For example, Shah (2004), Kennedy-Pipe and Welch (2005) and Baev (2007) note how </span><span class="underline">the ‘war on international terrorism’ discourse has been used by Russia to legitimate it actions against former Soviet republics like Chechnya. Within a sociological context, </span>identity discourse is<span class="underline"> often </span>characterised by issues concerning essentialising and marginalising social groups<span class="underline">, as well as totalising and categorising individuals and groups</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Gaudelli, 2001, p.60). </span><span class="underline">Categorisation results as a response to diversity, wherein categorisation assists with making the diversity (of people) more understandable. As a consequence of this, people become viewed as being more typical of certain categories</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (eg. a Muslim from </span><span class="underline">Iraq is stereotypically viewed as being ‘Muslim’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in comparison to an Australian Muslim in Cronulla within some discursive frameworks). </span>Following<span class="underline"> the </span>construction<span class="underline"> and application </span>of these categories, is a tendency to essentialise<span class="underline"> (belief in essence) </span>as is evident in notions of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ‘the laconic Aussie,’ ‘the whingeing Pom,’ and </span>the ‘fanatical terrorist<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.’ In this sense, </span><span class="underline">the act of ‘</span>naming’ is akin to ‘knowing<span class="underline">.’ Dividing practices evident in the categorisation and essentialising processes which inform the production of binaries reflect power struggles, as they primarily entail an external authority </span>imposing a ‘condition of life upon people’<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Gaudelli, 2001, p.74) that are supposed to have certain essences. </span><span class="underline">These power relations become evident in the abilities of claim-makers or particular agents to make certain discourses, categories and labels acceptable and make them ‘stick’ as it were.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In turn, </span><span class="underline">essentialism results in reifying culture by viewing cultural systems as being discrete and homogeneous units</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (nationally, ethnically and ideologically), </span><span class="underline">which are ‘naturally given’ and fixed in locality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Jones, 1999). Here it is important to remember, that </span><span class="underline">it is not culture that is ‘found’ or ‘discovered’ out in the field, but individuals who act and interact and express their views of culture</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Schulte-Tenckhoff, 2001, p.5). This paper contends that </span>it is the relations between groups and<span class="underline"> related </span>boundary making practices<span class="underline"> (insider/outsider, </span>Self/Other) rather than ‘traits’ which are<span class="underline"> important indicators and </span>producers of identity<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As discussed above, </span>binaries such as<span class="underline"> those of </span>Self/Other have a tendency to convey world views in concrete<span class="underline">, simplified and often </span>imperialist ways<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Berry, 2006). </span><span class="underline">The process of ‘</span>Othering’ is commensurate with identification<span class="underline"> (as culture, community, or nation) which further entails an act of differentiation, authentication, and at times, exclusion – creating boundaries between members of the ‘in’ group and outsiders.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In this sense the: ‘</span><span class="underline">Self/Other relation induces comparisons used by social actors to describe themselves or to describe others, depending on their location. In locking a given group into a substantially transformed identity, one constructs and immobilises this relation so that it operates in favour of those to whose advantage it is’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Schulte-Tenckhoff, 2001, p.11</span><span class="underline">). </span>Self/Other relations are therefore ‘matters of power and rhetoric rather than of essence’<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Clifford, 2004, p.14). Within this context, boundary-making practices are a way of ‘locking’ ‘imagined communities’ into strategically informed ontological states of being. Moreover, </span><span class="underline">these boundaries are inter-subjectively determined, that is, they are constructed through an emphasis on only a subset of many identity labels that apply</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (eg. religion). President George Bush has described his war on terror as a ‘crusade’ and a ‘divine plan’ guided by God. </span><span class="underline">These sentiments are similar to Islamic calls for Jihad, with religious terrorists viewing themselves as God’s people and their enemies as God’s enemies, ‘infidels’, or sinners</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As a consequence, for both sides, </span><span class="underline">the conflict takes on the form of a ‘spiritual battle.’ Thus religious doctrine acts as fuel for Islamic-based terrorism as it does for the US led ‘war on terror’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Inside this discursive framework, </span><span class="underline">both would contend that each party’s religion is the only meaningful one</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Berry, 2006 p.4). Indeed, </span><span class="underline">the construction of identity plays a key role in relation to the prospect for religious and political violence.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Hence, identity claims invariably informs interests. The call by fundamentalist Islamists for a Jihad on Western nations for example is a realisation of both interests and identities simultaneously. In this sense, identities and interests are mutually reinforcing concepts and incapable of being pursued separately (Hughes, 2004, p.7). Identity negotiation highlights the political nature of social identifications of Self and Others within and between groups. Contestation arises out of those ascribed social or collective identities that do not align with an individual’s or group’s self-definition, highlighting global and national tensions, as well as power dynamics which frequently underplay such identification processes. Hence </span><span class="underline">Self/Other struggles are ultimately struggles of legitimacy and meaning, frequently enacting and fuelling conflict. Indeed, it is in the creation of Self and an all-threatening Other that the state, or prominent figures within terrorist networks like Al Qaeda, use their power and available resources for legitimated violence</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Grondin, 2004). </span><br />

This is why their offense is bunk. The theory shell they’re going to run about why my discursive framework is abusive promotes useless education. The type of debate we’re used to hearing is labeled by academia as “normative legal discourse”, and is useless. It pre-scripts answers to controversial questions we are in no position to change.

If there’s no one in charge at the other end of the line, why then is normative legal thought in such a hurry to get its message across? And why, particularly, is it always in such a hurry to repeat the same old boring moves? There is an edge to these questions. And the edge comes in part from our implicit assumption that normative legal thought is a kind of that and that, as thought, it is in control of its own situation, its form, its own rhetoric.

Why have a fair debate that produces “education” if that education promotes an intellectual discussion that literally excludes those humans that are considered “Other”. Failure to take the discursive questioning of the AC to account is an act of violence against that which is unknown, that which is different than “Us”. This shows the stereotypical justice-morality debate they want to have does not promote true justice or morality, but a twisted Americanized form that turns their terminal impacts. When we debate incessantly about instances of “morality” that are purely hypothetical and we have no control over, it skews our conception of what truly is “morality”, turns all their terminal impacts<br />

For example, consider </span>the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> normative </span>word “freedom<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” This particular word </span>has a certain <span class="underline">exchange </span>value in our rhetoric<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and in our discourse. It is well known, for instance, that at present, “freedom” of […] enjoys a certain rhetorical advantage over “security of […]. That is to say, at present, “freedom” is rhetorically superior to “security.” </span>As legal thinkers<span class="underline"> come to </span>recognize this<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> point, </span>they<span class="underline"> try</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of course, </span><span class="underline">to </span>associate “freedom” with their favorite values<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, leaving “security” as the word for competing or interfering values. Thus the exchange value of the “freedom” word rises in the rhetorical economy of legal thought. However, the rise in the exchange value of such normative words typically yields an inflationary spiral. </span>Sooner or later everybody is using the “freedom” word<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For a while, the political charm of the “freedom” word can survive accelerated circulation. The word remains important. It remains important because it remains performatively effective. </span>It is perceived as a tool<span class="underline">, a rhetorical lever</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>But precisely because<span class="underline"> the “</span>freedom<span class="underline">” word </span>remains performatively effective, it is immediately pressed further into<span style="font-size: 8pt;">all sorts of </span>instrumentalist enterprises<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, thereby </span>further diffusing its<span style="font-size: 8pt;">constative </span>significance<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>After a while<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the “</span>freedom<span style="font-size: 8pt;">” word </span>doesn’t mean<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> much of </span>anything<span class="underline">. It isn’t even a reliable rhetorical tool</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to get people to act, or to be or to say various things. On the contrary, </span>everybody knows the trick: Freedom’s just another word for getting you to do something you don’t want to do<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Now this linguistic metamorphosis is hardly limited to the “freedom” word. Rather, the </span><span class="underline">linguistic devaluation affects the entire normative currency</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In fact, it affects the entire grammar of normative legal thought. Hence, </span><span class="underline">entire structures, </span>entire complexes of normative legal thought become increasingly vacuous<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – </span>their purchase on the world<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, descriptive and regulatory, </span><span class="underline">less and </span>less credible<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even the performative value of these structures and complexes becomes weakened as legal thinkers come to recognize that their constative significance has been devalued. As the normative currency is devalued, </span>the relation between normative structures and complexes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on the one hand, </span>and the practices to which they<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ostensibly </span>correspond<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on the other, </span>becomes weakened<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, attenuated. </span>No longer is it possible to maintain<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a naïve </span>idealism<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or materialism </span>where normative conceptions such as “justice<span class="underline">,” “liberty,” “consent,” or “community,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” either determine or </span>are determined by the practices to which they<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ostensibly </span>correspond<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The language of determination, and even its softer, more nuanced dialects, no longer provide an adequate understanding of the situation of normative legal thought. Here, the point is not that normative legal thought has now become indeterminate, as opposed to some previous or possible state of determinacy.

 I affirm; Resolved: It is morally permissible for victims to use deadly force as a deliberate response to repeated domestic violence.<br />
<br />
Status quo mindsets and practices concerning domestic abuse subjugate women and promote hegemonic structures of masculinity for three reasons –<br />
One, it forces women to be the helpless victim; without deadly force as an option, they are forced into passivity, allowing abuse and violence to continue<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dressler writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">An alternative course is to ask courts to confront the reality of relationship. If courts took relationships as given, again, as a kind of ideal, then a requirement of any objective or subjective belief in imminence would be misplaced. </span>Why should the law require immediacy<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the context of an ongoing relationship? </span>In nonrelationship situations, the law requires imminence because<span class="underline"> by doing so </span>it ensures<span class="underline"> that </span>someone who can avoid using deadly force<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by extracting himself or herself from the situation </span>will<span class="underline"> do so. </span>One cannot simply extract oneself from<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> an ongoing </span>relationship<span class="underline">, however</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">A relationship in which one could do that would not be a relationship</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> marked by mutual interdependence, a lack of autonomy, or love. </span>The relationship<span class="underline"> itself</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not necessarily the victim’s status as a woman or a battered woman, </span>makes imminence<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> an </span>inappropriate<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> requirement. This approach also suggests that although Wanrow has some relevance for battered women, its value is limited. It may not be the landmark domestic violence case that Schneider’s treatment of it suggests. </span>The feminist arguments<span class="underline"> in Wanrow </span>forced the court to appreciate that women may need to use deadly force when men do not because, for many women fighting against much larger men, anything less than deadly force will be no defense at all<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Their only choices are passivity or deadly force<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Thus, Wanrow is helpful to battered women to the extent that courts reject self-defense claims when the abuser’s attack was not significantly more violent than previous attacks through which the victim lived.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Another collateral </span>masculinity consequence of<span style="font-size: 8pt;">feminist law </span>reforms was the implicit empowerment of the state to enter the home in a<span class="underline"> surrogate </span>masculine role to protect women<span class="underline"> and traditional family structures.</span>This reinforced<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the positioning of </span>masculinity as the governing centerpiece of the family structure and masculinized the state<span class="underline"> as a protective actor</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Thus, view affirming the resolution as affirming the permissibility and empowerment of the feminine fighting back against the masculine.<br />
Voting affirmative is an alternative to the masculine and patriarchal processes of the status quo; how we as subjects are positioned in debate is a prerequisite to interpreting and understanding the resolution or its implications – how we know and view the world is influenced by construction of social reality through discourses of knowledge.<br />
This is especially true in discussions of gender roles and relations; discourse creates real power relations and real implications<br />

The affirmative burden is to prove that the discursive alternative is preferable to the status quo or the negative’s competitive option. The reciprocal negative burden is to prove that the status quo or their competitive speech act is preferable to enactment of the alternative. If you are going to vote for them they must give you a concrete and methodological reason to vote for their specific speech act. This idea of competitiveness is key; if there is no reason their advocacy is mutually exclusive with mine then permutation means I can advocate the AC and rejection of hegemonic masculinity as well as their speech act.<br />
Individual epistemological inquiry is key, and thus is the standard; We must each choose to self-endorse the idea of feminist epistemologies to promote checks and balances on masculine ideologies. Without investigation into how and through what methods we attempt to gather knowledge, the information we have describing the world around us is meaningless.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">These are all empirical questions. </span>By framing the questions of feminist epistemology as empirical ones<span class="underline">, feminist </span>theorists can challenge mainstream theorists<span class="underline">, who are largely empiricists, in a way that they cannot responsibly ignore or dismiss.

In the realm of environmentally destructive behaviors, </span>strip-mining, factory farming<span class="underline">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and </span>pollution<span style="font-size: 8pt;">of the air, water, and soil are instances of behaviors maintained and sanctioned within patriarchy. They, too, </span>rest on<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the faulty </span>beliefs that it is okay to &quot;rape the earth<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; that it is &quot;man's God-given right&quot; to have dominion (that is, domination) over the earth, that nature has only instrumental value, that environmental destruction is the acceptable price we pay for &quot;progress.&quot; And </span><span class="underline">the </span>presumption<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of warism, </span>that war is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a </span>natural<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, righteous, and ordinary way to impose dominion on a people or nation, </span>goes hand in hand with patriarchy<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and leads to dysfunctional behaviors of nations and ultimately to international unmanageability. Much of the current &quot;unmanageability&quot; of contemporary life in patriarchal societies, (d), is then viewed as a consequence of a patriarchal preoccupation with activities, events, and experiences that reflect historically male-gender-identified beliefs, values, attitudes, and assumptions. Included among these real-life consequences are precisely those concerns with nuclear proliferation, war, environmental destruction, and violence toward women, which many feminists see as the logical outgrowth of patriarchal thinking. In fact, it is often only through observing these dysfunctional behaviors--the symptoms of dysfunctionality--that one can truly see that and how patriarchy serves to maintain and perpetuate them. When patriarchy is understood as a dysfunctional system, this &quot;unmanageability&quot; can be seen for what it is--as a predictable and thus logical consequence of patriarchy.(11) The theme that global </span>environmental crises, war, and violence<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> generally </span>are<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> predictable and </span>logical consequences of <span style="font-size: 8pt;">sexism and </span>patriarchal culture<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is pervasive in ecofeminist literature (see Russell 1989, 2). Ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak, for instance, argues that &quot;a </span><span class="underline">militarism and warfare</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> are continual features of a patriarchal society because they </span><span class="underline">reflect</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and instill </span><span class="underline">patriarchal values</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and fulfill needs of such a system. Acknowledging the context of patriarchal conceptualizations that feed militarism is a first step toward reducing their impact and preserving life on Earth&quot; (Spretnak 1989, 54). Stated in terms of the foregoing model of patriarchy as a dysfunctional social system, the claims by Spretnak and other feminists take on a clearer meaning: </span>Patriarchal<span style="font-size: 8pt;">conceptual </span>frameworks legitimate impaired thinking<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (about women, national and regional conflict, the environment) </span>which<span style="font-size: 8pt;">is manifested in behaviors which, if continued,</span>will make life on earth<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> difficult, if not </span>impossible<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is a stark message, but it is plausible. Its plausibility lies in understanding the conceptual roots of various woman-nature-peace connections in regional, national, and global contexts.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Extinction is an independent reason to vote affirmative because it is categorically different than other impacts. The ability to have life precedes all ethical considerations, as life is a prerequisite to make moral calculations and come to logical conclusions about interactions between people and societies; if people die due to the state of exception they are no longer capable of engaging in ethical operations.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While the purpose of this book is to introduce gender as a category of analysis into the discipline of international relations</span><span class="underline">, the marginalization of women in the arena of foreign policy-making through the kind of gender stereotyping that</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I have described suggests that international politics has always been a gendered activity in the modern state system. Since foreign </span><span class="underline">and military policy-making has been</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> largely </span><span class="underline">conducted by men, the discipline that analyzes these activities is bound to be primarily about men and masculinity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We seldom realize we think in these terms, however; in most fields of knowledge </span>we have become accustomed to equating what is human with what is masculine<span class="underline">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nowhere is thismore true than in international relations, a discipline that, while it has for the most part resisted the introduction of gender into its discourse, bases its assumptions and explanations almost entirely on the activities and experiences of men. Any attempt to introduce a more explicitly gendered analysis into the field must therefore begin with a discussion of masculinity. </span>Masculinity and politics have a long and close association.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Characteristics associated with &quot;</span>manliness<span class="underline">,&quot; such as toughness, courage, power, independence, and even physical strength,</span> have, throughout history, been those most valued in the conduct of politics<span class="underline">, particularly international politics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Frequently, manliness has also been associated with violence and the use of force, a type of behavior that, when conducted in the international arena, has been valorized and applauded in the name of defending one's country. This </span>celebration of male power, particularly the glorification of the male warrior, produces more of a gender dichotomy than exists in reality<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for, as R. W.

Socially constructed gender differences are based on socially sanctioned</span>, unequal relationships between men and women that reinforce compliance with men's stated superiority.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Nowhere in the public realm are these </span><span class="underline">stereotypical gender images more apparent than in the realm of international politics, where the characteristics associated with hegemonic masculinity are projected onto the behavior of states whose success as internationalactors is measured in terms of their power capabilities and capacity for self-help and autonomy.</span><br />

Fourth, even if they win we should focus directly on the resolution, the affirmative advocacy still comes first; patriarchal norms make domestic violence inevitable and ensure that questioning of its parts or implications are inherently uninformed and flawed; the violence is inevitable<br />

Rather, gender is our primary lens </span><span class="underline">because </span>the worldwide institutionalization of gender differences is a major underpinning of structural inequalities of significance to world politics<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Through a complex interaction of identification processes, symbol systems, and social institutions (which we explore in subsequent chapters), </span>gender differences are produced<span class="underline">-typically </span>in the form of a dichotomythat<span class="underline"> not only opposes masculinity to femininity but also </span>translates<span class="underline"> these oppositional </span>differences into gender hierarchy, <span class="underline">the privileging group of traits and activities defined as masculine over those defined as feminine</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Thus, although it is important to recognize the cultural variation in how gender differences are formed and expressed</span><span class="underline">, </span>it is<span style="font-size: 8pt;">also</span>important to stress the political nature of gender as a system of difference construction and hierarchical dichotomy production<span class="underline">that is constitutive of almost all contemporary societies. Gender is about power, and power is gendered. We begin to make this power visible by examining the relationship between masculinity and femininity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<br />
And, debate is uniquely key for this advocacy; questions of methodology and structures to be fought against is a prerequisite to action; we must understand how and when the gender structure is constructed to deconstruct it<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Risman writes:</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Barbara J., rofessor of Sociology and alumni Research Distinguished Professor at North Carolina State University. “Gender as a Social Structure: Theory Wrestling with Activism,” Gender and Society, Vol. 18, No. 4, pp. 429-450) BN.</span><br />
Cognitive bias<span class="underline"> is one of the mechanisms by which inequality is re-created in everyday life. </span>There are<span class="underline">,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> however, </span>documented mechanisms for decreasing the salience of such bias<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Bielby 2000; Reskin 2000; Ridgeway and Correll 2000). </span><span class="underline">When we consciously manipulate the status expectations attached to those in subordinate groups, by highlighting their legitimate expertise beyond the others in the immediate social setting, we can begin to challenge the nonconscious hierarchy that often goes unnoticed.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Similarly, although many subordinates adapt to their situation by trading power for patronage, when they refuse to do so, interaction no longer flows smoothly, and change may result. Surely, when wives refuse to trade power for patronage, they can rock the boat as well as the cradle. These are only a few examples of interactive processes that can help to explain the reproduction of inequality and to envision strategies for disrupting inequality. </span>We need to understand when and how inequality is constructed and reproduced to deconstruct it<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I have argued before (Risman 1998) that </span>because the gender structure so defines the category woman as subordinate<span class="underline">, the deconstruction of the category itself is the best, indeed the only sure way, to end gender subordination. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is no reason, except the transitional vertigo that will accompany the process to dismantle it, that a utopian vision of a just world involves any gender structure at all. Why should we need to elaborate on the biological distinction between the sexes? </span><span class="underline">We must accommodate reproductive differences for the process of biological replacement, but there is no a priori reason we should accept any other role differentiation simply based on biological sex category.</span>Before accepting any gender elaboration<span class="underline"> around biological sex category, we ought to search suspiciously for the possibly subtle ways such differentiation supports men’s privilege.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Once two salient groups exist, the process of in-group and out-group distinctions and ingroup opportunity hoarding become possible. While it may be that for some competitive sports, single-sex teams are necessary, beyond that, </span>it seems unlikely that any differentiation or cultural elaboration around sex category has a purpose beyond differentiation in support of stratification<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Feminist scholarship always wrestles with the questions of how one can use the knowledge we create in the interest of social transformation. As feminist scholars, we must talk beyond our own borders. This kind of theoretical work becomes meaningful if we can eventually take it public. Feminist sociology must be public sociology (Burawoy forthcoming).</span>We must eventually take what we have learned from our theories and research beyond professional journals to our students and to those activists who seek to disrupt and so transform gender relations.Wemust con<span class="underline">sider how the </span>knowledge<span class="underline"> we create can help those who desire a more egalitarian social world to refuse to do gender at all, or to do it with rebellious reflexiveness to help transform the world around them.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For those without a sociological perspective, social change through socialization and through legislation are the easiest to envision. </span><span class="underline">We need to shine a spotlight on the dimension of cultural interactional expectations as it is here that work needs to begin.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We must remember, however, that much doing gender at the individual and interactional levels gives pleasure as well as reproduces inequality, and until we find other socially acceptable means to replace that opportunity for pleasure, we can hardly advocate for its cessation. The question of how gender elaboration has been woven culturally into the fabric of sexual desire deserves more attention. Many of our allies believe that “viva la difference” is required for sexual passion, and few would find a postgender society much of a feminist utopia if it came at the cost of sexual play. No one wants to be part of a revolution where she or he cannot dirty dance. </span><br />

 Status quo politics and governmentality engage the state of exception, the idea that some individuals are politically and morally valuable while others aren’t, a determination that is entirely up to the whim of the state, who can decide at any time that an individual is not a moral agent but a figure of “bare life” as we become homo sacers, a simple body with organs that has no moral agency; the exception to the new rule of bare life is the ability to be obligated to the other, to recognize that we have obligations to recognize others have moral legitimacy above that of bare life and that we must respect their political agency<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is precisely this closure of theory, which in Agamben is a communication communicating nothing other than itself, that becomes the determining factor in Emmanuel Levinas's critique of ontological imperialism in Totality and Infinity. In Totality and Infinity, Levinas argues that </span>theory<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [End Page 266] </span>without a relation with alterity,<span class="underline"> with exteriority, </span>is ontology as it &quot;designates comprehension—the logos of being<span class="underline">—that is, </span>a way of approaching the known being such that its alterity with regard to the knowing vanishes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; (Levinas 1969, 42). </span>In Agamben's<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> theory of the </span>state of exception, that promises human praxis to retrieve politics, the closure is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even </span>more formidable since it posits a beingwithout any representation or any relation to the other<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even though Levinas tries to displace the ontology of theory with what he calls </span><span class="underline">the &quot;metaphysics of desire</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; through which he wishes </span><span class="underline">to reverse the terms by eliminating theory that presupposes &quot;an exercise of freedom</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; (1969, 43); and though </span><span class="underline">this</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> simple </span>reversal<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> between ontology and metaphysics </span>might not ensure<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> what he calls &quot;</span>the obligation to the other<span class="underline"> for justice</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; (47); </span>Levinas is right in proposing an escape from the onslaught of the freedom of theory through<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> what hecalls </span>philosophy's &quot;ontic wisdom of perception<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; (1981, 206). </span>What is important<span class="underline"> in juxtaposing Levinas against Agamben </span>is<span style="font-size: 8pt;">not only </span>the contrast between philosophy and theory<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or in other words the ontical and the ontological, </span><span class="underline">but also </span>between Levinas's opening of the structure of being to the other. Levinas is aware of philosophy's desire to be ontological, but<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> he claims that &quot;</span>philosophy has kept an ontic style<span class="underline">&quot; as it bears on entities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on something, &quot;since one cannot say that it is&quot; (1981, 206). He believes this </span>subversion of the ontological<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—that says only itself—by the ontic, </span><span class="underline">which is worldly, </span>would lead us from the thauma of theory to the awakeningtrauma of the self to the other<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (214). One can argue that for Levinas </span>this<span class="underline"> traumatic </span>opening of the self to the other would be a kind of exception<span class="underline">; and this event of </span>awakening to the other<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, this trauma of intersubjectivity that Levinas's essay attributes to Husserl, </span>is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> precisely </span>what is missing in Agamben's account of human praxis in the wake of the state of exception<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In addition to this, the thauma of theory that Agamben distinguishes from &quot;a process of infinite deconstruction&quot; and also from justice (2005b, 64) functions as a mirror image of what the original Italian text calls &quot;la vita augusta&quot; (2003b, 106) embodied in the person of the auctor, who, in ancient Roman law, as opposed to the magistracy, is related to the extreme form of auctoritas. And as Agamben explains, auctoritas, like Weber's charismatic power, springs from the person as [End Page 267] something that is constituted and contained in him and that disappears with him (2005b, 82). Agamben's otherwise very intriguing and insightful reading of Carl Schmitt's Political Theology and Benjamin's &quot;Critique of Violence&quot; in the chapter entitled &quot;Gigantomachy Concerning a Void&quot; is tainted by the same proclivity for ontologizing. In this chapter, Agamben tries to stage the scandalous debate between Schmitt and Benjamin, in which Schmitt attempts to &quot;reinscribe violence within a juridical concept, [while] Benjamin responds to this gesture by seeking every time to assure it—as pure violence—an existence outside of the law&quot; (Agamben 2005b, 59). The latter tries to keep &quot;divine violence&quot; that lies beyond the cycle of law-making and law-preserving (Benjamin 1978, 297) clear from the juridical order. Benjamin tries to save the &quot;real state of exception,&quot; as the eighth thesis from &quot;On the Concept of History&quot; has it (Benjamin 2003, 392), and use it against the degeneration of the exception into the rule. Schmitt, on the other hand, fears that once exception becomes the rule, the machine ceases to function. Therefore, he tries to keep sovereignty related to the juridical order. The dispute, continues Agamben, &quot;takes place in a zone of anomie that, on the one hand, must be maintained in relation to the law at all cost, and, on the other, must be just as implacably released and freed from this relation&quot; (2005b, 59). The battle concerning anomie and violence also concerns human actions, as Agamben adds, the real stake in the battle over anomie is about the &quot;status of violence as a cipher for human action&quot; (59). At this point, Agamben seems to neutralize the difference between Schmitt's sovereign violence and Benjamin's revolutionary counterviolence, thereby securing a space for human action, or in other words, a space for being itself. This struggle for anomie, he says, is a decisive &quot;gigantomachia peri tes ousia&quot; [battle of giants concerning being] that defines Western metaphysics: </span>Here, pure violence as the extreme political object<span class="underline">, as the &quot;thing&quot; of politics, </span>is the counterpart to pure being<span class="underline">, to pure existence </span>as the ultimate metaphysical stakes<span class="underline">; the strategy of exception, which must ensure the relation between [End Page 268] anomic violence and law, is the counterpart to the onto-theo-logical strategy aimed at capturing pure being in the meshes of the logos</span>.<br />

The homo sacer is Agamben’s word for the body without moral agency; in ancient times the homo sacer was one that was exiled from society for breaking the law, and the law no longer applied to them; any person could injure, maim, steal from, kill, or violate them in any way without legal reprehension; Agamben makes the connection to the modern state of exception, the state’s ability to kill off any portion of the population in the name of life with no consequences; however, he does not assume for the obligation to the other, which if adopted would create an obligation to help the other, so as not to view their existence as merely that of bare life.<br />

View voting affirmative as an alternative to the biopolitical processes of the status quo; how we as subjects are positioned in debate is a prerequisite to interpreting and understanding the resolution or its implications – how we know and view the world is influenced by construction of social reality through discourses of knowledge.<br />

What is the nature of resistance in the state of exception<span class="underline">?

In other words, </span>the nature of resistance in the state of exception is individualized<span class="underline">, rather than collective, oriented toward short-term, rather than systemic </span>change<span class="underline">, and </span>fought by means that present a<span class="underline">n indirect, rather than direct, </span>challenge to sovereign power<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For illegal migrants, acts of resistance range from the extreme of hunger strikes and suicide attempts to acts of physical resistance and escape, to the destruction of identity documents.</span><br />

The affirmative burden is to prove that the discursive alternative is preferable to the status quo or the negative’s competitive option. Needs can be negative; thus, any conception of negative rights justifies the affirmative, ie I need to not be killed. The reciprocal negative burden is to prove that the status quo or their competitive speech act is preferable to enactment of the alternative. If you are going to vote for them they must give you a concrete and methodological reason to vote for their specific speech act. This idea of competitiveness is key; if there is no reason their advocacy is mutually exclusive with mine then permutation means I can advocate the AC and rejection of biopolitics as well as their speech act.<br />

The sovereign ability to control the value of individuals’ lives creates the state of emergency, in which the state can justify the death of any portion of the population in the name of life<br />

There must be some set of principles for allowing<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in exceptional circumstances, </span>the introduction of sovereign power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In other words, </span><span class="underline">there must be some set of </span>conditions that can be identified as a threat, such that a<span class="underline"> corresponding </span>state of emergency can be claimed<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in which the formerly decentralized apparatus of biopolitics suddenly constricts into the exception of sovereignty. 'It is at this moment that racism is inscribed as the basic mechanism of power, as it is exercised in modern States' (2003: 254). But I would argue that Foucault means 'racism' here in a specific, medical and biological sense. Racism in this sense is a biologically-inflected political relation in which war is rendered as fundamentally biological: </span>Wars are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign who must be defended; they are waged on behalf of the existence of everyone<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span>entire populations are mobilized for<span class="underline"> the purpose of </span>wholesale slaughter<span class="underline"> in the name of life necessity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: massacres have become vital Â… </span><span class="underline">the </span>existence in question is no longer the juridical existence of sovereignty<span class="underline">; </span>at stake is the biological existence of a population<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (1978: 137) In a curious turn of phrase, </span><span class="underline">Foucault later calls this a 'democratization of sovereignty</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,' a condition in which </span>the sovereign state of emergency emerges through awidespread<span class="underline"> and generalized </span>threat to the population<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (2003: 37). In such conditions, </span>both a medical-biological view<span class="underline"> of the population, </span>and<span class="underline"> a </span>statistical-informatic means<span class="underline"> of accounting for the population, </span>converge in the identification of potential threats and<span class="underline"> possible measures of </span>security<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In a sense, </span><span class="underline">it is war that acts as the hinge between population and information, but a war that always puts at stake the biological existence of the population</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (and thus nation). The body natural, even as it serves as an analogy for the body politic, is always what is fundamentally at stake in the body politic.</span><br />

Since measures of security can only function within a context of freedom of traffic, trade, and individual initiative, Foucault can show that the development of security coincides with the development of liberal ideology. </span><span class="underline">Today </span>we are facing<span class="underline"> extreme and </span>most dangerous developments of this<span class="underline"> paradigm of </span>security<span class="underline">. </span>In the<span class="underline"> course of a gradual </span>neutralisation of politics<span class="underline"> and the progressive surrender of traditional tasks of the state, </span>security imposes itself as the basic principle of state activity<span class="underline">. What used to be one among several decisive measures of public administration until the first half of the twentieth century, now becomes the sole criterion of political legitimation. </span>Security reasoning entails an essential risk. A state which has security as its only task<span class="underline"> and source of legitimacy </span>is<span class="underline"> a </span>fragile<span class="underline"> organism; </span>it can always be provoked<span class="underline"> by terrorism to turn itself terroristic. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We should not forget that the first major organisation of terror after the war, the Organisation de l'Armée Secrète (OAS) was established by a French General who thought of himself as patriotic and who was convinced that terrorism was the only answer to the guerilla phenomenon in Algeria and Indochina. When politics, the way it was understood by theorists of the &quot;Polizeiwissenschaft&quot; in the eighteenth century, reduces itself to police, the difference between state and terrorism threatens to disappear. In the end it may lead to security and terrorism forming a single deadly system in which they mutually justify and legitimate each others' actions. The risk is not merely the development of a clandestine complicity of opponents but that </span>the hunt for security leads to a worldwide<span class="underline"> civil </span>war which destroys all civil coexistence<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the new situation -- created by the end of the classical form of war between sovereign states -- </span><span class="underline">security finds its end in globalisation: it implies the idea of a new planetary order which is</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in fact, </span><span class="underline">the worst of all disorders. But there is yet another danger. </span>Because they require constant reference to a state of exception, measures of security<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> work towards a growing depoliticization of society. In the long run, </span><span class="underline">they </span>are irreconcilable with democracy<span class="underline">. Nothing is therefore more important than a revision of the concept of security as the basic principle of state politics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Maybe the time has come to work towards the prevention of disorder and catastrophe, and not merely towards their control. Today, there are plans for all kinds of emergencies (ecological, medical, military), but there is no politics to prevent them</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. On the contrary, </span><span class="underline">we can say that </span>politics secretly works towards the production of emergencies<span class="underline">.

The ability to have life precedes all ethical considerations, as life is a prerequisite to make moral calculations and come to logical conclusions about interactions between people and societies; if people die due to the state of exception they are no longer capable of engaging in ethical operations. And, loss of ethical value is inevitable as long as the sovereign functions in a biopolitical manner<br />

It is as if every valorization and </span>every “politicization” of life<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (which, after all, is implicit in the sovereignty of the individual over his own existence) </span><span class="underline">necessarily </span>implies a new decision concerning the threshold beyond which life ceases to be<span class="underline"> politically </span>relevant<span class="underline">, becomes only “sacred life,” and can as such be eliminated without punishment</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Every society sets this limit; every society—even the most modern—decides who its “sacred men” will be. It is even pos­sible that this limit, on which the politicization and the <em>exceprio</em> of natural life in the juridical order of the state depends, has done nothing but extend itself in the history of the West and has now— </span><span class="underline">in the new biopolitical horizon of states with national sovereignty—moved inside every human life and every citizen. </span>Bare life is no longer confined to a particular place<span class="underline"> or a definite category. </span>It now dwells in the biological body of every living being<span class="underline">. </span><br />

Power and knowledge are co-productive—while the negative would like you to believe that their advantages are objective depictions of the world, these claims are in fact contingent products of a dynamic network of power relations—their attempt to know the world is itself an exercise of control which must be interrogated before any action is taken<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pickett writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Axel Honneth, among others, points out that Foucault's conception of power is a reworking of Nietzsche's idea of the will to power.6 </span>Power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in this view, </span>is not a fixed property<span class="underline"> held by one class or group; </span>it is the outcome of conflict between a number of actors<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">It is</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not stable; it is </span><span class="underline">continually in flux and any truces must be considered temporary. </span>Power is ubiquitous in the linguistic<span class="underline">, bureaucratic, moral, </span>and other structures in which agents act<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For instance, although determined by power, </span><span class="underline">the fundamental rules of morality are often seen as natural rather than contingent products of history</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: &quot;It is true that </span>it is society that defines<span class="underline">, in terms of its own interests, </span>what must be regarded as crime: it is not<span class="underline"> therefore </span>natural<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. . . . [But] </span><span class="underline">by assuming the form of a natural sequence, </span>punishment does not appear as the arbitrary effect of human power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; By revealing the origins and historical shifts of our basic moral and cultural distinctions, it is possible to show that </span>whatseems<span class="underline"> to be </span>natural<span class="underline"> and self-evident </span>is<span class="underline"> in fact </span>contingent and arbitrary<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What appears as nature is in fact the workings of power. Furthermore, the will to </span>knowledge is the expression of power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There is a battle for truth; </span><span class="underline">knowledge is the spoils of victory</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.9 Both Nietzsche and Foucault deny that there is a timeless, a historical truth. Instead, </span>truth<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is a thing of this world, and as such, it </span>is subject to the<span class="underline"> contingency, error, mendacity, and </span>struggle that characterize thisworld<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Hence, Nietzsche argues that every philosophy is an expression of the will to power of the philosopher who wrote it.10 Foucault argues that the </span>human sciences operate on the basis of hierarchical relations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as those between doctor and patient, or teacher and student, </span>and<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span>these sciences<span class="underline"> in turn </span>have effects of power<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11 For these reasons, </span>power must not be considered<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as an essentially negative force, as something which is &quot;poor </span><span class="underline">in resources, sparing of its methods, </span>monotonous<span class="underline"> . . . incapable of invention, </span>and<span class="underline"> seemingly </span>doomed always to repeatitself<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot;12 </span><span class="underline">Instead, </span>power is capable of producing knowledge, rules of morality, and<span class="underline"> the </span>basic distinctions and denotations of a language<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For Nietzsche </span><span class="underline">power is creative and concerned with the continual increase in force</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For Foucault, modern power is the same: unlike power in the classical age, it is inventive and concerned with the increase in social forces. Nietzsche and Foucault's views of power culminate in the claim that </span>power produces identity<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Each agent is the creation and expression of power</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Both are anti-naturalists; they deny that there is something &quot;natural&quot; at the bottom of who we are. </span>There is no fixed human nature<span class="underline"> or subjectivity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Instead, </span>power produces agency:<span class="underline"> it creates animals capable of, for example, promising and confessing</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A central aspect of both philosophers' work is an attack on the philosophy of the subject, that is, on some concept of an ahistorical metaphysical agent that is the &quot;doer&quot; behind our thoughts and deeds. Instead of positing a subject which is the foundation of all knowledge and action, </span><span class="underline">philosophy should undermine its attachment to this &quot;subject without a history.&quot;13 We need to see the subject as simply the outcome of the correlation of forces, relations, and practices that constitute him.</span><br />

Further, the liberal lens of the negative blinds them to understanding the full extent of the sovereigns power<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Norris 2k</span> - <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Assistant Professor of Political Science at the Univeristy of Pennsylvania [Andrew “Agamben and the Politics of the Living Dead” Diacritics, Vol 30, No 4, Winter 04, pp. 38-58, Published by the John Hopkins University Press, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:6387:http://www.jstor.org/stable/1566307 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1566307" rel="nofollow">http://www.jstor.org/stable/1566307</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:6387 -->]</span><br />
<span class="underline">Agamben brings this out nicely in a discussion of Bruno Bettelheim's argument that the Muselmann has passed beyond the limit of the human and the moral by re- nouncing his freedom and by losing sight of the limit beyond which his life would have to be sacrificed in defense of that freedom.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For Bettelheim, regardless of the conditions, a human being can avoid becoming a Muselmann by &quot;accepting death as a human be- ing.&quot; But Agamben argues that </span><span class="underline">&quot;Simply to deny the Muselmann's humanity would be to accept the verdict of the SS and to repeat their gesture.&quot; The Muselmann &quot;does not merely embody a moral death,&quot; rather he &quot;is the site of an experiment in which morality and humanity are called into question,&quot; he is &quot;a limit figure of a special kind, in which not only categories such as dignity and respect but even the very idea of an ethical limit lose their meaning.&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> To acknowledge the Muselmann's compromised humanity, Bettelheim's limit of the human is denied; to avoid the moral barbarism of an imagined confrontation with a Muselmann in which one judges his &quot;character and habits,&quot; one renounces ethical terminology. </span><span class="underline">With the Muselmann </span>we find the limit of limits: clear boundaries can no longer be drawn<span class="underline"> here [Agamben, Remnants of Auschwitz 56, 63].26 The point is not that the liberal refusal to consider the camp as threshold rules out a solution to this dilemma from the start. </span>The very idea of a solution<span class="underline"> here </span>seems offensive<span class="underline">. The point is rather that </span>the liberal response can make no sense of its own confusion. The camp is simply evil<span class="underline"> and incomprehensible. The person condemned to a camp is neither capable of morality nor incapable of it. As for the difficult questions this emerging limit of </span>the moral<span class="underline"> might raise, they </span>too are set aside in favor of a respectful silence<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.27 In contrast, Agamben's conception of the threshold at least promises to more precisely delineate these confusions: the </span><span class="underline">camp both is and is not a legal, political, and moral space. Hence, </span>we should hardly be surprised to find ourselves torn, wanting both to affirm and<span class="underline"> to </span>deny that these categories apply here<span class="underline">. </span><span class="Emphasis2">Finally, </span>the liberal strategy reveals its limitations when we recognize that the no- tion of the threshold is<span class="Emphasis2"> in fact </span>expanding into areas where we will not have the luxury of refusing to consider the inner logic of phenomena we should like to reject as evil and incomprehensible.What<span class="underline">, for instance, </span>are we to do when<span class="underline"> we are </span>dealing with agents<span class="underline"> or things </span>that have not already been recognized as the bearers of rights<span class="underline">? </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Here the reassertion of rights is simply not an option. We must decide whether a neomort-a body whose only signs of life are that it is &quot;warm, pulsating, and urinating&quot;-is in fact a human being at all, an agent or a thing. In such cases, &quot;life and death [cease to be] properly scientific concepts [and become] political concepts, which as such acquire a political meaning precisely only through a decision&quot; [Homo Sacer 164]. Ironically, such deci- sions are increasingly made by scientists, and not by politicians: &quot;In the biopolitical horizon [orizzonte biopolitico] that characterizes modernity, </span><span class="underline">the physician and the sci- entist move into the no-man's-land [terra di nessuno] into which at one point the sover- eign alone could penetrate&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [159]. These are still marginal figures in our current politi- cal life. But if Agamben is right, </span><span class="underline">the concept of the margin is itself being swept away. It is this that leads him to conclude that the camp is the as-yet-unrecognized paradigm of the modern. As the logic of the sovereign exception comes unraveled (or is realized- this paradox being a necessary function of that logic), and the impossibility of categori- cally distinguishing between exception and rule is made manifest, the distinction be- tween bare life and political life is hopelessly confuse</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">d. &quot;When life and politics-origi- nally divided, and linked together by means of the no-man's land of the state of excep- tion that is inhabited [abita] by bare life [la nuda vita]-begin to become one, all life becomes sacred and all politics becomes the exception&quot; [148].28 [End page 52] In the end, the attempt to resist this through the assertion of human rights ignores the connection between the humanism that undergirds the concept of rights and the events that seem to conflict with it. Agamben's argument is not that Aristotle's or Locke's reflections on politics carry with them an implicit commitment to the substantive racist policies of National Socialism; nor does he claim that they &quot;caused&quot; the Holocaust (a term to which he objects [114]). What he does argue is that there is a deep affinity between such contemporary horrors and the tradition of political philosophy to which we might turn in an effort to understand and combat such phenomena. The practical implication would not be that there is no difference between Aristotle or Hitler, but that Aristotle will not provide a stable point from which to critique those who follow after him, or from which to construct an alternative.29 There is no Archimedean point outside biopolitics. Politics is always a matter of the body, and &quot;The 'body' is always already a biopolitical body&quot; [187]. </span><br />

<br />
Even if you choose death is neither good or bad, it still outweighs other ethical claims because you have no right to choose for everyone else and is a prerequisite because allowing others to die means you accept that they are not a part of a particular ethical calculation<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Myers writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Perhaps the best account of responsibility to emerge from the Holocaust is that of the late Emmanuel Levinas. Emmanuel Levinas Although the philosophical discussion of responsibility is at least as old as Aristotle’s Politics, since the Holocaust the term belongs by rights to Levinas.6 A naturalized French Jew born in Kovno, Lithuania, 92 percent of whose 30,000 Jews were murdered by the Germans (including most of his family), </span><span class="underline">Levinas</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> survived the war as a French officer in a pow camp near Hanover, studying Hegel, Proust, Diderot, and Rousseau between shifts of forced labor in the German forests.7 It is likely that he </span><span class="underline">experienced the &quot;belated shame&quot; which,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> according to Primo Levi in The Drowned and the Saved, &quot;</span><span class="underline">gnaws and rasps&quot; at every survivor of the Holocaust: Are you ashamed because you are alive in place of another</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? And in particular, of a man more generous, more sensitive, more useful, wiser, worthier of living than you? </span><span class="underline">You cannot block out such feelings</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. . . . It is no more than a supposition, indeed the shadow of a suspicion: that each man is his brother’s Cain, that each of us . . . has usurped his neighbor’s place and lived in his stead. (81-82) It is likely that Levinas was tormented by such shame, because his entire philosophy grows out of the inchoate anxiety, which parallels Levi’s &quot;shadow of a suspicion,&quot; that one person’s life usurps another’s. </span><span class="underline">All those who lived through</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the years 1939 to 1945 &quot;</span><span class="underline">retained a burn on their sides,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; he remarks, &quot;</span><span class="underline">as though they had to bear for ever the shame of having survived</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; (&quot;From the Rise of Nihilism&quot; 221). Levinas argues that </span>human subjectivity<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or self-consciousness—the foundation of the self—</span>is mauvaise conscience, the feeling of being &quot;not guilty, but accused<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; Stripped of its intentionality, its reaching out to grasp an object of knowledge (&quot;an other of consciousness&quot;), existing in a condition of passivity, </span>the human subject is put into question<span class="underline">. What am I</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? To be, I have to respond. &quot;But, from that point,&quot; Levinas explains, &quot;in affirming this me being, one has to respond to one’s right to be.&quot; </span>Self-consciousness is self-justification, because it is consciousness of being without the intention of being. I am aware of my existence, but I did nothing to bring about my existence<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And </span>therefore I am prey to the gnawings of conscience<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Is it possible<span class="underline"> that </span>I came into being as the result of a crime of which I am unaware<span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Levinas puts it even more strongly: </span>My being-in-the-world o<span class="underline">r my &quot;place in the sun,&quot; my being at home</span>, have these not<span class="underline"> also </span>been the usurpation of spaces belonging to the other [person] whom I have<span class="underline"> already </span>oppressed<span class="underline"> or starved,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or driven out into a third world; </span><span class="underline">are they not acts of repulsing, excluding, exiling, stripping, killing</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Pascal’s &quot;my place in the sun&quot; marks the beginning of the image of the usurpation of the whole earth. (&quot;Ethics as First Philosophy&quot; 81-82) Since the first stirrings of consciousness are the gnawings of conscience, the first question before the human subject is the ethical: how are you going to respond to this uneasy sense of being &quot;not guilty, but accused&quot;? </span>All human action<span class="underline">, every effort to budge from the passivity of subjectivity, </span>is a response to ethical challenge<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Hence </span><span class="underline">ethics are &quot;first philosophy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; logically prior to any other mode of thought. Socrates’ deontological advice that it is better to suffer injustice than to cause it (Gorgias 469c) is of small assistance to him who is rasped by the mauvaise conscience that he has already caused injustice. &quot;</span>Self-consciousness is not an inoffensive action<span class="underline"> in which the self takes note of its being</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; Levinas says; &quot;</span>it is inseparable from a consciousness of justice and injustice<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; (&quot;Religion for Adults&quot; 16). What he proposes is to replace deontology with a counterfactual ethics of responsibility. </span><span class="underline">If I am not guilty of hurting another I cannot be blamed for it, but if I nevertheless feel accused of it I can take responsibility for it</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this way perhaps I can both ease my conscience and begin to repair any damage that I might have caused. </span>My responsibility to the person I might have hurt<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—the human Other or Autrui, in Levinas’s terminology—</span>preempts any claims of my own<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Because the injury is counterfactual, because it is not specified and therefore not limited, my relation to the other is a relation of infinite responsibility, which means there is no escaping it (&quot;Transcendence and Height&quot; 20-21).8 In Buber’s familiar terms, </span>not to respond is to treat the other as an It rather than a Thou<span class="underline">, an object to which things are done rather than a person with whom I might speak</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But for Levinas there is no not responding. To ignore another to shame her, to make her aware of her isolation from me, and thus to duck the responsibility for not hurting her in these ways. Everyone is responsible to another whether he knows it or not. </span><span class="underline">Being human is living in responsibility</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Levinas’s ethics are not prescriptive, then, but descriptive. It is not that I should be responsible; I already am responsible by virtue of having consciousness. Every new encounter with another raises the question how I am going to respond to her. Although it is not prescribed, how to respond is a decision entirely within my command. Either I can accept responsibility or I can default—there is no third alternative. The injustice to another &quot;imposes itself upon me,&quot; Levinas says, &quot;without my being able to be deaf to its call or to forget it, that is, without my being able to suspend my responsibility for its distress&quot; (&quot;Meaning and Sense&quot; 54)</span>.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The individualism, uniformity, and universality of rights in Locke's theory contrast vividly with the medieval conception. </span><span class="underline">In making rights</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [End Page 947] </span><span class="underline">individual, Locke detaches them from their mooring in social relations and customary institutions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Nothing could be further from the view that rights and duties are anchored in specific roles and particular communities than an account in which all individuals possess identical rights inferred from their postulated isolation in a hypothetical state of nature. </span>The &quot;natural man&quot; of early liberalthought[‘s]<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is paradigmatically an individual in his own right rather than a member of a community, and his </span>rights belong to him independent of and prior to any social obligations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of performance or obedience tied to his role </span>in the community<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Indeed, </span><span class="underline">they are natural and exist prior to the political community</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The uniformity and universality of Lockean rights represent a similar contrast with the diverse and context-dependent character of medieval rights. On the medieval view the rights and obligations of peasants differed significantly from those of their lords, just as the rights of peasants and lords in one locality differed from those in the next. The natural men of Locke's theory all enjoy the same rights; they are born free and equal and all share an equal right to natural freedom. 53 </span>This Lockean system of rights and liberties<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (including Locke's views on property) </span>justified enclosure and<span style="font-size: 8pt;">virtually </span>unlimited accumulation, the eradication of customary rights and privileges, and<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span>creation of a market<span class="underline"> in wage labor.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In so doing </span>it facilitated<span class="underline"> important mercantilist aims while providing </span>arguments that would justifysocial practices crucial to the further development of capitalism<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. With respect to enclosure, Locke breaks with medieval arguments based on common property. 54 He acknowledges that God gave the earth in common to everyone for their benefit, but he did so for the use of the industrious and rational, whose labor gives them title to it. 55 Locke contrasts land that is common by compact from the original &quot;great Common of the World,&quot; which was appropriated by individuals. God commanded man to labor, and labor gives men &quot;distinct titles to several parcels of [the world], for their private uses; wherein there could be no doubt of Right.&quot; 56 </span>Avoiding waste or spoilage and<span class="underline"> the </span>requirement that &quot;enough and as good&quot; be left for others<span class="underline"> initially </span>limit<span class="underline"> the </span>accumulation of property<span class="underline"> in the state of nature. </span>But<span class="underline"> the introduction</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (through universal tacit consent) </span><span class="underline">of </span>money eliminates the<span class="underline"> spoilage </span>restriction and justifies<span class="underline"> &quot;an </span>inequality<span class="underline"> of private possessions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; 57 </span><span class="underline">The proviso requiring &quot;enough and as good&quot; becomes empty</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> because &quot;he who appropriates land to himself by his labor, [End Page 948] does not lessen but increase the common stock of mankind.&quot; 58 This is because enclosed land is 100 times more productive than common or unimproved land. 59 Shapiro argues that any right to subsistence implied by Locke's concern with the preservation and benefit of mankind or by the Lockean proviso must in light of these arguments be interpreted as a right to work for subsistence—at least under normal circumstances. 60 Locke's assumption of natural freedom and equality establishes a framework in which obligation is created consensually, through contract, and his emphasis on toleration—which extends beyond religion to one's health and estate—thus sets a precedent for noninterference in such relationships except where interference is required by natural law. 61 </span>Governmental interference<span class="underline"> to enforce limits on accumulation or to redistribute possessions </span>would be unacceptable<span class="underline"> on Locke's view</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 62 In practice </span><span class="underline">this insistence</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on the consensual foundations of obligation </span><span class="underline">amounts to a &quot;right to be free of inherited</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> social </span><span class="underline">obligations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; 63 a right crucial to the elimination of customary encumbrances on land and internal trade and development. This </span>freedom from the social welfare obligations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> traditionally </span><span class="underline">associated with land ownership </span>proved crucial to capitalist development<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, freeing up the use and disposition of land and other possessions and eliminating customary levies and other privileges.</span><br />

Thus, affirmation of the resolution is a rejection of capitalism, as in a world of the resolution assistance to the other in need would be prioritized over economic competition. View affirmation as an alternative to the inherent oppression of the status quo; we need to analyze the flaws in the system to find the preconditions for movements away from capitalism and its inevitable collapse – this is key to develop a real political strategy<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the most general terms and at the highest level of abstraction, </span><span class="underline">the question of counter-hegemony evokes the dialectic of bringing the new into existence</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, against the sedimented practices and relations that, as Marx (1852) wrote, weigh ‘like a nightmare on the brains of the living.’ </span><span class="underline">Yet </span>it is from existing practices and relations that the new is fabricated<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which is to say that </span><span class="underline">the future is already contained as potential within the present.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ‘Fermenting in the process of the real itself’ is what Ernst Bloch called ‘the concrete forward dream: anticipating elements are a component of reality itself’ (1986:197).

And, how we as subjects are positioned in debate is a prerequisite to interpreting and understanding the resolution or its implications – how we know and view the world is influenced by construction of social reality through discourses of knowledge. The affirmative burden is to prove that the discursive alternative is preferable to the status quo or the negative’s competitive option. The reciprocal negative burden is to prove that the status quo or negating the resolution is preferable to enactment of the alternative. Burdens must be reciprocal for fairness by definition. Skepticism does not meet the neg’s burden because if I have to prove a moral obligation for this specific act, the neg’s reciprocal burden is to prove no moral obligation for this specific act. If skep negates the aff reciprocal burden would be “moral obligations are possible.” And, skep doesn’t work with this affirmative; the reason ethical determinations are foggy are because people and values become commodities; voting aff is a prerequisite the creation of clear ethical values. Needs can be negative; thus, any conception of negative rights justifies the affirmative, ie I need to not be killed.<br />

Capitalism is a system to be rejected; its drive for resource expansion causes exploitation of the worker that underlies all social problems; it guarantees endless violence through oppression and racism, along with environmental degradation that ensure total extinction<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brown 5</span><br />
<span class="underline">The capitalist class owns the factories, the banks, and transportation-the means of production and distribution. Workers sell their ability to work in order to acquire the necessities of life</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Capitalists buy the workers' labor, but only pay them back a portion of the wealth they create. Because the capitalists own the means of production, they are able to keep the surplus wealth created by workers above and beyond the cost of paying worker's wages and other costs of production. This surplus is called &quot;profit&quot; and consists of unpaid labor that the capitalists appropriate and use to achieve ever-greater profits.</span><span class="underline">These </span>profits are turned into capital which capitalists use to further exploit the producers of all wealth-the working class.<span class="underline"> Capitalists are compelled by competition to seek to maximize profits. The capitalist class as a whole can do that only by extracting a greater surplus from the unpaid labor of workers by increasing exploitation. Under capitalism, </span>economic development happens only if it is profitable to<span class="underline"> the </span>individual capitalists<span class="underline">, </span>not<span class="underline"> for any </span>social need<span class="underline"> or good. </span>The profit drive is inherent in capitalism, and underlies or exacerbates all major social ills of our times.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> With the rapid advance of technology and productivity, new forms of capitalist ownership have developed to maximize profit</span><span class="underline">. The working people of our country confront serious, chronic problems because of capitalism. These chronic problems become part of the objective conditions that confront each new generation of working people. </span>The threat of nuclear war,<span class="underline"> which can destroy all humanity, </span>grows with the spread of nuclear weapons<span class="underline">, space-based weaponry</span>, and a military doctrine that justifies their use in preemptive wars and wars without end<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ever since the end of World War II, the U.S. has been constantly involved in aggressive military actions big and small. These wars have cost millions of lives and casualties, huge material losses, as well as trillions of U.S. taxpayer dollars. </span>Threats to the environment continue<span class="underline"> to spiral, </span>threatening all life<span class="underline"> on our planet. Millions of workers are unemployed or insecure in their jobs, even during economic upswings and periods of &quot;recovery&quot; from recessions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Most workers experience long years of stagnant real wages, while health and education costs soar. Many workers are forced to work second and third jobs to make ends meet. Most workers now average four different occupations during their lifetime, being involuntarily moved from job to job and career to career. Often, retirement-age workers are forced to continue working just to provide health care for themselves. With capitalist globalization, jobs move as capitalists export factories and even entire industries to other countries.</span><span class="underline">Millions of people continuously live below the poverty level; many suffer homelessness and hunger. Public and private programs to alleviate poverty and hunger do not reach everyone, and are inadequate even for those they do reach. </span>Racism remains the most potent weapon to divide working people. <span class="underline">Institutionalized </span>racism provides billions in extra profits for the capitalists every year<span class="underline"> due to the unequal pay racially oppressed workers receive for work of comparable value</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. All workers receive lower wages when racism succeeds in dividing and disorganizing them. In every aspect of economic and social life, African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian a nd Pacific Islanders, Arabs and Middle Eastern peoples, and</span><span class="underline">other nationally and racially oppressed people experience conditions inferior to that of whites. </span>Racist violence and the poison of racist ideas victimize all people of color no matter which <span class="underline">economic </span>class they belong to<span class="underline">. The attempts to suppress and undercount the vote of the African American and other racially oppressed people are part of racism in the electoral process. Racism permeates the police, judicial and prison systems, perpetuating unequal sentencing, racial profiling, discriminatory enforcement, and police brutality. The democratic, civil and human rights of all working people are continually under attack</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.These attacks range from increasingly difficult procedures for union recognition and attempts to prevent full union participation in elections, to the absence of the right to strike for many public workers. They range from undercounting minority communities in the census to making it difficult for working people to run for office because of the domination of corporate campaign funding and the high cost of advertising.</span><span class="underline">These attacks also include growing censorship and domination of the media by the ultra-right; growing restrictions and surveillance of activist social movements and the Left; open denial of basic rights to immigrants; and, violations of the Geneva Conventions up to and including torture for prisoners. </span>These abuses all serve to maintain the grip of the capitalists on government power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. They use this power to ensure the economic and political dominance of their class. </span><span class="underline">Women still face a considerable differential in wages for work of equal or comparable value. They also confront barriers to promotion, physical and sexual abuse, continuing unequal workload in home and family life, and male supremacist ideology</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> perpetuating unequal and often unsafe conditions. </span><span class="underline">The constant attacks on social welfare programs severely impact single women, single mothers, nationally and racially oppressed women, and all working class women. The reproductive rights of all women are continually under attack ideologically and politically. Violence against women in the home and in society at large remains a shameful fact of life in the U.S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

The existential risk of environmental destruction and nuclear war from the capitalist drive to infinitely exploit resources is an independent reason to vote affirmative, as extinction from nuclear war and environmental destruction are the end of all human aspiration; existence is a prerequisite to making ethical calculations or evaluating deontological standards.<br />

And, at the epistemological level, the negative’s knowledge is not value-neutral; its production is contingent on a specific separation of labor that privileges a small scientific and military elite, and its employment actively sustains capital, their knowledge should be held as suspect<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dickens and Ormrod 7 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It should be noted that, contrary to Lerner’s (1991) argument, Alfred SohnRethel (1975) and Frankel (2003) have argued that </span>this more scientific mode of relating to the universe merely intensified rather than alleviated the alienation of the masses<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from the universe. Sohn-Rethel’s argument is that </span><span class="underline">‘abstract’, one might say ‘objective’, knowledge first arose as part of the exchange relationship in what he calls ‘societies of appropriation’ or </span>capitalist societies<span class="underline"> based on a high division of labour</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The person producing a commodity is, as Marx described, alienated from the exchange process, in which s/he comes to see his/her product in terms of an abstract exchange value, which operates independently of the needs and uses which the seller or buyer has in mind. </span><span class="underline">This purely abstract system of </span>thought represented in the form of money<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (‘a crude approximation of the underlying principle’) </span>leads to abstract, scientific, thought<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Postone (1996) has argued similarly that ‘abstraction’ in general is central to capitalist societies. The development of capital in two distinct epochs has led to corresponding developments in epistemology, according to Sohn-Rethel. First, the introduction of coinage in Ancient Greece led to Greek philosophy and mathematics. Second, the development of modern capitalism led to the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century scientific revolutions. He goes on to argue, and this forms a major focus of his and Lerner’s thesis, that </span>the abstract form of scientific knowledge was instrumental in legitimizing the division of mental and manual labour in modern capitalism<span class="underline">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The argument is that </span><span class="underline">the existence of this abstract system </span>justifies the existence of an elite of scientists capable of studying the system<span class="underline"> untainted by the practical knowledge of the worker</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Davidson (1985) is also extremely critical of the development of objective scientific approaches to the universe that distance knowledge from people’s everyday experience of the universe. The latter, Davidson argues, remains Earth-centred (as in Tycho Brahe’s model). The result of de-centring Earth through science, for Davidson, is the creation of ‘a cold mechanical world’ (ibid.: 4). There are important differences between Sohn-Rethel’s account and Lerner’s. For Lerner, Galileo, like the empiricists Copernicus and Brahe before him, represents a break from the truly abstract philosophy of Plato. It is a break alleviating a lot of the problems of the division of labour by relying on artisan and serf knowledge available to all. However, Sohn-Rethel sees Galileo as representing a distinct break from his predecessors in instituting a new form of abstracted knowledge that severely heightens the mental/manual division of labour. He points to parallels between Galileo’s law of inertial motion and the abstraction of the commodity exchange. Lerner does not draw out a full criticism of the relationship between capital and cosmology that replaced it. Contrary to what Lerner implies during most of the book, </span><span class="underline">colonial capitalism based</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> initially </span><span class="underline">on</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> practical knowledge of navigation (</span><span class="underline">now satellites, and possibly future capitalist exploitation of space resources) has not been an age of equality or celebration of the knowledge of the manual worker. </span>This epoch has had its own cosmic elite of not only scientists but also engineers, and the military and the governments and corporations that control them. The scientific cosmological elite of today is still maintained by others’ labour<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> They are given ‘the freedom to abandon the constraints of the “ordinary” world’ (Ferguson 1990: 1).</span><br />

<strong>Questioning of capitalist tendencies is a prerequisite to ethical determinations; it negates one’s value to life as producers and capitalists are both turned into machines in a constant race for production, and materials become measurements of humanity.

<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Thus </span><span class="underline">the </span>powerlessness of the consumer vis-à-vis the production process is experienced as the active tyranny of the finished object<span class="underline"> — as an object-sized moral law. </span>Morality is now restricted to the single<span class="underline"> and immediate </span>dimension of “is<span class="underline">,” no longer transcended by means of its negation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, “ought” ( Marcuse, 1991); while reason similarly limits itself to the set of available options. “If people very strongly desire what they cannot get, they will be unhappy; such desires, therefore, are irrational,” says Jon Elster (1986: 15). </span><span class="underline">In the age of consumer capitalism, then, </span>morality and reason submit to a reality principle that no longer defers pleasure and accepts pain for<span class="underline"> the sake of </span>future achievements, but asserts<span class="underline"> the </span>pleasure and pain of the<span class="underline"> actually </span>experienced world<span class="underline">.

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tumino 1</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">– *Professor of English at Pittsburgh (Stephen, “What is Orthodox Marxism and Why it Matters Now More than Ever”, Red Critique, p. online)</span></strong><br />
<strong>Any effective political theory will have to<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">do at least two things: it will have to</span>offer an integrated understanding of social practices and<span class="underline">, based on such </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">an interrelated knowledge</span><span class="underline">, </span>offer a guideline for praxis<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;" class="reduce2">My main argument here is that among all contesting social theories now, only Orthodox Marxism has been able to produce an integrated knowledge of the existing social totality and provide lines of praxis that will lead to building a society free from necessity. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">But first I must clarify what I mean by Orthodox Marxism. Like all other modes and forms of political theory, the very theoretical identity of Orthodox Marxism is itself contested—not just from non-and anti-Marxists who question the very &quot;real&quot; (by which they mean the &quot;practical&quot; as under free-market criteria) existence of any kind of Marxism now but, perhaps more tellingly, from within the Marxist tradition itself. I will, therefore, first say what I regard to be the distinguishing marks of Orthodox Marxism and then outline a short polemical map of contestation over Orthodox Marxism within the Marxist theories now. I will end by arguing for its effectivity in bringing about a new society based not on human rights but on freedom from necessity. I will argue that </span>to know contemporary society—and to be able to act on such knowledge—one has to first of all know what makes the existing social totality<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;" class="reduce2">I will argue that the dominant social totality is based on inequality—not just inequality of power but inequality of economic access (which then determines access to health care, education, housing, diet, transportation, . . . ).</span><span class="underline">This systematic inequality cannot be explained by gender, race, sexuality, disability, ethnicity, or nationality. These are all secondary contradictions </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">and are all determined by the fundamental contradiction of capitalism which is inscribed in the relation of capital and labor. All</span>modes<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;" class="reduce2">of Marxism</span>now explain social inequalities primarily on the basis of these secondary contradictions and in doing so<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">—and this is my main argument—</span>legitimate capitalism<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Why? </span><span class="underline">Because such arguments authorize capitalism without gender, race, discrimination and thus accept economic inequality as an integral part of human societies. They accept a sunny capitalism—a capitalism beyond capitalism. Such a society, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">based on cultural equality but economic inequality,</span><span class="underline"> has always been the not-so-hidden agenda of the bourgeois left</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">—whether it has been called &quot;new left,&quot; &quot;postmarxism,&quot; or &quot;radical democracy.&quot; This is, by the way, the main reason for its popularity in the culture industry—from the academy (Jameson, Harvey, Haraway, Butler,. . . ) to daily politics (Michael Harrington, Ralph Nader, Jesse Jackson,. . . ) to. . . . For all, capitalism is here to stay and the best that can be done is to make its cruelties more tolerable, more humane. This humanization (not eradication) of capitalism is the sole goal of ALL contemporary lefts (marxism, feminism, anti-racism, queeries, . . . ).</span>Such an understanding<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">of social inequality</span>is based on the fundamental understanding that the source of wealth is human knowledge and not human labor.<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">That is, wealth is produced by the human mind and is thus free from the actual objective conditions that shape the historical relations of labor and capital. Only Orthodox Marxism recognizes the historicity of labor and its primacy as the source of all human wealth. In this paper I argue that any emancipatory theory has to be founded on recognition of the priority of Marx's labor theory of value and not repeat the technological determinism of corporate theory (&quot;knowledge work&quot;) that masquerades as social theory.</span></strong><br />

 Debate value and criterion talk is bankrupt; we engage in a normative discourse relating to the resolution, as if anything we talk about will somehow escape the round and create a global ethical good. Using elegant discourse to talk about values and standards doesn’t provide us any uniquely good education and none of the offense you can garner off of this debate is real or practical; the representation of standards and abstract talk about philosophies as something to be promoted through a speech act is vacuous and makes us an audience to those making the decisions, incapable of changing anything<br />

The normative method attempts to compress a vast philosophical theory into a neat little box with a value and a criterion and tell you how it can make the world a better place, even though none of us are in positions to make these vast, meta-ethical changes concerning how various people from different cultures are obligated towards each other. They go to every debate round at every tournament and make the same arguments just because that’s how they’re told to do it.<br />

If there’s no one in charge at the other end of the line, why then is normative legal thought in such a hurry to get its message across? And why, particularly, is it always in such a hurry to repeat the same old boring moves? There is an edge to these questions. And the edge comes in part from our implicit assumption that normative legal thought is a kind of that and that, as thought, it is in control of its own situation, its form, its own rhetoric. But it isn’t so. </span><span class="underline">If normative legal thought keeps repeating itself</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline">and</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if it </span><span class="underline">is incapable of understanding challenges to its own</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> intellectual </span><span class="underline">authority</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline">that is because </span>it is not<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> simply or even fundamentally </span>a kind of thought<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Normative legal thought is<span style="font-size: 8pt;">in part </span>a routine<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – our routine. It is the </span><span class="underline">highly </span>repetitive, cognitively entrenched, institutionally sanctioned, and politically enforced<span class="underline"> routine of the legal academy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – a routine </span><span class="underline">that</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> silently </span>produces our thoughts and keeps our work channeled within the same old cognitive and rhetorical matrices<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Like most routines, </span><span class="underline">it has been so well internalized that </span>we repeat it automatically, without thinking<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And like most routines, it remains unseen and unobserved – which is why it is so powerful. It is an aspect – a significant aspect – of the unnoticed and untroubled overarching epistemic economy within which (virtually) all contemporary legal thought is produced. In terms somewhat misleading but more familiar to legal thinkers, normative legal thought is the latest incarceration of the Langdellian legacy, the latest variation on formalism – normative formalism.</span><br />

We confront a starving beggar and immediately translate the concrete duty we feel into a normative (i.e., abstract) question.

Thus, I affirm; individuals have a moral obligation to assist people in need.<br />
The individuals that have a moral obligation to assist are you, the judges, who have an obligation to vote affirmative and make debate an activity that is actually relevant to our interactions with our community and society for us, the debaters, the people.<br />
To assist is <u>to give support or aid to</u><br />
Dictionary.com, 11<br />
<br />
<br />
A need is an <u>urgent want, as of something requisite</u><br />
Debaters are in need of a new normative structure of debate as a requisite to providing actual useful education; instead of all this abstract value talk that has absolutely no meaning in our lives we could debate about how the resolution affects our community, how it affects our lives personally, how we can question the resolution in such a way that specifically educates us on how to engage with other people. How we as subjects are positioned in debate is a prerequisite to interpreting and understanding the resolution or its implications – how we know and view the world is influenced by construction of social reality through discourses of knowledge. That is a reason why the actual speech acts of both teams and how they influence the community around us are the only things that matter, analysis of specific discourse is a prerequisite to gaining offense. View affirming the topic as an alternative of liberation from the humdrum of the status quo; education is an important impact because the reason we do debate is to learn more about different issues and how we ought to engage them. All we really have after the round is over is the education we’ve gained from the positions and argumentation. The affirmative burden is to prove that the discursive alternative is preferable to the status quo or the negative’s competitive option. The reciprocal negative burden is to prove that the status quo or negating the resolution is preferable to enactment of the alternative. If you are going to vote for them they must give you a concrete and methodological reason to vote for their specific speech act.<br />
<br />
<br />
Normative debate has taught them in a way to use generalized values like justice and morality to win debate rounds as opposed to understanding what it really means to have morality; the idea of morality becomes twisted and skewed to a point where we don’t know what it is anymore and it can no longer be properly defended or promoted in a way that ensures the greater good or education.<br />

For example, consider </span>the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> normative </span>word “freedom<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” This particular word </span>has a certain <span class="underline">exchange </span>value in our rhetoric<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and in our discourse. It is well known, for instance, that at present, “freedom” of […] enjoys a certain rhetorical advantage over “security of […]. That is to say, at present, “freedom” is rhetorically superior to “security.” </span>As legal thinkers<span class="underline"> come to </span>recognize this<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> point, </span>they<span class="underline"> try</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of course, </span><span class="underline">to </span>associate “freedom” with their favorite values<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, leaving “security” as the word for competing or interfering values. Thus the exchange value of the “freedom” word rises in the rhetorical economy of legal thought. However, the rise in the exchange value of such normative words typically yields an inflationary spiral. </span>Sooner or later everybody is using the “freedom” word<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For a while, the political charm of the “freedom” word can survive accelerated circulation. The word remains important. It remains important because it remains performatively effective. </span>It is perceived as a tool<span class="underline">, a rhetorical lever</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>But precisely because<span class="underline"> the “</span>freedom<span class="underline">” word </span>remains performatively effective, it is immediately pressed further into<span style="font-size: 8pt;">all sorts of </span>instrumentalist enterprises<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, thereby </span>further diffusing its<span style="font-size: 8pt;">constative </span>significance<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>After a while<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the “</span>freedom<span style="font-size: 8pt;">” word </span>doesn’t mean<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> much of </span>anything<span class="underline">. It isn’t even a reliable rhetorical tool</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to get people to act, or to be or to say various things. On the contrary, </span>everybody knows the trick: Freedom’s just another word for getting you to do something you don’t want to do<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Now this linguistic metamorphosis is hardly limited to the “freedom” word. Rather, the </span><span class="underline">linguistic devaluation affects the entire normative currency</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In fact, it affects the entire grammar of normative legal thought. Hence, </span><span class="underline">entire structures, </span>entire complexes of normative legal thought become increasingly vacuous<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – </span>their purchase on the world<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, descriptive and regulatory, </span><span class="underline">less and </span>less credible<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even the performative value of these structures and complexes becomes weakened as legal thinkers come to recognize that their constative significance has been devalued. As the normative currency is devalued, </span>the relation between normative structures and complexes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on the one hand, </span>and the practices to which they<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ostensibly </span>correspond<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on the other, </span>becomes weakened<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, attenuated. </span>No longer is it possible to maintain<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a naïve </span>idealism<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or materialism </span>where normative conceptions such as “justice<span class="underline">,” “liberty,” “consent,” or “community,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” either determine or </span>are determined by the practices to which they<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ostensibly </span>correspond<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The language of determination, and even its softer, more nuanced dialects, no longer provide an adequate understanding of the situation of normative legal thought. Here, the point is not that normative legal thought has now become indeterminate, as opposed to some previous or possible state of determinacy. Rather, the point is that determination is no longer the appropriate frame of reference for charting the relation between normative legal thought and the practices it ostensibly addresses.</span><br />

Rethinking the way normativity controls us breaks it down and brings realization that it is bankrupt; Affirmation can result in questioning of why we choose to engage this type of ethical consideration and normative debate in the first place to bring about styles of debate and arguments that are more relevant to every-day decision-making and real-world circumstances as opposed to generalized philosophies.<br />

Having to debate vague concepts of morality and autonomy violates the autonomy of us, the debaters, by telling us to read pre-scripted blocks and speak in a pompous manner that doesn’t actually mean anything just because other people have done it like that; it restricts our ability to talk about things that are more important and more meaningful to us; we become intellectual does staring into the headlights<br />

What if being disturbed by ‘being at home with oneself’ turns into being disturbed by the stranger? The incident that once seduced many Californians with an image of home safe from the stranger presents an example. California’s Proposition 187 was an initiative passed by 59 percent of California’s voters in November 1994, </span>declaring<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the state’s</span>undocumented immigrant population ineligible for basic social services such as health care<span style="font-size: 8pt;">and education.

We have to act and ACT NOW! On our ballot, Proposition 187 will be the first giant stride in ultimately ending the ILLEGAL ALIEN invasion. (cited in Hinojosa and Schey, 1995: 18)</span>The result was upsetting: abuses against<span class="underline"> not only undocumented persons, but against </span>the Latino population in general<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, many of them United States citizens and legal residents.</span><span class="Emphasis2">‘</span>Hate [was] unleashed<span class="Emphasis2">.’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Some responsible </span><span class="underline">‘residents’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">of California </span><span class="underline">even felt free to demand green cards from people that they suspected to be ‘illegal aliens’ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(CHIRLA, 1995). </span><span class="underline">Their home state, after all, was under attack. </span>The effect<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of Proposition 187 </span>has been<span class="underline">: . . . </span>to recriminalize the alien population and to heighten the costs of alien visibility<span class="underline">. . . .

(Honig, 1998: 5) California’s Proposition 187 was an attempt to build ‘safe homes’ for Californians, not for all of them of course.</span>The political abuse of the image of home as a sheltered and safe place drew upon an ‘exclusionary, territorializing, xenophobic, premodern and patriarchal cult of home’<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Antonopoulos, 1994: 57).</span><span class="underline">It was </span>an elaborate fixing of boundaries<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, making California a safe home for its ‘legal’ residents based on the exclusionary politics of home.</span>Boundaries<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, evidently,</span>not only evoke the idea of hospitality, but of hostility and racism<span class="underline"> as well</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.12 It is important to remember, however, that it is not only the situation of the guest but also the host that needs to be reconsidered since, in the case of immigration, for example, it is ‘<em>both</em> receiving populations and immigrants [that] . . . risk mutual transformation, [that] . . . engage and attenuate their home-yearning for each other’s sakes and for the sake of their political life together’ (Honig, 1999: 203). </span><span class="underline">The point, therefore, is about openings</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, about ‘keeping open the question of who “the people” (the demos) is’, since the question of democracy ‘always arises at the limit of the demos . . . wherein native, subject, citizen, or people receives its designation as such from the way the human encounter with the stranger and the strange is assumed’ (Dillon, 1999: 120 and 96).</span><span class="underline">There is a need to reconsider the boundary, not only as a separator but as a connector as well, where hospitality comes into play pointing beyond the boundaries.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is a need, perhaps, to reflect on what the title words, in Greek, of this text suggest: <em>Pera</em> – <em>peras</em> – <em>poros</em>: the other side/beyond – limit – passage; ‘beyond the limits that interdict passage’ (Baptist, 1999: 102). There is a need, more importantly, if a cosmopolitan approach is to be assumed, to think about hospitality ‘that would be more than cosmopolitical, that would go beyond strictly cosmopolitical conditions’, that would go beyond the interests, authority, and legislation of the state (Derrida, 1999a: 43). To conclude, there is no way, I would argue, to escape the advent of the stranger, to avoid questions and questionings that tremble, if not stir, the socio-political order that once appeared, perhaps, as a safe home. Nor is there a way to avoid the production of others. What is more important, instead of reflecting on the ways by which no other would be produced, is to be able to resist processes that produce <em>and</em> reproduce others; processes that stabilize themselves, that close spaces, and that derive their sustainability from the very process of othering itself. Again, what is more important, rather than reflecting on the ways by which to avoid the ‘disturbance’ of the stranger, is to be able to provide for the social, cultural, institutional, ethical <em>and</em> political spaces where we could learn to engage with and learn from each other, while being able to constitute our subjectivities free from subordination, in democratic ways. The point, then, is to open spaces, spaces where recognition as well as contestation and conflict can take place. Furthermore,</span><span class="underline">the point is not merely to open spaces; more importantly, it is to keep them open. Hospitality is aimed at such a concern.</span><br />

It is this type of extension of welfare that stigmatizes the immigrant, perpetuating the belief that noncitizens are somehow inferior and undeserving of moral calculation; challenging this act of discrimination is vital to contest all other forms of xenophobia and persecution<br />

Further, we must embrace an ethic of unconditional hospitality in opposition to calculations and exclusionary moral guidelines – even if achieving true hospitality is impossible, the aspiration itself brings us closer to the “Other.” True justice must simultaneously stand outside and within the law. Thus brings us to the question of the role of the ballot:<br />
<br />
The role of the ballot is ideal formation – a promise of justice to come. This idea is a prerequisite to fulfillment or even a conceptual understanding of their standard, a possibility of true justice that rejects their discursive misrepresentation. Their explanation of justice as something to be achieved through a tangible resolution reduces the idea of justice to its most simple and electronic form. The ethical demand stems from the promise of the alternative, not endorsement of the resolution. Further, their gift of rights and thus morality to the “citizen” exemplifies the way their standard creates arbitrary lines in the sand between what is a human deserving of morality and what is not; that turns their offense.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The concept of </span>unconditional hospitality is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> located in the now sizeable body of Derrida’s writings on justice and ethics and is </span>inextricably intertwined with<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> his ideas on numerous other ‘undecidable quasi-concepts’ such as </span>democracy, forgiveness<span class="underline">, friendship and cosmopolitanism.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23 Derrida explicitly addressed issues of justice and ethics, beginning with The Other Heading, but they have arguably always been present in his project of deconstruction, hence the statement, ‘deconstruction is justice’. The concept of hospitality figures prominently in these discussions as illustrated in his claim that ‘ethics is hospitality’.24 </span>Derrida finds an implosion or self-deconstruction at work in the very core of the concept of hospitality, the same aporia he discovers in the concept of justice<span style="font-size: 8pt;">which he articulated in his now classic essay, ‘Force of Law’.25 In this much-discussed essay, he examined the relationship between law and justice arguing that </span>justice requires an experience of the impossible, an experience of aporia<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> However, </span><span class="underline">‘experience’ is itself contradictory because experience</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is ‘something that </span><span class="underline">traverses and travels toward a destination for which it finds the appropriate passage. </span>The experience finds it way, its passage, it is possible<span class="underline">.’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26 But, </span><span class="underline">aporia does not allow passage. It is a non-road.Still, </span>there is no justice without this experience of aporia, however impossible such an experience may be<span class="underline">. ‘</span>A will, a desire, a demand for justice whose structure wouldn’t be an experience of aporia would have no chance to be what it is,<span class="underline"> namely a call for justice.’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27 Such an experience may be law, but law is not justice. ‘</span>Law is the element of calculation, and it is just that there be law, but justice is incalculable<span class="underline">.’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28 </span><span class="underline">In contrast to law, </span>justice requires absolute risk, not certainty. One must avoid good conscience as subjective certainty because it ‘is incompatible with the absolute risk that every<span class="underline"> promise, every engagement, and every responsible </span>decision<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – if there are such – </span>must run’<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.29 To buttress a promise, an engagement, a decision by the certainty of being right, of being on the side of reason, the side of conscience, the side of science, the side of truth is to transform the experience into a deployment of a programme or the application of a rule.</span><span class="underline">These things might seem to offer protection, a guarantee that responsibility has been carried out and Derrida does not suggest we completely abandon them. Such </span>certainties<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nevertheless</span>remain heterogeneous to the experience of the aporia inherent in responsibility’s call<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30 So, </span><span class="underline">the </span>fulfilment of responsibility<span class="underline">, whether to justice, democracy, or hospitality, </span>must always take the form of a promise<span class="underline">, a promise that is always ‘to come’. Justice, hospitality, democracy are all experiences ‘of the impossible’, though this does not mean they cannot occur.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31 </span><span class="underline">We</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> do, in fact, </span><span class="underline">sometimes experience justice, hospitality, and democracy, but such experiences ar</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">e of the </span><span class="underline">impossible because the concepts themselves with which we name the experiences are imbued with undecidability.</span>We construct these concepts in the attempt to capture, to translate what cannot be translated and the risk is ever present of reducing the experience to the language-dependent concept<span class="underline"> and/or to a mechanized technique or programme. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The insistence on undecidability is to guard against such a reduction. Given this, one could never come up with a body of specific laws or rules pertaining to such concepts. One could never list with any certitude the conditions under which experiences of these things might happen.</span><span class="underline">One could never define with any exactitude a set of objective social scientific indicators that would attest to the presence of these impossible experiences, which might nevertheless happen. </span>Justice, hospitality can only be poetic in the sense that they<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, like so many other experiences,</span>are untranslatable through language<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">They push against the limits of language and perhaps of comprehension itself.</span><span class="underline">Like a poem, we must allow these things to ‘come close to a silence around which discourse is ordered and that a poem sometimes discovers, but always pulls itself back from unveiling in the very movement of speech or writing’.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32 </span><span class="underline">One cannot speak of experiences of aporia without raising the issue of borders, the border as limit and threshold and the inherent undecidability of all borders. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Derrida has spoken of, written about, and called attention to the deconstructive logic at work on the many borders in our world, including, and perhaps most importantly, the concept of a border itself. His work carries particular relevance, as he has suggested on numerous occasions, for ‘the places where questions of juridical, ethical, or political responsibility also concern geographical, national, ethnic, or linguistic borders’.33</span><span class="underline">In such places one encounters a call for and the possibility/impossibility of hospitality. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Southwestern desert is just such a place where a demand, a plea for hospitality rises in the silence and reverberates across vast and seemingly empty spaces of a borderland both uncrossable and too porous, permeable and indeterminate.34 And it is here that the poles of conditional and unconditional hospitality perpetually haunt one another. In Of Hospitality and ‘Hostipitality’, </span><span class="underline">Derrida speaks</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> specifically </span><span class="underline">to</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the issue of </span><span class="underline">hospitality.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">35 </span><span class="underline">He points to the troubled and troubling Latin origin of the word, hospitalitat, ‘which allows itself to be parasitized by his opposite, “hostility,” the undesirable guest’.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">36 The question of conditionality presents itself in the very concept of hospitality and leads him to ask, </span><span class="underline">‘Do we know what hospitality is?’ and ‘will we ever know?’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">37 </span><span class="underline">This enigma suggests two manifestations of hospitality: (1) conditional or hospitality of the invitation; and (2) unconditional or hospitality of the visitation. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We should not think of these two manifestations as oppositional. Rather,</span><span class="underline">each is haunted by the other.Conditional hospitality, hospitality of the invitation, welcomes the other to the extent that he/she learns and speaks the language, adjusts to the order of the house, respects the orderer, in more common terms, assimilates.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The notion of</span>conditional hospitality<span style="font-size: 8pt;">is clearly inspired by the limitations of Kantian cosmopolitanism which, while asserting a right to universal hospitality, places</span>limits upon what it can mean by fixing it within a moral and physical geography defined by a world of sovereign, territorial states<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">38 In contrast, </span>in a situation of unconditional hospitality the visitor is not an invited guest, nor expected. The visitor arrives unexpectedly, uninvited and the pure host should open<span class="underline"> his/</span>her house without asking<span class="underline">, ‘Who are you?’, ‘What are you coming for?’, ‘Do you have a passport, a visa?’ </span>This hospitality of visitation requires unconditional acceptance<span class="underline"> of whomever turns up ‘before any determination, before any anticipation, before any identification, whether or not it has to do with a foreigner, an immigrant, an uninvited guest, or an unexpected visitor, whether or not the new arrival is the citizen of another country, a human, an animal, or divine creature, a living or dead thing, male or female’.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">39 Like justice, </span><span class="underline">unconditional hospitality is impossible</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as a rule. </span><span class="underline">Still it may happen. [S]ometimes, exceptionally, it may happen. I cannot regulate, control or determine these moments, but it may happen, just as an act of forgiveness, some forgiveness may happen, pure forgiveness may happen</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. … </span><span class="underline">Unconditional hospitality can’t be an establishment, but it may happen as a miracle ... in an instant, not lasting more than an instant, it may happen. This is the ... possible happening of something impossible which makes us think what hospitality or forgiveness, or gift might be.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">40</span><br />

Justice and morality are not concepts that can be discursively defined by language; in their pure and truest form they are simply ideals, likely impossible yet necessary to be strived for, and that is the affirmative’s fatal flaw. They must be unconditionally accepted through an hospitality towards the other in clear recognition that we may never reach the goal yet will run towards it in acceptance of the risks it may garner.<br />

The speech act of both sides is the only lens through which you should evaluate the impacts of the round. While I realize that every nation around globe will not suddenly swing open its doors to the alien, our speeches must embody the idea of a pure hospitality.<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Derrida writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Now, to come back to one of your most difficult questions: </span><span class="underline">what room is left for a politics of hospitality in that case, for perfectibility? If I want to improve the laws</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- and this is a very concrete problem for everyone in the world today, and especially in Europe and in France -- </span><span class="underline">how can we improve the situation?</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For instance, France has been recently, and for decades, betraying laws on political asylum, practicing a politics of immigration which is untrue to its own principle and so on and so forth. So </span><span class="underline">we have to change the law, improve the law, and </span>there is an infinite progress to be performed<span class="underline">, to be achieved in that respect</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I love the process of perfectibility, because it is marked by the context of the eighteenth century, the Aufklärung. It is often the case that people would like to oppose this period of deconstruction to the Enlightenment. No, I am for the Enlightenment, I'm for progress, I'm a 'progressist'</span><u>.<span class="underline"> I think </span>the law is perfectible and we can improve the law. We have to improve the conditions of conditional hospitality, we can change<span class="underline">, we should change the laws on immigration, as far as possible, given a certain number of constraints. </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">For instance, in France -- let me take this example to be less speculative and theoretical --</span><span class="underline">some people, including me, have signed a petition saying that, in certain conditions, we were ready to shelter in our houses people who were considered illegal immigrants</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in France. </span><span class="underline">We say, well, </span>we are going to violate the law, to practice civil disobedience because we find the way that the government today applies the law is outrageous<span class="underline">, but we are not</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> simply </span><span class="underline">doing this irresponsibly.The Minister of the Interior</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the time </span><span class="underline">said: these intellectuals are irresponsible, they are irresponsible because they want simply to open the gates and let everyone into the country, and then you will see what happens. No, we didn't say that. We were not advocating an unconditional hospitality. We said that </span>there is today a law<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for instance embodied in the Declaration of the Rights of Man, there is a law </span>which is higher than the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> French </span>legal system<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, than the way it is currently applied. And </span><span class="underline">it's in the name of this law, of this legality, that we oppose the current interpretation of the law by the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> French</span><span class="underline">government.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> So </span>it was not in the name of pure hospitality that we did so, but in the name of a perfectible law.<span class="underline"> We wanted the law to be changed and</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in fact, to some extent, </span><span class="underline">it has been changed. It has been changed, but not enough. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Of course we were not charged. I myself, for instance, could hide some such immigrants, and they couldn't sue me. The government had to change, to some extent -- not enough, but to some extent -- its policy, its practice. So in that case </span><span class="underline">we considered that the law was perfectible, that we had to improve the law, without claiming that the unconditional hospitality should become the official policy ofthe government. We are not dreamers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, from that point of view, </span>we know that today no government, no nation state, will simply open the borders, and in good faith we know that we don't do that ourselves<span class="underline">. We would not simply leave the house with no doors, no keys and so on and so forth. We protect ourselves, OK? Who could deny this in good faith? </span>But we have the desire for this perfectibility, and this desire is regulated by the infinite pole of pure hospitality<span class="underline">. If we have a concept of conditional hospitality, it's because we have also the idea of a pure hospitality, of unconditional hospitality. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The same goes for forgiveness. This resembles but is not identical with Kant's notion of a regulative idea: that is, there is an endless inadequation between the conditional and the unconditional, and there is this regulative idea ... an inaccessible law. In fact, </span><span class="underline">it's here and now that we have to try to think and to embody what unconditional hospitality should be. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is this intention and if we cannot conform to this injunction, and we cannot, obviously we cannot, its impossible, it's impossible as a rule.... Let me try and make this more specific. </span><span class="underline">It's impossible as a rule</span><u>,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I cannot regularly organise unconditional hospitality, and that's why, as a rule, I have a bad conscience, </span><span class="underline">I cannot have a good conscience because I know that I lock my door, and that a number of people who would like to share my house, my apartment, my nation, my money, my land and so on and so forth. I say not as a rule, but sometimes, exceptionally, it may happen. I cannot regulate, control or determine these moments, but it may happen, just as an act of forgiveness, some forgiveness may happen, pure forgiveness may happen.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I cannot make a determinate, a determining judgement and say: 'this is pure forgiveness', or 'this is pure hospitality', as an act of knowledge, there is no adequate act of determining judgement. That's why </span>the realm of action, of practical reason, is absolutely heterogenous to theory and theoretical judgements here, but it may happen without even my knowing it<span class="underline">, my being conscious of it, or my having rules for its establishment. Unconditional hospitality can't be an establishment, but it may happen as a miracle </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">... in an instant, not lasting more than an instant, it may happen. </span>This is the ... possible happening of something impossible which makes us think what hospitality, or forgiveness, or gift might be<span class="underline">.</span><br />

The affirmative uses a flawed methodology that negates any risk of solvency. Political solutions are not capable of ending widespread nationalist and ethnic violence, much less the smaller ethical and structural impacts of the AC. The only chance of solvency is through embracing an ethic of hospitality that transcends politics<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Carroll writes:</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(David, Professor of French @ UC--Irvine, MLN 122.4 (2007) 904-924, muse)</span><br />
One does not have to be a cynic to wonder if in a world plagued with nationalist, ethnic, and religious wars and other<span class="underline"> forms of </span>violence <span class="underline">in which civilians are sacrificed daily in the name of ethnic</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">or religious</span><span class="underline">ideals or fictions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on the one hand,</span>or the crass political struggle for power and domination<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on the other,</span>whether any form of politics is up to the task of dealing<span class="underline"> effectively </span>with such conflicts and bringing peace to the affected peoples and regions<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Something else,</span>something more fundamental than politics would seem<span class="underline"> to be </span>needed for politics to be effective, for justice for the conflicting groups to be possible<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;Politics after!&quot; is the title of an essay included in Emmanuel Levinas's <em>Beyond the Verse</em> [<em>L'Au-delà du verset</em>] to which Derrida refers in <em>Adieu to Emmanuel Levinas</em> in order to evoke the possibility of a concept of peace that, in Levinas's terms, &quot;goes beyond purely political thought.&quot;</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/mln/v122/122.4carroll.html#FOOT14" rel="nofollow">14</a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Levinas essay, however, could also have been entitled &quot;Hospitality First!&quot; since</span>it is in terms of hospitality that the priority of politics is challenged<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Not in terms of conventional hospitality but what Derrida characterizes as </span>an absolute form of hospitality that is independent of and exists prior to any politics<span class="underline">. Hospitality in the conventional sense implies that we accept that the host</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">is &quot;<em>chez lui</em>,&quot; that he</span><span class="underline">has the right to inhabit his home and thus to open up his home and offer hospitality to others, to those who by being welcomed and received into his home become his guests. And for the same reasons, that he has the right to protect his home and refuse hospitality to those he does not wish to welcome into it. The host knows his home is really his because he has a deed</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a lease, a document of some sort that attributes to him the right to occupy the home he occupies; </span><span class="underline">in the same way he knows his country is his because he was born in it or immigrated legally into it and now has a passport, a green card, an identity card, or a visa to prove his legitimacy, some document that gives him the right to live in the land in which he lives as a citizen or legal resident. </span>To question the original<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, &quot;natural&quot; </span>right of the master of the house<span style="font-size: 8pt;">or of the legal inhabitant of his or her country </span>is not to oppose the right or laws of hospitality in general but rather to propose a more radical notion of hospitality that is not governed by any written laws<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For if the &quot;master of the house&quot; cannot claim to possess originally or naturally what he possesses <em>only</em> legally and politically, then hospitality not only becomes more problematic and contradictory, but also potentially more open and generous, more absolute or unconditional.</span>In the process, the distinction between host and guest<span class="underline"> also </span>breaks down<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Or as Derrida puts it in his analysis of Levinas's &quot;ethics of hospitality,&quot; &quot;if the at home with oneself [<em>chez-soi</em>] of the dwelling is an 'at home with oneself as in a land of asylum or refuge,' this would mean that the inhabitant dwells there as a refugee or an exile, a guest [<em>hôte</em>] and not a proprietor.&quot;</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/mln/v122/122.4carroll.html#FOOT15" rel="nofollow">15</a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For Levinas,</span><span class="underline">the radical notion of hospitality that implies an original loss of sovereignty over the land one inhabits</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the home one &quot;owns&quot; and occupies, has both a biblical and Kantian source; I would argue that for Derrida it could also be considered to have an Algerian source and be part of his experience of injustice and thus an important part of what remains of Algeria in his texts. If &quot;hospitality precedes property&quot; (<em>Adieu</em>, 45 [85]), then in terms of what Derrida calls &quot;this implacable law of hospitality&quot; the relation of host and guest is not stable but consists of a series of reversals of the two French meanings of the word <em>hôte</em>: The <em>hôte</em> who receives (the host), the one who welcomes the invited or received <em>hôte</em> (the guest), the welcoming <em>hôte</em> who considers himself owner of the place is in truth a <em>hôte</em> received in his own home. He receives the hospitality that he offers <em>in</em> his own home; he receives it <em>from</em> his own home—which, in the end, does not belong to him. The <em>hôte</em> as host is a guest [. . .]. The one who welcomes is first welcomed in his own home [<em>chez lui</em>]. The one who invites is invited by the one whom he invites. The one who receives is received [<em>L'invitant est invité par son invité. Celui qui reçoit est reçu</em>]. (41–42 [79]) </span>What is original, what makes hospitality in its most radical, implacable sense<span class="underline">, therefore, possible </span>is not possession but a &quot;radical dispossession<span class="underline">.&quot; In this sense no one is really ever originally or completely master of his/her house or truly at home in his/her home(land).</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The law of hospitality is rooted in this original displacement or deferment of the &quot;natural right&quot; to possess and along with it the right to sovereignty—over either oneself or others. But what exactly are the political implications of asserting that there is or should be &quot;an excess of the ethical over the political,&quot; or in Levinas's words, that</span>there exists an &quot;ethicsbeyondthe political&quot;<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(<em>Adieu</em>, 61 [113], Derrida's emphasis)?</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/mln/v122/122.4carroll.html#FOOT16" rel="nofollow">16</a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In Derrida's terms, </span>the excess or priority of the ethical in no way necessitates a retreat from politics<span class="underline"> or a refusal to become politically involved</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, although there is always a risk it will be interpreted this way. Derrida characterizes the priority Levinas gives to the ethical over the political rather as &quot;a provocation [. . .] at a moment of the history of humanity and of the Nation-State</span>when the persecution of all these hostages<span class="underline">—the foreigner, the immigrant</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(with or without papers),</span><span class="underline">the exile, the refugee, those without a country or a State, the displaced person or population</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [. . .]—</span>seems<span class="underline">, on every continent, to be </span>exposed to an unprecedented cruelty<span class="underline">&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(<em>Adieu</em>, 64, trans. modified [117–18]). In general,</span>the function of the ethical is to provoke the political, to refuse to accept the unacceptable cruelty inflicted on others in the interests of the State<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, national security, religion, ethnicity, or anything else.</span><span class="underline">What is unacceptable in terms of an ethics of hospitality are &quot;the crimes against hospitality endured by the guests</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [<em>hôtes</em>] </span><span class="underline">and hostages of our time, incarcerated or expelled day after day, from concentration to detention camp, from border to border, close to us or far away from us&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(71, trans. modified [132]).</span><span class="underline">The politics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">implied by Derrida's reflections on Levinasian hospitality are</span><span class="underline">rooted in the respect for the unnamed</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, undocumented </span><span class="underline">and thus always potentially threatening other, </span>a politics whose ultimate horizon is unlimited or absolute hospitality<span class="underline">.</span><br />

It’s reverse causal; decline of international law causes global conflict<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shaw writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The new politics of international relations require us, therefore, to go beyond the anti-imperialism of the intellectual left as well as of the semi-anarchist traditions of the academic discipline. We </span><span class="underline">need to recognise three fundamental truths.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> First, in the twenty-first century people </span><span class="underline">struggling for democratic liberties across the non-Western world are likely to make constant demands on our solidarity.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Courageous academics, students and other intellectuals will be in the forefront of these movements</span><u>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">They deserve the unstinting support of intellectuals in the West. Second, </span><span class="underline">the old international thinking in which democratic movements are seen as purely internal to states no longer carries conviction </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">– despite the lingering nostalgia for it on both the American right and the anti-American left. The idea that global principles can and should be enforced worldwide is firmly established in the minds of hundreds of millions of people. This consciousness will a powerful force in the coming decades. Third, </span>global state-formation is a fact. International institutions are being extended<span class="underline">, and (like it or not) they have a symbiotic relation with the major centre of state power, the increasingly internationalised Western conglomerate.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The success of the global-democratic revolutionary wave depends first on how well it is consolidated in each national context – but second, on how thoroughly it is embedded in international networks of power, at the centre of which, inescapably, is the West. From these political fundamentals, strategic propositions can be derived. First, </span><span class="underline">democratic movements cannot regard non-governmental organisations and civil society as ends in themselves. They must aim to civilise local states, rendering them open, accountable and pluralistic, and curtail the arbitrary and violent exercise of power. Second, democratising local states is not a separate task from integrating them into global and often Western-centred networks. </span>Reproducing isolated<span class="underline"> local </span>centres of power carries with it<span class="underline"> classic </span>dangers of<span class="underline"> states as centres of </span>war<span class="underline">.84 Embedding global norms and integrating new state centres with </span>global institutional frameworks are essential to<span class="underline"> the </span>control<span class="underline"> of </span>violence<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (To put this another way: the proliferation of purely national democracies is not a recipe for peace.) </span><span class="underline">Third, while the global revolution cannot do without the West and the UN, neither can it rely on them unconditionally</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We need these power networks, but we need to tame them too, to make their messy bureaucracies enormously more accountable and sensitive to the needs of society worldwide. This will involve the kind of ‘cosmopolitan democracy’ argued for by David Held85. It will also require us to advance a global <em>social</em>-democratic agenda, to address the literally catastrophic scale of world social inequalities. This is not a separate problem: </span><span class="underline">social and economic </span>reform is<span class="underline"> an </span>essential<span class="underline"> ingredient of </span>alternative<span class="underline">s </span>to<span class="underline"> warlike and </span>genocidal power<span class="underline">; these feed off and reinforce corrupt and criminal political economies. Fourth, if we need the global-Western state, if we want to democratise it and make its institutions friendlier to global peace and justice, we cannot be indifferent to its strategic debates. </span>It matters to develop international political interventions<span class="underline">, legal institutions and robust peacekeeping </span>as<span class="underline"> strategic </span>alternatives to bombingour way through<span class="underline"> zones of </span>crisis<span class="underline">. It matters that international intervention supports pluralist structures, rather than ratifying</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Bosnia-style </span><span class="underline">apartheid</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.86 As political intellectuals in the West, we need to have our eyes on the ball at our feet, but we also need to raise them to the horizon. We need to grasp the historic drama that is transforming worldwide relationships between people and state, as well as between state and state. </span>We need<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to think about how the turbulence of the global revolution can be consolidated in democratic, pluralist, </span>international networks of<span class="underline"> both social relations and state </span>authority<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We cannot be simply optimistic about this prospect. Sadly, </span><span class="underline">it will require repeated violent political crises to push Western and other governments towards the required restructuring of world institutions.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">87 What I have outlined is a huge challenge; but </span>the alternative is to see<span class="underline"> the global </span>revolution splutter into<span class="underline"> partial </span>defeat<span class="underline">, or </span>degenerate into<span class="underline"> new </span>genocidal wars<span class="underline"> - perhaps </span>even nuclear conflicts<span class="underline">. The practical challenge for all concerned citizens, and the theoretical and analytical challenges for students of international relations and politics, are intertwined</span><br />

Marine ecosystems are critical to the survival of all life on earth – independent reason to vote negative because there is no coming back from extinction – survival is a prerequisite to engaging ethical determinations<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Craig writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Biodiversity and ecosystem function arguments for conserving marine ecosystems also exist, just as they do for terrestrial ecosystems, but these arguments have thus far rarely been raised in political debates. For example, besides significant tourism values - the most economically valuable ecosystem service coral reefs provide, worldwide - coral reefs protect against storms and dampen other environmental fluctuations, services worth more than ten times the reefs' value for food production. n856 Waste treatment is another significant, non-extractive ecosystem function that intact coral reef ecosystems provide. n857 More generally, &quot;</span>ocean ecosystems <span class="underline">play a major role in the global geochemical cycling of all the elements that </span>represent the basic building blocks ofliving organisms<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur, as well as other less abundant but </span><span class="underline">necessary elements</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; n858 In a very real and direct sense, therefore, </span>human degradation of marine ecosystems impairs<span class="underline"> the </span>planet's ability to support life<span class="underline">. Maintaining biodiversity is often critical to maintaining the functions of marine ecosystems</span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Current evidence shows that, in general, </span><span class="underline">an ecosystem's ability to keep functioning in the face of disturbance is strongly dependent on its biodiversity, &quot;indicating that more diverse ecosystems are more stable</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; n859 Coral reef ecosystems are particularly dependent on their biodiversity. [*265] Most ecologists agree that the complexity of interactions and degree of interrelatedness among component species is higher on coral reefs than in any other marine environment. This implies that the ecosystem functioning that produces the most highly valued components is also complex and that many otherwise insignificant species have strong effects on sustaining the rest of the reef system. n860 </span><span class="underline">Thus, </span>maintaining and restoring <span class="underline">the </span>biodiversity of marine ecosystems is critical to <span class="underline">maintaining and </span>restoring <span class="underline">the ecosystem </span>services that they provide<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Non-use biodiversity values for marine ecosystems have been calculated in the wake of marine disasters, like the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. n861 Similar calculations could derive preservation values for marine wilderness. However, economic value, or economic value equivalents, should not be &quot;the sole or even primary justification for conservation of ocean ecosystems. Ethical arguments also have considerable force and merit.&quot; n862 At the forefront of such arguments should be a recognition of how little we know about the sea - and about the actual effect of human activities on marine ecosystems. </span><span class="underline">The United States has traditionally failed to protect marine ecosystems because it was difficult to detect anthropogenic harm to the oceans, but we now know that such harm is occurring - </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">even though we are not completely sure about causation or about how to fix every problem. Ecosystems like the NWHI coral reef ecosystem should inspire lawmakers and policymakers to admit that </span><span class="underline">most of the time we really do not know what we are doing to the sea and hence should be preserving marine wilderness whenever we can </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">- especially when the United States has within its territory relatively pristine marine ecosystems that may be unique in the world. We may not know much about the sea, but we do know this much: </span>if we kill the ocean we kill ourselves, and we will take <span class="underline">most of </span>the biosphere with us.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Black Sea is almost dead, n863 its once-complex and productive ecosystem almost entirely replaced by a monoculture of comb jellies, &quot;starving out fish and dolphins, emptying fishermen's nets, and converting the web of life into brainless, wraith-like blobs of jelly.&quot; n864 More importantly, the Black Sea is not necessarily unique. The Black Sea is a microcosm of what is happening to the ocean systems at large. The stresses piled up: overfishing, oil spills, industrial discharges, nutrient pollution, wetlands destruction, the introduction of an alien species. </span><span class="underline">The sea weakened, slowly at first, then collapsed with </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[*266] </span><span class="underline">shocking suddenness. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The lessons of this tragedy should not be lost to the rest of us, because </span><span class="underline">much of what happened </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">here </span><span class="underline">is being repeated all over the world. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The ecological stresses imposed on the Black Sea were not unique to communism. Nor, sadly, was the failure of governments to respond to the emerging crisis. n865 Oxygen-starved &quot;dead zones&quot; appear with increasing frequency off the coasts of major cities and major rivers, forcing marine animals to flee and killing all that cannot. n866 Ethics as well as enlightened self-interest thus suggest that the United States should protect fully-functioning marine ecosystems wherever possible - even if a few fishers go out of business as a result.</span><br />

 In order to answer whether due process is truly due, we must ask ourselves, “<u>What is terrorism</u>?” According to Merriam-Webster, terrorism is “the systematic use of terror, especially as a means of coercion.” <u>So what is a terrorist</u>?<br />
It is the rush to the conclusion that we know the terrorist that creates the violence to begin with. The totalizing us-them nature of terrorism discourse that pervades American politics prevents effective measures to stop the killing, requiring an infinite mimetic war to “win”, to come out on top as America always does. Our only chance is to break with the system, to question and problematize our view to prevent endless cycles of violence.

Its consequences in </span>legitimizing the repression of minorities<span class="underline"> in India, Russia, Turkey, and other countries are all too obvious. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">But the ultimate catastrophe is that </span>such a<span class="underline"> categorically ill-defined, perpetually deferred, </span>simpleminded Good-versus-Evil war<span class="underline"> echoes and </span>re-creates the very absolutist mentality and exceptionalist tactics of the insurgent terrorists. By formally adopting the terrorists’ own game<span class="underline">—one that by definition lacks rules of engagement, definite endings, clear alignments between enemies and friends, or formal arrangements of any sort, military, political, legal, or ethical—</span>the inevitable danger lies in reproducing it endlessly.<span class="underline"> One only has to look at the Palestinian-Israeli or the Basque-Spanish conflicts to see how self-defeating the alleged “victories” against terrorism can be in the absence of addressing the causes of the violence. “</span>A war against terrorism<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, then, mirrors the state of exception characteristic of insurgent violence, and in so doing it </span>reproduces it ad infinitum<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. The question remains: What politics might be involved in this state of alert as normal state? Would this possible scenario of competing (and mutually constituting) terror signify the end of politics as we know it?”27 </span>It is either politics or once again the self-fulfilling prophecy of fundamentalist crusaders<span class="underline"> who will never be able to entirely eradicate evil from the world. </span>Our choice cannot be<span class="underline"> between Bush and bin Laden, nor is our struggle one of “</span>us” versus “them<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">” </span>Such a split leads us into the ethical catastrophe of not feeling<span class="underline"> full </span>solidarity with the victims of either side<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">—since the value of each life is absolute, “</span>the only appropriate stance is the unconditional solidarity with ALL victims.”<span class="underline"> 28 </span>We must question our own involvement with the phantasmatic reality of terrorism discourse, for<span class="underline"> “now </span>even<span class="underline"> the USA and its </span>citizens can be regulated by terrorist discourse<span class="underline">. . . . Now the North American territory has become the most global and central place in the new history that terrorist ideology inaugurates.”29 Resisting the temptation of innocence regarding the barbarian other implies an awareness of a point Hegel made and that applies to the contemporary and increasingly globalized world more than ever: evil, he claims, resides also in the innocent gaze itself, perceiving as it does evil all around itself</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Derrida equally holds this position. In reference to the events of September 11, he said: “My unconditional compassion, addressed to the victims of September 11, does not prevent me from saying it loudly: with </span><span class="underline">regard to this crime, I do not believe that anyone is politically guiltless.”</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">30 In brief, we are all included in the picture, and these tragic events must make us problematize our own innocence while questioning our own political and libidinal investment in the global terrorism discourse.</span><br />

The securitizing state uses the threat of “terrorism” to justify any action taken upon its people as it engages what Agamben called the “state of exception”. The affirmative’s choice to begin their movement with the state literally makes ethics impossible, as the securitizing state can justify eliminating any portion of the population in the name of security, in the name of life. People are no longer viewed as autonomous individuals but as tools of support for state power<br />

There must be some set of principles for allowing<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in exceptional circumstances, </span>the introduction of sovereign power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

'It is at this moment that racism is inscribed as the basic mechanism of power, as it is exercised in modern States' (2003: 254).

How we as subjects are positioned in debate is a prerequisite to interpreting and understanding the resolution or its implications – how we know and view the world is influenced by construction of social reality through discourses of knowledge. Their view and representations of the terrorist are not neutral; they conflate the terrorist with enemy, creating a real-world sense of insecurity and violence. We have not only an intellectual but ETHICAL obligation to challenge status quo dominant discourse that allows us to open up a critical space to create new, emancipatory forms of knowledge. <u>The alternative is to vote negative to reject the affirmative’s unquestioning acceptance of a single, static terrorist identity and recognize the unconditional solidarity that exists between terrorism and the self.</u> I AM THE TERRORIST.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The purpose of this article is not to assert that the terrorist threat does not exist or that terrorism and religion are not linked in some fashion. Rather, its central aim is to draw attention to the contestable and politicized character of the dominant narratives, </span>the ways in which<span class="underline"> ‘Islamic </span>terrorism’ is interpreted and socially constructed as an existential threat and the means by which the broader discourse functions to promote<span class="underline"> a number of </span>discrete political projects and reify a particular<span class="underline"> kind of </span>political and social order<span class="underline">. </span>Exposing the ideological effects and political technologies of the discourse has the potential to open up critical space for<span class="underline"> the articulation of </span>alternative<span class="underline">and potentially emancipatory </span>forms of knowledge<span class="underline"> and practice</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, </span>given the enormous<span class="underline"> material and social </span>destruction of the war on terror<span class="underline">ism thus far, the possibility of </span>articulating non-violent or constructive responses<span class="underline"> to acts of terrorism </span>takes on immense<span class="underline"> normative </span>significance<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Fortunately, </span><span class="underline">discourses are never completely hegemonic;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> there is always room for counter-hegemonic struggle and subversive forms of knowledge.

All we have after the round is over is the education we’ve gained from the positions and argumentation. The affirmative burden is to prove that the endorsement of their speech act is preferable to the negative’s competitive option, and thus is the reciprocal negative burden. If you are going to vote for them the they must give you a concrete and methodological reason to vote for their specific speech act.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The same discourse (which characterises a way of thinking or the given state of knowledge at one time) can appear throughout a range of texts, across numerous sites. When these discursive events refer to the same object, say terrorism for example, and share a similar style and support a strategy, they are said to belong to the same <em>discursive formation</em> (Hall, 1997, p.44). </span>It is through<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> these </span>discursive formations that things<span class="underline">/practices </span>acquire<span class="underline"> their </span>meaning<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, </span>discursive representation is not a benign practice, for it is<span class="underline"> often </span>those in positions of power and authority who are able to construct ‘reality’ and<span class="underline"> thus </span>knowledge itself<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As Klein (1994) explains: ‘[a] </span>discourse<span class="Emphasis2">, then, </span>is not a way of learning ‘about’ something out there in the ‘real world’; it is<span class="Emphasis2"> rather </span>a way of producing that something as real, as identifiable<span class="underline">, classifiable, knowable, and therefore, meaningful. </span>Discourse creates the conditions of knowing<span style="font-size: 8pt;">’ (cited in George, 1994, p.30). Foucault contends that </span><span class="underline">knowledge is a form of power, and that power is present or exercised within decisions regarding what circumstances knowledge is applied or not</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, Foucault argues that knowledge (when linked to power) assumes the authority of ‘the truth’ and has the power to make itself true through a variety of regulatory and disciplining practices (Hall, 1997, p.49). </span>Knowledge<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (ways of knowing about others through discursive representations) therefore </span>is constructed by humans through<span class="underline"> their </span>interactions with the world around them and is a reflection of existing social, historical and political factors<span class="underline">, and as such, is never neutral.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In his analysis of the socially constructed nature of knowledge, Foucault explores the production of knowledge through discourse, and particularly how knowledge about the social, the individual, and associated shared meanings are produced in specific periods. In <em>Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason</em> (1988) and <em>The History of Sexuality Volume One</em> (1981),Foucault providesexamples of the shifting historical significance of sexuality and mental illness and the emergence of deviant identities. In this respect, mental illness and sexuality did not exist as independent objects, which remained the same and meant the same thing throughout all periods. Rather, it was through distinct discursive formations that the objects ‘madness’ or ‘heterosexuality’ emerged and appeared as meaningful constructs. Sexual relations and desires have always been present, but the constructs ‘heterosexual’ and ‘homosexual’ were <em>produced</em> through moral, legal, and medical discourses and practices. Through these discourses and practices, behaviours and acts were aligned with the construction of ‘types of’ people or identities - identities which were subject to medical treatment and legal constraints designed to regulate behaviour. In this respect, social and self identities are a consequence of power reflected in historically and institutionally specific systems/sites of discourse. </span><span class="underline">As social constructs, </span>it is important<span class="underline"> therefore </span>to view knowledge and discourse production through the socio-historical conditions in which they are produced<span class="underline">. In this respect, </span>discourses concerning terrorism<span class="underline">, security dilemmas and threat, and world order, </span>are produced within specific<span class="underline"> historical, geographical and socio-political </span>contexts as well as<span class="underline"> within social </span>relations of power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span><span class="underline">the controlling and legitimising aspects of discourse are such that </span>proponents of violence are not likely to construct a narrative that is contrary to their values<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For instance, </span><span class="underline">Al Qaeda is unlikely to construct a narrative that posits them in a contrary manner to their own moral values by engaging in ‘terrorist’ activities. Rather, they would position themselves as acting morally, and as victims of oppression or humiliation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Cobb, 2004). Similarly, </span>the US and her<span class="underline"> coalition </span>allies are<span class="underline"> also </span>likely to construct a narrative which posits their involvement in a ‘fight against terror’ within a discursive framework of liberty and democracy<span class="underline">, rather than expansionist or imperialist terms. </span><br />

It is not just events that are shaped by language; our discourse shapes the identities we see in others – their violent language methodologically constructs dichotomies of “Good and Evil,” “Self and Other,” that are the precondition for the line between “Citizen and Terrorist.” The idea that affirming means these people should have more rights is irrelevant – the key question is how you have chosen to identify them, using only the label of one committing acts of terror.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In his foundational work <em>Orientalism</em> (1978), Edward </span><span class="underline">Said examines the historical construction of the East (Them/Other) and West (Us/Self) as essentially different entities through discursive practices</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Drawing upon Foucault’s notion of discourse, </span><span class="underline">Said contends that </span>Orientalism is a discourse: by which European culture was able to manage<span class="underline"> – </span>and even produce – the Orient<span class="underline"> politically, sociologically, militarily, ideologically, scientifically, and imaginatively during the post-Enlightenment period</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (p. 3). </span>Such a discourse draws upon assumptions that are imperialist by design, privilege European<span class="underline"> sensibilities and </span>representations of the Other, and reinforce ideas concerning the fixed nature of<span class="underline"> states of being and </span>difference<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (McDowell, 2003). Said argues that </span>Orientalist ideas can be found in<span class="underline"> current </span>representations of ‘Arab’ cultures as backward, lacking democracy, threatening and anti-Western<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (2003). Similarly, Occidentalism</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.socresonline.org.uk/13/1/17.html#fn2" rel="nofollow">2</a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> can be found in stereotypical representations of an “imperialist, corrupting, decadent and alienating West” (Nadje Al-Ali cited in Freund, 2001). As I suggest later, </span>these<span class="underline"> representations </span>have become a feature of<span class="underline"> the current </span>Western perceptions of terrorism<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As a practice, Othering is not solely a province of East versus West relations, but also exists as a strategy within other non-Westerns nations. For example, Shah (2004), Kennedy-Pipe and Welch (2005) and Baev (2007) note how </span><span class="underline">the ‘war on international terrorism’ discourse has been used by Russia to legitimate it actions against former Soviet republics like Chechnya. Within a sociological context, </span>identity discourse is<span class="underline"> often </span>characterised by issues concerning essentialising and marginalising social groups<span class="underline">, as well as totalising and categorising individuals and groups</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Gaudelli, 2001, p.60). </span><span class="underline">Categorisation results as a response to diversity, wherein categorisation assists with making the diversity (of people) more understandable. As a consequence of this, people become viewed as being more typical of certain categories</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (eg. a Muslim from </span><span class="underline">Iraq is stereotypically viewed as being ‘Muslim’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in comparison to an Australian Muslim in Cronulla within some discursive frameworks). </span>Following<span class="underline"> the </span>construction<span class="underline"> and application </span>of these categories, is a tendency to essentialise<span class="underline"> (belief in essence) </span>as is evident in notions of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ‘the laconic Aussie,’ ‘the whingeing Pom,’ and </span>the ‘fanatical terrorist<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.’ In this sense, </span><span class="underline">the act of ‘</span>naming’ is akin to ‘knowing<span class="underline">.’ Dividing practices evident in the categorisation and essentialising processes which inform the production of binaries reflect power struggles, as they primarily entail an external authority </span>imposing a ‘condition of life upon people’<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Gaudelli, 2001, p.74) that are supposed to have certain essences. </span><span class="underline">These power relations become evident in the abilities of claim-makers or particular agents to make certain discourses, categories and labels acceptable and make them ‘stick’ as it were.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In turn, </span><span class="underline">essentialism results in reifying culture by viewing cultural systems as being discrete and homogeneous units</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (nationally, ethnically and ideologically), </span><span class="underline">which are ‘naturally given’ and fixed in locality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Jones, 1999). Here it is important to remember, that </span><span class="underline">it is not culture that is ‘found’ or ‘discovered’ out in the field, but individuals who act and interact and express their views of culture</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Schulte-Tenckhoff, 2001, p.5). This paper contends that </span>it is the relations between groups and<span class="underline"> related </span>boundary making practices<span class="underline"> (insider/outsider, </span>Self/Other) rather than ‘traits’ which are<span class="underline"> important indicators and </span>producers of identity<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As discussed above, </span>binaries such as<span class="underline"> those of </span>Self/Other have a tendency to convey world views in concrete<span class="underline">, simplified and often </span>imperialist ways<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Berry, 2006). </span><span class="underline">The process of ‘</span>Othering’ is commensurate with identification<span class="underline"> (as culture, community, or nation) which further entails an act of differentiation, authentication, and at times, exclusion – creating boundaries between members of the ‘in’ group and outsiders.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In this sense the: ‘</span><span class="underline">Self/Other relation induces comparisons used by social actors to describe themselves or to describe others, depending on their location. In locking a given group into a substantially transformed identity, one constructs and immobilises this relation so that it operates in favour of those to whose advantage it is’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Schulte-Tenckhoff, 2001, p.11</span><span class="underline">). </span>Self/Other relations are therefore ‘matters of power and rhetoric rather than of essence’<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Clifford, 2004, p.14). Within this context, boundary-making practices are a way of ‘locking’ ‘imagined communities’ into strategically informed ontological states of being. Moreover, </span><span class="underline">these boundaries are inter-subjectively determined, that is, they are constructed through an emphasis on only a subset of many identity labels that apply</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (eg. religion). President George Bush has described his war on terror as a ‘crusade’ and a ‘divine plan’ guided by God. </span><span class="underline">These sentiments are similar to Islamic calls for Jihad, with religious terrorists viewing themselves as God’s people and their enemies as God’s enemies, ‘infidels’, or sinners</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As a consequence, for both sides, </span><span class="underline">the conflict takes on the form of a ‘spiritual battle.’ Thus religious doctrine acts as fuel for Islamic-based terrorism as it does for the US led ‘war on terror’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Inside this discursive framework, </span><span class="underline">both would contend that each party’s religion is the only meaningful one</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Berry, 2006 p.4). Indeed, </span><span class="underline">the construction of identity plays a key role in relation to the prospect for religious and political violence.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Hence, identity claims invariably informs interests. The call by fundamentalist Islamists for a Jihad on Western nations for example is a realisation of both interests and identities simultaneously. In this sense, identities and interests are mutually reinforcing concepts and incapable of being pursued separately (Hughes, 2004, p.7). Identity negotiation highlights the political nature of social identifications of Self and Others within and between groups. Contestation arises out of those ascribed social or collective identities that do not align with an individual’s or group’s self-definition, highlighting global and national tensions, as well as power dynamics which frequently underplay such identification processes. Hence </span><span class="underline">Self/Other struggles are ultimately struggles of legitimacy and meaning, frequently enacting and fuelling conflict. Indeed, it is in the creation of Self and an all-threatening Other that the state, or prominent figures within terrorist networks like Al Qaeda, use their power and available resources for legitimated violence</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Grondin, 2004). </span><br />

If there’s no one in charge at the other end of the line, why then is normative legal thought in such a hurry to get its message across? And why, particularly, is it always in such a hurry to repeat the same old boring moves? There is an edge to these questions. And the edge comes in part from our implicit assumption that normative legal thought is a kind of that and that, as thought, it is in control of its own situation, its form, its own rhetoric. But it isn’t so. </span><span class="underline">If normative legal thought keeps repeating itself</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline">and</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if it </span><span class="underline">is incapable of understanding challenges to its own</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> intellectual </span><span class="underline">authority</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline">that is because </span>it is not<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> simply or even fundamentally </span>a kind of thought<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Normative legal thought is<span style="font-size: 8pt;">in part </span>a routine<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – our routine. It is the </span><span class="underline">highly </span>repetitive, cognitively entrenched, institutionally sanctioned, and politically enforced<span class="underline"> routine of the legal academy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – a routine </span><span class="underline">that</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> silently </span>produces our thoughts and keeps our work channeled within the same old cognitive and rhetorical matrices<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

And like most routines, it remains unseen and unobserved – which is why it is so powerful. It is an aspect – a significant aspect – of the unnoticed and untroubled overarching epistemic economy within which (virtually) all contemporary legal thought is produced. In terms somewhat misleading but more familiar to legal thinkers, normative legal thought is the latest incarceration of the Langdellian legacy, the latest variation on formalism – normative formalism.</span><br />

Why have a fair debate that produces “education” if that education promotes an intellectual discussion that literally excludes those humans that are considered “Other”. Failure to take the discursive questioning of the alternative into account is an act of violence against that which is unknown, that which is different than “Us”. This shows the stereotypical justice-morality debate they want to have does not promote true justice or morality, but a twisted Americanized form that turns their terminal impacts. When we debate incessantly about instances of “morality” that are purely hypothetical and we have no control over, it skews our conception of what truly is “morality”, turns all their terminal impacts<br />

For example, consider </span>the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> normative </span>word “freedom<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” This particular word </span>has a certain <span class="underline">exchange </span>value in our rhetoric<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and in our discourse. It is well known, for instance, that at present, “freedom” of […] enjoys a certain rhetorical advantage over “security of […]. That is to say, at present, “freedom” is rhetorically superior to “security.” </span>As legal thinkers<span class="underline"> come to </span>recognize this<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> point, </span>they<span class="underline"> try</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of course, </span><span class="underline">to </span>associate “freedom” with their favorite values<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, leaving “security” as the word for competing or interfering values. Thus the exchange value of the “freedom” word rises in the rhetorical economy of legal thought. However, the rise in the exchange value of such normative words typically yields an inflationary spiral. </span>Sooner or later everybody is using the “freedom” word<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For a while, the political charm of the “freedom” word can survive accelerated circulation. The word remains important. It remains important because it remains performatively effective. </span>It is perceived as a tool<span class="underline">, a rhetorical lever</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>But precisely because<span class="underline"> the “</span>freedom<span class="underline">” word </span>remains performatively effective, it is immediately pressed further into<span style="font-size: 8pt;">all sorts of </span>instrumentalist enterprises<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, thereby </span>further diffusing its<span style="font-size: 8pt;">constative </span>significance<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>After a while<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the “</span>freedom<span style="font-size: 8pt;">” word </span>doesn’t mean<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> much of </span>anything<span class="underline">. It isn’t even a reliable rhetorical tool</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to get people to act, or to be or to say various things. On the contrary, </span>everybody knows the trick: Freedom’s just another word for getting you to do something you don’t want to do<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Now this linguistic metamorphosis is hardly limited to the “freedom” word. Rather, the </span><span class="underline">linguistic devaluation affects the entire normative currency</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In fact, it affects the entire grammar of normative legal thought. Hence, </span><span class="underline">entire structures, </span>entire complexes of normative legal thought become increasingly vacuous<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – </span>their purchase on the world<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, descriptive and regulatory, </span><span class="underline">less and </span>less credible<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even the performative value of these structures and complexes becomes weakened as legal thinkers come to recognize that their constative significance has been devalued. As the normative currency is devalued, </span>the relation between normative structures and complexes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on the one hand, </span>and the practices to which they<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ostensibly </span>correspond<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on the other, </span>becomes weakened<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, attenuated. </span>No longer is it possible to maintain<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a naïve </span>idealism<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or materialism </span>where normative conceptions such as “justice<span class="underline">,” “liberty,” “consent,” or “community,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” either determine or </span>are determined by the practices to which they<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ostensibly </span>correspond<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The language of determination, and even its softer, more nuanced dialects, no longer provide an adequate understanding of the situation of normative legal thought. Here, the point is not that normative legal thought has now become indeterminate, as opposed to some previous or possible state of determinacy. Rather, the point is that determination is no longer the appropriate frame of reference for charting the relation between normative legal thought and the practices it ostensibly addresses.</span><br />

 The affirmative’s presentation of the implications of domestic violence is flawed; they view domestic violence as a single action or a group of overt and violent blows delivered from one individual to another; this type of thought prevents recognizing that the idea of domestic violence is not created by these individual acts of violence, but of broader societal and historical relations between classes, races, and genders. The mentality that we can ignore the structural foundation which allows domestic violence to operate is exactly what allows it to continue<br />

Employing Foucault's insights, I suggest that we read Tillmon's metaphor not in its literal sense as a singular, coherent &quot;man&quot; that oppresses women but rather as a reflection of the local and intimate effects produced by state power.5 For Tillmon, </span><span class="underline">being on welfare produces the experience of being in a &quot;super-sexist marriage&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—being on welfare feels </span><span class="underline">like being abused</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The question<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> then </span>is not where or who the &quot;man&quot; in the state is, but rather what modalities of state power produce this effect in the lives of women<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on welfare. What is it about the welfare system that situates women on the receiving end of abuse? </span>How does state power materialize as<span class="underline"> a form of </span>domestic violence<span class="underline"> in the lives of women </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">on welfare? These questions suggest that </span>there are important insights about the nature of state violence to be gained from<span class="underline"> a </span>closer examination of<span class="underline"> the </span>welfare<span class="underline"> system</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Tillmon's metaphor reminds us that, though it is most often imagined and theorized as an instrument of the police or military, </span>state violence—like domestic violence—is not simply a beating in the street or other overt physical act but rather an elaborate and sometimes all-encompassing system of power and control<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.6 </span>It manifests itself in the<span class="underline"> very </span>ways<span class="underline"> that </span>domestic space is constituted and the heteropatriarchal family normalized<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the case of women on welfare, </span><span class="underline">a group that is </span>hypervisibly situated at the intersections of social relations of race, class, gender, and sexuality<span class="underline">, this is most apparent in the porous boundaries that increasingly define the homes of the &quot;poor&quot; as spaces of privatized social inequality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and publicized moral failure.7 Tillmon's analysis points to state violence as not just spectacular incidents but also mundane practices such as home inspections, the denial of a welfare check, bureaucratic obstacles, and the myriad other dehumanizing ways that recipients are always already seen and treated as &quot;welfare queens.&quot;</span><br />

Their advocacy perpetuates racial and societal lines that separate different types of women; their discourse imposes a world in which only those women seen as innocent, i.e. only the white socioeconomically well-off women are allowed to use deadly force; all those others who are seen as racial minorities are seen as consistently breaking the rules<br />

Operating from mainstream assumptions about<span class="underline"> the nature of </span>domestic violence and its relationship to women's poverty<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the </span>studies quantified specific incidents of abusebut did not investigate how structural forces such as patriarchy, racism, and economic inequality might render some<span class="underline"> women </span>more vulnerable<span class="underline"> to abuse than others</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Gender oppression was undertheorized; class was reduced<span class="underline"> to women's capacities to work</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> outside the home; </span>and race as an organizing feature of structural inequality<span class="underline"> rather than as a marker of cultural deviance </span>was disregarded entirely<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<br />
The alternative is to use question the intersectionality of differences between people and their race, gender, socioeconomic condition, and other differences and how those societal norms set the base for domestic violence to occur; thus, the standard is epistemological inquiry; without investigation into what methods and practices we use to gather knowledge, the information we have to describe the world around us is meaningless; this questioning of society’s role in the production of domestic violence can lead to the resolving of questions such as whether or not victims of domestic abuse can permissibly use deadly force, but this is a key first step<br />

With this approach, </span><span class="underline">feminists</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and others working under the umbrella of the women's movement can continue to challenge men's violence toward known women while diversifying to produce historical and culturally specific understandings of how women can have very different experiences of the same issue.

This question of the alternative is key to developing the framework; Evaluate the debate through competing speech acts; it is not enough to prove the resolution true for some reason, the affirmative burden is to prove that their speech act is beneficial to our understanding of domestic violence as a whole and how we should interact with it, and thus is my reciprocal burden; if I prove the alternative is a better means by which we envision confronting domestic violence than through the affirmative’s speech act then you vote negative. How we as subjects are positioned in debate is a prerequisite to interpreting and understanding the resolution or its implications – how we know and view the world is influenced by construction of social reality through discourses of knowledge. The offense they attempt to garner off their standard is meaningless if we do not learn how it applies to real-world decisionmaking or relating it do our own actions in regard to domestic violence and means nothing to us if we fail to first recognize why domestic violence exists and why it proliferates. Only the representations about how our rhetoric exists in the world matter because all we really have after the round is the education we’ve gained from specific speech acts.

In its study on the roots of behaviour in war and violations of international humanitarian law, the ICRC for example discusses the fact that some combatants may have been victims of harm themselves, and how their self-perception as having the status of victims influences their behaviour in engaging in more violence.43 As a second important example, </span>the recent study on women<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and war44 also </span>shows a commitment to caution when using the term ‘victim’<span class="underline"> coupled with a clear desire to keep the concept in its place, </span>leaving<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> enough </span>roomfor<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> all the </span>other identities<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><span class="underline">people</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> living in a conflict environment (women in this case) </span><span class="underline">can have</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and perceive themselves as having.

Use of the word ‘victim’ precedes their framework and impact arguments; they fail to recognize that this construction of ‘victimhood’ constructs the identity of the person suffering domestic abuse in its entirety and devalues their other attributes as a person; the way the AC represented what they call ‘victims’ directly contributes to the violence they suffer in our society<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Second, </span>the term ‘victim’ can<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as a noun </span>refer to an identity<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or status. </span>The identity of ‘victim’ in the sense of a label<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or status can be used either by people affected by a crime or an accident to describe themselves, or </span><span class="underline">by others </span>when they refer to such people in their discourse<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.1 Rather than indicating the actual vulnerable state of a person or group and their needs, </span>the term ‘victim’<span class="underline"> when used in this way </span>relates to a much more abstract and contestable dimension, involving self-perception<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (as a victim or not), </span><span class="underline">identity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (understood as the different ways in which one relates to oneself and presents oneself to others), </span><span class="underline">and feelings</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (e.g. of self-worth, self-respect, confidence and dignity, or on the contrary </span>demoralization, depression, hurt and loss of confidence<span style="font-size: 8pt;">). Finally, it can also involve interests: the desire to gain social recognition, to seek justice, to benefit from reparations, to influence public opinion, to highlight the guilt of perpetrators, etc. It can also motivate either the harmed person to claim victim status or another person to attribute this status to others. Uses or rejections of the term ‘victim’ as an identity can be illustrated by the following cases, to mention only a few. There is for instance the girl who, seriously injured by a landmine in Cambodia like many others, has become an anti-landmine campaigner, vindicating her rights as a ‘victim’ and demanding forms of justice through her presence and slogans in front of the United Nations in Geneva. Or the teacher from a village in Darfur who lost several members of his family in the conflict there, and now comes to work every day at one of the international aid organizations. He keeps a low profile, never giving his colleagues any idea of the suffering he has gone through, but instead appearing content enough to be considered as an active colleague rather than as a ‘victim of the conflict’ – the category of people he himself is helping. Or lastly there is the government that will seek to reshape its world image as a ‘victim’ after being the target of terrorist attacks, whereas another state that has experienced similar deadly events will integrate the sombre episode in its history but will not seek to include the aspect of victimhood in a new national identity. </span><span class="underline">The </span>attributes linked<span class="underline"> to the term ‘</span>victim’ when it refers to<span class="underline"> a state of </span>vulnerability may remain present when it is claimed or attributed as a status<span class="underline">, though sometimes not so evidently. </span>The negative connotation of those attributes may<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span>affect the people they are meant to describe, by devaluing them<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This impact is not always taken into consideration. On the contrary, </span>the term ‘victims’ is<span class="underline"> often used and </span>understood<span class="underline"> in a straightforward way </span>as referring to the state of victimhood, when in fact its impact is more that of labelling a group of individuals<span class="underline">. The enunciator might not always be aware of the underlying devaluing connotations mentioned above and their effect on the people concerned</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Evaluate the affirmative’s discourse first; the way in which we label certain groups and individuals is the precondition for how we engage them discursively and politically. Their performative speech act has the power to devalue the lives of those they term ‘victims’<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Meredith 3 writes:</span><br />
<br />
<span class="underline">The ‘victim’ identity is one of several identities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by which subjects can define themselves. </span>When someone refers to a person as a victim<span class="underline"> in their discourse, </span>they are<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> potentially </span>excluding other identities that may better define that person<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, at least in his or her own eyes. Deliberately or not, </span>the enunciator may<span class="underline"> run the risk of </span>exclud<span class="underline">ing the </span>other identities the individual persons possess that would reflect other attributes<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or states they define themselves by, for example their nationality, their profession, their cultural or religious beliefs, their motivations, their role or position in their family. Arguably, </span>it is not a harmless or insignificant event to bring any particular identity of a person or group to the fore at the expense of others<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As a poststructuralist theorist2 puts it, ‘… </span>naming<span class="underline"> is not just the pure nominalistic game of attributing an empty name to a preconstituted subject. </span><span class="Emphasis2">It </span>is the discursive construction of the subject itself<span class="Emphasis2">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> […] </span>The<span class="underline"> essentially </span>performative character of naming is the precondition for all hegemony and politics<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.’3 </span>Naming<span class="underline"> oneself, another individual, or </span>a group ‘a victim’ can<span class="underline"> therefore </span>become a performative act that has the power to<span class="underline"> validate, and therefore ‘</span>produce’ a subject with this particular identity<span class="underline"> and the attributes that go with it (vulnerable, passive, helpless</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> etc.). Such a discourse may be sending powerful messages and reflecting particular motivations meant to achieve certain goals, but the latter are not always easy to ‘decode’</span>.<br />

 The real is dead; in its place has come a giant metaphorical world of representations and symbols upon symbols, each becoming a signifier of the last; the affirmative’s speech act on the nature of moral obligations contributes to the world in its becoming of the simulacrum, the electronic copy of the world and the ethical norms that go along with it that now precede the real thing<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Introna writes:</span><br />
The real<span class="underline"> for Baudrillard</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (1983) </span>is dead<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; it is not merely dead it never existed. </span><span class="underline">The </span>assumed relationship between the real and the representation was<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> itself </span>an image<span style="font-size: 8pt;">— </span>there is no<span style="font-size: 8pt;">sense in the </span>distinction between: the map and the territory<span class="underline">; the copy and the original; </span>the fictional and the factual; the simulation and the real<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Baudrillard (1983, p. 2) concludes: “</span>Abstraction<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> today </span>is no longer that of the map<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the double, the mirror or the concept. </span>Simulation is no longer that of a territory<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a referential being or a substance. </span><span class="underline">It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: </span>a hyper real<span class="underline">. The territory no longer precedes the map</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Nor survives it. Henceforth</span><span class="underline">, </span>it is the map that precedes the territory<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—PRECESSION OF SIMULACRA— it is the map that engenders the territory...” </span>There are no foundations, no ultimate referent, everything is always already interpretation.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Without a foundation that can act as the guiding principle—</span><span class="underline">the judge</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as it were—</span><span class="underline">of what is real or imitation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, true or false, genuine or counterfeit, </span>all distinctions become arbitrary<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Baudrillard (1993, p. 5) confirms: “Strictly speaking, </span>nothing remains for us to base anything on. All that remains<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for us </span>istheoretical violence—speculation to the death<span class="underline">, whose only method is the radicalisation of hypotheses.” </span>Distinctions<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> now </span>become the outcome of the microphysics of power, local language games<span class="underline">, regimes of truth, intersubjective agreements; </span>and<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the end of this spectrum Baudrillard’s </span>total anarchism<span class="underline">. All distinctions must be made plastic</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by self-referentiality. This is the “logic of simulation which has nothing to do with a logic of facts and an order of reasons. </span><span class="underline">Simulation is characterised by a precession of the model</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of all models around the merest fact—</span><span class="underline">the models come first</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and their orbital circulation constitutes the genuine magnetic field of events” (Baudrillard, 1983, p. 31). All are simulations; the </span>models ‘create’ the facts<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Facts have no sense of their own, they circulate the models in an infinite regression. To understand Baudrillard’s argument one could expand his successive phases of the image—maybe one can also call it the biography of reality—as indicated in Table 1 below (Baudrillard, 1983, p. 11). I will start the discussion in phase three. Baudrillard argues that </span><span class="underline">the real is fabricated by staging its negative.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For example, he explains that </span><span class="underline">Disneyland is staged so that we can say Disneyland is ‘make believe’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (imaginary) </span><span class="underline">and the world that surrounds Disneyland</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Los Angeles and the rest of America</span><span class="underline">) is real</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In a similar manner we stage criminality so that we can fabricate a system of justice that is seen as legitimate. </span><span class="underline">In staging the negative we fabricate</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (or make sensible) </span><span class="underline">distinctions such as real and imaginary</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, true and false, right and wrong. As Baudrillard (1983, p. 25) argues: “The Disneyland imaginary is neither true nor false; it is a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real” (my emphasis). In the face of the postmodern nihilism the </span>modern society is becoming desperate in its efforts to preserve the real<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This is seen in the proliferation of the staging of the negative. </span>The proving of the real by staging the imaginary is now exploding<span class="underline">:</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the proving of the truth through scandal; the proving of the law by transgression; proving work by strike, etc. In the mass media, in the information society, this staging is most apparent: “</span>Instead of facilitating communication, it exhausts itself staging communication<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Instead of producing meaning, it wears itself out staging it. </span><span class="underline">This is the gigantic simulation-process with which we are familiar</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: non-directive interviews, phone-ins, all-round participation, verbal blackmail— you’re involved, the event is you,...” (Baudrillard, 1980, p. 139). In the final phase of the image </span><span class="underline">any </span>pretence to the real is lost as the system becomes self-referential<span class="underline"> and a law onto itself. This is the stage of the hyperreal: “</span>the collapse of reality into hyperrealism<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the meticulous reduplication of the real, preferably through another reproductive medium such as advertising or photography [or cyberspace and virtual reality]. </span><span class="underline">Through reproduction from one medium into another the real becomes volatile</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, it becomes </span><span class="underline">the allegory of death, but</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> it </span><span class="underline">also draws strength from its own destruction</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, becoming the real for its own sake, a fetishism of the lost object which is no longer the object of representation, but the ecstasy of denigration and its own ritual extermination: the hyperreal.” [Baudrillard, 1993 #18, p. 72</span><span class="underline">) In the hyperreal the crisis of representation that have occupied the modern mind</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for so long </span><span class="underline">is overcome with the real sealed off in a circle of pure repetition</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the epoch of the hyperreal the real is now “that which it is possible to provide an equivalent reproduction... At the end of the process of reproducibility, </span>the real is not only that which can be reproduced, but that which is always already reproduced<span class="underline">: the hyperreal</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” (Baudrillard, 1993, p. 73). It is clear from the above brief analysis that there is an infinite regress in the logic of Baudrillard. We stage the imaginary to fabricate (simulate) the real. The simulation becomes a simulation of a simulation that accelerates us into the dimension of the hyperreal. In the hyperreal everything is already simulation; everything is always already reproduction.</span><br />

The hypothetical moral obligations promoted in the AC are contributions to the hyperreal, the imagination of the disaster in which we mix names and faces and real human lives into electronic representations, and we are involved as though we are some omniprescient third party capable of deciding between life and death<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Introna continues:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is my supposition that </span>electronic mediation with its hyperreal effect<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—even if we do not take it to its Baudrillardian extreme—</span>is turning disasters into hyperreal events and proper names into meaningless electronic representations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span><span class="underline">hyperreal events and </span>representations that come before us, but do not involve us<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In hyperreality </span>we are less and less likely to meet our obligations face to face. This is why<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I believe </span>the world was able to turn the Gulf War into a television spectacle and watch jet fighters bomb enemy targets, not people with names and faces, just images<span style="font-size: 8pt;">on the screen </span>that explode<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—like in Rambo or Death Wish-II. I will not try to prove this supposition. I suspect one could develop many forms of phenomenological description and empirical studies to attempt this. I will not do it here—mostly because I cannot give the claim of the other force by proving it. </span><span class="underline">I cannot make obligation safe</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, it will happen or not. Nevertheless, I want to discuss this supposition by looking at the collapse of the Barings bank and the role of Nick Leeson in this event in which a multitudinous number of proper names, with faces, suffered. It is my contention that this disaster was possible because Leeson could not see the faces of proper names—he did not become disturbed. This left him self-certain and rendered his immoral actions obvious and self-evident to him. </span>In his hyperreal world he could simply not come face to a face—just images presented on screens, numbers moving from screens to paper and back<span class="underline">.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
The hyperreal makes the idea of a moral obligation impossible to realize; the representation of those with moral obligations not as actual individual people but as one unidentified mass of bodies replaces the real of moral obligations; as long as we are making our speeches in our safe little debate rounds about how important obligations are we have no duties outside of our ivory towers. This makes us complacent with the disaster, the disaster that forces us to confront our true moral obligations to the suffering other in the moment of their suffering, the moment at which we recognize their real body, their real face, their real suffering; The alternative is to reject the affirmative and the conception that we can attempt to represent the suffering of the other and our response through an unrelated speech act; vote negative in realization that we cannot choose our obligations; we must reject these abstract conceptions of the obligation and realize that the obligation is what controls us, we do not control the terms of the obligation; recognize the naked face of the other that we observe suffering<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Introna continues:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Why do moral obligations happen? </span>With<span class="underline"> the notion of </span>a moral obligation<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I have in mind a claim for which </span>there exists no social or institution basis, no rational logos to make it reasonable. Neither are there benefits for assuming it<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span><span class="underline">the taking up of the obligation may entail personal sacrifice </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">beyond what can be viewed as reasonable. In spite of this ‘irrational’ basis people do respond to their moral obligations in everyday life. Why do we sometimes experience and respond to another’s claim on us, even if may mean enormous personal sacrifice? Are ethical sensibilities aroused by a rational reflection on Kant’s imperative, for example, or maybe on the imperative ‘to do onto others as I would want them to do unto me’? </span>This may be true in removed ethical discourse, but it seems less likely in-the-world when faced with<span class="underline"> the abyss of </span>disaster<span style="font-size: 8pt;">2. I would argue that it is possible to know</span>ethical responsibilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> through ethical discourse. However, they </span>are experienced in the facticity of the situation—when facing a face in a disaster<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To know my obligations may be necessary but it is not sufficient for me to enact them. </span><span class="underline">To enact them </span>I need to experience<span class="underline"> then in </span>the facticity of the situation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If this is so then </span>we need to inquire about the source of this experience<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I would argue with Don Caputo (1993) that </span>obligations happens to us. When I find myself in factual life I find myself enmeshed in obligations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, I experience them </span>as part of my being-in-the-world<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Introna, 1997). In involving myself in the world </span><span class="underline">I </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tend to </span><span class="underline">find obligations always already there</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span><span class="underline">I never seem to arrive in time to find out were they came from</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Heidegger, 1962). </span>They are just there<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As I stumble through my everyday, I find myself coming face to a face with obligations. </span>They<span class="underline"> seem to </span>grab me, without my consent<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. They take hold of me, </span>bind me, in a way that makes my claim to autonomy and freedom seems feeble<span class="underline"> and frivolous in the face of the urgency of the bond</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Caputo (1993, pp. 7–8) makes this point most strikingly: </span>Obligation is a feeling, the feeling of being bound<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (ligare, ob-ligare, re-ligare), an element of my feeling Befindlichkeit, but I cannot get on top of it, scale its heights, catch a glimpse of its rising up. </span><span class="underline">It comes at me, comes over me</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, overtakes me, seizes hold of me. </span>As soon as I come to be I am already in its grasp<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I have neither the will nor the means to deny it. When I am obliged I do not know by what dark powers I am held. I only know/feel/find myself caught up, in the midst of obligation, in its snare, in scandal, in panic—perhaps even blinded. </span>If an obligation is ‘mine’ it is not because it belongs to me but because I belong to it<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Obligation is</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not one more thing that I comprehend and want to do, but </span><span class="underline">something that intervenes upon and disrupts the sphere of what the I wants</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline">something that troubles and disturbs the I</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, that pulls the I out of the circle of the same, as Levinas would say. In the face of the other, the particular person, obligation disturbs the calm waters of the I; it plucks the I out of its orbit. To obey it is not a matter of judging the relevance of a principle, it is rather a ‘choice about the effects of obedience or disobedience’ in-the-world—it is a kind of “Abrahamic Befindlichkeit” (Kierkegaard, 1985 [1843]). Obligation does not leave room for manoeuvre. It is not about a range of choices that I can weigh up in terms of each choice’s consequences (Bentham, 1948 [1789]). It is a matter of responding to what is possible here and now in the Befindlichkeit—in the being-bound—to that I am already in. </span>We cannot say where obligation comes from<span class="underline">, what its home-ground, foundation, primordial source, </span>or fundamental cause is. We can<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, nevertheless, </span>say that obligations tend to consort with disasters<span class="underline">. “A disaster is an economic notion.…</span>The disaster belongs to an economy of excessive cost, for which there is no compensating return<span class="underline">. The disaster is an utter wasting</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a sheer loss. </span><span class="underline">There is no larger perspective</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, no larger whole, no totality in terms of which the loss can be reckoned part of an acceptable expenditure, an acceptable cost that one is willing to pay. </span>Disasters throw all reckoning and cost-accounting, every logos and ratio, into chaos<span style="font-size: 8pt;">” Caputo (1993, p. 29). There are no ‘small’ or ‘big’ disasters, only disasters. Disasters do not lend themselves to be weighed for outcomes, results or consequences. To search for an outcome in a disaster is an extreme form of ‘obscenity’. </span>Disasters do not produce a result, only victims with proper names—particular persons, with particular families, addresses, and so forth<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Absolute singulars as Levinas would say. </span><span class="underline">Obligation consorts with disasters, it is a matter of being bound</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (ligare) </span><span class="underline">to</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, grabbed by, </span><span class="underline">a disaster in-the-world</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is not a matter of something before me, an informed choice, it is to be claimed by something that ‘has a hold on us, something that is older than us, that has us before we have it.’ </span><span class="underline">Obligation is</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span><span class="underline">not a subjectivistic notion</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Caputo (1993, p. 32) argues: “It is not an effect produced by a subject, but rather something produced in me, as in a patient, something that happens to me... It is my unflagging supposition that there is something about suffering that stops us in our tracks...that we are laid hold of by others, seized and laid claim to, that the fullness of freedom is hollowed out by the hollow eyes of those who suffer.” The seizure does not depend on principle; the principle is, at most, a consolidation, after the fact, of being seized. Hence, we “do not judge the singular in virtue of the principle, but we draft the principle after the fact by excavating the singularity and erecting a relatively hollow schema—or ‘principle’—whose cash value is solely the singularities upon which it is drawn... We do not really apply principles to individual ‘cases’...we apply individuals to principle” Caputo (1993, p. 37). </span>In the disaster, the ego and her categories shatter before the face of the other. The face of the other, the singular disturbs the ego, takes it hostage and shatters even the most reasonable of reasons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Nevertheless, what if someone claims to be ‘indifferent to suffering, or, claiming nothing at all, simply walk away from suffering’. What then? What are we to do? The ‘cold truth’ is that we cannot force the claim of those who suffer. Whatever our good intentions, such forcing of the claim would not hold up. We cannot make the claim more forceful by calling to its defence meta-ethical categories as Caputo (1993) so eloquently argues for the child born with AIDS: The claim of the child is finite and fragile. It is not absolutely commanding— not a Categorical Imperative that breaks through the world of appearances, nor the Form of the Good gradually being recalled, nor the traces of the Face of God showing up in the child’s face. Were any of these very beautiful hypotheses true, we would, perhaps, not let the conditions flourish under which these disasters occur with such savage regularity as we do. What law there is to come to the relief of the child is inscribed only on the face of the child, which is the face of suffering, and it does not extend beyond the singularity of the child. The child herself is the only law. In terms of metaphysico-ethical back-ups, the child is on her own. The child ‘is not a fact as it were of pure reason.’… [but] of factual life, a fact of flesh, of the power that flesh exerts over flesh, which is highly finite. No more. But no less. (p. 38, my emphasis) But </span>what if the obligation does not stick? We cannot make it stick. The best<span class="underline"> that </span>we can do is to make the claim<span class="underline"> of the child </span>burst forth in as many ways possible<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to make it as strong as possible, ‘</span>to sound the alarm of disasters<span class="underline"> as loud as we can,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and to make indifference look as bad as possible, as bad as its is.’ However, </span><span class="underline">in ‘sounding the alarm’ we must be careful not to turn disasters into meanings,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> categories and themes. </span>Disasters are about particular bodies not meanings<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (such as law and order, the struggle, freedom, the people, the Law, the Faith, and so forth). </span>Disasters have a face and a name, a proper name<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The currency of obligations is proper names, particular individuals<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>We ‘know our obligations because we meet up with them, face to face<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.’ </span>A victim with a name, a face and a body<span class="underline">; these give the victim a change to make a disaster visible</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Meanings hide disasters and make them fit our systems of cost accounting. As the late Deng Xiaoping said of the Tiananmen Square massacre: ‘We can afford to spill a little blood [in the name of law and order].’ </span><span class="underline">In an obligation, both the addressor and the addressee must ultimately bear proper names</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is you making a claim, an ob-ligare, on me to plunge myself into y/our disaster. Obligations are communicated between proper names. </span>Proper names are the locale and limit of obligations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Proper names are the im/possibility of obligations. </span><span class="underline">It is the naked solicitations of the face of the other that disturb us. Only as proper names can we be ‘in the others shoes’, be her proxy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Obligation happens; obligation is fragile, it is on the surface, in the face, the eyes of the victims—victims with proper names. We cannot make obligation safe or strong—not secure or force its claim. </span>Every attempt to force the claim will unravel the very source of the claim. It is the nakedness, the very straightforwardness of the other’s face that disturb us, puts us into question<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The naked face of the other the ego looses it self-certain status and the self-evidence of her categories. </span>We cannot choose our obligations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, they will find us, grab us, in our Befindlichkeit. What can we do? We can sound the alarm. </span><span class="underline">We can make proper names our business, the resolution, the scale of our life. If we live on the landscape of proper names obligations will claim us</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If they do, then we ought to respond, as a proper name to a proper name, particular human being to a particular other human being, that is what obligation demands of us and what Ethics cannot do. But, what if obligation does not happen</span>:<br />
<br />
Evaluate the debate through competing speech acts; it is not enough to prove that obligations to the other may exist in some way, the affirmative burden is to prove that their speech act is beneficial to our understanding of the obligation to the other and how we must respond in a real situation, and thus is my reciprocal burden; if I prove the alternative is a better means by which we envision confronting social obligations than through the affirmative’s speech act then you vote negative. How we as subjects are positioned in debate is a prerequisite to interpreting and understanding the resolution or its implications – how we know and view the world is influenced by construction of social reality through discourses of knowledge. The offense they attempt to garner off their standard is meaningless if we do not learn how it applies to real-world decisionmaking or relating it do our own actions in regard to our moral obligation to the other. Only the representations about how the moral obligation exists in the world matter because all we really have after the round is the education we’ve gained from specific speech acts.<br />
<br />
We must reject the attempt to create a “code” or set of standards that create an obligation; instead we must break through the mediation, break through the hyperreal to get proper names and faces to which we are obligated<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Introna continues:</span><br />
If we cannot make obligation safe<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, if we do not have recourse to meta-physical categories to make the claim of obligation strong, </span>what now<span class="underline">? What may be an appropriate response. </span>I do not believe it to be of value to try and ‘code’ obligation. The flood of ethical codes<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> prepared by organizations such as the ACM and IFIP (Berleur &amp; d’Udekem- Gevers, 1996) </span>are<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in my view </span>a non-sensible response. Codes will not engender obligation—unless you put in place regimes of discipline<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Foucault, 1977) </span><span class="underline">to force it</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which have been suggested by some (Berleur &amp; d’Udekem-Gevers, 1996). </span>Even the coding of obligation into methodology<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Mumford &amp; Weir, 1979; Rogerson, 1996) </span>seems<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to me to be </span>inappropriate<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Obligation needs a face and a proper name. We must experience it not merely know it. In confronting hyperreality, we do not need rules, principles and arguments<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I believe </span>we need to get faces and proper names together, break through mediation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">— mediation of categories, principles, concepts, representation, commodities, to name a few. </span><span class="underline">We must get those who command, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">construct, recommend, and so forth </span><span class="underline">to meet face to a face with those who will be affected by their commands</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, constructions and recommendations. </span>Let flesh meet flesh. We do not need codes. We need to become involved in the world, it is in being<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—in that we will experience our being bound—</span>to<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>In our involvement obligation will happen if it will happen<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, if not then not. We cannot make it happen, it is only as strong and no more</span>.<br />

 The criticism outweighs and is a prior question to the case –<br />
1. They have no offense; moral obligations are impossible in a world that has come to be mediated by electronics, statistics, and body counts; we no longer have true moral interactions with other people in the world but come to know them as faceless numbers and statistics and masses of individuals. This negates the possibility of a moral obligation as a moral obligation can only be experienced in the event of the disaster, the event which causes us to connect to another person that the codes and rules for obligations of the AC ignores. They view obligations as a math equation in which we can use a speech act to determine under what conditions moral obligations may be acceptable, even though we are not personally in those situations, and that’s a link; the world does not exist as they would like you to believe it does; their representations of obligations come to replace what an obligation actually means to us – that’s the first Introna Card.<br />
2. They view themselves as some impartial judge of humanity capable of deciding when moral obligations are relevant and when they are not; this capability does not exist and it contributes to the existence of the hyperreal, this giant metaphorical world that comes to represent various things in society that we don’t actually learn to engage; this creation of the hyperreal and viewing those we have obligations as mere hypothetical people and statistics negate’s our ability to react in the event of the disaster, our ability to conclude that we do have an obligation to assist the other. It is things like their speech act that allows things like carpet bombings during the Gulf War, as we view individuals around the world not as actual people with names, faces, families and stories but hypothetical objects we can manipulate – that’s the second Introna card.<br />
3. Their speech act makes us complacent with the disaster; The alternative is to reject the affirmative and the conception that we can attempt to represent the suffering of the other and our response through an unrelated speech act; vote negative in realization that we cannot choose our obligations; we must reject these abstract conceptions of the obligation and realize that the obligation is what controls us, we do not control the terms of the obligation; recognize the naked face of the other that we observe suffering. The alternative is a recognition that moral obligations may exist but the methodology of the affirmative’s speech act is not the methodology by which we should go about engaging them. We need to avoid representing abstract equations and codes for obligations, that was explained above, and instead realize that the obligation will come to us in the moment of the disaster. Attempts to push the code of the obligation unravel the system because we no longer recognize the naked value of the other and why we have an obligation to them in the first place – that’s the third Introna card.<br />
4. Most importantly is the framework; evaluate the debate through competing speech acts and how they contribute to our understanding and our ability to engage the obligation to the other in need. It is not enough for the aff to prove there may be obligations; they must prove their speech act is beneficial to our understanding of the obligation; if I prove the alternative is a better means by which we envision confronting social obligations than through the aff’s speech act then you vote negative. How we as subjects are positioned in debate is a prerequisite to interpreting and understanding the resolution or its implications – how we know and view the world is influenced by construction of social reality through discourses of knowledge. The offense they’re claiming off their standard is meaningless if we do not learn how it applies to real-world decisionmaking or relating to our own decisions; all we really have after the round is our education from specific speech acts.<br />
Finally, only through breaking the attempts to make codes or standards for the existence of moral obligations can we realize that the people we have obligations to are actually real people just like us, and that in the moment of the disaster our obligation to assist them will overtake us, to let flesh meet flesh and become involved in the world – that’s the last Introna card.<br />

 The affirmative’s utopian vision of a peaceful global community where individuals will hold and fulfill moral obligations to one another is <u>impossible to realize</u>—it necessitates the scapegoating and elimination of the other in order to remove those that prevent solvency for the project. Lacanian political intervention is the only way out.<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Stavrakakis, 99</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif;"> (Yannis, <em>Lacan and the Political,</em> Visiting Professor, Department of Government, University of Essex, pages 99-100). </span><br />
<span class="underline">Our age is clearly an age of social fragmentation, political disenchantment and open cynicism</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> characterised by the decline of the political mutations of modern universalism—</span><span class="underline">a universalism that</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, by replacing God with Reason, </span><span class="underline">reoccupied the ground of a pre-modern aspiration to fully represent and master the essence and the totality of the real. On the political level </span>this<span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> universalist </span>fantasy took the form of a series of utopian constructions of a reconciled future society. The fragmentation<span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> of our present social terrain and cultural milieu </span>entails the collapse of such grandiose fantasies<span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">.1 Today, </span><span class="underline">talk about utopia is usually characterised by a certain ambiguity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. For some, of course, </span>utopian constructions are still seen as positive results<span class="underline"> of human creativity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">in the socio- political sphere: ‘utopia is the expression of a desire for a better way of being’ (Levitas, 1990:8). Other, more suspicious views, such as the one expressed in Marie Berneri’s book Journey through Utopia, warn—</span>taking into account experiences like the Second World War—of the dangers entailed in trusting the idea of a perfect<span class="underline">, ordered and regimented </span>world<span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. For some, instead of being ‘how can we realise our utopias?’, the crucial question has become ‘how can we prevent their final realisation?.... [How can] we return to a non-utopian society, less perfect and more free’ (Berdiaev in Berneri, 1971:309).2 It is particularly the political experience of these last decades that led to the dislocation of utopian sensibilities and brought to the fore a novel appreciation of human finitude, together with a growing suspicion of all grandiose political projects and the meta-narratives traditionally associated with them (Whitebook, 1995:75). All these developments, that is to say the crisis of the utopian imaginary, seem however to leave politics without its prime motivating force: the politics of today is a politics of aporia. In our current political terrain, hope seems to be replaced by pessimism or even resignation. This is a result of the crisis in the dominant modality of our political imagination (meaning utopianism in its various forms) and of our inability to resolve this crisis in a productive way.3 In this chapter, I will try to show that </span><span class="underline">Lacanian theory provides new angles through which we can reflect on our historical experience of utopia and reorient our political imagination beyond its suffocating strait-jacket.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Let’s start our exploration with the most elementary of questions: what is the meaning of the current crisis of utopia? And is this crisis a development to be regretted or cherished? In order to answer these questions </span><span class="underline">it is crucial to enumerate the conditions of possibility and the basic characteristics of utopian thinking</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. First of all it seems that </span>the need for utopian meaning arises in periods of increased<span class="underline"> uncertainty, social instability and </span>conflict<span class="underline">, when the element of the political subverts the fantasmatic stability of our political reality</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Utopias are generated by the surfacing of grave antagonisms and dislocations<span class="underline"> in the social field</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. As Tillich has put it ‘all utopias strive to negate the negative...in human existence; </span><span class="underline">it is the negative in that existence which makes the idea of utopia necessary’ </span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">(Tillich in Levitas, 1990:103). </span>Utopia<span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> then </span><span class="underline">is one of the possible responses to the ever-present negativity, to the real antagonism which is constitutive of human experience</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, from the time of More’s Utopia (1516) </span><span class="underline">it </span>is conceived as an answer to the negativity<span class="underline"> inherent in concrete political antagonism. What is</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span><span class="underline">the exact nature of this response? Utopias are images of future human communitiesin which</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> these </span><span class="underline">antagonisms</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> and the dislocations fuelling them (the element of the political) </span><span class="underline">will be</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> forever </span><span class="underline">resolved</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, leading to a reconciled and harmonious world—it is not a coincidence that, among others, Fourier names his utopian community ‘Harmony’ and that the name of the Owenite utopian community in the New World was ‘New Harmony’. As Marin has put it, </span><span class="underline">utopia</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> sets in view an imaginary resolution to social contradiction; it </span><span class="underline">is a simulacrum of synthesis which dissimulates social antagonism by projecting it onto a screen representing a harmonious and immobile equilibrium</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (Marin, 1984:61). This final resolution is the essence of the utopian promise. </span><span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">What I will try to do in this chapter is, first of all, to demonstrate the deeply problematic nature of utopian politics. Simply put, my argument will be that </span>every utopian fantasy construction needs a ‘scapegoat’ in order to constitute itself—the Nazi utopian fantasy and the production of the ‘Jew’ is a good example<span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, especially as pointed out in Žižek’s analysis.4 </span>Every utopian fantasy<span class="Emphasis2"> produces its reverse and </span>calls for its elimination<span class="underline">. </span><span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Put another way, </span>the<span class="underline"> beatific side of fantasy is coupled in utopian constructions with a horrific side, a </span>paranoid need for a stigmatised scapegoat<span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The<span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">naivety—and also the </span>danger—of utopian structures is revealed when the realisation of this fantasy is attempted<span class="underline">. It is then that </span>we are brought close to the<span class="underline"> frightening </span>kernel of the real: stigmatisation is followed by extermination.<span class="underline"> This is</span><span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> not an accident. It is </span><span class="underline">inscribed in the structure of utopian constructions; it seems to be the way all fantasy constructions work</span><span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">If in almost all utopian visions, violence and antagonism are eliminated, if </span>utopia is based on the expulsion and repression of violence<span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (this is its beatific side) </span>this is only because it owes its own creation to violence; it is sustained<span class="underline"> and fed </span>by violence<span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (this is its horrific side). </span>This repressed moment of violence resurfaces<span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, as Marin points out, </span>in the difference inscribed in the name utopia itself<span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">(Marin, 1984:110). </span><span class="underline">What we shall argue is </span>that it also resurfaces in the production of the figure of an enemy<span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. To use a phrase enunciated by the utopianist Fourier, </span><span class="underline">what is ‘driven out through the door comes back through the window’</span><span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (is not this a ‘precursor’ of Lacan’s <em>dictum</em> that ‘</span>what is foreclosed in the symbolic reappears in the real’<span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">?—VII:131).5 The work of Norman Cohn and other historians permits the articulation of a genealogy of this manichean, equivalential way of understanding the world, </span>from the great witch-hunt up to modern anti-Semitism<span class="underline">, and </span>Lacan<span class="underline">ian theory </span>can provide valuable insights<span class="underline"> into any attempt to understand the logic behind this utopian operation</span><span style="color: #141413; font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">—here the approach to fantasy developed in Chapter 2 will further demonstrate its potential in analysing our political experience. In fact, from the time of his unpublished seminar on <em>The Formations of the Unconscious,</em> Lacan identified the utopian dream of a perfectly functioning society as a highly problematic area (seminar of 18 June 1958).</span><br />
<br />
The call for a world in which obligations are concrete necessitates the elimination of those that refuse to engage in obligations to the other. And, even if they don’t claim to “fiat” a world in which obligations are mandatory to those in need, the imagination of the world alone and construction of utopia and good that would come from it is enough for a link. Their discourse and engagement of ethics creates a normative good that must be followed without exception.<br />
<br />
Lacanian politics are a genuine political alternative. If it is impossible to fully represent the real, then we have no choice but to institutionalize the Lack or design politics around doubt and uncertainity. This will result in more radically democratic politics.<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Stavrakakis, 99</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (Yannis, <em>Lacan and the Political,</em> Visiting Professor, Department of Government, University of Essex, pages p 96-98). </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">According to my reading, Bellamy, Butler and Lane are questioning the value of recognising the effects and the structural causality of the real in society; instead of the political they prioritise politics, in fact traditional fantasmatic politics. This seems to be the kernel of their argument: </span><span class="underline">Even if</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> this move is possible—</span><span class="underline">encircling the unavoidable political modality of the real—is it really desirable, is it ethically and politically satisfactory? </span>The fear<span class="underline"> behind all these statements is common; </span>it is that the stress on the political qua encounter with the real precludes the possibility of presenting a more<span class="underline"> or less </span>stable<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (present or future) </span>ground for ethics and democracy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline">that it undermines their universal character and the possibility of any final reconciliation at either the subjective or the social level</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Frosh is summarising this fear à propos of the issue of human rights</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: ‘if humanism is a fraud [as Lacan insists] and there is no fundamental human entity that is to be valued in each person [an essence of the psyche maybe?], one is left with no way of defending the “basic rights” of the individual’ (Frosh, 1987:137). In the two final chapters of this book I shall argue that the reason behind all these fears is the continuing hegemony of an ethics of harmony. Against such a position </span><span class="underline">the </span>ethics of the real entails a recognition of the irreducibility of the real and an attempt to institutionalise social lack<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Thus </span>it might be possible to achieve an ethically and politically satisfactory institution<span class="underline"> of the social field </span>beyond the fantasy of closure which has proved so<span class="underline"> problematic, if not </span>catastrophic<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In other words, </span><span class="underline">the </span>best way to organise the social might be one which recognises the<span class="underline"> ultimate </span>impossibility around which itis<span class="underline"> always </span>structured<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What could be some of the parameters of this new organisation of the social in our late modern terrain? Ulrich Beck’s theory seems to be relevant in this respect. According to our reading of Beck’s schema, </span><span class="underline">contemporary societiesare faced with</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the return of uncertainty, a return of the repressed without doubt, and </span><span class="underline">the inability of mastering the totality of the real. </span>We are forced<span class="underline"> thus </span>to recognise the ambiguity of our experience<span class="underline"> and to articulate an auto-critical position towards our ability to master the real. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is now revealed that </span><span class="underline">although </span>repressing doubt and uncertainty<span class="underline"> can provide a temporary safety of meaning, it </span>is<span class="underline"> nevertheless </span>a dangerous strategy<span class="underline">, a strategy that depends on a fantasmatic illusion. This realisation, contrary to any nihilistic reaction, is nothing but the starting point for a new form of society which is emerging</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> around us, together of course with the reactionary attempts to reinstate an ageing modernity: 96 ENCIRCLING THE POLITICAL Perhaps the decline of the lodestars of primary Enlightenment, the individual, identity, truth, reality, science, technology, and so on, is the prerequisite for the start of an alternative Enlightenment, one which does not fear doubt, but instead makes it the element of its life and survival. (Beck, 1997:161) Is it not striking that </span>Lacanian theory stands at the forefront of the struggle to make us change our minds<span class="underline"> about all these grandiose fantasies</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Beck argues that such an openness towards doubt can be learned from Socrates, Montaigne, and others; it might be possible to add Lacan to this list. In other words, doubt, which threatens our false certainties, can become the nodal point for another modernity that will respect the right to err. Scepticism contrary to a widespread error, makes everything possible again: questions and dialogue of course, as well as faith, science, knowledge, criticism, morality, society, only differently...things unsuspected and incongruous, with the tolerance based and rooted in the ultimate certainty of error. (Beck, 1997:163) In that sense, </span><span class="underline">what is at stake in our current theoretico-political terrain is not the central categories or projects of modernity per se (the idea of critique, science, democracy, etc.), but their ontological status, their foundation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">The crisis of their current foundations, weakens their absolutist character and creates the opportunity to ground them in much more appropriate foundations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Laclau, 1988a). Doubts liberate; they make things possible. First of all </span><span class="underline">the possibility of </span>a new vision for society<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>An anti- utopian vision<span class="underline"> founded on the principle ‘Dubio ergo sum’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Beck, 1997:162) closer to the subversive doubtfulness of Montaigne than to the deceptive scepticism of Descartes. Although Lacan thought that in Montaigne scepticism had not acquired the form of an ethic, he nevertheless pointed out that Montaigne is truly the one who has centred himself, not around scepticism but around the living moment of the aphanisis of the subject. And it is in this that he is fruitful, that he is an eternal guide, who goes beyond whatever may be represented of the moment to be defined as a historical turning-point. (XI:223–4) </span>This<span class="underline"> is a </span>standpoint<span class="underline"> which </span>is<span class="underline"> both </span>critical and self-critical<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: there is no foundation ‘of such a scope and elasticity for a critical theory of society 97 ENCIRCLING THE POLITICAL (which would then automatically be a self-critical theory) as doubt’ (Beck, 1997:173). Doubt, the invigorating champagne of thinking, points to a new modernity ‘more modern than the old, industrial modernity that we know. The latter after all, is based on certainty, on repelling and suppressing doubt’ (ibid.: 173). Beck asks us to fight for ‘a modernity which is beginning to doubt itself, which, if things go well, will make doubt the measure and architect of its self-limitation and self-modification’ (ibid.: 163). </span><span class="underline">He asks us</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, to use Paul Celan’s phrase, </span><span class="underline">to ‘build on inconsistencies’. This will be a modernity instituting a new politics, a politics recognising the uncertainty of the moment of the political. It will be a modernity recognising the constitutivity of the real in the social. A truly political modernity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (ibid.: 5). In the next two chapters I will try to show the way in which </span>Lacanian <span class="underline">political </span>theory can act as a catalyst for this change<span class="underline">. </span>The <span class="underline">current </span>crisis<span class="underline"> of utopian politics, instead of generating pessimism, can </span>become the starting point for a renewal of<span class="underline"> democratic </span>politics within a radically transformed ethical framework<span class="underline">.</span><br />
<br />
And, even if they win the alternative doesn’t solve, this is an independent reason to vote negative, as their assumptions about the world are not neutral. The affirmative’s ignorance of the Lack that drives their desire for action goes unrecognized and proves that their offense is not objectively true but simply a drive to constitute the ego.<br />
<br />
My interpretation---the judge should assume the position of an analyst---interrogating the aff’s <u>psychological investment</u> in the politics of the status quo should be a prior question to their advantages and solvency claims---it’s not about what the neg does it’s about what the aff needs to do better<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Now I can also answer the obvious counter-argument to this Lacanian notion of the act: if we define an act solely by the fact that its sudden emergence surprises/transforms its agent itself and, simultaneously, that it retroactively changes its conditions of (im)possibility, is not Nazism, then, an act par excellence? </span><span class="underline">Did Hitler not ‘do the impossible', changing the entire field of what was considered `acceptable' in the liberal democratic universe? </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Did not a respectable middle-class petit bourgeois who, as a guard in a concentration camp, tortured Jews, also, accomplish what was considered impossible, in his previous ‘decent’ existence and acknowledge his ‘passionate attachment’ to sadistic torture? </span><span class="underline">It is here that the notion of ‘</span>traversing the fantasy’, and<span class="underline"> - on a different level - of</span><u>transforming the constellation that generates social symptoms becomes crucial<span class="underline">. An </span>authentic act</u>disturbs the underlying fantasy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, attacking it from the point of `social symptom' (let us recall that Lacan attributed the invention of the notion of symptom to Marx!). </span><span class="underline">The</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> so-called `</span><span class="underline">Nazi revolution', with</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its disavowal/displacement of the fundamental social antagonism ('class struggle' that divides the social edifice from within) - </span><span class="underline">with its projection/externalization of the cause of social antagonisms into the figure of the Jew</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and the consequent reassertion of the corporatist notion of society as an organic Whole - clearly </span><span class="underline">avoids confrontation with social. antagonism; the ‘Nazi revolution’ is the exemplary case of a pseudo-change</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of a frenetic activity in the course of which many things did change – ‘something was going on al1 the time’ - </span><span class="underline">so that,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> precisely, something.- that which really matters - would not change; so that </span>things would fundamentally 'remain the same'<u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In short, </span><span class="underline">an authentic act is not simply external with regard to the hegemonic symbolic field disturbed by it:</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> an act is an act only with regard to some symbolic field, as intervention into it. That is to say: a symbolic field is always and by definition in itself 'decentred', structured around a central void/impossibility (a personal life-narrative, say, is a bricolage of ultimately failed attempts to come to terms with some trauma; a social edifice is an ultimately failed attempt to displace/obfuscate its constitutive antagonism); and </span><span class="underline">an act disturbs the symbolic field into which it intervenes not out of nowhere, but precisely from the standpoint of this inherent impossibility</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, stumbling block, which is its hidden, disavowed structuring principle.</span><span class="underline">In contrast to this authentic act which intervenes in the constitutive void</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, point of failure - or what Alain Badiou has called the 'symptomal torsion’ of a given constellation - </span><span class="underline">the inauthentic act legitimizes itself through reference to the point of substantial fullness of a given contellation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (on the political terrain: Race, True Religion, Nation...): it aims precisely at obliterating the last traces of the 'symptomal torsion' which disturbs the balance of that constellation. </span><span class="underline">One palpable political consequence</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of this notion of the act that has to intervene at the `symptomal torsion' of the structure (and also a proof that our position does not involve `economic essentialism') </span><span class="underline">is that in each concrete constellation there is one touchv nodal point of contention which decides where one 'truly stands'</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, </span>in the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> recent struggle of the so-called `</span>democratic opposition' in Serbia against<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span>Milosevic<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> regime, </span>the<span class="underline"> truly </span>touchy topic is the stance towards the Albanian majority<span class="underline"> in Kosovo: the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> great </span><span class="underline">majority of the `democratic opposition' unconditionally endorse Milosevic’s anti-Albanian nationalist agenda</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even accusing him of making compromises with the West and `betraying' Serb national interests in Kosovo. In the course of the student demonstrations against Milosevic's Socialist Party falsification of the election results in the winter of 1996, the Western media which closely followed events, and praised the revived democratic spirit in Serbia, rarely mentioned the fact that one of the demonstrators' regular slogans against the special police was `Instead of kicking us, go to Kosovo and kick out the Albanians!'. So - and this is my point - </span>it is<span class="underline"> theoretically as well as politically </span>wrong to claim that<span class="underline">, in today's Serbia, </span>'anti-Albanian nationalism<span class="underline">' is simply one among the `floating signifiers' that </span>can be appropriated either by Milosevic<span class="underline">'s power bloc </span>or by the opposition: the moment one endorses it, no matter how much one 'reinscribes it<span class="underline"> into the democratic chain of equivalences', </span>one<span class="underline"> already </span>accepts the terrain as defined by Milosevic, one<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - as it were - </span>is already `playing his game'<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In today's Serbia, </span>the<span class="underline"> absolute sine qua non of an </span>authentic political act would<span class="underline"> thus </span>be to reject absolutely the ideologico-political topos of the Albanian threat<span class="underline"> in Kosovo</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Psychoanalysis is aware of</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a whole series of `</span><span class="underline">false acts': psychotic-paranoiac violent passage a l'acte, hysterical acting out</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, obsessional self-hindering, perverse self-instrumentalization – all these </span><span class="underline">acts are not simply wrong according to some external standards, they are</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> immanently </span><span class="underline">wrong since they can be properly grasped only as reactions to some disavowed trauma that they displace</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, repress, and so on. </span><span class="underline">What we are tempted to say is that the Nazi anti-Semitic violence was `false' in the same way: all the shattering impact of this large-scale frenetic activity was fundamentally `misdirected'</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, it was a kind of gigantic passage a l'acte </span><span class="underline">betraying an inability to confront the real kernel of the trauma (the social antagonism</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">). So what we are claiming is that anti-Semitic violence, say, is not only `factually wrong' (Jews are `not really like that', exploiting us and organizing a universal plot) and/or ‘morally wrong’ (unacceptable in terms of elementary standards of decency, etc.), but also `untrue’ in the sense of an inauthenticity which is simultaneously epistemological and ethical, just as an obsessional who reacts to his <strong>[sic]</strong> disavowed sexual fixations by engaging in compulsive defence rituals acts in an inauthentic way. Lacan claimed that </span>even if the patient's wife is<span class="underline"> really </span>sleeping around<span class="underline"> with other men, </span>the patient's jealousy is still<span class="underline"> to be treated as </span>a pathological condition<span class="underline">;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in a homologous way, </span>even if<span class="underline"> rich </span>Jews `really' exploited German workers<span class="underline">, seduced their daughters, dominated the popular press, and so on, </span>anti-Semitism is still<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> an emphatically `</span><span class="underline">untrue', </span>pathological<span class="underline"> ideological </span>condition<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - why? </span><span class="underline">What makes it pathological is the disavowed subjective libidinal investment in the figure of the Jew – the way social </span>antagonism is <span class="underline">displaced</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">-obliterated by </span><span class="underline">being </span>'projected'<span class="underline"> into the figure of the Jew</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. So - back to the obvious counter-argument to the Lacanian notion of the act: </span><span class="underline">this second feature (for a gesture </span>to<span class="underline"> count as an act, it must </span>'traverse the fantasy') is not simply a further, additional criterion, to be added to the first<span class="underline"> ('doing the impossible', retroactively rewriting its own conditions): if this second criterion is not fulfilled, the first is not really met either - that is to say; we are not actually `doing the impossible', traversing the fantasy towards the Real. </span><br />
<br />
To create a fantasy is to view the world through a lens of the symbolic-we view things by how we express the world as language and thus how we want to see it, in line with our fantasies. This inevitably excludes those things which can't be described by language and the symbolic-those become the real. Reliance on a security worldview means other ideas that don't fit in can't be symbolized and are thus part of the lack. This means their impacts are a rigged game bc they only analyze certain facts.<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zizek 4</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif;">Slavoj, Birkbeck Institite for the Humanities, </span><span class="underline">Conversations with Zizek</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif;">, Glyn Daly, 78-79</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Here I would agree with Laclau and Mouffe’s notion that society doesn’t exist: that </span>there is no neutral<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> space, no neutral </span>reality that can be <span class="underline">first </span>objectively described<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and from which we then develop the idea of antagonism. Again, </span>this would be<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> my idea of </span>fantasy as constituting reality<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Of course Nazis are a real obstacle, but the question is why are they a real obstacle? The answer is, because they are sustained by a certain fantasmatic universe. That is to say that of course </span>you can describe the <span class="underline">way </span>Nazis are a real threat<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, how they threaten social reality for Jews, but </span>the reason they are a threat<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in reality </span>has to do with fantasies about <span class="underline">radical </span>antagonism<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this sense, the only thing I am claiming is that you cannot account for antagonism as Real in the terms of just a reflection or an effect of some conflicts in social reality. To return to the notion of the real Real and reality, the crucial point to bear in mind is that, again, the Lacanian Real is not some kind of a hard kernel: the true reality as opposed to only our symbolic fictions. This is why the notion of the imaginary Real, which I evoked before, is so important. I think that the Real is in a way a fiction; </span>Real is not some kind of<span class="underline"> raw </span>nature which is <span class="underline">then </span>symbolized<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> You symbolize nature but </span>in order to symbolize nature<span class="underline">, in this very symbolization, </span>you produce <span class="underline">an excess or </span>a lack symmetrically: and that’s the Real<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is the crucial Lacanian lesson. It’s not, as it is sometimes misrepresented, that you have—let’s call it naively pre-symbolic reality: you symbolize it and then something cannot be symbolized and that is the Real. No, this is just a kind of stupid reality; we don’t even have an ontological name for it. IT is, rather, that the very gesture of </span>symbolization introduces a gap in reality<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is this gap which is the Real and </span>every positive form of this gap is constituted through fantasy<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> So again the crucial thing is to avoid any reification of the Real. The Real can be considered almost as a topological term, a topological twist, and any substantialization of the Real is a kind of perspective illusion. Real is a purely topological category. With reference to the passage from special to general theory of relativity in Einstein, one could put in these terms: through symbolization space itself is curved, and the Real is the illusion that this curvature of the space is caused by some positive entity. But the whole point about the Real is that the impossibility is not the result of some positive obstacle, but is purely inherent: the </span>impossibility is produced as the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> very </span>condition of symbolic space<span class="underline">. </span>That is the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ultimate </span>paradox of the Real. You cannot have it all<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not because there is something opposing you, but </span>because of this<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> purely formal, </span>structurally inherent, self-blockade<span class="Emphasis2">.</span><br />
<br />
Universal ethical principles ignore the crucial Lacanian insight that desire cannot simply be ignored. Trying to renounce all desire in favor of ethics turns us into perpetual Hamlets—frozen in indecision with catastrophic results all around.<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Donahue 1</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 7pt;"> (Brian, Department of English, Gonzaga University, “Marxism, Postmodernism, Žižek,” Postmodern Culture,12.2, Project Muse) </span><br />
<span class="underline">Žižek specifies this crucial opposition between symbolic law and superego explicitly in terms of the movement from permission to obligation, from possibility based on clearly defined universal prohibition to necessity based on radical contingency</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Paradoxically, in the absence of prohibition, where one might expect the free flow of libidinal energy, superego intervenes to require what is already permitted: Law is the agency of prohibition which regulates the distribution of enjoyment on the basis of a common, shared renunciation (the &quot;symbolic castration&quot;), whereas superego marks a point at which <em>permitted</em> enjoyment, freedom-to-enjoy, is reversed into <em>obligation</em> to enjoy--which, one must add, is the most effective way to block access to enjoyment. (<em>For They</em> 237). </span>It is because of this obscene<span class="underline">, harsh, punitive </span>quality of the superego that the subject can never settle accounts with it<span class="underline">. </span>There is always more that can be sacrificed<span class="underline">, Žižek explains, </span>which is why Lacanian<span class="underline"> psychoanalytic </span>ethics is based<span class="underline"> explicitly </span>on opposing<span class="underline"> the </span>coercion of the superego<span class="underline">, in contrast to the ordinary association of superego with &quot;conscience&quot; or the moral sense guiding ethical behavior</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">: Lacan's maxim of the ethics of psychoanalysis (&quot;not to compromise one's desire&quot;) is <em>not</em> to be confounded with the pressure of the superego.... Lacan takes seriously and literally the Freudian &quot;economical paradox&quot; of the superego--that is, the vicious cycle that characterizes the superego: the more we submit ourselves to the superego imperative, the greater its pressure, the more we feel guilty. According to Lacan, this &quot;feeling of guilt&quot; is not a self-deception to be dispelled in the course of the psychoanalytic cure--we really <em>are</em> guilty: superego draws the energy of the pressure it exerts upon the subject from the fact that the subject was not faithful to his desire, that he gave it up. Our sacrificing to the superego, our paying tribute to it, only corroborates our guilt. For that reason our debt to the superego is unredeemable: the more we pay it off, the more we owe. (<em>Metastases</em> 67-68) Indeed, </span><span class="underline">Lacan's ethical imperative must be taken as </span>explicitly opposed to the concept of conventional morality with its focus on maximizing the Good,<span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> which functions as the arbiter of all action, </span>since this model<span class="Emphasis2"> ultimately </span>leads to a psychological paralysis arising from infinite consideration of ramifications<span class="underline">, a process </span>that turns the subject into a perpetual Hamlet<span class="underline">, standing behind Claudius but unable to decide whether killing him or not killing him would be the better option. The interminable process of trying to decide which course of action leads to the &quot;greater Good&quot; entails its own kind of choice </span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">(that is, to &quot;compromise one's desire&quot; by default</span><span class="underline">) with its own kind of psychic consequences</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> for the subject. Žižek explains this ethical-moral distinction through a Greimasian semiotic square based on the four possible arrangements of the positive and negative versions of these terms and the figures corresponding to the four pairings--moral, ethical (Saint); immoral, unethical (Scoundrel); immoral, ethical (Hero); and moral, unethical (superego)--and endorses the Lacanian championing of Hero over superego (<em>Metastases</em> 67). Žižek also anticipates the anxious objection that this Lacanian ethical attitude is too radical in its practical implications: is it reasonable to propose that everyone unrelentingly pursue his or her own desire and renounce all other considerations</span><span class="underline">? Don't &quot;ordinary&quot; people need an &quot;ethics of the 'common Good</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">,'... despicable as it may appear in the eyes of the suicidal heroic ethics advocated by Lacan?&quot; (<em>Metastases</em> 69). </span><span class="underline">But he concludes that this concern--&quot;What if everyone were to do the same as me?&quot;--is simply another way of introducing the &quot;pathological consideration of the </span><em><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">consequences</span></em><span class="underline"> of our act in reality&quot; and therefore functions as a way of imposing superego injunctions, restraints, and cycles of guilt through the insistence that we renounce our desire precisely because it cannot be universalized</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">(69).</span><br />

 <br />
The criticism outweighs and is a prior question to the case –<br />
<br />
First is the link debate –<br />
<br />
1. The idea that there could possibly be a world in which individuals unquestionably hold moral obligations to one another is pure fantasy; it is a hope that can never be realized as it ignores what Lacan termed the Real, inherent societal problems and people’s invested interests that prevent any radical ideal such as this from happening. People are raised in different backgrounds and hold different values as important; the idea that everyone could get along under the common obligation is ridiculous and creates the idea of the Fantasy, the blanket the affirmative puts over the problems in the world to cover them up and say “oh everything will be ok.” – that’s Stavrakakis.<br />
<br />
2. The idea of a universal ethic is a link – the maximization of a single ethic leads to infinite questioning and psychological determination of what could possibly be a result of every action and the infinite possible actions that could maximize this ethic, resulting in psychological paralysis as people turn into perpetual hamlets. That’s an independent reason to reject the affirmative, as individuals would not actually uphold their obligations to one another in their world; infinite calculations would go into what the consequences of upholding or not upholding obligations would be, preventing any action. – that’s Stavrakakis.<br />
<br />
Second is the impacts –<br />
<br />
1. It turns the aff and negates their offense; the arguments in the AC are not objectively true but carefully constructed representations of society and its individuals, the representations as to how people act and how they would conform under the resolution are representations of the fantasy; there are inherent blockades preventing the aff from gaining knowledge about other societies or people different from us and seeing the world as a whole, meaning there’s no risk that their knowledge is objective or true – that’s Zizek.<br />
<br />
2. It is the precondition for genocide; the fact that people hold different values and beliefs means that people would inevitably dissent to the world of the affirmative, just as people resent to various societal guidelines in the status quo. The only way the affirmative could get rid of the dissenters to create a space for solvency is to wipe them out; the best example is World War 2, the Nazis envisioned a perfect world in which everybody got along and was happy, but when not everything worked they had to create a scapegoat for the problems, which was the Jews taking everybody’s money; that resulted in the Holocaust and ensuing world war. The same applies to the aff, in order to realize their project they would have to wipe out dissenters and create scapegoats whenever a problem arose – that’s Stavrakakis.<br />
<br />
Finally is the alternative;<br />
<br />
The alternative is to engage in a Lacanian psychoanalytic politics, to realize that the envisioning of individuals always prioritizing moral obligations to those in need and following those obligations is totally illogical and an engagement of the Fantasy; instead we must try to engage the Real, realizing that there are inevitably going to be dissenters to this process, and instead of just imagining these inherent problems in society explained on the link debate are not there and we can just cover them up, that instead we should engage them and work around them as best we can. This anti-utopian vision is key to creating a new type of political and ethical process in which we realize that utopia is impossible and the assumptions such as those in the AC get us nowhere; it is a prerequisite to the ethical advantages of the AC.
