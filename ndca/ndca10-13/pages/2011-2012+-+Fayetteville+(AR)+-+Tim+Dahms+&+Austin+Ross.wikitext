INHERENCY -

The budget for environmental monitoring satellites is being cut now, crushing our ability to respond to environmental problems –

PLAN: The United States federal government should substantially increase its development of space beyond the Earth's mesosphere by increasing funding to NASA's Earth Observation System in order to launch environmental monitoring satellites. Funding will be ten billion dollars through normal means, we claim the right to fiat. We'll clarify if needed.

SPACE HISTORY -

Understanding and evaluating space policy requires genealogical reading of the history of the legal regimes and policy projects that construct “outer space” as an object of development.
U.S. policymakers experienced the launch of Sputnik as a scientific and legal crisis.
Legal codification of outer space as an object for capitalist development attempted to resolve the problem outer-space posed for nation-state sovereignty.
Beebe, '99 (Barton Law @ NYU ’99 “Law's Empire and the Final Frontier: Legalizing the Future in the Early Corpus Juris Spatialis” Yale Law Journal 108 (7) p. 1758-1763)

Outer space represented a challenge to the concept of property – Infinite amounts of land unclaimed for billions of years with no practical way of exerting ownership. Thus, U.S. space policy was based on an epistemology of enclosure. United States administrations argued that outer space should be considered “empty space” – unclaimed by an existing state but subject to enclosure –
Milun, 2010 (Kathryn, Anthropology/Sociology @ Minnesota Duluth 2010 The Political Uncommons: the cross-cultural logic of the global commons p.)

And, this reflects a larger shift, as common property resources are being enclosed and privatized all around the world.
Heynen, '05 (Nik Heynen and Paul Robbins, “The Neoliberalization of Nature: Governance, Privatization, Enclosure and Valuation,” 5/2005, Center for Public Ecology, http://www.forumonpublicdomain.ca/sites/forumonpublicdomain.ca/files/neoliberalizationofnature.pdf)

SPACE DOMINANCE

The narrative of outer-space as empty space produces an American space policy dedicated to national conquest, dominance, and technological control. Nationalist goals and achievements frame American space policy discussions.
Siddiqi, 2010 History Assistant Professor, Fordham University 2010 Asif, Technology and Culture, Volume 51, Number 2, April 2010, pp. 425-430

The nationalistic drive for full-spectrum dominance of space reduces space to another area for militaristic conquest. In the name of nationalism, the state is permanently mobilized to achieve domination, reducing the public to a state of Bare Life and constant warfare -
Peoples, '09 — Columba Peoples, Lecturer in International Relations in the School of Sociology, Politics and International Studies at the University of Bristol, holds a Ph.D. from the University of Wales, 2007 ("Haunted Dreams: Critical Theory, Technology and the Militarization of Space," Securing Outer Space: International Relations Theory and the Politics of Space, Edited by Natalie Bormann and Michael Sheehan, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415460565)

Full-spectrum dominance of outer space results in a consequent militarization of inner space where every person on earth becomes a participant in the global production of violence – this both drains life of any value and creates a constant cycle of confilct -
Orr, '04 [Jackie, Department of Sociology at Syracuse University, “The Militarization of Inner Space,” in Critical Sociology 30.2]

SPACE ECONOMICS

The epistemology of enclosure makes possible capitalist expansion into space. Facing the crises that come with the inherently unsustainable nature of capitalism, capitalists seek a short-term fix by expanding into outer space –
Dickens, 2010 (Peter Dickens, “The Humanization of the Cosmos—To What End?”, 1 November 2010, Monthly Review, http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end)

The epistemology of enclosure is what makes capitalist commodification of the commons possible – this allows for infinite commodification, culminating in extinction –
Johnston, '03 (Josée, Associate Professor of Sociology at the U. of Toronto, Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, “Who Cares about the Commons?” December 2003)

And, capitalism is an inherently dehumanizing force that reduces life to a resource, destroying its value –
Marsh, '95 (James, Professor of Philosophy at Fordham University, PhD from Northwestern University, Critique Action and Liberation, pg. 277)

Capitalism necessitates constant war – it's the root cause of violence –
Magdoff and Magdoff in ‘05 Harry Magdoff and Fred Magdoff editor of Monthly Review And professor of plant and soil science at the University of Vermont in Burlington “Approaching Socialism” http://www.monthlyreview.org/0705magdoffs1.htm pg.1

These inevitable wars go nuclear –
Webb, '04 (Sam, masters in econ at uconn, “War, Capitalism, and George W. Bush.” <http://www.pww.org/article/view/4967/1/207/O/>)

TEXT: the United States federal government should respect outer space as a universal commons. We'll clarify.

CONTENTION FOUR IS ALSO ABOUT SPACE

Embracing the civil commons is the best way to combat capitalism – we provide a specific, pragmatic alternative – recognition of space and the environment as commons challenges capitalism at a fundamental level –
Johnston, '03 (Josée JOHNSTON, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Toronto, 2003, Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, “Who Cares about the Commons?” December 2003)

Challenging the U.S.F.G. to respect the principle of Common Heritage is a productive political project. Resisting co-option is the only way to achieve radical change –
Falk, 2000 (Richard, Woodrow Wilson School @ Princeton, “Human Governance for the World: Reviving the Quest” Review of International Political Economy

Space policy is a productive starting point for an alternative politics of the commons. Respecting space as Common Heritage commits us to equal distribution of common resources. Voting affirmative articulates a new anti-imperialist legal epistemology.
Milun, 2010 (Kathryn Professor of Anthropology/Sociology @ Minnesota Duluth, The Political Uncommons: the cross-cultural logic of the global commons p. 147-149)

SPACE POLITICS

The affirmative is fundamentally a question of how we approach the topic. We must affirm space as a commons in order to foster meaningful debate about space development –
Dietrich, '02 George B. Founder and President of SPACE Canada, Institute of Air and Space Law, McGill University, “Extending the Principle of the Common Heritage of Mankind to Outer Space”, July, 2002, http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&dvs=1309455662625~871,

And, now is key—we are at a tipping point. Either you vote aff to endorse a critical cosmopolitanism or you cede control of outer space to the neo-cons.
Dickens, '07 – Professors at the University of Essex (Peter and James Ormrod, August 2007, “Outer Space and Internal Nature: Towards a Sociology of the University” Sociology volume 41 number 4)

Our framework is to put how we conceptualize space first – the epistemology of enclosure has led to the property-minded discourse dominating space policy in the status quo –
Stuart, '09 – Fellow in Global Politics in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics and Political Science (Jill, “Unbundling sovereignty, territory and the state in outer space Two approaches” From Securing Outer Space, Edited by Borrman and Sheean—Chapter 1)




=Negative= 
==ORIENTALISM K== 
The affirmative's discourse is trapped within the mindset of Orientalism – the idea that the world is divided into two distinct parts – the rational, saving West; and the barbarian, violent East. The affirmative empowers a new Orientalism – a view of the world where the West is inherently superior, and in the name of world peace colonize and wage war upon the East -
Crooke, ‘06 (Alastair, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union, August 31, “The "New Orientalism"”

The affirmative engages in a politics of difference in which prevention is based on seeing culture as the source of danger through their orientalist ideals – this reduces the citizen to a state of bare life -
Jabri, '06 (Professor of International Politics and the Director of the Centre for International Relations at the King’s College London Vivienne, “War, Security and the Liberal State” Security Dialogue
<span style="background-color: #edeff4; color: #3b5998; display: block; font-family: 'lucida grande',tahoma,verdana,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;">[[@http://sdi.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/37/1/47]]</span>

Our alternative is to reject the 1AC's flawed epistemology grounded in Orientalism – This is key to anything resembling solvency, be it the Alternative or the the plan – only by problematizing the East vs. West discourse through our advocacy can we open up space for new approaches in international relations -
Said, ‘03 (Edward, Orientalism. Penguin Books)

==COMMONS K== 
Outer space represented a challenge to the concept of property – to solve this, U.S. space policy was based on an epistemology of enclosure, wherein outer space was considered “empty space” – unclaimed by an existing state but subject to enclosure –
Milun, 2010 (Kathryn, Anthropology/Sociology @ Minnesota Duluth 2010 The Political Uncommons: the cross-cultural logic of the global commons p.)

The alternative is an epistemological rethinking of American space policy. By rejecting the epistemology of enclosure we can embrace an alternative politics of the commons and challenge capitalism at a fundamental level – Embracing the civil commons is the best way to combat capitalism – we provide a specific, pragmatic alternative
