**Naughton 3**, Col. James Naughton, Army Materiel Command, “Briefing on Depleted Uranium”, March 14, 2003, Url: [[http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2058]] 
<span style="margin-right: 0.2in;">I'm Colonel Jim Naughton from Army Materiel Command. I am currently the director for munitions in that organization. I have been involved in developing and buying munitions most of my military career. We have several branches of service that use depleted uranium. We have used it for about two decades. Next chart please. **__During the Gulf War, we fired ammunition weighing approximately <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">320 tons</span>. That <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">sounds like an awful lot of depleted uranium, but when you actually put it together and measure it, it's a cube about eight feet on the side. </span>__**__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">It isn't really a lot of material</span>__**__. Depleted uranium is very heavy. That's one of the things that makes it good for use in ammunition and armor, so it doesn't take up a lot of space.__**</span>

A. Interpretation: The affirmative should specify the branch of government that implements their plan
B. Violation: They don’t 

C. Vote Negative— 
<span style="line-height: 150%;"> 1.Kills CP ground. <span style="font-weight: normal;">Lack of specification destroys agent CP ground which is core negative ground. Also key to in depth education about the opportunity costs of agency implemtation. This is critical civic education and is a key internal link to all their educational claims </span></span>
<span style="line-height: 150%;"> 2. Crushes solvency debates—<span style="font-weight: normal;">no in-depth solvency debates about the who, what, when, and hows of the plan. Some of these agencies are better able to solve an aff than others. </span></span>
<span style="line-height: 150%;"> 3. Lack of specification is severance—<span style="font-weight: normal;">allows them to say not us—allows them to jack our link grd to agency DA’s that is core topic ground and makes the plan a moving target. This jacks education and fairness and makes debate boring—leaves us with statism args. </span></span>
