==Federal Reserve Affirmative - GFCA State, UGA==

===1AC — Plan===

The Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve should substantially invest in transportation infrastructure in the United States.

If you went out this morning and saw hundreds of people … increase hours for existing workers.

It’s become conventional wisdom: when the economy falters … continue to take the slow, winding road forward.

Third, infrastructure — the plan is crucial to revitalize transportation infrastructure — its deterioration crushes the economy.
