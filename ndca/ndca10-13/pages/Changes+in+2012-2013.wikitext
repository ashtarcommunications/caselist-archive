There are no major changes for the 2012-2013 season. A few points of emphasis:

**1. Please treat this space with respect**. It is not a bulletin board or forum. Vandalism will not be tolerated. Coaches will be contacted about students that abuse this resource.

**2. Please follow the naming convention carefully**. It is not hard, but it is important. If you do not know what you are doing or cannot take the time to read the instructions carefully, please do not edit the wiki; ask a more competent or considerate friend for help. 

**3. Membership remains required**. If you do not already have an account on the wiki, please register for one. Non-members or anonymous visitors cannot edit the wiki because of vandalism and spam issues.

If you find this resource useful, please consider joining the NDCA to help support it.
