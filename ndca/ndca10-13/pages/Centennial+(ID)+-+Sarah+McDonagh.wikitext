Due to the fact that it's not a community norm in the piece of national circuit that I traverse/my teammates have expressly stated that they do not want their arguments disclosed and we construct things communally (sort of) I'm not going to disclose arguments at this time. However, I think debate is an educational activity first and I think disclosure makes for better debates/education or something, so we might put the thesis of each argument we read on here after UPS. If you have a particularly compelling reason why disclosure in the PNW is required/good, or want cites, email me.
