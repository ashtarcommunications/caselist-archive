<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">If you've ever played with magnets, you know that opposite poles attract and like poles repel each other. This is the basic principle behind electromagnetic propulsion. Electromagnets are similar to other magnets in that they attract metal objects, but the magnetic pull is temporary. As you can read about in [[http://science.howstuffworks.com/electromagnet.htm|How Electromagnets Work]], you can easily create a small electromagnet yourself by connecting the ends of a copper wire to the positive and negative ends of an AA, C or D-cell [[http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/battery.htm|battery]]. This creates a small magnetic field. If you disconnect either end of the wire from the battery, the magnetic field is taken away. The magnetic field created in this wire-and-battery experiment is the simple idea behind a maglev train rail system. There are three components to this system: A large electrical power source Metal coils lining a guideway or trackLarge guidance …</span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> in just over two hours.</span>__
