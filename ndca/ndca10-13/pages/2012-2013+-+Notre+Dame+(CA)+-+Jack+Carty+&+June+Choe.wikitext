**Congestion prevents economic growth and damages competitiveness**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Concerns over the state of U.S. transportation infrastructure are higher on the federal policy agenda than at any time... </span>an opportunity exists to marry shorter-term job creation with investments that will pay long<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">er</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">-</span>term benefits to U.S.<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">economic</span>competitiveness.

//U.S. manufacturers are not likely to decide to reenter the market <span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">and manufacture railcars </span>unless the U.S. Government <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(like other major Western countries and Japan)</span> assures a stable, predictable, and planned <span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;">rail equipment</span> market...<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There is significant innovation occurring in both the bus and rail production industries.</span>//

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The preoccupation of states with </span>securing<span style="font-size: 8pt;">the reliability of</span>energy<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> through exploration and extraction might seem benign enough (leaving aside for a moment the weighty issues of diminishing and increasingly remote supplies)...

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; text-align: left;">Thus, the United States federal government should substantially increase its mass transit infrastructure investment in the United States.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">APTA’s highest priority continues to be the enactment of a well-funded, multi-modal surface transportation authorization bill... it is essential to enhancing our nation’s mobility, accessibility and economic prosperity, while promoting energy conservation and environmental quality.</span>
