Being passionately curious about the market’s behavior, he uses his statistical and financial background to question the common views and profit on the misconceptions. “Don’t fight the emotionality on the market -- take advantage of it!” is one of his favorite mottos. His time is divided mainly among analyzing various markets with emphasis on the precious metals, managing his own portfolio, writing commentaries and essays, and developing financial software. Most of the time he’s got left is spent on reading everything he can about the markets, psychology, philosophy, and statistics. Radomski started investigating the markets for his private use well before starting his professional career. He used to work as an informatics consultant, but this time-consuming profession left him little time for his true passion -- the interdisciplinary market analysis. Establishing www.SunshineProfits.com gave him the opportunity to put his thoughts, ideas, and experience into a form available to other investors.
