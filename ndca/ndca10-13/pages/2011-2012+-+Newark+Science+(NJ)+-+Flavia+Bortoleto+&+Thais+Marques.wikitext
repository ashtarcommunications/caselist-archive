<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times;">From Sept. 5-8, sunspot 1283 produced four big flares and three CMEs.</span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8pt;"> Two of the flares were X-class events and two were M-class flares. (Strong solar flares are classified accordingto a three-tiered system: X-class are the most powerful, M-class are of medium strength and C-class are the weakest.) While the rapid motion previously observed in sunspot 1283 seems to have died down a bit, Young said, the sunspot looks poised to erupt again sometime soon. "There's a good probability that we're still going to seeat least another M-class flare, possibly another X-class flare," Young told SPACE.com. It's not uncommon for sunspots to pop off a number of powerful flares in quick succession the way 1283 has done, he added. That seems to be the natural order of things. "</span><span style="font-family: Times;">When you see one big flare, your chances of seeing another one are pretty good</span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8pt;">," Young said.

CMEs have even greater destructive potential; they can spawn geomagnetic storms that disrupt GPS signals, radio communications and power grids. [Sun's Wrath: Worst Solar Storms in History] So researchers are working hard to better understand sun storms, with the aim of one day being able to predict them with a great deal of accuracyand a long lead time. But they're not there yet. "We still have a long way to go to really have the kind of forecasting capabilities that we have with terrestrial weather," Young said. That's not to say scientists aren't making progress. Indeed, they've learned a lot about solar eruptions lately, Young said. And the knowledge base will continue to grow, he added, as a fleet of sun-watching spacecraft beam home more and more observations of Earth's star. "We're really in a great time right now in terms of the data that we have," Young said, citing the contributions of spacecraft such as NASA's STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory, as well as SOHO, a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency. "It's going to be pretty exciting, from a solar physics and a space weather point of view." All of these eyes on the sun should be treated to quite a show over the next several years. </span><span style="font-family: Times;">Solar activity has been ramping up over the last few months as the sun works toward a maximum in its 11-year activitycycle.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but </span>**__because a world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts. Finally, </span>**__U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

===Norms against ASAT attacks must be re-emboldened, failure will collapse nuclear deterrence and make full scale space attacks inevitable=== 
Black 8 (Samuel is a Research Associate with the Space Security project at the Stimson Center, Protect Satellites Against Harmful Interference, July 07, http://www.stimson.org/spotlight/protect-satellites-against-harmful-interference-/)
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Throughout the history of the space age, </span>there has been no record of a satellite being interfered with during a crisis<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or in warfare. </span>This norm is in need of reinforcement<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Bush administration and the Russian government have withdrawn from treaties that include pledges against harmful interference; other treaties with this provision have expired. Meanwhile, China and the United States have carried out destructive A-Sat testing. The U.S. test in February employed a ballistic missile defense system converted for use against satellites. Major spacefaring nations already have multiple means to harm satellites, which can help deter the initiation of harmful interference against satellites in crises or warfare. No further A-Sat tests are required to prove this point. </span>The first case of satellite interference<span style="font-size: 8pt;">in times of crisis or war </span>is unlikely to be the last<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Latent A-Sat capabilities can serve as a deterrent against cheating. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In the event that any state breaks its pledge </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">not to engage in harmful interference, </span>that state is likely to invite unfortunate consequences. Satellites are a force multiplier and are invaluable to technologically advanced military forces<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>If satellite interference becomes the norm<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in crises and warfare</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span>advanced spacefaring nations stand to lose the benefits that satellites provide<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.Satellites are used by militaries for communication and early warning purposes, both of which are </span>vital<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> for nuclear deterrence. If satellites are targeted in crises and warfare, breakdowns in deterrence could occur. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Interference with satellites would change the conduct of warfare. It is impossible to predict with certainty what the resulting consequences would be, but it is safe to conclude that </span>the country that relies upon satellites the most, the United States, would suffer the most if satellites become acceptable target<span style="font-size: 8pt;">s. Furthermore, </span>widespread interference with satellites would hinder the peaceful uses of outer space. If debris is created, the risk of catastrophic damage to satellites increases.

===Credible ASAT threats increase likelihood of escalation=== 
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Lewis 2004 (</span>Jeffrey, Center for defense information,“What if Space Were Weaponized? Possible Consequences for Crisis Scenarios,” http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/scenarios.pdf accessed 10-29-9 rmg)
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Perhaps most worrisome</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, the United States might be</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> blithely </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">unawareof the degree to which the Russians were concerned about its actions and inadvertently escalate a crisis</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. During the early 1980s, the Soviet Union suffered a major “war scare” during which time its leadership concluded that bilateral relations were rapidly declining. This war scare was driven in part by the rhetoric of the Reagan administration, fortified by the selective reading of intelligence. During this period, NATO conducted a major command post exercise, Able Archer, that caused some elements of the Soviet military to raise their alert status. American officials were stunned to learn, after the fact, that the Kremlin had been acutely nervous about an American first strike during this period.56 All of these incidents have a common theme – that confidence is often the difference between war and peace. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In times of crisis, false alarms can have a momentum of their own</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As in the second scenario in this monograph, t</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">he lesson is that commanders rely on the steady flow of reliable information. When that information flow is disrupted– whether by a deliberate attack or an accident – confidence collapses and the result is panic and escalation.Introducing ASAT weapons into this mix is all the more dangerous</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, because such weapons target the elements of the command system that keep leaders aware, informed and in control. As a result, the mere presence of such weapons is corrosive to the confidence that allows national nuclear forces to operate safely.</span>

U.S. space warriors<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> now have a doctrine and plans for counterspace operations, but they </span>do not have a credible plan to stop inadvertent or uncontrolled escalation once the shooting starts<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Like U.S. war-fighting scenarios, there is a huge chasm between plans and consequences, in which</span>requirements for escalation dominance make uncontrolled escalation far more likely. A pre-emptive strike in space on a nation that possesses nuclear weapons would invite the gravest possible consequences.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Attacks on satellites that provide early warning and other critical military support functions would most likely be viewed either as a surrogate or as a prelude to attacks on nuclear forces.</span>

===Nuclear deterrence is key to hedge against transition wars and great power conflicts it creates a background of stability that facilitates economic integration and peace.=== 
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Morgan et al. 2009 </span>(Patrick, political science professor at UC “Complex Deterrence: Strategy in the Global Age”, pg 9-11, ldg)
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Among the great powers (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council), </span>nuclear weapons are largely seen as a hedge against the emergence of great-power conflict in the future.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The great-power relationships in the post-cold war era are characterized by “recessed general deterrence,” or dissuasion, in which states do not expect immediate militarized conflict, but weapons are kept in the background as insurance given the inherent uncertainties of world politics. The end of the cold war witnessed substantial changes in the deterrence dynamics involving great powers, and, as a result, general deterrence and dissuasion became operational concept. Although they do not maintain large arsenals, the United States nor Russia is presumed to hold automatic launch-on-warning attack plans anymore, although some of the elements of the previous era are continuing. In addition, they have reduced the number of weapons they possess, although the numbers still exceed a minimum nuclear deterrence posture. The tree other old nuclear power China, the United Kingdom, and France, also have been maintaining their smaller arsenals, but this might change as Chinese nuclear force modernization plans come to fruition in the coming decades. </span>The logic behind the maintenance of nuclear capabilities is that the great powers want to be prepared in case their relations deteriorate in the future<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Nuclear capability can also be construed as an assurance against the expansionist pathologies of great powers as described in perspectives such as offensive realism. Moreover, uncertainties in Russia and China give pause to Western nuclear powers, while, for Moscow, the fear of American influence in its former spheres in Eastern Europe and Central Asia is the cardinal source of anxiety</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For the rising power, China, nuclear weapons offer a major insurance against direct assault on its strategic sphere, allowing it to rise peacefully. </span>Nuclear weapon<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">s also </span>offer a limited but crucial deterrent against potential conflict escalation between the United States and China involving Taiwan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The great-power deterrence calculations are thus based on “recessed general deterrence” as well as “existential deterrence”: no immediate expectations of war exist among them. However, as Patrick Morgan states, </span>“if serious conflicts emerge again, then deterrence will be in vogue<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if not, at least for a lengthy period, then deterrence will operate offstage, held in reserve, and will not be the cornerstone of security management for the system.” This does not mean that the relations in the US-Russia and US-China dyads would remain the same in the long run. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Power transition has invariably been turbulent in the international system, and herein lies the role that nuclear weapons may play in deterring a transition war</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. US-Russia relations could deteriorate, and deterrence could become more relevant if tensions build up over the establishment of missile defenses in Eastern Europe and over Russian efforts to repudiate major arms-control agreements in its effort to regain its lost superpower status. As discussed in Morgan and Paul’s chapter in this volume, nuclear deterrence in this context has offered the major powers greater maneuverability. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It has allowed the major power states to sustain their credentials system managers and has prevented the emergence of active security dilemmas among them that can be caused by conventional arms races and technological breakthroughs. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Absent the fear of existential wars, the potentially rival states have engaged in greater economic interactions. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The increasing trade relations between the United States and China and China and India, an emerging power, suggest that general nuclear deterrence may offer economic spin-off benefits.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> To some extent, the stability in relations among the great powers, with no war in sight between them, points to the pacifying role that nuclear weapons may be playing, although other causes are present as well. </span>In that sense nuclear weapons may act as crucial factors in preventing a power transition war akin to those that the world experienced in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For Russia, the superpower that declined nuclear deterrence offers an opportunity not to be excessively alarmed by the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">5. If the measures described above (all of which can be said to constitute a deterrence by denial strategy) fail, or are not sufficient in response to more gratuitous attacks against satellite systems, then a deterrence by punishment strategy can be exercised.

This is not to say that the U.S. should not target adversary satellite systems — it is not too difficult to envision circumstances where, for example, an adversary reconnaissance satellite poses a threat to deployed U.S. forces and therefore must be neutralized. </span>

Furthermore, given the fact that under current political and geostrategic circumstances the U.S. weaponization of space is highly unlikely, how can U.S. policy makers deter attacks on U.S. satellite systems when the very satellites in question have little, if any, coercive capability? In fact there are a number of </span>measures<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that can be undertaken </span>that can<span style="font-size: 8pt;">both </span>deny the ability of an adversary tocause catastrophic damage to U.S. space power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>and also lend credibility to any U.S. threat to respond <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to an attack on U.S. satellite systems using military and diplomatic means. </span>These measures<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> are </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">as follows: </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">1</span>. Deny the adversary the benefits of attacking U.S. satellite systems by installing<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> whenever possible </span>passive defenses on satellites, such as hardening againste<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">lectromagnetic </span>p<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ulse </span>attacks, measures to make jamming more difficult, and ablative shielding to help satellites both withstand attacks and survive space debris impacts<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Eventually, as individual threats become more defined, active defenses should also be seriously considered. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">2. In tandem with passive defenses, develop and accelerate programs for rapid launch of satellites to reconstitute lost systems, and to bolster constellations in times of crisis</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Also needed are spare satellites in storage that can be launched at short notice. While the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program is seeking to address these issues with the use of small satellites, efforts should also be made to speed-up the time it takes to place large satellites in orbit. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">3. Prioritize space situational awareness programs</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in order to build as quickly as possible a comprehensive picture of the space environment. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If policy makers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and commanders </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">possess the ability to differentiate between purposeful attacks and natural environmental hazards then the potential for misperception and miscalculation is dramatically reduced. Furthermore, </span>effective deterrence is strengthened by the fact that space situational awareness could potentially indicate the nature and origins of any attempted attack on a satellite.

===U.S. countermeasures reduces the benefits of developing and deploying ASATs=== 
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Kosiak 2007</span> (Steven M. vice President, Budget Studies, at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, Arming the Heavens: A Preliminary Assessment of the Potential Cost and Cost-Effectiveness of Space-Based Weapons,” Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments http://www.csbaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2007.10.31-Spaced-Based-Weapons.pdf)
Rather than attempting to protect US<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and other </span>satellites by destroying enemy ASAT capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, through the use of bodyguard satellites or other means, a wide range of </span>passive countermeasures could be employed<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Some of these countermeasures are truly “passive,” </span>such as satellite hardening<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">while others require some activity by the satellite (such as </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">maneuvering</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">), but are passive in the sense that their effectiveness does not turn on an ability to destroy the threatening ASAT system. As noted earlier, no attempt is made in this chapter to estimate the cost of developing and applying most of these countermeasures—among other things because of the highly classified nature of these programs and activities, and the lack of even very rough open-source estimates of their potential costs and cost-effectiveness. While this may limit the usefulness of this discussion, it is nevertheless important to understand, at least conceptually, the range of passive countermeasures that are available. Although a number of these countermeasures were mentioned in the previous chapter of this report, most of that earlier discussion focused on the cost of acquiring and supporting various space-based weapon systems (as well as terrestrialbased alternatives) in the absence of such countermeasures. Not all of the countermeasures noted below would, in all cases, prove costeffective means of protecting satellites—much would depend on the specific details of the satellites to be protected, the countermeasures to be employed and the ASAT weapon thought to pose a threat. But under some circumstances, each of them could prove cost-effective. Moreover</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, this approach might prove especially cost-effective if some combination of these countermeasues were employed.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is impossible, in the absence of a much more detailed analysis (perhaps including access to classified data), to estimate whether, or to what extent, the use of some combination of passive countermeasures could provide a cost-effective counter to an enemy’s ASAT capabilities (or provide greater protection, at lower cost, than bodyguard satellites). However, it seems reasonable to conclude that any analysis that assumed some </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">use of passive countermeasures would drive up the costs of acquiring and supporting various ASAT capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—above, and perhaps far above, the estimates provided in the preceding chapter. As noted below, it is also important to understand that, just as countries with extensive and sophisticated space, and space-tracking, capabilities are likely to be able to deploy more effective ASAT weapons than countries with more primitive space-related capabilities, the former are also likely to be able to employ passive countermeasures to protect satellites much more effectively. Put another way, in many cases,</span>passive countermeasures that might be ineffective if used against a sophisticated space-faring country could be highly effective if employed against the ASAT capabilities most likely to be acquired by countries with less developed space capabilities.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Since the United States has by far the world’s largest and most modern and effective network of space tracking assets, it possesses an especially important advantage in this area.</span>

===Plan makes attack on space assets inconceivable===

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Instead, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is likely that </span>the greatest improvements in the security of valuable U.S. space assets will be achieved by making the satellites less vulnerable to attack <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">making them less valuable. </span>Hardening important satellites could make attacking them more difficult<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while satellite miniaturization is making it increasingly possible to eliminate existing vulnerabilities altogether by making satellite systems more distributed and redundant, with more smaller satellites doing the same jobs as fewer large, expensive ones.[31] As this shift continues, there will be fewer and fewer opportunities for attacks on a single satellite, or even several, to cause the sort of widespread disruption that has occasionally occurred in the past due to mechanical failures of critical satellites.[32] In short, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is both desirable and likely that communications and other </span>satellites<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> will gradually </span>become<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> more like the U.S. interstate highway system: economically vital to the nation, but </span>hardly worth the trouble of attacking because its resilience and redundancy means that none of its individual components is critical<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Try and pursue a strategy of deterrence by denial. Deny the adversary the bene-fits of attacking your satellite systems by installing, whenever possible, </span>passive defenses on satellites, such as<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> hardening against electromagnetic pulse attacks, measures to make jamming more difficult, and ablative </span>shielding to help satellites<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> both </span>withstand<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ac-tual </span>physical attacks and survive space debris<span style="font-size: 8pt;">impacts.

In tandem with passive defenses, develop and accelerate programs for rapid launch of satellites to reconstitute lost systems and to bol-ster constellations in times of crisis. Also needed are spare satellites in storage here on earth that can be launched at short notice. While the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program is seeking to address these issues with the use of small satellites, efforts should also be made to speed up the time it takes to place larger satellites and more traditional systems that are being used in orbit.

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Weather is often in the headlines. But largely unnoticed last month was the weather that forced airlines flying the polar route between the United States and Asia to detour south over Alaska. This unusual routing was a response to </span>a ''space weather'' event - an enormous ejection of charged gas from the Sun capable of scrambling terrestrial electronic instruments.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Such events </span>can happen at any time but tend to become more severe and more frequent in roughly 11-year cycles.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The peak of the current cycle is expected in 2011-12.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">What's especially significant about this is that </span>the world's reliance on electronic technology - and therefore vulnerability to space weather - has increased substantially since the last peak a decade ago<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. From sporadic </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">solar flares</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> to ethereal shimmering aurora, manifestations </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">of severe space weather have the power to adversely affect </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the integrity of the world's power grids, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the accuracy and availability of GPS, the reliability of satellite-delivered telecommunications and the utility of radio and over-the-horizon radar.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> The detour of recent flights was due to the potential loss of essential air traffic control radio near the North Pole and was costly and inconvenient; some airlines had to bump passengers to take on added fuel for the re-</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">routing. Space weather can affect human safety and economies anywhere on our vast wired planet, and blasts of electrically-charged gas traveling from the Sun at up to five million miles an hour can strike with little warning.</span>Their impact could be big - on the order of $2 trillion during the first year in the United States alone, with a recovery period of 4 to 10 years<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. History is rife with warnings. In 1859, the British astronomer Richard Carrington observed that an apparently freak event causing compasses to go haywire, telegraph systems to fail and aurora to be visible as far south as Cuba was preceded by an intense white light flare on the surface of the Sun. In 1921, space weather wiped out communications and generated fires in the northeastern United States. In March 1989, a geomagnetic storm caused Canada's Hydro-Quebec power grid to collapse within 90 seconds, leaving millions of people in darkness for up to nine hours. In 2003, two intense storms traveled from the Sun to Earth in just 19 hours, causing a blackout in Sweden and affecting satellites, broadcast communications, airlines and navigation. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A study</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> by the Metatech Corporation in 2008 </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">showed that a repeat of the 1921 solar storm today </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">would affect more than 130 million people with sudden and lasting ramifications across the U.S. social and technical infrastructure. Last November, a Lloyd's report stated that ''A loss of power could lead to a cascade of operational failures </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that could leave society and the global economy severely disabled.''</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> Thanks to the work of scientists across the globe, we now have a better understanding of the causes and frequency of these events. We know that space weather disturbances are strongly controlled by magnetic fields in the Sun's atmosphere. We know that a storm is more </span>**<span style="color: #cc0033; font-size: 8pt;">likely</span>**<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> when the Sun is approaching the peak of its magnetic cycle, and we can identify where on the sun the intense activity eventually causing the storm is </span>**<span style="color: #cc0033; font-size: 8pt;">likely</span>**<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> to occur. Space scientists also indicate that the severity of future storms could be much greater than those experienced in recent decades, pointing to the critical need for careful monitoring of the Sun and its effects on the Earth. Action to put these understandings to work to protect our societies is well underway.</span>

Will this be possible in the future? Meanwhile, traditional foreign-policy challenges are multiplying. The threat from al Qaeda and Islamic terrorist affiliates has not been extinguished. Iran and North Korea are continuing on their bellicose paths, while Pakistan and Afghanistan are progressing smartly down the road to chaos. Russia's new militancy and China's seemingly relentless rise also give cause for concern. If America now tries to pull back from the world stage, it will leave a dangerous power vacuum.

In such a scenario there are shades of the </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">1930s, when global trade and finance ground nearly to a halt, the peaceful democracies failed to cooperate, and aggressive powers led by the remorseless fanatics who rose up on the crest of economic disaster exploited their divisions.Today we run the risk that rogue states may choose to become ever more reckless with their nuclear toys, just at our moment of maximum vulnerability.The aftershocks of the financial crisis will almost certainly rock our principal strategic competitors even harder than they will rock us</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The dramatic free fall of the Russian stock market has demonstrated the fragility of a state whose economic performance hinges on high oil prices, now driven down by the global slowdown. China is perhaps even more fragile, its economic growth depending heavily on foreign investment and access to foreign markets. Both will now be constricted, inflicting economic pain and perhaps even sparking unrest in a country where political legitimacy rests on progress in the long march to prosperity. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">None of this is good news if the authoritarian leaders of these countries seek to divert attention from internal travails with external adventures.</span>

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">These gloomy prognostications about the threats to our space environment should be troubling to Americans.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> The United States relies on the unhindered use of outer space for national security.</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">151 </span>**According to a space commission led by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the [United States] is more dependent on space than any other nation</span>.”**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">152 </span>**According to Robert G. Joseph, former Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security at the State Department, “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">space capabilities are vital to our national security and to our economic well-being.”153 Therefore, a catastrophic collision between space debris and the satellites on which that national security so heavily depends poses a very real and current threat to the national security interests of the United States</span>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Since “the [1991] Gulf War, the [United States] military has depended on satellites for communications, intelligence and navigation for its troops and precision-guided weapons.” Satellites are also used for reconnaissance and surveillance, command and control, and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehiclesnational security, and those assets are vulnerable to space debris collisions. As Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Edward Markey stated,</span> “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">American satellites are the soft underbelly of our national security.”</span>**161 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The Rumsfeld Commission</span>** <span style="font-size: 6pt;">set the groundwork for such a conclusion in 2001, when it discussed the vulnerability of U.S. space-based assets and</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">warned of the Space Pearl Harbor</span>.**162** <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Congress also recognized this vulnerability in June 2006, when it held hearings concerning space and its import to U.S. national power and security.**163** In his June 2006 Congressional Statement, Lieutenant General C.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">C. Autonomous //Operations// </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">//F//</span>or a satellite to continue to execute its mission<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, in the event that the ground control station is lost</span>, it must be capable of performing autonomous operations.Autonomous operations require the capability for the satellite to perform autonomous orbit control<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (e.g. station keeping for geosynchronous orbits), </span>momentum control, redundant unit control<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (fault detection) </span>and substitution<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Analysts estimate that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">autonomous operations increase the total system cost by between three and eight percent of the total satellite cost</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.(85) D. Hardening </span>Hardening of a space system's<span style="font-size: 8pt;">elements </span>is the single most effective survivability measure<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.(86) </span>The technologies to harden against damage from nuclear-weapons effects exist today<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">However, this level of hardening is reserved for a few, special mission military satellites</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as MILSTAR. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Most of the hardening programs underway today are focused on providing electronic component hardening to protect satellites from natural environment effects</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">However, concepts such as reflective surfaces, shutters and non-absorbing materials have been proposed as a means of hardening against an attack by lasers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the future, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the U.S. must advance</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the state-of-the-art in </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">hardening technology to include limiters, filters, Faraday cages, surge arrestors, waveguide cutoffs,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as well as expand the use of fiber optic components to increase survivability against nuclear, high-power microwave and neutral particle beam weapons.(87) </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Analysts estimate that satellite hardening would increase the total system cost by between two and five percent of the total satellite cost</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.(88) E. Proliferation-Redundant Nodes The concept of orbit proliferation or redundant nodes involves placing multiple satellites, in a given orbit, with overlapping coverages. The premise behind this concept is that if one satellite fails then the other satellites will be available to execute all or some percentage of the essential functions of the mission. This forces the adversary to attack multiple space systems, driving up the complexity and cost of the attack. Continuing advances in micro-miniaturization of space systems and components and the compact, portable ground systems for controlling them will support the proliferation strategy. F. On-Board Systems For Attack Reporting Many of the threats discussed here can reasonably be confused with natural phenomena such as space debris, solar activity, and computer hardware or software failure. `</span>In order for the U.S. to react appropriately to an attack on its space systems it must first know that it has been attacked and the nature of the attack.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> An on-board system for attack reporting would be able to record or report the time, intensity, or direction of a potentially hostile action against the satellite. </span>I f combined with the ability to autonomously react, a system such as this would be effective for system survivability.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Analysts estimate that employment of an on-board attack reporting system would increase the total system cost by between one and five percent of the total satellite cost.(89)</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> G. Maneuverability </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While most satellites have thrusters for attitude control, station keeping and orbit changes, few have the thrust capability or carry the necessary propellant to maneuver. Thrusters which would enable a satellite to maneuver or dodge an ASAT threat would be powerful; generating higher structural loads to the spacecraft and requiring stiffer</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, stronger solar arrays and appendages, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as well as</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, require </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">additional propellant</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These factors add up to weight penalties for the system. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Analysts estimate that to add maneuverability to a satellite system would currently increase the total system cost by between ten and twenty percent of the total satellite cost</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> depending on the satellite altitude (warning time), nature of the threat, and threat detection efficiency.(90) However, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">this cost and the technology to implement maneuverability could be significantly reduced if the U.S. can develop the capability to refuel the space system on-orbit</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Programs such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's (DARPA) Orbital Express Program are developing and demonstrating the necessary technology and operations concepts needed to employ maneuverability. H. Rapid Reconstitution The are two basic ways to rapidly reconstitute an on-orbit capability. First, spare or reserve satellites can be maintained on-orbit. Second, replacement satellites can be launched into orbit on short notice. In either case, an advanced commitment of resources is needed to provide this capability. Furthermore, the U.S. does not currently possess the capability to rapidly launch satellites into orbit, so a national level commitment to develop a rapid launch capability would be needed. I. On-board Decoys Decoys that credibly simulate the radar and optical signatures of the satellite are effective, potentially low-cost methods for diverting an ASAT attack from the actual satellite. The decoy would be located on or inside the host satellite and released at the precise moment for the most effective deployment. Decoys could also include lightweight optical or RF jamming systems to nullify or confuse an ASAT's homing system. Analysts estimate that employment of a decoy system would increase the total system cost by between one and ten percent of the total satellite cost.(91) J. Self-Defense or Escort Defense Capability The ability for a satellite to defend itself against an ASAT attack is a reasonable way to increase the survivability of a high-value space system. One method of self-defense would be to design a suite of optical or radar sensors and small, lightweight missiles into the satellite. Analysts estimate that employment of an on-board self-defense system would increase the total system cost by between ten and twenty percent of the total satellite cost.(92) Alternatively, a small escort satellite carrying the same capabilities might be a more capable system, especially if the goal was to detect, track and intercept the ASAT while the primary satellite continued its mission. Analysts currently estimate that employment of an escort defense system would increase the total system cost by between twenty and forty percent of the total satellite cost.(93) However, with continued advances in technologies for capable microsatellites the cost of deploying such a system will decrease. In the more distant future, self-defense missiles might be replaced by a high-energy lasers or high-power microwave systems. VII. Conclusion </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As history has shown--whether at Pearl Harbor</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in the killing of 241 U.S. Marines in their barracks in Lebanon</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, or </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the attack on </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the USS Cole</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in Yemen--</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if the U.S. offers an inviting target, it may well pay the price of attack. </span>With the growing commercial and national security use of space, U.S. assets in space and on the ground, offer<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> just such </span>targets<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Widely dispersed counterspace threat capabilities coupled with space situational awareness platforms threaten the U.S. ability to freely operate in space. We can no longer look at traditional adversaries as the only threat as there will likely be various space threats from several nations. History is replete with instances in which warning signs were ignored and change resisted untilan external, "improbable" event forced resistant bureaucracies to take action. The question is whether the U.S. will be wise enough to act responsibly and soon enough to reduce U.S. space vulnerability. Or whether,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as in the past, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a disabling </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">attack against the country and its people--a </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">"Space Pearl Harbor"--will be the only event able to galvanize the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nation and cause the U.S. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Government to act.</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times;">From Sept. 5-8, sunspot 1283 produced four big flares and three CMEs.</span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8pt;"> Two of the flares were X-class events and two were M-class flares. (Strong solar flares are classified accordingto a three-tiered system: X-class are the most powerful, M-class are of medium strength and C-class are the weakest.) While the rapid motion previously observed in sunspot 1283 seems to have died down a bit, Young said, the sunspot looks poised to erupt again sometime soon. "There's a good probability that we're still going to seeat least another M-class flare, possibly another X-class flare," Young told SPACE.com. It's not uncommon for sunspots to pop off a number of powerful flares in quick succession the way 1283 has done, he added. That seems to be the natural order of things.

CMEs have even greater destructive potential; they can spawn geomagnetic storms that disrupt GPS signals, radio communications and power grids. [Sun's Wrath: Worst Solar Storms in History] So researchers are working hard to better understand sun storms, with the aim of one day being able to predict them with a great deal of accuracyand a long lead time. But they're not there yet. "We still have a long way to go to really have the kind of forecasting capabilities that we have with terrestrial weather," Young said. That's not to say scientists aren't making progress. Indeed, they've learned a lot about solar eruptions lately, Young said. And the knowledge base will continue to grow, he added, as a fleet of sun-watching spacecraft beam home more and more observations of Earth's star. "We're really in a great time right now in terms of the data that we have," Young said, citing the contributions of spacecraft such as NASA's STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory, as well as SOHO, a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency. "It's going to be pretty exciting, from a solar physics and a space weather point of view." All of these eyes on the sun should be treated to quite a show over the next several years. </span><span style="font-family: Times;">Solar activity has been ramping up over the last few months as the sun works toward a maximum in its 11-year activitycycle.

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times;">On February 14 the sun erupted with the largest solar flare seen in four years—big enough to interfere with radio communications and GPS signals for airplanes on long-distance flights.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">U.S. military satellite communications have improved and expanded greatly over the past four decades, from SCORE through DSCS III, UFO, and Milstar. </span>Capabilities have grown dramatically with the development of satellite and electronics technologies**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Higher-power and wider-bandwidth satellites have enabled increased information transmission to an ever-wider assortment of terminal types deployed with an increasing number and variety of military units.Throughout this history, and now, Aerospace has been involved in every phase of development and deployment of DOD satellite communication systems, from concept development and requirements definition through design and test reviews to launch preparations and on-orbit testing and operations. Aerospace regularly applies lessons learned in the course of one program to all DOD satellite programs. </span>As military satellite communication systems improve, they continue to provide information superiority to the U.S. military. This enables our military forces to remain dominant in the increasing speed and diversity of their actions during times of peace as well as times of conflict.


===The impact is global nuclear war===

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but </span>**__because a world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts. Finally, </span>**__U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">American retrenchment could have devastating consequences. </span>Without an American security blanket, regional powers could rearm in an attempt to balance against emerging threats.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Under this scenario, there </span>would be a heightened possibility of arms races, miscalculation, or other crises spiraling into all-out conflict.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Alternatively, in seeking to accommodate the stronger powers,</span>weaker powers may shift their geopolitical posture away from the United States.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Either way, hostile states would be emboldened to make </span>aggressive moves in their regions<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As rival powers rise, Asia in particular is likely to emerge as a zone of great-power competition. Beijing’s economic rise has enabled a dramatic military buildup focused on acquisitions of naval, cruise, and ballistic missiles, long-range stealth aircraft, and anti-satellite capabilities. China’s strategic modernization is aimed, ultimately, at denying the United States access to the seas around China. Even as cooperative economic ties in the region have grown</span><span class="underline">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">China’s expansive territorial claims — and provocative statements and actions following crises in Korea and incidents at sea — have roiled its relations with South Korea, Japan, India, and Southeast Asian states.

===Norms against ASAT attacks must be re-emboldened, failure will collapse nuclear deterrence and make full scale space attacks inevitable=== 
Black 8 (Samuel is a Research Associate with the Space Security project at the Stimson Center, Protect Satellites Against Harmful Interference, July 07, http://www.stimson.org/spotlight/protect-satellites-against-harmful-interference-/)
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Throughout the history of the space age, </span>there has been no record of a satellite being interfered with during a crisis<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or in warfare. </span>This norm is in need of reinforcement<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Bush administration and the Russian government have withdrawn from treaties that include pledges against harmful interference; other treaties with this provision have expired. Meanwhile, China and the United States have carried out destructive A-Sat testing. The U.S. test in February employed a ballistic missile defense system converted for use against satellites. Major spacefaring nations already have multiple means to harm satellites, which can help deter the initiation of harmful interference against satellites in crises or warfare. No further A-Sat tests are required to prove this point. </span>The first case of satellite interference<span style="font-size: 8pt;">in times of crisis or war </span>is unlikely to be the last<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Latent A-Sat capabilities can serve as a deterrent against cheating. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In the event that any state breaks its pledge </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">not to engage in harmful interference, </span>that state is likely to invite unfortunate consequences. Satellites are a force multiplier and are invaluable to technologically advanced military forces<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>If satellite interference becomes the norm<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in crises and warfare</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span>advanced spacefaring nations stand to lose the benefits that satellites provide<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.Satellites are used by militaries for communication and early warning purposes, both of which are </span>vital<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> for nuclear deterrence. If satellites are targeted in crises and warfare, breakdowns in deterrence could occur. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Interference with satellites would change the conduct of warfare. It is impossible to predict with certainty what the resulting consequences would be, but it is safe to conclude that </span>the country that relies upon satellites the most, the United States, would suffer the most if satellites become acceptable target<span style="font-size: 8pt;">s. Furthermore, </span>widespread interference with satellites would hinder the peaceful uses of outer space. If debris is created, the risk of catastrophic damage to satellites increases.

===Credible ASAT threats increase likelihood of escalation=== 
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Lewis 2004 (</span>Jeffrey, Center for defense information,“What if Space Were Weaponized? Possible Consequences for Crisis Scenarios,” http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/scenarios.pdf accessed 10-29-9 rmg)
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Perhaps most worrisome</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, the United States might be</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> blithely </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">unawareof the degree to which the Russians were concerned about its actions and inadvertently escalate a crisis</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. During the early 1980s, the Soviet Union suffered a major “war scare” during which time its leadership concluded that bilateral relations were rapidly declining. This war scare was driven in part by the rhetoric of the Reagan administration, fortified by the selective reading of intelligence. During this period, NATO conducted a major command post exercise, Able Archer, that caused some elements of the Soviet military to raise their alert status. American officials were stunned to learn, after the fact, that the Kremlin had been acutely nervous about an American first strike during this period.56 All of these incidents have a common theme – that confidence is often the difference between war and peace. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In times of crisis, false alarms can have a momentum of their own</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As in the second scenario in this monograph, t</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">he lesson is that commanders rely on the steady flow of reliable information. When that information flow is disrupted– whether by a deliberate attack or an accident – confidence collapses and the result is panic and escalation.Introducing ASAT weapons into this mix is all the more dangerous</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, because such weapons target the elements of the command system that keep leaders aware, informed and in control. As a result, the mere presence of such weapons is corrosive to the confidence that allows national nuclear forces to operate safely.</span>

===Accidental war goes nuclear===

U.S. space warriors<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> now have a doctrine and plans for counterspace operations, but they </span>do not have a credible plan to stop inadvertent or uncontrolled escalation once the shooting starts<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Like U.S. war-fighting scenarios, there is a huge chasm between plans and consequences, in which</span>requirements for escalation dominance make uncontrolled escalation far more likely. A pre-emptive strike in space on a nation that possesses nuclear weapons would invite the gravest possible consequences.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Attacks on satellites that provide early warning and other critical military support functions would most likely be viewed either as a surrogate or as a prelude to attacks on nuclear forces.</span>

===Nuclear deterrence is key to hedge against transition wars and great power conflicts it creates a background of stability that facilitates economic integration and peace.=== 
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Morgan et al. 2009 </span>(Patrick, political science professor at UC “Complex Deterrence: Strategy in the Global Age”, pg 9-11, ldg)
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Among the great powers (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council), </span>nuclear weapons are largely seen as a hedge against the emergence of great-power conflict in the future.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The great-power relationships in the post-cold war era are characterized by “recessed general deterrence,” or dissuasion, in which states do not expect immediate militarized conflict, but weapons are kept in the background as insurance given the inherent uncertainties of world politics. The end of the cold war witnessed substantial changes in the deterrence dynamics involving great powers, and, as a result, general deterrence and dissuasion became operational concept. Although they do not maintain large arsenals, the United States nor Russia is presumed to hold automatic launch-on-warning attack plans anymore, although some of the elements of the previous era are continuing. In addition, they have reduced the number of weapons they possess, although the numbers still exceed a minimum nuclear deterrence posture. The tree other old nuclear power China, the United Kingdom, and France, also have been maintaining their smaller arsenals, but this might change as Chinese nuclear force modernization plans come to fruition in the coming decades. </span>The logic behind the maintenance of nuclear capabilities is that the great powers want to be prepared in case their relations deteriorate in the future<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Nuclear capability can also be construed as an assurance against the expansionist pathologies of great powers as described in perspectives such as offensive realism. Moreover, uncertainties in Russia and China give pause to Western nuclear powers, while, for Moscow, the fear of American influence in its former spheres in Eastern Europe and Central Asia is the cardinal source of anxiety</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For the rising power, China, nuclear weapons offer a major insurance against direct assault on its strategic sphere, allowing it to rise peacefully. </span>Nuclear weapon<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">s also </span>offer a limited but crucial deterrent against potential conflict escalation between the United States and China involving Taiwan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The great-power deterrence calculations are thus based on “recessed general deterrence” as well as “existential deterrence”: no immediate expectations of war exist among them. However, as Patrick Morgan states, </span>“if serious conflicts emerge again, then deterrence will be in vogue<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if not, at least for a lengthy period, then deterrence will operate offstage, held in reserve, and will not be the cornerstone of security management for the system.” This does not mean that the relations in the US-Russia and US-China dyads would remain the same in the long run. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Power transition has invariably been turbulent in the international system, and herein lies the role that nuclear weapons may play in deterring a transition war</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. US-Russia relations could deteriorate, and deterrence could become more relevant if tensions build up over the establishment of missile defenses in Eastern Europe and over Russian efforts to repudiate major arms-control agreements in its effort to regain its lost superpower status. As discussed in Morgan and Paul’s chapter in this volume, nuclear deterrence in this context has offered the major powers greater maneuverability. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It has allowed the major power states to sustain their credentials system managers and has prevented the emergence of active security dilemmas among them that can be caused by conventional arms races and technological breakthroughs. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Absent the fear of existential wars, the potentially rival states have engaged in greater economic interactions. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The increasing trade relations between the United States and China and China and India, an emerging power, suggest that general nuclear deterrence may offer economic spin-off benefits.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> To some extent, the stability in relations among the great powers, with no war in sight between them, points to the pacifying role that nuclear weapons may be playing, although other causes are present as well. </span>In that sense nuclear weapons may act as crucial factors in preventing a power transition war akin to those that the world experienced in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For Russia, the superpower that declined nuclear deterrence offers an opportunity not to be excessively alarmed by the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</span>
===In isolation, retaliatory deterrence fails=== 
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Butterworth and Sheldon 2008 </span>(Dr. Robert, President of Aries Analytics, a company which provides market analyses and program development services to government, and Dr. John Sheldon, Institute Fellow “Space Power and Deterrence: Are We Serious?” Ph.D., George C.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">5. If the measures described above (all of which can be said to constitute a deterrence by denial strategy) fail, or are not sufficient in response to more gratuitous attacks against satellite systems, then a deterrence by punishment strategy can be exercised. At this juncture it is useful to note that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a retaliatory deterrence strategy for the U.S. has little credibility given that</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for the foreseeable future at least, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the U.S. is the most space-reliant country today</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Threatening to attack adversary satellites in response to attacks on our own may prove fruitless if the adversary in question does not leverage significant military, diplomatic and economic power</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> through such systems. This is not to say that the U.S. should not target adversary satellite systems — it is not too difficult to envision circumstances where, for example, an adversary reconnaissance satellite poses a threat to deployed U.S. forces and therefore must be neutralized. </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">If U.S. policy makers are serious about deterring attacks on U.S. space systems, what might the requirements for an effective deterrence strategy look like? Furthermore, given the fact that under current political and geostrategic circumstances the U.S. weaponization of space is highly unlikely, how can U.S. policy makers deter attacks on U.S. satellite systems when the very satellites in question have little, if any, coercive capability? In fact there are a number of </span>measures<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that can be undertaken </span>that can<span style="font-size: 8pt;">both </span>deny the ability of an adversary tocause catastrophic damage to U.S. space power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>and also lend credibility to any U.S. threat to respond <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to an attack on U.S. satellite systems using military and diplomatic means. </span>These measures<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> are </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">as follows: </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">1</span>. Deny the adversary the benefits of attacking U.S. satellite systems by installing<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> whenever possible </span>passive defenses on satellites, such as hardening againste<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">lectromagnetic </span>p<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ulse </span>attacks, measures to make jamming more difficult, and ablative shielding to help satellites both withstand attacks and survive space debris impacts<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Eventually, as individual threats become more defined, active defenses should also be seriously considered. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">2. In tandem with passive defenses, develop and accelerate programs for rapid launch of satellites to reconstitute lost systems, and to bolster constellations in times of crisis</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Also needed are spare satellites in storage that can be launched at short notice. While the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program is seeking to address these issues with the use of small satellites, efforts should also be made to speed-up the time it takes to place large satellites in orbit. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">3. Prioritize space situational awareness programs</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in order to build as quickly as possible a comprehensive picture of the space environment. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If policy makers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and commanders </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">possess the ability to differentiate between purposeful attacks and natural environmental hazards then the potential for misperception and miscalculation is dramatically reduced. Furthermore, </span>effective deterrence is strengthened by the fact that space situational awareness could potentially indicate the nature and origins of any attempted attack on a satellite.

===U.S. countermeasures reduces the benefits of developing and deploying ASATs=== 
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Kosiak 2007</span> (Steven M. vice President, Budget Studies, at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, Arming the Heavens: A Preliminary Assessment of the Potential Cost and Cost-Effectiveness of Space-Based Weapons,” Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments http://www.csbaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2007.10.31-Spaced-Based-Weapons.pdf)
Rather than attempting to protect US<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and other </span>satellites by destroying enemy ASAT capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, through the use of bodyguard satellites or other means, a wide range of </span>passive countermeasures could be employed<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Some of these countermeasures are truly “passive,” </span>such as satellite hardening<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">while others require some activity by the satellite (such as </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">maneuvering</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">), but are passive in the sense that their effectiveness does not turn on an ability to destroy the threatening ASAT system. As noted earlier, no attempt is made in this chapter to estimate the cost of developing and applying most of these countermeasures—among other things because of the highly classified nature of these programs and activities, and the lack of even very rough open-source estimates of their potential costs and cost-effectiveness. While this may limit the usefulness of this discussion, it is nevertheless important to understand, at least conceptually, the range of passive countermeasures that are available. Although a number of these countermeasures were mentioned in the previous chapter of this report, most of that earlier discussion focused on the cost of acquiring and supporting various space-based weapon systems (as well as terrestrialbased alternatives) in the absence of such countermeasures. Not all of the countermeasures noted below would, in all cases, prove costeffective means of protecting satellites—much would depend on the specific details of the satellites to be protected, the countermeasures to be employed and the ASAT weapon thought to pose a threat. But under some circumstances, each of them could prove cost-effective. Moreover</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, this approach might prove especially cost-effective if some combination of these countermeasues were employed.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is impossible, in the absence of a much more detailed analysis (perhaps including access to classified data), to estimate whether, or to what extent, the use of some combination of passive countermeasures could provide a cost-effective counter to an enemy’s ASAT capabilities (or provide greater protection, at lower cost, than bodyguard satellites). However, it seems reasonable to conclude that any analysis that assumed some </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">use of passive countermeasures would drive up the costs of acquiring and supporting various ASAT capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—above, and perhaps far above, the estimates provided in the preceding chapter. As noted below, it is also important to understand that, just as countries with extensive and sophisticated space, and space-tracking, capabilities are likely to be able to deploy more effective ASAT weapons than countries with more primitive space-related capabilities, the former are also likely to be able to employ passive countermeasures to protect satellites much more effectively. Put another way, in many cases,</span>passive countermeasures that might be ineffective if used against a sophisticated space-faring country could be highly effective if employed against the ASAT capabilities most likely to be acquired by countries with less developed space capabilities.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Since the United States has by far the world’s largest and most modern and effective network of space tracking assets, it possesses an especially important advantage in this area.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Instead, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is likely that </span>the greatest improvements in the security of valuable U.S. space assets will be achieved by making the satellites less vulnerable to attack <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">making them less valuable. </span>Hardening important satellites could make attacking them more difficult<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while satellite miniaturization is making it increasingly possible to eliminate existing vulnerabilities altogether by making satellite systems more distributed and redundant, with more smaller satellites doing the same jobs as fewer large, expensive ones.[31] As this shift continues, there will be fewer and fewer opportunities for attacks on a single satellite, or even several, to cause the sort of widespread disruption that has occasionally occurred in the past due to mechanical failures of critical satellites.[32] In short, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is both desirable and likely that communications and other </span>satellites<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> will gradually </span>become<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> more like the U.S. interstate highway system: economically vital to the nation, but </span>hardly worth the trouble of attacking because its resilience and redundancy means that none of its individual components is critical<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Weather is often in the headlines. But largely unnoticed last month was the weather that forced airlines flying the polar route between the United States and Asia to detour south over Alaska. This unusual routing was a response to </span>a ''space weather'' event - an enormous ejection of charged gas from the Sun capable of scrambling terrestrial electronic instruments.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Such events </span>can happen at any time but tend to become more severe and more frequent in roughly 11-year cycles.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The peak of the current cycle is expected in 2011-12.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">What's especially significant about this is that </span>the world's reliance on electronic technology - and therefore vulnerability to space weather - has increased substantially since the last peak a decade ago<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. From sporadic </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">solar flares</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> to ethereal shimmering aurora, manifestations </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">of severe space weather have the power to adversely affect </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the integrity of the world's power grids, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the accuracy and availability of GPS, the reliability of satellite-delivered telecommunications and the utility of radio and over-the-horizon radar.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> The detour of recent flights was due to the potential loss of essential air traffic control radio near the North Pole and was costly and inconvenient; some airlines had to bump passengers to take on added fuel for the re-</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">routing. Space weather can affect human safety and economies anywhere on our vast wired planet, and blasts of electrically-charged gas traveling from the Sun at up to five million miles an hour can strike with little warning.</span>Their impact could be big - on the order of $2 trillion during the first year in the United States alone, with a recovery period of 4 to 10 years<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. History is rife with warnings. In 1859, the British astronomer Richard Carrington observed that an apparently freak event causing compasses to go haywire, telegraph systems to fail and aurora to be visible as far south as Cuba was preceded by an intense white light flare on the surface of the Sun. In 1921, space weather wiped out communications and generated fires in the northeastern United States. In March 1989, a geomagnetic storm caused Canada's Hydro-Quebec power grid to collapse within 90 seconds, leaving millions of people in darkness for up to nine hours. In 2003, two intense storms traveled from the Sun to Earth in just 19 hours, causing a blackout in Sweden and affecting satellites, broadcast communications, airlines and navigation. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A study</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> by the Metatech Corporation in 2008 </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">showed that a repeat of the 1921 solar storm today </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">would affect more than 130 million people with sudden and lasting ramifications across the U.S. social and technical infrastructure. Last November, a Lloyd's report stated that ''A loss of power could lead to a cascade of operational failures </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that could leave society and the global economy severely disabled.''</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> Thanks to the work of scientists across the globe, we now have a better understanding of the causes and frequency of these events. We know that space weather disturbances are strongly controlled by magnetic fields in the Sun's atmosphere. We know that a storm is more </span>**<span style="color: #cc0033; font-size: 8pt;">likely</span>**<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> when the Sun is approaching the peak of its magnetic cycle, and we can identify where on the sun the intense activity eventually causing the storm is </span>**<span style="color: #cc0033; font-size: 8pt;">likely</span>**<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> to occur. Space scientists also indicate that the severity of future storms could be much greater than those experienced in recent decades, pointing to the critical need for careful monitoring of the Sun and its effects on the Earth. Action to put these understandings to work to protect our societies is well underway.</span>

Will this be possible in the future? Meanwhile, traditional foreign-policy challenges are multiplying. The threat from al Qaeda and Islamic terrorist affiliates has not been extinguished. Iran and North Korea are continuing on their bellicose paths, while Pakistan and Afghanistan are progressing smartly down the road to chaos. Russia's new militancy and China's seemingly relentless rise also give cause for concern. If America now tries to pull back from the world stage, it will leave a dangerous power vacuum. The stabilizing effects of our presence in Asia, our continuing commitment to Europe, and our position as defender of last resort for Middle East energy sources and supply lines could all be placed at risk. In such a scenario there are shades of the </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">1930s, when global trade and finance ground nearly to a halt, the peaceful democracies failed to cooperate, and aggressive powers led by the remorseless fanatics who rose up on the crest of economic disaster exploited their divisions.Today we run the risk that rogue states may choose to become ever more reckless with their nuclear toys, just at our moment of maximum vulnerability.The aftershocks of the financial crisis will almost certainly rock our principal strategic competitors even harder than they will rock us</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The dramatic free fall of the Russian stock market has demonstrated the fragility of a state whose economic performance hinges on high oil prices, now driven down by the global slowdown. China is perhaps even more fragile, its economic growth depending heavily on foreign investment and access to foreign markets. Both will now be constricted, inflicting economic pain and perhaps even sparking unrest in a country where political legitimacy rests on progress in the long march to prosperity. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">None of this is good news if the authoritarian leaders of these countries seek to divert attention from internal travails with external adventures.</span>

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> In January, an agreement was signed between Britain's Meteorological Office and the Space Weather Prediction Center of the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration for wide-ranging cooperation and data sharing in the space-weather domain.

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">These gloomy prognostications about the threats to our space environment should be troubling to Americans.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> The United States relies on the unhindered use of outer space for national security.</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">151 </span>**According to a space commission led by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the [United States] is more dependent on space than any other nation</span>.”**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">152 </span>**According to Robert G. Joseph, former Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security at the State Department, “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">space capabilities are vital to our national security and to our economic well-being.”153 Therefore, a catastrophic collision between space debris and the satellites on which that national security so heavily depends poses a very real and current threat to the national security interests of the United States</span>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Since “the [1991] Gulf War, the [United States] military has depended on satellites for communications, intelligence and navigation for its troops and precision-guided weapons.” Satellites are also used for reconnaissance and surveillance, command and control, and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehiclesnational security, and those assets are vulnerable to space debris collisions. As Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Edward Markey stated,</span> “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">American satellites are the soft underbelly of our national</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> security.”</span>**161 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The Rumsfeld Commission</span>** <span style="font-size: 6pt;">set the groundwork for such a conclusion in 2001, when it discussed the vulnerability of U.S. space-based assets and</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">warned of the Space Pearl Harbor</span>.**162** <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Congress also recognized this vulnerability in June 2006, when it held hearings concerning space and its import to U.S. national power and security.**163** In his June 2006 Congressional Statement, Lieutenant General C.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">C. Autonomous //Operations// </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">//F//</span>or a satellite to continue to execute its mission<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, in the event that the ground control station is lost</span>, it must be capable of performing autonomous operations.Autonomous operations require the capability for the satellite to perform autonomous orbit control<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (e.g. station keeping for geosynchronous orbits), </span>momentum control, redundant unit control<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (fault detection) </span>and substitution<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Analysts estimate that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">autonomous operations increase the total system cost by between three and eight percent of the total satellite cost</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.(85) D. Hardening </span>Hardening of a space system's<span style="font-size: 8pt;">elements </span>is the single most effective survivability measure<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.(86) </span>The technologies to harden against damage from nuclear-weapons effects exist today<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">However, this level of hardening is reserved for a few, special mission military satellites</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as MILSTAR. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Most of the hardening programs underway today are focused on providing electronic component hardening to protect satellites from natural environment effects</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">However, concepts such as reflective surfaces, shutters and non-absorbing materials have been proposed as a means of hardening against an attack by lasers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the future, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the U.S. must advance</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the state-of-the-art in </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">hardening technology to include limiters, filters, Faraday cages, surge arrestors, waveguide cutoffs,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as well as expand the use of fiber optic components to increase survivability against nuclear, high-power microwave and neutral particle beam weapons.(87) </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Analysts estimate that satellite hardening would increase the total system cost by between two and five percent of the total satellite cost</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.(88) E. Proliferation-Redundant Nodes The concept of orbit proliferation or redundant nodes involves placing multiple satellites, in a given orbit, with overlapping coverages. The premise behind this concept is that if one satellite fails then the other satellites will be available to execute all or some percentage of the essential functions of the mission. This forces the adversary to attack multiple space systems, driving up the complexity and cost of the attack. Continuing advances in micro-miniaturization of space systems and components and the compact, portable ground systems for controlling them will support the proliferation strategy. F. On-Board Systems For Attack Reporting Many of the threats discussed here can reasonably be confused with natural phenomena such as space debris, solar activity, and computer hardware or software failure. `</span>In order for the U.S. to react appropriately to an attack on its space systems it must first know that it has been attacked and the nature of the attack.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> An on-board system for attack reporting would be able to record or report the time, intensity, or direction of a potentially hostile action against the satellite. </span>I f combined with the ability to autonomously react, a system such as this would be effective for system survivability.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Analysts estimate that employment of an on-board attack reporting system would increase the total system cost by between one and five percent of the total satellite cost.(89)</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> G. Maneuverability </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While most satellites have thrusters for attitude control, station keeping and orbit changes, few have the thrust capability or carry the necessary propellant to maneuver. Thrusters which would enable a satellite to maneuver or dodge an ASAT threat would be powerful; generating higher structural loads to the spacecraft and requiring stiffer</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, stronger solar arrays and appendages, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as well as</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, require </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">additional propellant</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These factors add up to weight penalties for the system. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Analysts estimate that to add maneuverability to a satellite system would currently increase the total system cost by between ten and twenty percent of the total satellite cost</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> depending on the satellite altitude (warning time), nature of the threat, and threat detection efficiency.(90) However, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">this cost and the technology to implement maneuverability could be significantly reduced if the U.S. can develop the capability to refuel the space system on-orbit</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Programs such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's (DARPA) Orbital Express Program are developing and demonstrating the necessary technology and operations concepts needed to employ maneuverability. H. Rapid Reconstitution The are two basic ways to rapidly reconstitute an on-orbit capability. First, spare or reserve satellites can be maintained on-orbit. Second, replacement satellites can be launched into orbit on short notice. In either case, an advanced commitment of resources is needed to provide this capability. Furthermore, the U.S. does not currently possess the capability to rapidly launch satellites into orbit, so a national level commitment to develop a rapid launch capability would be needed. I. On-board Decoys Decoys that credibly simulate the radar and optical signatures of the satellite are effective, potentially low-cost methods for diverting an ASAT attack from the actual satellite. The decoy would be located on or inside the host satellite and released at the precise moment for the most effective deployment. Decoys could also include lightweight optical or RF jamming systems to nullify or confuse an ASAT's homing system. Analysts estimate that employment of a decoy system would increase the total system cost by between one and ten percent of the total satellite cost.(91) J. Self-Defense or Escort Defense Capability The ability for a satellite to defend itself against an ASAT attack is a reasonable way to increase the survivability of a high-value space system. One method of self-defense would be to design a suite of optical or radar sensors and small, lightweight missiles into the satellite. Analysts estimate that employment of an on-board self-defense system would increase the total system cost by between ten and twenty percent of the total satellite cost.(92) Alternatively, a small escort satellite carrying the same capabilities might be a more capable system, especially if the goal was to detect, track and intercept the ASAT while the primary satellite continued its mission. Analysts currently estimate that employment of an escort defense system would increase the total system cost by between twenty and forty percent of the total satellite cost.(93) However, with continued advances in technologies for capable microsatellites the cost of deploying such a system will decrease. In the more distant future, self-defense missiles might be replaced by a high-energy lasers or high-power microwave systems. VII.

Widely dispersed counterspace threat capabilities coupled with space situational awareness platforms threaten the U.S. ability to freely operate in space. We can no longer look at traditional adversaries as the only threat as there will likely be various space threats from several nations. History is replete with instances in which warning signs were ignored and change resisted untilan external, "improbable" event forced resistant bureaucracies to take action. The question is whether the U.S. will be wise enough to act responsibly and soon enough to reduce U.S. space vulnerability. Or whether,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as in the past, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a disabling </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">attack against the country and its people--a </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">"Space Pearl Harbor"--will be the only event able to galvanize the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nation and cause the U.S. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Government to act.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Hardening against electromagnetic pulse </span>Satellites can be hardened by factors of about ten against externally generated electronic pulses created by nuclear detonations.**Satellite construction costs may grow by up to perhaps 10 percent as a result, but for military satellites in particular, the added costs are hardly onerous. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is more difficult to harden equipment against system-generated electromagnetic pulse phenomena, which is likely to be a dubious financial proposition for commercial satellites. Hardening against electromagnetic pulse for satellites in MEO and GEO might be less of an imperative, since distances between satellites are greater at those altitudes. </span>On-orbit spares or replacements on the ground can substitute for those satellites rendered inoperable<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>
