===Marxism=== 

**A. The failure of the Left**

**More than a decade and a half ago, the intellectual climate in Germany collapsed into philosophy. German philosophers emphasized the transformative potential of ideas, and sought to emancipate themselves and politics through transformations in consciousness.**

**It was in this intellectual climate that Karl Marx emerged. His central thesis was that this philosophy of ideas not only distracted attention from the very real material conditions that structure our existence, but also made progressive social change impossible.**

**The insights of Karl Marx are perhaps even more pertinent today, when the liberal academy and intellectuals have begun to assert that discourse and performance are avenues for confronting oppressive power structures. This trend of the Left today is embodied in the affirmative’s politics, in their naïve and unproblematic endorsement of discourse as they desperately struggle to believe that what they have done in this debate is itself transformative and empowering.**

**Against this paralyzing politics, it is more important that ever to return to Marx, and to emphasize his insight that transformations in consciousness can never lead to social transformations—only struggling to transform the real material conditions that structure social relations can bring about social change**
**Marx, 1845** (Karl, The German Ideology, http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm)

__This conception of history depends__ … as men make circumstances.

**Unfortunately, Marx’s insight has been all but discarded by the new left, with its emphasis on being postmodern, postcolonial, post-structural, post-Marxist, or post-anything. This post-al politics of the contemporary left focuses on discourse and language at the expense of analyzing real material conditions and is complicit with capitalism, especially insofar as it obscures the operation of political economy and the material reality of capitalism**
