**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The “Other” is fundamentally relative, absolute ethics presupposes the Other to be Good, which results in violence</span>**

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The spacing of time entails that alterity … or rejection, continued life or violent death</span>

====**2NC Impact: Violence**==== 

**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">All decisions MUST be contingent upon calculation. Absolute peace is unethical and results in absolute violence</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Their “other” arguments are not disads to our alternative. We are do not say that ethics are bad, we say that ETHICAL obligations are bad… because they prioritize one set of people over an other. </span>**
