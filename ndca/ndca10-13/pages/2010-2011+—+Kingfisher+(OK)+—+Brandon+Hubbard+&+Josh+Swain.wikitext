==South Korean Affirmative==

Contention One is Inherency

**Current strategy of “Strategic Patience” in dealing with North Korea is failing.**
**Wit '11** (Joel, Visiting fellow, U.S.-Korean Institute at SAIS, Foreign Policy, "Kim Jong Il's Missiles," Jan 20, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/20/kim_jong_ils_missiles)

__During his recent trip to Asia, U.S. Defense Secretary.......urgency to proceeding down the track of negotiations and engagement."__


**Sinking of South Korean warship and artillery attack prove**
**Wit '10** (Joel, Visiting fellow, U.S.-Korea Institute at SAIS, Foreign Policy, “Time to Get Serious About North Korea,” December 13, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/12/13/time_to_get_serious_about_north_korea )


__Don't get me wrong. The North's recent artillery attack... Expect more provocations, escalation, and possibly even war.__



===North Korea Advantage===

**Inter-Korean conflict would inevitably draw US in**
**Bandow '10** (Doug, 4/18, former assistant to Ronald Reagan and fellow at Cato Institute, Huffington Post, “Let the Koreans Take Care of the Koreas, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/doug-bandow/let-the-koreans-take-care_b_542141.html)

If a torpedo was used, however, the threat of conflict rises....... the South Korean military was ill-prepared to defend its own personnel.



**South Korea’s military policy is tied to the US—withdrawal would strip the ROK of its power**
**Bandow 5 (Doug, former assistant to Ronald Reagan and fellow at Cato Institute, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2751/is_81/ai_n15753425/pg_6/?tag=content;col1)**

IT SHOULD come as no surprise that the majority of South Koreans..... __Only then can South Korea and the United States decide on the contours of future military cooperation that will serve both nations.__ 


===Japan Advantage===



**Removing troops from South Korea shifts the focus of the alliance and causes a more assertive, independent Japanese force structure** 
**Cronin 5** (Richard, Specialist in Asian Affairs, The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs Vol. 29 No. 1, http://www.stimson.org/southeastasia/pdf/Cronin_The_North_Korean_Nuclear_Threat_and%20the_US_Japan_Security_Alliance.pdf)



__Japan__ also __has never been more materially and psychologically prepared......... respect to the totality of Japan economic, diplomatic, and military interests.__



**Withdrawing forces in Asia sends a signal to Japan that they cannot depend on the US indefinitely, spurring military assertiveness throughout Asia** 
**Carpenter 95 (**Ted Galen, director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, Paternalism And Dependence: The U.S.-Japanese Security Relationship, http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-244.html)



Even worse, __Washington's policy encourages a dependent mentality on the part of the Japanese.........__ it was safe for their country to continue its free-riding habits.


===Regional Stability Advantage===

I**ndependent Japanese forces are the most effective route to conflict stability in Asia** 
**Carpenter, ‘2** [Ted, Galen, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, “Japan Takes a Modest Step Toward Global Security” CATO, 1-8-2002, http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3364] 



__The standard argument against Japan playing a more active military role......... the United States should state explicitly that it expects Japan to do so.__


**Nuclear instability in Asia outweighs – lack of certainty, presence of great powers, number of actors, entrenched nature of conflict and no conflict-depressing norms** 
Paul **Dibb, ‘1** (Prof – Australian National University, Strategic Trends: Asia at a Crossroads, Naval War College Review, Winter 2001, http://www.nwc.navy.mil/press/Review...r/art2-w01.htm)

__The areas of maximum danger and instability in the world today are in Asia..........__ ASEAN Regional Forum have shown themselves to be ineffective when confronted with major crises.



**The only scenario for escalating Asian conflicts is in a world of US security assurances** 
Joel S **Wit, ’10** (Visiting Fellow, U.S.‐Korea Institute at SAIS, “Four Scenarios for a Nuclear North Korea,” Februrary, http://uskoreainstitute.org/pdf/WP-NK_Future/USKI_WP10-01_Wit.pdf.)

Overall, while this scenario would represent a serious setback............... particularly efforts to work in close cooperation with China.



===Taiwan Conflict Advantage===


**An independent Japan prevents Taiwan conflict by restricting the Chinese sphere of influence**
**Preble, ‘6** [Christopher, director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, “Two Normal Countries Rethinking the U.S.-Japan Strategic Relationship” CATO Policy Analysis, April 18, 2006, http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa566.pdf]


l__ingering hostility toward and suspicion of North Korea__ ......... __a “normal country” that is no longer dependent on a distant patron for its defense.__



**Taiwan is the most likely scenario for global nuclear escalation**
**Ikegami, ‘8** (Dr. Masako, Professor of Sociology and Peace & Conflict Studies and Director of the Center for Pacific Asia Studies – Stockholm University “Time for Conflict Prevention Across the Taiwan Strait”, China Brief, 8(7), 3-28, http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=4822)



Indeed, a __cross-Strait conflict is potentially one of the most dangerous conflicts........... By nature, a cross-Strait conflict cannot be a limited theatre of war.__ 



**Taiwan would become the deadliest war imaginable** 
**Johnson, ‘1** (Chalmers, President – Japan Policy Research Institute, “Time to Bring the Troops Home”, The Nation, 4-26, http://ieas.berkeley.edu/cks/k12/girling_troops.doc.)


__Taiwan, whose status constitutes the still incomplete last act of the Chinese civil war......... it could easily escalate into a nuclear holocaust.__


===Plan Text===


**The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its military presence in South Korea by immediately withdrawing a substantial number of deployed active forces. We reserve the right to clarify in cross-x.**


===Solvency===


**The ROK has the capabilities to defend itself, so U.S. presence is unnecessary** 
**Bandow, ‘2** (Doug, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute and a former Special Assistant to President Reagan, “A New Policy for a New Millenium: America's Relationship to South and North Korea” The ICAS Lectures, Spring Symposium, 2-14-2002, http://www.icasinc.org/2003/2003w/2003wdxb.html] )



__South Korea is capable today of defending itself against an invasion from the North..... the North marries an effective atomic bomb to a means of delivery.__ 



**Signal of the plan alone is enough to send the signal to de-militarize and look to diplomacy.**
**Bandow 96** (Doug, senior fellow at the Cato Institute “Tripwire: Korea and U.S. foreign policy in a changed world” pg 83 JL)


__U.S. troops have been stationed in South Korea for the past half century....... psychological, political, and diplomatic effects of their presence__



**Troops could be withdrawn gradually ending in 2012.**
**Kim et al. 09** (Kim, Indong Oh, writers from the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainable Development Northeast Asia Peace and Security Project “A New U.S. Policy toward Korea: Korean American Recommendations for Real Change” JL)



__As__ the denuclearization process, __peace__ treaty and normalization__............... relinquishing the U.S. military's wartime operational control over the ROK troops to the South Korean government.__
