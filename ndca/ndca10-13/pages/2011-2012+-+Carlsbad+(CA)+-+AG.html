<!-- ws:end:WikiTextTocRule:92 -->Having come from a relatively unknown school and competing on the circuit independently, I have learned of the importance of disclosure and the help needed to be a proficient debater. Starting out on your own in the circuit, means you are already at a disadvantage with theory shells, meta-ethical frameworks, and the quantity of cards in your backfiles. For this reason, I whole-heartedly endorse disclosure theory. That being said, I also understand the problem when facing powerhouse teams as a small school that can be easily prepped out. Thus, I will only disclose my cases after the last tournament I will attend on a given topic and <em>during</em> disclosure tournaments. If you want me to disclose at any other time, e-mail me at: andoni.m.garcia@gmail.com. I believe in posting entire cases and full cards, because often times schools like mine don't have access to JSTOR, ProjectMUSE, etc and so I cannot access your cites. To minimize this disadvantage, I will never abridge disclosed cards.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Justice </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is defined as: The disposition to treat equals equally &amp; unequals unequally.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Speciesism.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This means that if animals are on equal moral ground, it is just to treat them equally through animal rights. Hence the burden of the affirmative will to be to prove that animals are on equal moral ground.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Moral equality is based on the ability to suffer. <strong>Bentham</strong></span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Speciesism.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">****[2]****</a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">The day may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been witholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, as well as a more conversable </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">But suppose they were otherwise, what would it avail?</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The question is not, Can they <em>reason</em>? nor, Can they</span></u></strong><strong><em><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">talk</span></u></em></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">? but, Can they</span></u></strong><strong><em><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">suffer</span></u></em></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">?</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This argument is summarized in <strong>Singer 1</strong></span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Speciesism.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">****[3]****</a><span style="font-size: 10pt;">:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">In this passage </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Bentham points to the capacity for suffering as the vital characteristic that gives a being the right to equal consideration. The capacity for suffering</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">—or more strictly, for suffering and/or enjoyment or happiness—</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is not just another characteristic like the capacity for language, or for higher mathematics</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Bentham is not saying that those who try to mark &quot;the insuperable line&quot; that determines whether the interests of a being should be considered happen to have selected the wrong characteristic</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The capacity for suffering </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and enjoying things</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is a prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare</span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">. A </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is.</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">of any other being. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">T</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">his is why the limit of sentience </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(using the term as a convenient, if not strictly accurate, shorthand for the capacity to suffer or experience enjoyment or happiness</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">)</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. To mark this boundary by some characteristic like intelligence or rationality would be to mark it in an arbitrary way. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Why not choose some other characteristic, like skin color?</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now that moral equivalency is defined and we can determine it through the criteria of suffering or interests, we must look to see if nonhuman animals satisfy this. <strong>Hills</strong></span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Speciesism.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">****[4]****</a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Do non-human animals feel pain?</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To judge whether I felt pain, you used certain kinds of evidence.

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">These observations are backed up by ethological data, <strong>Sneddon<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Speciesism.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">**[5]**</a></strong> reports:</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Recognition</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> is defined as: the acknowledgement and action upon the existence of something.</span><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Animal rights</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> is defined as: respecting animals moral worth.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The <strong>Value</strong> of this round will be <strong>Justice</strong>. Prefer this because it links to the resolution harder than any other value, because the resolution uses the operative term justice.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The <strong>Standard</strong> of this round will be minimizing suffering. Prefer this for three reasons.</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If animals have moral worth, than it will be immoral and unjust to make them suffer.

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Contention 1</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – Discrimination</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Humans are naturally self-centered and speciesist. Our natural affinity for species superiority was first exploited by <strong>Hume<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Speciesism.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">**[6]**</a>:</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Why select so minute</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, so weak, so bounded </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">a principle as the reason </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and design </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">of animals </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">is found to be upon this planet </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">? What </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">peculiar </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">privilege</span></u></strong> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">has this </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">little agitationof the brain </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">which we call thought, that we must</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">thus </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">make it the model of the whole universe? Our partiality in our own favor does indeed present it on all occasions, but sound philosophy ought carefully to guard against so natural an illusion</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The concept that humans are anthropocentric leads to the discrimination and prejudice against other species. This unjust trait is explained in <strong>Dunayer 1<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Speciesism.docx#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">**[7]**</a></strong>:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Through massive and sustained exploitation, humans inflict enormous suffering on other animals. Humans generally justify their exploitation of other species by categorizing “animals” as inferior and therefore rightfully subjugated while categorizing humans as superior and naturally entitled to dominate. So inveterate and universal is the false dichotomy of animal vs. human</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">– and so powerfully evocative – that symbolically associating women with “anima;” assists in their oppression. Applying images of denigrated nonhuman species to women labels women inferior and available for abuse; attaching imagers of the aggrandizes human species to men designates them superior and entitled to exploit. Language is a powerful agent in assigning the imagery of animal vs. human. Feminists have long objected to “animal” pejoratives for women and the pseudogenerics <em>man</em> and <em>mankind</em>. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">These linguistic habits are rooted in speciesism, the assumption that other animals are inferior to humans and do not warrant equal consideration and respect.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">He then criticizes the connotation of the word animal and how humans uphold speciesism in a different sense. <strong>Dunayer 28</strong> writes:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When used to denote other species only, <em>animal</em> falsely removes humans from animalkind.</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">In parallel, through their male imagery the pseudogenerics <em>man</em> and <em>mankind</em> effectively exclude women from humankind. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By reserving <em>animal</em> for <em>other</em> animals, humans deny their kinship with nonhuman animals, abjuring membership in all groups larger than species</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – such as primatekind, mammalkind, and animalkind. </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This use of <em>animal</em> reflects the speciesist belief that humans fundamentally differ from all nonhuman animals and are inherently superior</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">On a more philosophical approach, humans display their anthropocentricism through a false sense of moral superiority. <strong>Korsgaard<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Speciesism.docx#_ftn8" rel="nofollow">**[8]**</a></strong> reads:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is left to us, the [only] rational beings, to declare that the things that are good for creatures</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> who have a final good are also the sources of normative laws: that a final good is as far as possible something to be respected, preserved, and promoted. The world contains final goods because it contains animals, and it contains morality because self-conscious animals demand as a matter of right that that final goods should be promoted and respected. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The world contains value, ultimately, because of us - because we are moral animals.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, humans’ prominent speciesism exists on three levels: The inherent, the physical, and the moral. All of these types of discrimination are unjust, because it makes humans unequal to animals – which they are not.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Contention 2</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – Animal Holocaust</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This speciesism is creating an animal holocaust in the status quo. The term Holocaust refers to much more than the immoral acts during World War Two, but rather refers to an entire ideology. <strong>Livingston<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Speciesism.docx#_ftn9" rel="nofollow">**[9]**</a></strong> explains:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Holocaust stands for much more than the one event. It represents a place and time when supremacist thinking was so embedded in a culture that they were blind or apathetic to the evil that existed in their everyday world. This kind of thinking is not exclusive to just that time and place. The great blind spot of </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">our country and </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Western Civilization</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">for that matter </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is the mistreatment and disregard for non-human animals in nearly every capacity</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The inherent speciesism of humans is causing this widespread ideology, and the mass genocide of animals. <strong>Prescott<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Speciesism.docx#_ftn10" rel="nofollow">**[10]**</a></strong> links the two:</span><br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 6pt;">“</span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">The very same mindset that made the Holocaust possible – that we can do anything we want to those we decide are 'different or inferior' – is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day. ... The fact is, all animals feel pain, fear and loneliness. We're asking people to recognize that what Jews and others went through in the Holocaust is what animals go through every day in factory farms</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 8pt;">.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The harms of this speciesism is ever apparent in factory farms and slaughter houses. The direct and evident links are summarized by <strong>Isacat<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Speciesism.docx#_ftn11" rel="nofollow">**[11]**</a></strong>:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Mass extinction is not the only human scourge on animals; animals live in a continuing holocaust. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Animal Holocaust is the mass destruction of animals by humanity</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and is a direct comparison with Nazi mass murder, particularly of Jews. The animals most often referred to in the Animal holocaust are domesticated animals that people raise for food. However, more generally, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Animal Holocaust victims include any animals </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and their populations </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that humans </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">control, systematically </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">abuse or destroy</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, such as fur-farmed animals, laboratory animals and free-living wild animals.</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Animal Holocaust resembles the Nazi perpetrated Holocaust in the use</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">of business-like </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">mass slaughter, mediated by transports (trains), factory farms (concentration camps) and slaughterhouses (death camps). Other pertinent comparisons </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">of animals with human Holocaust victims </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">are performing experiments on animal inmates and turning them into</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">commodities,</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> such as fur (skin goods) and fats (soap). </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Perhaps the most telling comparison is the contempt for the victims’ humane treatment</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and the widespread disregard for their rights</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">People today generally do not think of animals as beings</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">who are mutilated, tortured or slain; </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">animals are merely ‘animals’, there for the purpose of satisfying human needs</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Experimenting on nonhuman animals also displays abusive and unjust treatment of animals for the benefit of humans. <strong>Singer 23</strong> writes:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The same form of discrimination may be observed in the </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">widespread </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">practice of experimenting on other species in order to see if </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">certain </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">substances are safe for human beings</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, or to test some psychological theory about the effect of severe punishment on learning, or to try out various new compounds just in case something turns up.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In the past, argument about vivisection has often missed the point, because it has been put in absolutist terms: Would the abolitionist be prepared to let thousands die if they could be saved by experimenting on a single animal? The way to reply to this purely hypothetical question is to pose another: </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Would the experimenter be prepared to perform his experiment on an orphaned human infant</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, if that were the only way to save many lives</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">?</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(I say &quot;orphan&quot; to avoid the complication of parental feelings, although in doing so l am being overfair to the experimenter, since the nonhuman subjects of experiments are not orphans.) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If the experimenter is not prepared to use an orphaned human infant, then his readiness to use nonhumans is simple discrimination, since adult apes, cats, mice, and other mammals are more aware of what is happening to them, more self-directing and</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">so far as we can tell, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">at least as sensitive to pain, as any human infant. There seems to be no relevant characteristic that human infants possess that adult mammals do not have to the same or a higher degree.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(Someone might try to argue that what makes it wrong to experiment on a human infant is that the infant will, in time and if left alone, develop into more than the nonhuman, but one would then, to be consistent, have to oppose abortion, since the fetus has the same potential as the infant—indeed, even contraception and abstinence might be wrong on this ground, since the egg and sperm, considered jointly, also have the same potential. In any case, this argument still gives us no reason for selecting a nonhuman, rather than a human with severe and irreversible brain damage, as the subject for our experiments).”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, the harms are real and ever apparent from this speciesist mentality. The abuse and extraneous suffering at these animals expense just to benefit humans is not only discriminatory, but also unjust and unwarranted. Hence, through upholding animal rights and respecting their moral worth, this abuse would not occur. Through minimizing their suffering, I uphold the value of this round.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Overall: Speciesism is bad</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">As both <strong>Hills</strong> and <strong>Sneddon</strong> proved, animals can suffer. Because they can suffer, under <strong>Bentham</strong>’s rationale, all animals are on equal moral grounds. This will be impactful for two reasons.</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because animals are on equal moral grounds, justice requires that we treat them equally. If we refuse to respect their moral worth, we will be prolonging speciesism and not upholding justice. Hence, through recognizing animal rights – defined as respecting their moral worth – we will be treating equals equally. Thus affirming justice.</span></li><li><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Singer 1 </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">made the claim that “</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">” Thus, because animals can and do suffer, it is just to minimize that suffering. Through respecting their moral worth and ending the continuum of speciesism, we will end their unnecessary abuse and inhumane treatment that occurs in the status quo, thus upholding justice.</span></li></ol><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because justice requires the recognition of animal rights, I affirm.</span><br />

<strong><span style="background-color: white;">Justice</span></strong><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Biomed%20Plan.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">****[1]****</a><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">is defined by as</span><br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">Justice is</span><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>a concept of</u></strong></span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">moral</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">rightness based on</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">ethics</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, rationality</span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">,</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">law</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, natural law, religion,</span> <strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">fairness, or</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">equity</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">along with the punishment of the breach of said ethics.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Recognition</strong> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">is defined as: the acknowledgement and action upon the existence of something.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus the affirmative must defend some sort of action of existence rather than the arbitrary and abusive recognition of rights without implementation of said rights.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Animal Rights</strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> is defined as an immutable entitlement to not be treated in a means that causes suffering. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">You prefer this definition insofar as in order for a right to be just, it must be one’s due, yet if we make the right external to the actor, it can be and not be one’s due depending on the circumstances, but it then would still be a right that applies to one, but isn’t ones due, which is illogical. The affirmative definition renders a right as an intrinsic quality rather than as an external one, as that would be the only way for a right to be just. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The affirmative burden is to defend that the recognition of animal rights is just. The negative must defend the position of complete lack of rights, even to welfare. Otherwise, they would not be negating the resolution, as they would recognize animal rights on some level, which is properly affirmative ground.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Value:</strong> Justice<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The resolution uses the operative term justice and thus no other value will link to the resolution as hard.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Standard:</strong> Minimizing suffering<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Prefer this standard for two reasons.</span><br />
<br />
1. It is morally right to reduce suffering. <strong>Singer<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Biomed%20Plan.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">**[2]**</a></strong> writes<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In this passage <strong><u>Bentham points to the capacity for suffering as the vital characteristic that gives a being the right to equal consideration.</u></strong></span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> The capacity for suffering</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">—or more strictly, for suffering and/or enjoyment or happiness—</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is not just another characteristic like the capacity for language, or for higher mathematics</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Bentham is not saying that those who try to mark &quot;the insuperable line&quot; that determines whether the interests of a being should be considered happen to have selected the wrong characteristic</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The capacity for suffering </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and enjoying things</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is a prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare</span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">. A </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is.</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> equally</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> with the like suffering</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">of any other being. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account. This is why the limit of sentience (using the term as a convenient, if not strictly accurate, shorthand for the capacity to suffer or experience enjoyment or happiness) is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others. To mark this boundary by some characteristic like intelligence or rationality would be to mark it in an arbitrary way. Why not choose some other characteristic, like skin color?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, if animals suffer, it will be just to prevent their suffering, because there can be no moral justification for refusing to take their suffering into consideration. Justice is defined as moral rightness, and thus it will be just to prevent suffering.</span><br />
<br />
2. Minimizing suffering is the most morally urgent principle, and thus takes precedence over other ethical philosophies such as Utilitarianism or Deontology. <strong>Popper<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Biomed%20Plan.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">**[3]**</a></strong> writes:<br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The recognition that all moral urgency has its basis in the urgency of suffering or pain. I suggest</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, for this reason, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">to replace the utilitarian formula</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">‘Aim at </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number’, or briefly, ‘Maximize happiness’ by the formula ‘The least amount of avoidable suffering for all’, or briefly, ‘Minimize suffering’.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Such a simple formula can, I believe, be made one of the fundamental principles of public policy. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We should realize that from the moral point of view, suffering and happiness must not be treated as symmetrical; that is to say, the promotion of happiness is in any case much less urgent than the rendering of help to those who suffer</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and the attempt to prevent suffering.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore because all other moral urgencies are founded on the principle of suffering, prevention of suffering takes precedence over them. But even further, the ends of any other ethical philosophy come second to the pragmatic ends of minimizing suffering.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Plan:</strong> The United States Federal Government will use biomedical engineering to prevent the suffering of animals used in and raised for factory farms.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The concept of suffering and pain is found in the brain’s anterior cingulated cortex. <strong>Shriver 1<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Biomed%20Plan.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">**[4]**</a></strong> explains:</span><br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">This prospect stems from a new understanding of how mammals sense pain. </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">The brain</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, it turns out, </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">has two separate pathways for perceiving pain: a sensory pathway that registers its location</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, quality (sharp, dull or burning, for example) and intensity</span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">, and a so-called affective pathway that senses the pain’s unpleasantness. This second pathway appears to be associated with activation of the brain’s anterior cingulate cortex, because people who have suffered damage to this part of the brain </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">still feel pain but </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">no longer find it unpleasant.</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> (The same is true of people who are given morphine, because there are more receptors for opiates in the affective pain pathway than in the sensory pain pathway.)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This anterior cingulated cortex will be the focus of the biomedical engineering, because this is the place where the pain is translated into a feeling and into suffering. The unpleasantness, intensity, and severity of the pain derives itself from this location. The proposed process is summarized by <strong>Shriver 2</strong>:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Recently, scientists have learned to genetically engineer animals so that they lack certain proteins that are important to the operation of the anterior cingulate cortex. Prof. Min Zhuo</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> and his colleagues at the University of Toronto, for example, </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">[has] bred mice lacking enzymes that operate in affective pain pathways. When these mice encounter a painful stimulus</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, they withdraw their paws normally, but </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">they do not become hypersensitive to a subsequent painful stimulus, as ordinary mice do.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This groundbreaking research led to a more formal study with a pragmatic mechanization. <strong>Shriver 3</strong> writes:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Prof. Zhou-Feng Chen</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">and his colleagues here at Washington University </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">[has] engineered mice so that they lack the gene for a peptide associated with the anterior cingulate gyrus. Like the animals given brain lesions, these mice are normally sensitive to heat and mechanical pain, but they do not avoid situations where they experience such pain.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The impact of Chen’s study is that he took out a gene from the mouse genome, which in turn is also left out to the offspring. Therefore, in enacting this plan, each animal wouldn’t need to be biomedically engineered, rather only the first generation. <strong>Barnes<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Biomed%20Plan.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">**[5]**</a></strong> explains:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Huge advances have been made in understanding the chemical, molecular and genetic bases for pain. These advances allow us to manipulate how pain is experienced, and may allow us to eliminate the sensation of pain in farm animals.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Studies have been performed on rodents in which their pain receptors were suppressed or altered, and the results indicate that it is possible to reduce or eliminate pain in animals. In some humans experiencing chronic debilitating pain, a surgery has been performed to remove a part of the brain that registers pain. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">However, performing surgery to remove or alter pain-registering parts of the brain would be far too costly for farmers. The solution, then, would be to breed animals lacking the genes that cause them to feel pain.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally, the link from mice to mammals in factory farms is made apparent, <strong>Shriver 4</strong> writes:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Given the similarity among all mammals’ neural systems</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, it is likely that </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">scientists could genetically engineer pigs and cows in the same way. They both share equivocal anterior cingulated cortexes, rendering them subject to the same gene removal as rats. Because the sensory dimension of the animals’ pain would be preserved, they would still be able to recognize and avoid</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, when possible, </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">situations where they might be</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> bruised or otherwise </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">injured</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Topicality:</strong><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Upholds the definition of recognition, because we are not just acknowledging the animal rights, but also acting upon such rights, and for that reason it coincides with the first part of the resolution. A plantext inherently advocates an action upon a certain premise and thus the nature of the argument warrants the topicality to the term recognition.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Upholds the definition of animal rights, because my plan prevents the treatment of animals in a means that causes suffering. This is not effect-topical, because while my impacts will also achieve this, the plantext claims this statement. The plantext is to prevent the suffering of animals, and thus affirms the definition of animal rights. Hence, the diction of my plan warrants the topicality to the term animal rights.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I do not have to prove topicality of justice nor requires, because those are the premises on which we are debating.</span></li></ol><br />
<strong>Advantages:</strong><br />
<ol><li>Suffering of animals in Factory Farms</li></ol><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">In factory farms, animals are forced to go through treacherous torture and suffering. <strong>Frank<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Biomed%20Plan.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">**[6]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Factory farming, characterized by overcrowding, restricted movement, unnatural diets and unanesthesized surgical procedures utilizes intensive farming procedures in such a way that results in severe suffering for the farm animal.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">The poultry industry uses factory farming techniques in nearly every phase of poultry production and, consequently, most vividly illustrates the abuses of factory farming. However, factory farming occurs in the raising of all farm animalshogs, calves, dairy cows, cattle, and so forth. This section presents several examples of factory farming techniques and the cruelties they impose on farm animals.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">My plan inherently solves for the animal’s suffering in factory farms. <strong>Lent<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Biomed%20Plan.docx#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">**[7]**</a></strong> summarizes:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Shriver notes the unnecessary and often cruel suffering that farm animals undergo</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 4pt;">as they’re being prepared for our supermarket freezers. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">But then he offers hope of salvation, by applying genetic engineering as a method of modifying a crucial part of the brain. As a result, they would no longer suffer from the consciousness of that pain.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">By genetically engineering animals without anterior cingulated cortexes, the animals won’t be able to suffer. Hence, my plan inherently provides full solvency. The impact of this, is that minimizing suffering is morally right, and thus by preventing this many animals from succumbing to this much pain, I am providing an innumerable amount of moral rightness.</span><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Recognition </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is defined as: the acknowledgment and action upon the existence of something.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus the affirmative must defend some sort of action of existence rather than the arbitrary and abusive recognition of rights without implementation of said rights.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Animal Rights</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – Human rights</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> 1. Syllogism</span></strong><br />
a. Animal rights refer to a liberty granted to one or more animal species. <strong>Merriam-Webster<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Human%20Rights.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">**[2]**</a></strong> defines it:<br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">rights </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">(as to fair and humane treatment) </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">regarded as belonging fundamentally to any animal</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">This denotation must be preferred to any animal rights such as welfare or other opposing definitions, because it incorporates those definitions into a broad definition that augments the scope, and thusly the education of the debate.</span><br />
b. Homo Sapiens are animals. By neglecting to acknowledge that human beings also fall under this premise of animal rights, we will be enhancing the present speciesism in the real world. <strong>Dunayer<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Human%20Rights.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">**[3]**</a></strong> writes:<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When used to denote other species only, <em>animal</em> falsely removes humans from animalkind.</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">In parallel, through their male imagery the pseudogenerics <em>man</em> and <em>mankind</em> effectively exclude women from humankind. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By reserving <em>animal</em> for <em>other</em> animals, humans deny their kinship with nonhuman animals, abjuring membership in all groups larger than species</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – such as primatekind, mammalkind, and animalkind. </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This use of <em>animal</em> reflects the speciesist belief that humans fundamentally differ from all nonhuman animals and are inherently superior</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”</span><br />
c. Therefore, animal rights can refer to a liberty granted to homo sapiens. Hence, the definition is allowed under the syntax of the resolution.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> 2. </span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Humans are the only animals that can have rights</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Rights create an obligation, or contract, between the rights-bearers, and thus nonhuman animals cannot have rights. <strong>Scruton<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Human%20Rights.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">**[4]**</a></strong> reads:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Still, there are limits. Rights may have taken precedence over duties, but American jurisprudence has always been clear that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">rights cannot be had for free. Every legal privilege creates a burden on the one who does not possess it: your right may be my duty, and people who claim rights are also in the business of respecting them</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. <strong><u>Rights cannot be invented without also inventing the social and legal relations that enable us to uphold them, and</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">the shopping list of </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">rights will therefore be </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">severely</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">limited</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>by</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">social custom and </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">human nature</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">The conservative hope is that, at a certain point, common sense will prevail. &quot;If you invent any more rights,&quot; people then will say, &quot;you will find yourself in a society where nobody respects them. In other words, you will have destroyed the very benefit that you sought to extend.&quot; And it seems to me that the birth of &quot;communitarianism&quot; as a posture within the American liberal tradition is really a recognition of this possibility, and of the underlying truth that a society cannot be based in rights alone but must also inculcate a strong sense of duty in its members, if rights are to be anything more than useless bits of paper. Rights ought not to be given but purchased, and the price is duty. You can have many things on the cheap; but the moral life isn't one of them.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">But this brings us face-to-face with what is, to my mind, the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview, one that promises to sow even more confusion than liberalism inherently requires: the growing advocacy of &quot;animal rights.&quot; </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Properly understood, the concept of a right—</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the attendant ideas of duty, responsibility, law, and obedience—enshrines what is distinctive in the human condition</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. To spread the concept beyond our species is to jeopardize our dignity as moral beings, who live in judgment of one another and of themselves.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">To build upon this responsibility that rights entail: Rights require that you take others rights into consideration when you act, and thusly impose positive and negative duties – which nonhuman animals can’t uphold. <strong>Cohen<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Human%20Rights.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">**[5]**</a></strong> explains:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The differing targets, contents, and sources of rights, and their inevitable conflict, together weave a tangled web. Notwithstanding all such complications, this much is clear about </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">rights</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in general: they </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">are</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in every case</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">claims</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, or potential claims, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">within a community of moral agents. Rights arise, and can be intelligibly defended, only among beings who actually</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">do, or </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">can, make moral</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">claims against one another</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Whatever else rights may be, therefore, they are necessarily human</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">; </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">their possessors are</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">persons, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">human beings</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Secondly, rights bearers must be able to step outside of their own self-interests in order to do what is just for the whole moral community. <strong>Cohen 2</strong> reads:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Animals (that is, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">nonhuman animals</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, the ordinary sense of that word) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">lack this capacity for free moral judgment. They are not</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">beings of a kind </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">capable of exercising or responding to moral claims. Animals therefore have no rights, and they can have none</span></u></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">This is the core of the argument about the alleged rights of animals. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The holders of rights must have the capacity to comprehend rules of duty, governing all including</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">themselves</span></u></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> In applying such rules</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the holders of rights must recognize possible conflicts between what is in their own interest and what is just.</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">Only in a community of beings capable of self-restricting moral judgments can the concept of a rights be correctly invoked.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, humans are the only animal that can be a rights-bearer because they can comprehend the rules of duty governing all of a society. Moreover, humans can step outside of their own self-interests, while nonhuman animals cannot.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> 3. Syllogism</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> a. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The resolution mandates rights for one or more animal</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> b. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Humans are the only animals that can have rights, as my Cohen and Scruton cards discuss.</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> c. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, the resolution mandates rights for humans.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> 4. H</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">uman rights are animal rights</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because animals must live in a social world without spiritual substance, any arguments about equal morality, suffering as the brightline, or other Singer related arguments, only further affirm human rights. <strong>Zizek<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Human%20Rights.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">**[6]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One of the divisions in </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the chapter on reason in Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit speaks about</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">das geistige Tierreich (the spiritual animal kingdom) or </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the social world that lacks any spiritual substance, so that, in it, individuals effectively interact as “intelligent animals.”</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">They use reason, but only in order to assert their individual interests, to manipulate others into serving their own pleasures. Is not a world in which the highest rights are human rights precisely such a spiritual animal kingdom, a universe? There is, however, a price to be paid for such liberation – in such a universe, human rights ultimately function as animal rights. This, then, is the ultimate truth of Singer: our universe of human rights is the universe of animal rights.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, the animal rights which the resolution discusses, truly means to evaluate human rights, because they are the operative rights in the universe we live in.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> 5. </span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nonsensicality</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">If we don’t accept human rights, the resolution would become nonsensical.</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> a. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If nonhuman animals morally cannot have rights, nor be rights-bearers, than it would not be just on an ecocentric paradigm to require their rights. Justice is defined as moral rightness, and if something requires a morally prohibited object, than it wouldn’t be just. Therefore, Justice cannot require rights to nonhuman animals.</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> b. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Furthermore, if you do look to an alternate definition of animal rights, it would make the resolution nonsensical. Justice cannot require an unjust action, and thus the resolution wouldn’t make sense. Because nonsensical statements like heplgrrr cannot be false, you must affirm.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Burden:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> The affirmative must prove that the recognition of human rights is just, while the negative must prove the reciprocal – that the recognition of human rights is unjust.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">They are equitable on three essential terms, <strong>Donnelly<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Human%20Rights.docx#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">**[7]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Human rights are <em>equal</em> rights: one either is or is not a human being, and therefore has the same human rights as everyone else</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (or none at all). </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">They are also <em>inalienable</em> rights: one cannot stop being human, no matter how badly one behaves nor how barbarously one is treated. And they are <em>universal</em> rights, in the sense that today we consider all members of the species <em>Homo sapiens</em> “human beings,” and thus holders of human rights.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Moreover, human rights create a moral universality. <strong>Donnelly 2</strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If human rights are the rights one has</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">simply </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">because on is a human beings</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, as they usually are thought to be, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">then they are held “universally,” by all human beings. They also hold “universally” against all other persons and institutions. As the highest moral rights, they regulate the fundamental structures and practices of political life, and</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> in ordinary circumstances </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">they take priority over other moral, legal, and political claims. These dimensions encompass what I call the <em>moral universality</em> of human rights.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally, they create a pragmatic equity that can be seen in implementation in the real world today. <strong>Donnelly 3</strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Human rights in the contemporary world are universal in another sense: they are</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">almost </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">universally accepted</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, at least in word, or </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">as ideal standards. All states regularly proclaim their acceptance of and adherence to international human rights norms, and charges of human rights violations are among the strongest complaints that can be made in international relations. Three quarters of the world’s states have undertaken international legal obligations to implement these rights</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> by becoming parties to the International Human Rights Covenants, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">and</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> almost </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">all other nations have otherwise expressed approval of and commitment to their content. I call this the <em>international normative universality</em> of human rights.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<ol><li><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">b. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Human rights uphold fairness</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The natural human rights must override the welfare of others, in order to be fair to everyone and not give any being an unfair moral worth. <strong>Rawls<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Human%20Rights.docx#_ftn8" rel="nofollow">**[8]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It has seemed to many philosophers</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and it appears to be supported by the convictions of common sense, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that we distinguish as a matter of principle between the claims of liberty and right </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">on the one hand </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">and the desirability of increasing aggregate social welfare </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">on the other; </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">and that we give a certain priority, if not absolute weight, to the former.</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Each member of society is thought to have an inviolability founded on justice or, as some </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">say, on natural right, which even the welfare of everyone else cannot override. Justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others. The reasoning which balances the gains and losses of different persons as if they were one person is excluded. Therefore in a just society the basic liberties are taken for granted and the rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to the calculus of social interests.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Furthermore, this idea of the inviolability of rights, is explained on a political and pragmatic level by <strong>Kant<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Aff/Flow%20Aff%20-%20Human%20Rights.docx#_ftn9" rel="nofollow">**[9]**</a></strong>:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Such are the desperate conclusions to which we are inevitably driven if we do not assume that the pure principles of right have an objective reality</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, i.e. that they can be applied in practice. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">And whatever empirical politics may say to the contrary, the people within the state, as well as the states in their relations with one another, must act accordingly. A true system of politics cannot therefore take a single step without first paying tribute to morality</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. And although politics in itself is a difficult art, no art is required to combine it with morality. For as soon as the two come into conflict, morality can cut through the know which politics cannot unite.</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The rights of man must be held sacred, however great a sacrifice the ruling power may have to make. There can be no half measures here; it is no use devising hybrid solutions such as a pragmatically conditioned right halfway between right and utility. For all politics must bend the knee before right</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, although politics may hope in return to arrive, however slowly, at a stage of lasting brilliance.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, human rights are both equitable and fair, and uphold a sense of moral rightness.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Overall, because justice requires things that are morally right, and human rights are morally right, justice requires human rights. Hence, I affirm.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Justice </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is defined as: Giving each their due</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Requires</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> is defined as: Necessitates</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, rights restrict ones freedoms and bind people to responsibilities that they must carry out. For example, the right to speech prohibits you from physically stopping someone from voicing their opinion</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The </span><strong>Value</strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> for this round will be justice, because the resolution uses the operative term justice. Thus, if I prove it is unjust to give nonhuman animals rights, I will win this round.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 1</strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">:</span></strong>Animals cannot possess rights<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This whole debate focuses on the justice of animal rights, but if animals cannot have rights than animal rights cannot be just, because they cannot exist. Nonexistent things are neither just nor unjust; and, moral permissibility will thusly flow neg, because the term requires creates a binding obligation for the affirmative to prove. Therefore, if I prove that Animals cannot be rights-bearers than I win this round.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Subpoint A</strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">: </span></strong>Rights create responsibilities<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">As I noted in the analytic after my definition for rights, rights create an obligation or responsibility to carry out in order to uphold that right. <strong>Scruton<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Lay%20Neg%20-%20Moral%20Obligation.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">**[2]**</a></strong> explains:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Still, there are limits. Rights may have taken precedence over duties, but American jurisprudence has always been clear that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">rights cannot be had for free. Every legal privilege creates a burden on the one who does not possess it: your right may be my duty, and people who claim rights are also in the business of respecting them</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. <strong><u>Rights cannot be invented without also inventing the social and legal relations that enable us to uphold them, and</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">the shopping list of </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">rights will therefore be </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">severely</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">limited</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>by</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">social custom and </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">human nature</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">The conservative hope is that, at a certain point, common sense will prevail. &quot;If you invent any more rights,&quot; people then will say, &quot;you will find yourself in a society where nobody respects them. In other words, you will have destroyed the very benefit that you sought to extend.&quot; And it seems to me that the birth of &quot;communitarianism&quot; as a posture within the American liberal tradition is really a recognition of this possibility, and of the underlying truth that a society cannot be based in rights alone but must also inculcate a strong sense of duty in its members, if rights are to be anything more than useless bits of paper. Rights ought not to be given but purchased, and the price is duty. You can have many things on the cheap; but the moral life isn't one of them.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">But this brings us face-to-face with what is, to my mind, the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview, one that promises to sow even more confusion than liberalism inherently requires: the growing advocacy of &quot;animal rights.&quot; </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Properly understood, the concept of a right—</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the attendant ideas of duty, responsibility, law, and obedience—enshrines what is distinctive in the human condition</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. To spread the concept beyond our species is to jeopardize our dignity as moral beings, who live in judgment of one another and of themselves.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, humans are the only being that can be rights-bearers because they can fulfill this responsibility and duty that comes with rights. If you have rights, than you must also abide by such rights and uphold them to other beings, which animals just cannot do. <strong>Cohen</strong> summarizes it:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The differing targets, contents, and sources of rights, and their inevitable conflict, together weave a tangled web. Notwithstanding all such complications, this much is clear about </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">rights</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in general: they </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">are</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in every case</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">claims</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, or potential claims, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">within a community of moral agents. Rights arise, and can be intelligibly defended, only among beings who actually</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">do, or </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">can, make moral</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">claims against one another</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Whatever else rights may be, therefore, they are necessarily human</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">; </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">their possessors are</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">persons, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">human beings</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Subpoint B:</strong> Animals don’t have objective moral judgment<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Without this ability to step outside of their own personal interests, animals cannot uphold justice nor be bound to rights that protect others interests as well as their own. <strong>Cohen 2</strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Animals (that is, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">nonhuman animals</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, the ordinary sense of that word) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">lack this capacity for free moral judgment. They are not</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">beings of a kind </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">capable of exercising or responding to moral claims. Animals therefore have no rights, and they can have none</span></u></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">This is the core of the argument about the alleged rights of animals. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The holders of rights must have the capacity to comprehend rules of duty, governing all including</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">themselves</span></u></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> In applying such rules</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the holders of rights must recognize possible conflicts between what is in their own interest and what is just.</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">Only in a community of beings capable of self-restricting moral judgments can the concept of a rights be correctly invoked.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, because animals cannot be held accountable for the duties entrusted to beings through rights nor can animals step away from their own interests to uphold justice, animals cannot possess rights.</span><br />
<br />
My <strong>Alternative</strong> is: Humans have a moral obligation to treat animals humanely<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Cohen 3<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Lay%20Neg%20-%20Moral%20Obligation.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">**[3]**</a></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> describes the situation:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It does not follow from this</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, however, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that we are morally free to do anything we please to animals</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Certainly not. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In our dealings with animals</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, as in our dealings with other human beings, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">we have obligations that do not arise from claims against us based on rights</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Rights entail obligations, but many of the things one ought to do are in no way tied to another’s entitlement. Rights and obligations are not reciprocals</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> of one another, and it is a serious mistake to suppose that they are.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This allows for moral obligations without rights being enacted, justifying the assertion made by <strong>Korsgaard<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Lay%20Neg%20-%20Moral%20Obligation.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">**[4]**</a>:</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">“</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is left to us, the rational beings, to declare that the things that are good for</span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">creatures</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">who have a final good are also the sources of normative laws:</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that a final good is as far as possible something to be respected, preserved, and promoted</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">The world contains final goods because it contains animals, and it contains morality because self-conscious animals demand as a matter of right that that final goods should be promoted and respected. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The world contains value, ultimately, because of us - because we are moral animals.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally, the moral obligation is indeed moral, as pointed out in <strong>Singer<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Lay%20Neg%20-%20Moral%20Obligation.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">**[5]**</a></strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">of any other being. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account. This is why the limit of sentience (using the term as a convenient, if not strictly accurate, shorthand for the capacity to suffer or experience enjoyment or happiness) is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others. To mark this boundary by some characteristic like intelligence or rationality would be to mark it in an arbitrary way. Why not choose some other characteristic, like skin color?”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because animals can and do suffer, it is just to minimize this suffering, or to treat animals humanely. And because animals cannot be rights-bearers, humans have a moral obligation to treat animals humanely.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus, I negate.</span><br />

<strong>Link</strong>/<strong>Violation</strong>:<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">My opponent advocated for dismantling and ending factory farms, claiming that this would minimize animals suffering, which they deemed just. I agree that minimizing suffering is just, but I believe that ending the factory farms is not the proper means of achieving this end. Factory farms are a pragmatic source of both revenue and human happiness.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Factory Farms are essential for the economy.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">My opponent’s arguments of ending factory farms, actually don’t minimize suffering.</span><br />
<br />
1. Meat is good for the economy<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">My opponent’s arguments would lead to a dismantling and banning of the animal products industry. This industry is a vital part of the economy. <strong>Dunham<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Factory%20Farms%20K.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">**[1]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">The Meat and Poultry Industry </span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">Economic Impact study measures the combined impact of the meat processing, poultry processing, hide and skin production and offal production industries (hereafter meat and poultry products). The industry is defined to include not only the production of meat and poultry based products, but meat distribution and retailing. The industry </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">contributes about $832 billion in total to the US Economy, or just under 5.8 percent of GDP and, through its production and distribution linkages, impacts firms in all 509 sectors of the US economy.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">The production process (as defined in this study) begins in one of four ways. In the case of slaughtering, livestock (including cows, pigs, sheep, goats, etc.) are purchased from farmers and brought to slaughterhouses for conversion into raw meat sides. Meat and poultry packers use either live animals (like chickens) or slaughtered meat products and convert these to either fresh or packaged meat. Alternatively, hides and skins are purchased from slaughterhouses and converted to raw (untanned) leather or fur products. Finally, offal such as livers, pancreases, and intestines are purchased from farmers, packers or slaughterhouses and processed for food or medical uses. The 8,370 firms that convert livestock to useful products or directly import meat into the United States are denoted as producers. All told,these firms employ over 524,500 people in production or importing operations, sales, packaging, and direct distribution. Once meat and poultry products have been produced or imported, they enter the second tier of the industry – the wholesaling tier. We estimate that there are nearly 4,100 firms involved in the wholesale supply of meat and poultry products throughout the country (not including wholesaling operations directly owned and operated by the major packers). Wholesalers are involved in the transportation of meat and poultry products from the producers or a bonded warehouse operated by importers, and the storage of products for a limited period of time. The wholesaling tier of the industry directly employs around 63,000 individuals in every state in the country. Finally, the third tier of the industry directly sells products to the consumer. This can either be through on-premises sales (as in the case of a restaurant), or for off-premises consumption (grocery stores, butchers, etc.) For this analysis, the retail tier is assumed to consist of firms in the following industries: Restaurants and taverns, grocery stores, meat and fish markets, fruit and vegetable markets, dairy products stores, retail bakeries and miscellaneous food stores. While there are obviously other venues that may sell meat and poultry products to the public – street vendors, cruise lines, non-profit groups, etc. they are not included in the analysis due to limited data availability or the small amount of product that they handle. We estimate that</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">there are approximately 1,227,600{one million, two hundred thousand} employees whose jobs depend on the sale of meat and poultry products to the public.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus, a significant portion of the US economy depends on this industry.</span><br />
<br />
2. Taking away this vital part would lead to global economic peril.<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Getting rid of a vital part of our economy at this point would be catastrophic, as the global economy is on the brink of collapse. <strong>Haskell<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Factory%20Farms%20K.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">**[2]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Furthermore this double dip that we are close to achieving would cause a global influx. <strong>Bradford<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Factory%20Farms%20K.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">**[3]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />

<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">History bears out that desperate nations take desperate actions.

As the studies showed, rapid escalation to full WMD exchange occurs. Today, a great percent of the WMD arsenals that will be unleashed, are already on site within the United States itself.</span></em> <strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">The resulting great Armageddon will destroy civilization as we know it, and</span></u></strong><strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">perhaps</span></strong><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">most of the biosphere</span></u></strong><strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, at least for many decades</span></strong><strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 1pt;">.</span></strong><br />
<br />
4. Existential risk<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Extinction level risk is the greatest harm possible. It causes complete suffering and a complete lack of happiness, welfare, and other moral objectives. Thus even its possibility is reprehensible. Any existential risk to extinction that can be prevented will be moral. <strong>Bostrom</strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Even if we use the most conservative of these estimates</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">, which entirely ignores the possibility of space colonization and software minds, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">we find that the expected loss of an existential catastrophe is greater than the value of </span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">1018 <strong><u>{one quintillion}</u></strong></span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">human lives. </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">This implies that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere</span></u></strong><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">one millionth of one percentage point</span></u></em></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">is at least ten times the value of a billion human lives. </span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> The more technologically comprehensive estimate of 1054 human-brain-emulation subjective life-years (or 1052 lives of ordinary length) makes the same point even more starkly. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Even if we give this allegedly lower bound on the cumulative output potential of a technologically mature civilization a mere 1% chance of being correct, we find that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere</span></u></strong><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">one billionth of one billionth of one percentage point</span></u></em></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">is worth a hundred billion times as much as a billion human lives.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore because of the magnitude of existential risk and the lives we could save from minimizing the risk slightly, factory farms shouldn’t be abolished. While they might cause minor suffering to animals in the factory farms, the inherent harms of abolishing it – one quintillion human lives lost – severely outweighs any amount of suffering at its expense. Furthermore, Bostrom’s conservative statistic neglects the animals, and other moral entities deaths, which would only augment the impact of abolishing factory farms.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Counter-plan:</strong> The United States Federal Government will use biomedical engineering to prevent the suffering of animals used in and raised for factory farms.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The concept of suffering and pain is found in the brain’s anterior cingulated cortex. <strong>Shriver 1<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Factory%20Farms%20K.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">**[5]**</a></strong> explains:</span><br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">This prospect stems from a new understanding of how mammals sense pain. </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">The brain</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, it turns out, </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">has two separate pathways for perceiving pain: a sensory pathway that registers its location</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, quality (sharp, dull or burning, for example) and intensity</span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">, and a so-called affective pathway that senses the pain’s unpleasantness. This second pathway appears to be associated with activation of the brain’s anterior cingulate cortex, because people who have suffered damage to this part of the brain </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">still feel pain but </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">no longer find it unpleasant.</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> (The same is true of people who are given morphine, because there are more receptors for opiates in the affective pain pathway than in the sensory pain pathway.)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This anterior cingulated cortex will be the focus of the biomedical engineering, because this is the place where the pain is translated into a feeling and into suffering. The unpleasantness, intensity, and severity of the pain derives itself from this location. The proposed process is summarized by <strong>Shriver 2</strong>:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Recently, scientists have learned to genetically engineer animals so that they lack certain proteins that are important to the operation of the anterior cingulate cortex. Prof. Min Zhuo</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> and his colleagues at the University of Toronto, for example, </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">[has] bred mice lacking enzymes that operate in affective pain pathways. When these mice encounter a painful stimulus</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, they withdraw their paws normally, but </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">they do not become hypersensitive to a subsequent painful stimulus, as ordinary mice do.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This groundbreaking research led to a more formal study with a pragmatic mechanization. <strong>Shriver 3</strong> writes:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Prof. Zhou-Feng Chen</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">and his colleagues here at Washington University </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">[has] engineered mice so that they lack the gene for a peptide associated with the anterior cingulate gyrus. Like the animals given brain lesions, these mice are normally sensitive to heat and mechanical pain, but they do not avoid situations where they experience such pain.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The impact of Chen’s study is that he took out a gene from the mouse genome, which in turn is also left out to the offspring. Therefore, in enacting this plan, each animal wouldn’t need to be biomedically engineered, rather only the first generation. <strong>Barnes<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Factory%20Farms%20K.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">**[6]**</a></strong> explains:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Huge advances have been made in understanding the chemical, molecular and genetic bases for pain. These advances allow us to manipulate how pain is experienced, and may allow us to eliminate the sensation of pain in farm animals.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Studies have been performed on rodents in which their pain receptors were suppressed or altered, and the results indicate that it is possible to reduce or eliminate pain in animals. In some humans experiencing chronic debilitating pain, a surgery has been performed to remove a part of the brain that registers pain. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">However, performing surgery to remove or alter pain-registering parts of the brain would be far too costly for farmers. The solution, then, would be to breed animals lacking the genes that cause them to feel pain.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally, the link from mice to mammals in factory farms is made apparent, <strong>Shriver 4</strong> writes:</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Given the similarity among all mammals’ neural systems</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, it is likely that </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">scientists could genetically engineer pigs and cows in the same way. They both share equivocal anterior cingulated cortexes, rendering them subject to the same gene removal as rats. Because the sensory dimension of the animals’ pain would be preserved, they would still be able to recognize and avoid</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">, when possible, </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">situations where they might be</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> bruised or otherwise </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">injured</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Solvency:</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because the plantext will implement this, the animals suffering will be holistically reduced; while maintaining their lives, and thus it extends.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Competition:</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The plans are mutually exclusive, because the affirmative is abolishing factory farms, while I’m keeping factory farms and just preventing any suffering from the animals. Hence both plans cannot be permed.</span><br />

<strong>Observation 1</strong>: <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Humans are the actors of any rights, and thus will implement the rights for the animals. <strong>Scruton<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">**[1]**</a></strong> explains:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Still, there are limits. Rights may have taken precedence over duties, but American jurisprudence has always been clear that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">rights cannot be had for free. Every legal privilege creates a burden on the one who does not possess it: your right may be my duty, and people who claim rights are also in the business of respecting them</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. <strong><u>Rights cannot be invented without also inventing the social and legal relations that enable us to uphold them, and</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">the shopping list of </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">rights will therefore be </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">severely</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">limited</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>by</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">social custom and </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">human nature</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">The conservative hope is that, at a certain point, common sense will prevail. &quot;If you invent any more rights,&quot; people then will say, &quot;you will find yourself in a society where nobody respects them. In other words, you will have destroyed the very benefit that you sought to extend.&quot; And it seems to me that the birth of &quot;communitarianism&quot; as a posture within the American liberal tradition is really a recognition of this possibility, and of the underlying truth that a society cannot be based in rights alone but must also inculcate a strong sense of duty in its members, if rights are to be anything more than useless bits of paper. Rights ought not to be given but purchased, and the price is duty. You can have many things on the cheap; but the moral life isn't one of them.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">But this brings us face-to-face with what is, to my mind, the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview, one that promises to sow even more confusion than liberalism inherently requires: the growing advocacy of &quot;animal rights.&quot; </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Properly understood, the concept of a right</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">—and the attendant ideas of duty, responsibility, law, and obedience—</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">enshrines what is distinctive in the human condition</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. To spread the concept beyond our species is to jeopardize our dignity as moral beings, who live in judgment of one another and of themselves.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, rights and their respective responsibilities can only be carried out by humans. If we extend rights to animals, humans will be the enablers of such rights. If animals could act upon these rights, they would have rebelled against their abuse long ago, but rather humans must carry out the rights for them. Thus, humans are the actors, so all of the moral obligations entailed to animal rights only apply to humans.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Burden:</strong> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The affirmative must prove that the recognition of animal rights is just, while the negative will have to prove the reciprocal – that the recognition of animal rights is unjust. Furthermore, if the debate comes to a wash, you will prefer negative, because permissibility flows neg. The phrase justice requires in the resolution creates a binding obligation for the affirmative to prove, while if it is permissible or prohibited, it will flow neg.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Harms:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1. Coercion:</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is not only immoral and unjust to force humans into this moral obligation of recognizing animal rights, but also strips them of a fundamental human right: Liberty. As written by <strong>Benjamin Franklin<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">**[2]**</a></strong>:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">all men</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">are created equal, that they </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</span></u></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Declaration of Independence</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Locke</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> also agrees with this conception of the fundamental right to liberty. <strong>Locke<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">**[3]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Man being born</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, as has been proved, with a Title to perfect Freedom, and an uncontrouled enjoyment of all the Rights and Privledges </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">of the Law of Nature</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, equally with any other Man, or Number of Men in the World, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">hath by Nature a Power</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, not only </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">to preserve</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">his Property, that is</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">his Life, Liberty and Estate</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus it is paramount that to be human you are granted liberty and that liberty cannot be infringed without the consent of the people. Therefore, by affirming this resolution you are dehumanizing humanity and oppressively stripping their right to liberty.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>2. Universal Justice</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Rights are moral obligations to do something or act in some manner, <strong>Gillon<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">**[4]**</a></strong> explains:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Essentially, rights entail moral obligations that require action or restraint from others-that is, impose positive or negative duties</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">on others. An enormous variety of rights are claimed, ranging from so called human rights, via rights to unemployment benefits and free prescriptions, to the right to sit at high table or use the executives' lavatory.</span><br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 7pt;">Gillon, Raanan. &quot;Philosophical Medical Ethics.&quot; </span><em><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 7pt;">British Medical Journal</span></em><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 7pt;"> 290. 22 June 1985. 1890-1891. Print.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Furthermore, morality is a subjective value that changes from person to person. This subjectivity – or different perspectives of what is good or bad– is warranted by <strong>Nietzsche</strong> <strong>1<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">**[5]**</a></strong>:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Against positivism, which halts at phenomena -- &quot;There are only facts&quot; -- I would say: No, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">facts are precisely what there are not, only interpretations. We cannot establish any fact &quot;in itself&quot; -- perhaps it is folly to want to do such a thing…</span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In so far as the word &quot;knowledge&quot; means anything, the world is knowable; but it is interpretable otherwise, it has no meaning behind it, but countless meanings.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Perspectivism</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot;”</span><br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 8pt;">Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. </span><em><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 8pt;">The Will to Power</span></em><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 8pt;">. New York: Random House, 1967. Print</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because morality is grounded in facts, and facts change from person to person, there cannot be any universal moral obligation across all beings, as the resolution presupposes. Hence, justice cannot require the recognition of animal rights, because the moral obligation from animal rights, is not universally just. Some people might think it is moral, but inherently others will not. Thus animal rights don’t affirm justice.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>3</strong>: <strong>Rights are speciesist</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">a. Humans are the actors of any animal rights.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Cross-apply my observation 1, which shows that humans are the actors of animal rights. Hence, through humans carrying out these animal rights, we still extend our dominance over animals, and thus maintain our speciesism. Animal rights falsely give animals any moral value.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">b. Rights are a human construct. </span><strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 11pt;">Pigliucci</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 11pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">[6</a>]</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">To begin with, as I have argued in this column before, “</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">rights</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 3pt;">”</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">are not a feature of the natural world, but rather an entirely human construct</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. That, of course, doesn’t mean they are not interesting or important. Democracy is also a human construct, but its existence or lack thereof affects the lives of billions on the planet. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The fact that</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">rights are a human construct</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, however, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">means that we cannot appeal to</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">the laws of </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">nature to defend </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">any particular viewpoint about </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">them</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus if rights were extended to animals, it would extend humans legislative dominance over animals. This continuum of humans inherent speciesism is bad. Hence placing rights on animals only exerts humans dominance even more.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">c. Rights are based on human-interests. <strong>Hume<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">**[7]**</a></strong> responds:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Why select so minute, so weak, so bounded a principle as the reason and design of animals is found to be upon this planet ? </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What peculiar privilege has this little agitation of the brain</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">which we call thought, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that we must thus make it the model of the whole universe?</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Our partiality in our own favor does indeed present it on all occasions, but sound philosophy ought carefully to guard against so natural an illusion</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">We can thusly see that rights and other universal concepts imposed by humans are only for humans benefit. These concepts and ideals are for the self-interests of our species rather than for the universe, and thus won’t benefit animals. Our control and prolonged dominance over animals is out of selfish drives that furthers speciesism and doesn’t provide a solution to the problem.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, we can sufficiently conclude that rights are a speciesist construct.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Violation:</strong> Affirmative affirms rights, yet opposes speciesism.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The affirmative inherently affirms rights through affirming the resolution, yet discusses ending speciesism and links his impacts to this. As I have sufficiently proven, rights are speciesist and thus the affirmative cannot garner his impacts, but even further he augments the impacts through affirming a speciesist construct – rights.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Impacts:</strong><br />
1. Aff harms of speciesism will still exist<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because the affirmative isn’t actually solving for speciesism, and is furthering speciesism through new means of speciesism being introduced to the status quo, you can see that rather than preventing speciesism, he is compounding and expanding the harms of speciesism. Hence, all of his impacts can be turned, because through affirming rights, he is causing those harms.</span><br />
<br />
2. Speciesism leads to exploitation and suffering<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This anthropocentric view point causes a discrimination against other species. This is summarized by <strong>Danayer<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn8" rel="nofollow">**[8]**</a></strong>:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Through massive and sustained exploitation, humans inflict enormous suffering on other animals. Humans generally justify their exploitation of other species by categorizing “animals” as inferior and therefore rightfully subjugated while categorizing humans as superior and naturally entitled to dominate. So inveterate and universal is the false dichotomy of animal vs. human</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">– and so powerfully evocative – that symbolically associating women with “anima;” assists in their oppression. Applying images of denigrated nonhuman species to women labels women inferior and available for abuse; attaching imagers of the aggrandizes human species to men designates them superior and entitled to exploit. Language is a powerful agent in assigning the imagery of animal vs. human. Feminists have long objected to “animal” pejoratives for women and the pseudogenerics <em>man</em> and <em>mankind</em>. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">These linguistic habits are rooted in speciesism, the assumption that other animals are inferior to humans and do not warrant equal consideration and respect.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This speciesist view that humans posses, causes this exploitation, suffering, and trauma. Danayer discussed it in a general sense, but it can refer to anything as specific as factory farms. <strong>Prescott<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn9" rel="nofollow">**[9]**</a></strong> links the two:</span><br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 6pt;">“</span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">The very same mindset that made the Holocaust possible – that we can do anything we want to those we decide are 'different or inferior' – is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day. ... The fact is, all animals feel pain, fear and loneliness. We're asking people to recognize that what Jews and others went through in the Holocaust is what animals go through every day in factory farms</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 8pt;">.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This massive quantity of suffering is achieved through speciesist means, and thus the affirmative’s rights will only build to this suffering.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Alternative:</strong> People will exercise their Will to Power to achieve the humane treatment of animals.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Instead of using rights, Nietzsche proposes the will to power, as the primary mechanism for achieving something of moral value. He explains how the Will to Power weighs morals in <strong>Nietzsche 1<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn10" rel="nofollow">**[10]**</a>:</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>Only where there is life, is there also will: not, however, Will</u></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>to Life, but- so teach I thee- Will to Power!</u></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one; but</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> out of the very reckoning speaketh- the Will to Power!&quot;-</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Thus did Life once teach me: and thereby, ye wisest ones, do I solve</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> you the riddle of your hearts.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>Verily, I say unto you: good and evil which would be everlasting- it</u></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>doth not exist! Of its own accord must it ever surpass itself anew.</u></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>With your values and formulae of good and evil, ye exercise power,</u></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>ye valuing ones</u></strong>: </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and that is your secret love, and the sparkling,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> trembling, and overflowing of your souls</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Here he explains what the Will to Power is, a means of establishing morals. But it truly is more than just that, and thus I define the Will to Power as: the driving force that allows individuals to develop morals, gain self-conscientiousness, and reach their potential. This concept allows each individual to justify their own set of morals, through their unadulterated justification. <strong>Nietzsche 2<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn11" rel="nofollow">**[11]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />

Not to cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher men, into whose peculiar torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight.</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Not to cleave to a science</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries, apparently specially reserved for us. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Not to cleave to one’s own liberation</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird, which always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it – the danger of the flier. Not to cleave to our own virtues, nor become as a whole a victim to any of our specialties, to our “hospitality” for instance, which is the danger of dangers for highly developed and wealthy souls, who deal prodigally, almost indifferently with themselves, and push the virtues of liberality so far that it becomes a vice.</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One must know how to conserve oneself – the best test of independence.”</span></u></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This type of self-reflective moral value establishes each individual’s moral framework. Hence, it is up to each person to will the humane treatment of animals. </span><br />
<br />
<strong>Solvency:</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">People will inherently uphold this individual moral standard to reduce the suffering of animals and to treat them humanely. Many people in the status quo already exert their Will to Power of minimizing animal suffering. Philosophers such as Korsgraard, Singer, Sytzbel and Newkirk as well as many profound leaders of PETA has all justified on their own terms that it is moral to treat animals humanely. Therefore, you can see that people can, do, and will Will to Power this human treatment of animals.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Will to Power establishes moral obligations for each individual based on their self-reflecting justifications. This moral obligation, however, necessitates action, because these self reflective values mandate an action. <strong>Bond 1<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/Flow%20Neg%20-%20Nietzsche%20and%20Rights%20K.docx#_ftn12" rel="nofollow">**[12]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />

It seems to me that if we are to be really clear on this question, </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and if </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">we wish to incorporate value into our account</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, we must make a fourfold distinction as follows: (1) the first-order motivational system or system of urges or inclinations, (2) second-order desires or reflective wants, (3) the system of valuations or value beliefs, and (4) actual values or goods attainable by action.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nietzsche’s Will to Power is a reflective want in which the people self-justify their moral claims, thus providing their own values. This type of inclination is necessary to discuss action. <strong>Bond 212</strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We may act, either on the promptings of some urge</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> or inclination, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">or in order to satisfy some reflective want</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, though neither kind of want <em>necessitates</em> action</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. Ideally, actual knowledge of some kind of good </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(or, if not that, true belief that something is kind of good), </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">will produce a reflective want that will, </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">possible with the aid of self-discipline or external influence</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, produce or reinforce a disposition to be inclined</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, in appropriate circumstances, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">to act so as to achieve goods of that kind. And unless there is some greater apprehended good</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> to be achieved by attention or by some other action</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, these inclinations will be acted upon</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. I take this to exemplify practical wisdom, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">in Aristotle’s sense</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, together with (in each case) at least one of the moral virtues, as these are conceived by Aristotle. Next best, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">an effort of will is requires to act so as to achieve the apprehended good, since such an action is opposed by inclination. I would take this to be identical to Kant’s reason determining the will, except that it would apply in non-moral as well as in moral cases.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus, if there is a will or value present it will necessitate an action. Bond narrowed action down to either a prompting or a reflective want. But this leaves it open to attack of urgings that don’t lead to action. He settles this in his last remarks, <strong>Bond 312</strong> reads:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">According to Gauthier, it is my reflective wants that provide me with self-regarding justifying reasons for action. In other words value</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, for me</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, lies in the satisfaction of these wants. Non-reflective wants, although they may motivate me, do not constitute reasons of any kind. I do not act <em>for</em> them; they impel me to act. According to Rawls and Richards, the satisfaction of any want constitutes a good for the wanter</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and the frustraction of any want an evil. Of course one wants some things more than others, and the satisfaction of a more powerful want is a greater good than the satisfaction of a weaker one.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, because the Will to Power is a reflective want, its values and goods require an action from the wanter. Rawls, Richard, and Gauthier agree that you act <em>for</em> the reflective want rather than the reflective want merely compelling an action.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, the Will to Power would provide solvency because it leads to an action, that directly minimizes suffering or treats animals humanely. Moreover, this solves for the speciesism harms, because it won’t press a human construct over all beings, rather moral judgment is a universal construct. Furthermore, it would reduce the current speciesism harms by actively reducing the suffering of animals. Next, it discusses the subjectivity of itself, solving for the problem of the universal justice, and finally, it allows everyone to establish their own moral value, and thus upholds the right to liberty.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, I affirm</span><br />

<strong>Disad:</strong> Dolphins shouldn’t be let free<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">1. Dolphins gang-rape other animals against their will. <strong>Sundara<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/DisAd%20-%20Dolphin%20Rape.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">**[1]**</a> 1</strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: #f3efe8; font-size: 10pt;">Researchers have been studying the sexual behaviour of dolphins intensely for the last decade, after it was discovered they</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: #f3efe8; font-size: 5pt;"> not only partake in homosexual activity (read more HERE), but also </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: #f3efe8; font-size: 10pt;">gang-rape and kidnap females who don’t reciprocate their sexual advances.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #f3efe8; font-size: 10pt;">She furthers by analyzing the research in <strong>Sundara</strong> <strong>2:</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: #f3efe8; font-size: 10pt;">I</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background-color: #f3efe8; font-size: 10pt;">n order to coerce the reluctant females, males form groups of two or three – often remaining together in their search for sexual gratification for well over a decade. When they find a suitable female they literally force her to mate with one or more of the group, and have even been known to herd their unwilling consorts for months at a time, basically using them as their personal sex-slaves.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #f3efe8; font-size: 10pt;">Next, another analysis of dolphin rape is explained by</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When we talk about dolphin rape it's always gang-rape. For a creature with only flippers living in a water world there is no way a single male dolphin to commit rape so they bring friends. They raid pods and male alliances</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(when they have their girl) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">kidnapping a female by surrounding her in order force her away with them. These poor females are kept for weeks even months being repeatedly raped.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">A personal narrative of the story was written by a marine biologist. <strong>Eries</strong></span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Sept-Oct/Neg/DisAd%20-%20Dolphin%20Rape.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">****[2]****</a><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> 1</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">It gets better. There is even a recording of dolphin rape (audio) according to this </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 5pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s1052990.htm" rel="nofollow">page</a></span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Here is the testimony by </span><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dr Liz Hawkins</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> writes.</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One day in front of the Cape we recorded a group of dolphins. And what it looked like was 4 males pursuing and chasing a female who really didn’t want to be chased. And she would basically put her genitals above the water and she’d keep putting her belly above the water so the males couldn’t get to her. And as she did that there was a really intense emission of whistles, and basically it was the same whistle being called over and over and over again and it was quite a distressed type of call</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">2. </span><span style="background-color: #f3efe8; font-size: 10pt;">Dolphins gang-rape humans</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #f3efe8; font-size: 10pt;">She next describes the uniqueness of dolphin’s gang-rape in <strong>Sundara 3:</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #f3efe8; font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>Although dolphins are not alone in the animal world of gang-rapists, research suggests they’ve the perfected the art to a degree unseen in any other species, and it seems they don’t limit their advances to their female partners, either: there are several reports claiming divers and swimmers have also been accosted.</u></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The latter part has prominent impacts to humans, <strong>Eries 2</strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dolphins are also known to have interspecies sex with other dolphins</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, porpoises and humans!!?! Here is </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">an excerpt from a CNN report in June 2002</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> about George (a horny male dolphin) which tried to hump humans.</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Georges is a bottlenose dolphin and has made Weymouth harbour, Dorset his home for the summer. Thousands of people have been swimming with him and watching him from boats, but his behavior starting changing a month ago. Ric O'Barry, the trainer on the show 'Flipper' was brought in to investigate and has apparently seen this behavior before. 'When dolphins get sexually excited, they try to isolate a swimmer, normally female. They do this by circling around the individual and gradually move them away from the beach, boat or crowd of people.' O'Barry said the dolphin would get very excited and rough before trying to mate with a swimmer, </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">possibly</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> causing them to drown.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, the harms coming off of releasing dolphins from captivity, is that you are increasing the amount of free dolphins that have already been accustomed to humans, and thusly are inherently increasing rape, suffering, and drowning. These unjust impacts show that the plantext doesn’t affirm justice.</span><br />

 <br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The affrimative burden</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> is to prove the resolution true. The traditional value/criterion model is only a means to this end, thus if the affirmative can prove this independently, it is sufficient for an affrimative ballot. Prefer this burden for two reasons:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">1. As the true/false burden is a factual affrimation of the resolution, it stands prior to any other evaluation. In order to provide any other correct understanding of the resolution this problem must first be solved, and the burden is central to any educational value to be derived from this debate, as any other means would only be scraping the surface of the philosophical depth of the resolution. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">2. A true/false burden is the most predictable one to be posed as the resolution is the only resource either debater is provided with pre-round, and the understanding of the truth or falsity of a statement is the most intuitive understanding possible, as it requires no presuppositions other than what is provided by the most basic definition of the resolution.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">In order to determine what is true in context of this resolution, I offer some <strong>definitions</strong>:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Individuals</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> is defined by the Oxford Dictionary<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Boy%20Scouts.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]</span> as the plural of a <strong><u>single human being as distinct from a group</u></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, I can either prove that more than one person has such obligation or that a group has such obligation. I will prove both. We have to look to the denotation of the word, because it is the only predictable definition available to both people pre-round. If I had to prove every individual or a majority of individuals, the resolution would have specified.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">A <strong>Moral obligation</strong> is a duty or commitment to one’s morals. Morals are defined by Merriam-Webster Dictionary<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Boy%20Scouts.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2</a>]</span> as </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">expressing or teaching a</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">conception of right behavior.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, I have to show that individuals express that they acknowledge a duty to assist people in need. If they have a conception of this duty– even without acting upon such conception – it meets my burden of proof.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, my burden in this debate is to prove that either more than one person or a group acknowledges a duty to assist people in need.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">To center the debate more, I offer some <strong>observations</strong>.</span><br />
<br />
<ol><li><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">The true/false burden comes apriori to any comparative worlds or philosophical burdens. Proving a utilitarian, consequentialist, deontological, contractarian, or other such burdens only exist to prove the resolution true/false. Thus, proving it true/false supersedes any such burdens. Do not let the negative place such a burden on me, proving the resolution true is the upmost way to affirm the resolution.</span></li><li>If morality does not exist then you must affirm. If it is proven that morality is not real then the resolution becomes nonsensical, because it calls into question something that does not exist. Nonsensical things cannot be false, and thus you must affirm.</li><li>Conflicting obligations still affirms. If one has an obligation to do one thing, but also has an obligation to another maxim then both obligations have to exist, in order for them to be conflicting. If the obligation exists, then you must affirm.</li><li>If the debate comes to a wash, presume affirmative for two reasons.</li></ol><ul><li>First, because if they cannot prove the resolution false than there is a chance of offense that it is true. They have to prove in its entirety that the resolution is false.</li><li>Second, because of the heavy affirmative time-skew. I have to respond to 7 minutes of negative constructive and extend 6 minutes of affirmative in just 4 minutes. If the debate is still a wash at the end of the round, I will have done enough with a time-skew to deserve the ballot.</li></ul><br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">My one and only <strong>contention</strong> is the Boy Scouts of America.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">I will show you that Boy Scouts have a moral obligation to assist others in need, through the Scout Oath.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Every Boy Scout has to memorize, understand, and pledge to the scout oath in order to be a Boy Scout. This oath is repeated at the beginning of every meeting and is central to the ideology of scouting as a whole. The <strong>Scout Oath<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Boy%20Scouts.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">**[3]**</a></strong> reads:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">On my honor, I will do my best</span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To do my duty to God and my country;</span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To obey the Scout Law;</span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To help other people at all times;</span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">In order to show how this oath affirms the resolution, I will prove <strong>solvency</strong>, or how the Boy Scouts manages to prove the resolution true.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">My burden, established at the top of the case, is to prove that either more than one person or a group acknowledges a duty to assist people in need.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">The first part of that is to prove that the Boy Scouts of America is truly either multiple people or a group. Boy Scouts is in fact a group, and thusly meets that criteria of the burden. Colin <strong>French</strong><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Boy%20Scouts.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">[4</a>]</span>, the director of administration of Boy Scouts of America writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Boy Scouts of America is one of the nation's largest and most prominent values-based youth </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">development</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> organizations</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The BSA provides a program for young people that builds character, trains them in the responsibilities of participating citizenship, and develops personal fitness.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, it is a group based on morals. But further, there is more than one person in boy scouts. <strong>Alvin Townley</strong> in his book, <em>Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influences of America’s Eagle Scouts<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Boy%20Scouts.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">**[5]**</a></em> writes: about</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Each of these Eagle Scouts belongs to a tradition begun in 1910. Almost a century later, the founders of the Boy Scouts would be proud of their legacy and the men it has produced. AS Chief Scout Executive James West and his partners envisioned, only a small number of youth had the perseverance to reach Eagle: Of the </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">110 million boys</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">who </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">have joined the Scout movement [since it began]</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, just shy of 2 million have reached its pinnacle. The group that did finish has made a tremendous mark on the world. As a result of their lives, the Eagle Scout has become an American icon, universally known as hard-working, successful, and honest, whether his silver medal hangs proudly on his khaki uniform or lies buried in his cluttered attic, unseen for fifty years.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, there is more than one individual with such moral obligation. I have proved the first caveat of my burden. The next is that it indeed a moral obligation. John <strong>Eastman<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Boy%20Scouts.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">**[6]**</a></strong> in <em>Liberty</em> magazine writes:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">For nearly a century </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the Boy Scouts has been</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> singularly</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> successful in its mission of instilling in young boys a sense of their moral obligations </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">to God, country, and family</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. Such moral training was thought by the Founders to be essential</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> in a republican form of government. The Declaration of Rights affixed to the beginning of the Virginia Constitution of 1776, for example, provides “that no free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles.” The Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 echoes the sentiment: “The happiness of a people, and the good order and preservation of civil government, essentially depend upon piety, religion, and morality.” And the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 went even further, asserting that “laws for the encouragement of virtue, and prevention of vice and immorality, shall be made and constantly kept in force, and provision shall be made for their due execution.” </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Boy Scouts pledge themselves to a duty to uphold a sense of moral standard at each meeting, in order to enter scouting, and everyday of their lives. Thus, the Boy Scouts have proved the second caveat of the burden. Finally, I have to prove that it is towards assisting people in need. The Boy Scout’s Oath reads:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">On my honor, I will</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> do my best</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">To </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">do my duty</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">to God and my country;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">To obey the Scout Law;</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">To help other people at all times</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, Boy Scouts, being a group consisting of more than one person, does in fact have a moral obligation to assisting people in need. They acknowledge and pledge a duty to help other people at all times. Therefore, over 110 million youth prove this resolution true.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">My burden was to only prove the resolution true, and I have done that. I have proven that </span><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">both more than one person and a group acknowledges a duty to assist people in need.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, I affirm.</span><br />

<strong>Definitions</strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I define <strong>Individuals</strong> as a general quantity of people. It would be abusive for me to have to prove every single individuals, while the negative would only have to prove one individual does not.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Next, I define <strong>in need</strong> as </span><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">a condition or situation in which something necessary for humanity is required. Therefore, the individuals have to assist others that are in a life-threatening situation. Prefer this definition for two reasons:</span><br />
<br />
<ol><li><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">This is how it is defined in the topic literature with major authors such as Singer, and thus this is the most predictable definition for this debate.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">This sets up an actual brightline or distinction between those that are in need and those that are not.</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">In order to center this debate more, I offer 3 <strong>observations</strong>:</span><br />
<ol><li>If morality does not exist then you must affirm. If it is proven that morality is not real then the resolution becomes nonsensical, because it calls into question something that does not exist. Nonsensical things cannot be false, and thus you must affirm.</li><li>Conflicting obligations still affirms. If one has an obligation to do one thing, but also has an obligation to another maxim then both obligations have to exist, in order for them to be conflicting. If the obligation exists, then you must affirm.</li><li>If the debate comes to a wash at the end of the round, presume affirmative, because of the time-skew. I have to respond to 7 minutes of negative case and extend 6 minutes of affirmative case in just 4 minutes. If the debate comes to a wash at the end of the round, then I will have done the better job debating as I would have beaten back as much as my opponent with more of a time-skew. Thus you presume the better debater.</li></ol><br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">In this debate, I </span><strong><span style="background-color: white;">value</span></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;"> <strong>morality</strong> because the resolution is centered on the evaluative term moral obligation. In order to determine what is moral, I pose the</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="background-color: white;">Meta-Ethic </span></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">of Social Interaction. This meta-ethic accurately describes how morals originate for 4 reasons:</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;"> Social Interaction is necessary for moral self-reflection, <strong>Sandel<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Communitarian.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">**[1]**</a></strong> </span><em><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 8pt;">professor of philosophy at Harvard </span></em><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">writes:</span></li></ol><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To imagine a person incapable of constitutive attachments</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> such as these </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is not to conceive an ideally free and rational agent, but to imagine a person wholly</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> without character, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">without moral depth. For to have character is to know that I move in a history</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> I neither summon nor command, which carries consequences nonetheless for my choices and conduct. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It draws me closer to some and more distant from others</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">; it makes some aims more appropriate, others less so. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As a self-interpreting being, I am able to reflect on my history and in this sense to distance myself from it, but the distance is always precarious and provisional, the point of reflection never finally secured outside the history itself.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, in order for any moral self-reflection to occur, one must make their own history through their interactions with others and the causes of such actions. Self-reflection is necessary for morality.</span><br />
<br />
2. Humans are naturally social beings<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">For any moral theory to be so, it must take into account human nature. If humans are inherently social, then moral theories are required to be inclusive of this. <strong>Sayers<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Communitarian.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">**[2]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Specifically, they agree in rejecting the account of the individual and society which is at the basis of traditional liberal social philosophy in both its utilitarian and rights-based forms. In this philosophy the individual is portrayed as having a nature and an identity which exists prior to and independent of its social relations and social roles; and society is conceived as a mere aggregate of such individuals, each endowed with individual rights and pursuing its own conception of the good. By contrast, these writers insist, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">we are </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">essentially </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">social beings. All our distinctively human and moral characteristics are constituted socially and historically. Our desires and values, our ability to reason and choose, our very being and identity as human agents and moral selves, are formed only in and through our social relations </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and roles. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There is such a thing as society, and it is prior to and constitutive of the individual</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">What Taylor calls the `atomic' individual and Sandel the `unencumbered' self of liberal social theory is a myth.”</span><br />
<br />
3. The only time in which morality is needed to guide action is when multiple individuals are involved. Therefore, social interaction is necessary for a moral obligation, and thus theories absent of this meta-ethic are not relevant to this debate and don’t provide grounds for proper debate.<br />
<br />
4. We use social attachments to shape our rationalities, and thus we use the rationalities of others to form the basis of own. Because it is not imposed, does not deny the fact that supposedly independent rationalities interact with each other in an intrinsic way that extends beyond an individual human body. We cannot draw brightlines between rationalities without accounting for socialization.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore in order to understand rationality or morality at all, we must recognize the concept of social interaction, and take that into account. Because of this meta-ethic, my </span><strong>value criterion</strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> is:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Communitarianism</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, an ethical theory that claims that morals are derived from our society and that we in turn have to obligations to our society due to those morals. <strong>Whipps<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Communitarian.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">**[3]**</a></strong> explains:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Communitarianism doesn't deny the value of autonomy, but shifts the focus of political </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">or public </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">decision-making to the community as foundation for meaning and authority. While liberalism elevates one's personal choices and </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">personal </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">responsibilities, communitarianism highlights each person's responsibility to the communal welfare, a type of social commitment often missing from liberalism.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Prefer this ethical system for two reasons:</span><br />
<ol><li>Communitarianism is the only ethical theory that accounts for social interaction. Judy <strong>Whipps 2</strong> writes:</li></ol><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">“As Will Kymlicka says of liberal constructions of self [says] and culture, &quot;no particular task is set for us by society, no particular practice has authority that is beyond individual judgment and possible rejection&quot; (1990, 210). In this construction, the self is also often in competition with other autonomous beings.8 As many communitarians point out, [However] this way of thinking ignores the extent to which </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">individual freedom and sense of meaning is possible only within community. Ignoring this dependence on community allows us also to ignore our responsibility</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> to community.</span><span style="font-size: 1pt;">”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, only by recognizing the duties to the community, are any moral actions able to be derived. Hence, only communitarianism can properly illustrate morality.</span><br />
<br />
2. The community allows the individual to be distinguished. <strong>Sandel 2</strong> writes:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">I do not think we can, at least not without cost to those loyalties and convictions whose moral force consists partly in the fact that living by them is inseparable from understanding ourselves as the particular persons we are-as members of this family or community or nation or people, as bearers of that history, as citizens of this republic. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">[Social] Allegiances such as [community] </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">these </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">are more than values I happen to have</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and to hold, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">at a certain distance. They go beyond the obligations I voluntarily incur and the &quot;natural duties&quot; I owe to human beings as such. They allow that to some I owe more than justice requires</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">or even permits</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, not by reason of agreements I have made but instead in virtue</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">of those more or less enduring</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> attachments and </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">commitments that</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, taken together, partly </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">define the person I am.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, the community is necessary in order to understand yourself. For these two reasons, you prefer a communitarianism framework, but even further, they prompt the:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Observation 4:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Communitarianism comes as an a priori to other ethical theories. The first justification proved that morality is derived from the community, and for this reason, any ethical theory must first start there. Next, the second justification showed that communitarianism defines the individual. Thus, any ethical theory that is based on autonomy or the individual must first recognize and function under a communitarian framework. All of our obligations firstly arise in the community and thus ANY ethical theory must function below a communitarian one.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Contention 1: </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There exists an obligation to assist those in need.</span><br />
<br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">a. A moral obligation is necessary for the community</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Without such obligation, the community would collapse, therefore collapsing morality. <strong>Etzioni<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Communitarian.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">**[4]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Responsiveness is the cardinal feature of</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> authentic </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">communities. If the values the community foster</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">s and the form of its structure (allocation of assets, application of power, shapes of institutions, and mechanisms of socializatio</span><span style="font-size: 1pt;">n</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">do not reflect its members' needs</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, or reflect only the needs of some, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">the community's order will be imposed </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> rather than truly supported. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">And in the long run, imposed order is unstable </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(indeed ultimately disorderly) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">and threatens the autonomy of individual members</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> and subgroups.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, without having the obligation to those in need, a community will indeed collapse upon itself, and won’t be able to function. Furthermore, individual autonomy will collapse and thus any other ethical theory will as well. Hence, without recognizing the needs of members, morality will not exist. As per my observation 1, this then affirms.</span><br />
<br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">b. The moral obligation exists under communitarianism. <strong>Fuller<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Communitarian.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">**[5]**</a></strong> writes:</span></li></ol><br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">These very questions are at the root of the theoretical solutions to the issue of </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">poverty, welfare and </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">providing basic needs</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">. Libertarianism suggests that welfare policies are actually counterproductive in the distribution of goods Even worse than that, government dictation of who receives what goods and income and coerced taxation is morally bankrupt and an affront to individual liberty. Welfare is just another roadblock that hinders free market capitalism. Meanwhile, </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">communitarianism offers a</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> drastically different </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">solution to the issues of </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">poverty, </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">human needs and welfare. Communitarians acknowledge individual rights but also </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">suggest </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">the individual's obligations to the community. Welfare policies are not only just but are necessary programs </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">that provide the less fortunate members of the community. They do not believe the libertarian contention that increasing government programs would damage a free market system. However, </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">welfare recipients </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">also </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">have a responsibility to </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">rise above the poverty line and </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">reach sustainability in</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> addition to</span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;"> their rights of dignity and basic human needs</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;"> Therefore, inherent in any community is one’s obligation to members without basic human needs.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Hence, I affirm.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Definitions:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I define <strong>moral obligation</strong> as the individuals Will to Power. Nietzsche first describes what the Will to Power is in <strong>Nietzsche 1<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Nietzsche%20Will%20to%20Power.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">**[1]**</a>:</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Only where there is life, is there also will: not, however, Will</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">to Life, but- so teach I thee- Will to Power!</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one; butout of the very reckoning speaketh- the Will to Power!&quot;-Thus did Life once teach me: and thereby, ye wisest ones, do I solveyou the riddle of your hearts</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Verily, I say unto you: good and evil which would be everlasting- it</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">doth not exist! Of its own accord must it ever surpass itself anew. With your values and formulae of good and evil, ye exercise power,</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">ye valuing ones</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">: and that is your secret love, and the sparkling,trembling, and overflowing of your souls.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Here, Nietzsche explains that instead of binding to society’s morals and projections of good and evil, we must use our own values and justifications to determine morality. I define the Will to Power as: the driving force that allows individuals to develop morals, gain self-conscientiousness, and reach their potential. This is the motive which establishes obligations. <strong>Nietzsche 2<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Nietzsche%20Will%20to%20Power.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">**[2]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A man who WILLS commands something within himself which renders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience.</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> But now let us notice what is the strangest thing about the will,-this affair so extremely complex, for which the people have only one name. </span></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND the obeying parties</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other hand, </span></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term &quot;I&quot;: a whole series</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of </span></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">false judgments about the will itself, has become attached to the act of willing-to such a degree that he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the command-consequently obedience, and therefore action-was to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word</span></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, he who wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. &quot;Freedom of Will&quot;-that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order- who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful &quot;underwills&quot; or under-souls-indeed, our body is but a social structure composed of many souls-to his feelings of delight as commander.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, the Will to Power inherently establishes a moral obligation on the actor of such will. Thus the Will to Power is a means of obligations, and a sufficient obligation for affirming the resolution.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I define <strong>Individuals</strong> and <strong>People</strong> as more than one person, but not necessarily every person, because it would be unfeasible and completely ridiculous for the affirmative to prove that every individual has a moral obligation to everyone else’s well-being. Eisenhower in no way should have had an obligation to Hitler, and insofar as there are exceptions to the rule, the rule cannot stand. Thus I don’t have to prove a totality, but rather that a general amount of individuals have a moral obligation to a general amount of other people.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I reserve the right to clarify any other definitions in cross-x.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I <strong>Value</strong> morality because the resolution is centered on the evaluative term ‘moral obligation’ which calls into question what is moral. The concept of morality must come as an a priori to any moral obligation, because if something isn’t moral than it can’t be a moral obligation.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">To achieve morality, I will use the <strong>Standard</strong> of subjectivity. Prefer this standard for two reasons.</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Morality is subjective. Morality is grounded in facts, and facts are just our interpretations of the ‘fact’. <strong>Nietzsche 3<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Nietzsche%20Will%20to%20Power.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">**[3]**</a></strong> explains:</span></li></ol><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Against positivism, which halts at phenomena -- &quot;There are only facts&quot; -- I would say: No, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">facts are </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">precisely what there are not, only interpretations. W</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">e cannot establish any fact &quot;in </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">itself&quot; -- perhaps it is f</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">olly to want to do such a thing. In so far as the word </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&quot;knowledge&quot; means anything, the world is kn</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">owable; but it is interpretable </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">otherwise, it has no meaning behind it, but countless meanings</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. -- &quot;Perspectivism.&quot;</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Here, Nietzsche claims that there exists infinite interpretations, perspectives, and opinions of the truth and of morality. What is wrong and right varies from person to person, and thus morality itself is subjective. <strong>Olson<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Nietzsche%20Will%20to%20Power.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">**[4]**</a></strong> furthers:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">looking at one of Nietzsche’s specific postulations of perspectivism, we can get a better idea of precisely how this term applies to his philosophy and how it relates to the “truthfulness” of his other claims.</span></u></strong> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In</span></u></strong><strong><em><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Beyond Good and Evil</span></u></em></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, Nietzsche</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> begins with a chapter entitled “On the Prejudices of Philosophers.” Almost immediately he </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">begins to tear into the lack of integrity on the part of traditional philosophers who present their ideas as the product of pure reason. </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nietzsche declaims, “they pose as having discovered and attained their real opinions through the self-evolution of a cold, pure, divinely unperturbed dialectic</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">: while what happens at bottom is that a </span><em><span style="font-size: 5pt;">prejudice</span></em><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, a notion, an ‘inspiration,’ generally a desire of the heart sifted and made abstract, is defended by them with reasons sought after the event” (<em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, which will be referred to as </span><em><span style="font-size: 5pt;">BGE</span></em><span style="font-size: 5pt;">,I.5). </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus, philosophical insights are not the universal claims to truth that philosophers have presented them as and wished them to be. </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The philosophy of an individual is precisely that, not a product “of a cold, pure, divinely unperturbed dialectic.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nietzsche claims that because each individual has their own perspective of what is good and bad, than their outlook establishes their morals, not pure philosophical rhetoric by someone else’s perspective. These differences in morality alone prove the notion of perspectivism and for that reason morality is subjective. Thus to uphold morality, subjectivity must be used.</span><br />
<br />
2. Moral obligations are subjective. <strong>Zimmerman<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Nietzsche%20Will%20to%20Power.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">**[5]**</a></strong> writes:<br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: NewCenturySchlbk-Roman,serif; font-size: 5pt;">It is with overall moral obligation that the </span><em><span style="font-family: NewCenturySchlbk-Italic,serif; font-size: 5pt;">morally conscientious </span></em><span style="font-family: NewCenturySchlbk-Roman,serif; font-size: 5pt;">person is primarily concerned. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: NewCenturySchlbk-Roman,serif; font-size: 10pt;">When one wonders what to do in a particular situation and asks, out of conscientiousness, ‘What ought I to do?’, the ‘ought’ expresses overall moral obligation. ‘Ought’ here is a contrary of ‘wrong’. Conscientiousness precludes deliberately doing what one believes to be overall morally wrong.</span></u></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Here Zimmerman notes that moral obligations are based on one’s belief of right and wrong. Because everyone believes their own set of right and wrong, and their own forms of morals, than everyone’s moral obligations of what they ought to do are based fundamentally on their subjective morals. This idea is furthered by <strong>Ross<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Nietzsche%20Will%20to%20Power.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">**[6]**</a></strong>:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When people express different opinions about the rightness or wrongness of an act, the difference is</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">often </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">due to</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> the fact that one of them is thinking of objective and the other of </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">subjective rightness. The recognition of the difference</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">between the two </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is therefore in itself important as tending to reconcile what might otherwise seem irreconcilable differences of opinion.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, because people do have opposing opinions on what is right and wrong, there exists such subjective obligations, rather than purely objective ones. Therefore because there are both subjective morals and obligations, subjectivity not only upholds the value and resolution, but allows for competing interpretations of morality.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus the <strong>Burden</strong> for the affirmative will be to prove that some individuals establish their own moral obligations to assist others in need. Insofar as I prove a general amount of people will such obligations, I will win this round. The negative burden is to either prove that the Will to Power isn’t a moral obligation or that no individual has a moral obligation to assist people in need.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Observation 1:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> As the affirmative, I only have to prove that such an obligation exists. Whether the obligation actually helps others, or other excessive burdens would be extra-topical. Insofar as any such obligation exists you must affirm.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 1:</strong> Exercising the Will to Power<br />
<br />
<ol><li>A. Self-reflective obligations</li></ol><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><br />
</span><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; font-size: 10pt; text-align: left;">The whole philosophy of Nietzsche and thus the subject moral obligation relies on the Will to Power. This concept of the Will to Power encourages people to only do what they themselves justify as moral. <strong>Nietzsche 42</strong> writes:</span></span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One must subject oneself to one’s own test that one is destined for independence and command</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and do so at the right time. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One must not avoid one’s tests</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous game one can play, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">and are in the end tests made only before ourselves and before no other judge. Not to cleave to any person, be it even the dearest</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">– every person is a prison and also a recess. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Not to cleave to a fatherland, be it even the most suffering and necessitou</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">s</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> – it is even less difficult to detach one’s heart from a victorious fatherland. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Not to cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher men</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, into whose peculiar torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Not to cleave to a science</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries, apparently specially reserved for us. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Not to cleave to one’s own liberation</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird, which always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it – the danger of the flier. Not to cleave to our own virtues, nor become as a whole a victim to any of our specialties, to our “hospitality” for instance, which is the danger of dangers for highly developed and wealthy souls, who deal prodigally, almost indifferently with themselves, and push the virtues of liberality so far that it becomes a vice. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One must know how to conserve oneself – the best test of independence.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The means of implementing the Will to Power is for each individual to exercise it themselves and self-justify their morals and obligations based on their own independent rationale, without influence from others. Hence, each individual will have their own moral obligations.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Furthermore, allowing people to exercise their Will is not only acceptable under Nietzschean ethics, but rather necessitated. The subjective moral guideline that the Will to Power establishes will be ethical and affirm the resolution.</span><br />
<br />
<ol><li>B. Willing to assist people in need</li></ol><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><br />
</span><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; font-size: 10pt; text-align: left;">People will inherently uphold this individual moral obligation to assist others in need. Many of the prominent affirmative authors have already exerted their Will to Power and solitarily justified their moral standards which resulted in helping others in need. Philosophers such as Singer and Korsgaard have self-justified their moral obligations. Even further many parents have justified their moral obligation to assist their children in need. The list of examples goes on and on, but the general principle is that through their own self-justification many people already do have the moral obligation to assist people in need, and thus you must affirm. Insofar as a general amount of individuals have such moral obligation you must affirm.</span></span><br />
<br />
<ol><li>C. Infinite possibilities</li></ol><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><br />
</span><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; font-size: 10pt; text-align: left;">If you don’t believe the high possibility of a general amount of people willing a moral obligation to assist people in need, the fact that the universe is infinite in size makes it one hundred percent true. <strong>Bostrom<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Affirmative/Aff%20-%20Nietzsche%20Will%20to%20Power.docx#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">**[7]**</a></strong> writes:</span></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Recent </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">cosmological </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">evidence suggests that the world is</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">probably </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">infinite</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Moreover</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">,</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> [If] </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the totality of physical existence </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">[it </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">]indeed </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">infinite</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, in the kind of way that modern cosmology suggests it is, then </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">it contains an infinite number of galaxies, stars, and planets. If there are an infinite number of planets then there is, with [a] probability [of] one, an infinite number of people. Infinitely many of these people</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>are</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">happy, infinitely many are [and] unhappy. Likewise for other local properties that are plausible </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">candidates for having value</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, pertaining to person</span><span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 5pt;">‐</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">states, [or] lives, or entire societies, ecosystems, or civilizations—there are infinitely many democratic states, and infinitely many that are ruled by despots, etc.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Insofar as there is a probability of one that there exists an infinite number of people, an infinite many of these people will exercise their Will to Power to establish their moral standards, moreover, an infinite number of those people will Will to assist others in need, and thusly an infinite amount of people will take it upon themselves to establish a moral obligation to assist a general quantity of people in need. Because of the infinite possibilities in the universe and the nature of the Will to Power in a Nietzschean paradigm, you must affirm.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally, if the debate comes to a wash, presume affirmative, because with the risk of offense of an infinite universe, the moral obligation will exist and thus affirm.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Overall:</strong> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because morality is subjective, and Nietzschean ethics takes this into account, Nietzschean ethics will be the best philosophy to use in this round. Furthermore, the Will to Power establishes a subjective moral obligation, which directly coincides with the ethical framework. Finally, there exists a moral obligation to assist people in need under the Will to Power. Hence, I affirm.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Value: Morality</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The resolution is centered on the evaluative term moral obligation, which necessitates morals.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">My <strong>standard</strong> for upholding morality is <strong>deontology. Kant<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Negative/Neg%20-%20Test%20Infinity%20Bitch.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">**[1]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />

<strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Every rational being, exists as an end in himself </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">and not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that will. </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Beings whose existence depends not on our will but on nature have, nevertheless, if they are not rational beings, only a relative value as means and are therefore called things</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">. On the other hand, rational beings are called</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">persons</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> inasmuch as </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">their nature</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> already </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">marks them</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> out </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">as ends in themselves</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, in order for people – rational beings, to have any morality ascribed to them, we must seek to treat them as ends in themselves. Furthermore, the reason of giving them value is explained in the <strong>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Negative/Neg%20-%20Test%20Infinity%20Bitch.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">**[2]**</a></strong>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 3pt;">The most influential position on these issues is found in the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant (1785, 1788, 1797). Indeed, most contemporary discussions of respect for persons explicitly claim to rely on, develop, or challenge some aspect of Kant's ethics. </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">Central to Kant's ethical theory is the claim that all </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 3pt;">persons are owed respect just because they are persons, that is, free rational beings. To be a person is to have a status and worth that is unlike that of any other </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">kinds of being</span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 3pt;"> it </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 10pt;">is to be an end in itself with dignity. And the only response that is appropriate to such a being is respect. Respect (that is, moral recognition respect) is the acknowledgment in attitude and conduct of the dignity of persons as ends in themselves. </span></u></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">Respect for such beings is not only appropriate but also morally and unconditionally required: the status and worth of person is such that they must always be respected. Because we are all too often inclined not to respect persons, not to value them as they ought to be valued, one formulation of the Categorical Imperative, which is the supreme principle of morality, commands that our actions express due respect for the worth of persons: “Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or the person of any other, never simply as a means but always at the same time as an end” (</span><em><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten</span></em><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> (</span><em><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;">Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals)</span></em><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> (1785/1996, 4:429). Our fundamental moral obligation, then, is to respect beings; morally right actions are thus those that express respect for beings as ends in themselves, while morally wrong actions are those that express disrespect or contempt for beings by not valuing them as ends in themselves (Wood 1999). In addition to this general commandment, Kant argues that there are also more specific duties of respect for other persons and self-respect, to which we'll return. For now, we must address the question, What is it to be an end in itself and to possess dignity?</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The negative burden</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> is to prove the resolution false. The traditional value/criterion model is only a means to this end, thus if the negative can prove this independently, it is sufficient for a negative ballot. Prefer this burden for two reasons:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">1. As the true/false burden is a factual negation of the resolution, it stands prior to any other evaluation. In order to provide any other correct understanding of the resolution this problem must first be solved, and the burden is central to any educational value to be derived from this debate, as any other means would only be scraping the surface of the philosophical depth of the resolution. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">2. A true/false burden is the most predictable one to be posed as the resolution is the only resource either debater is provided with pre-round, and the understanding of the truth or falsity of a statement is the most intuitive understanding possible, as it requires no presuppositions other than what is provided by the most basic definition of the resolution.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Observation 1: </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In order for a moral obligation to be so, it must be moral. Therefore if a moral obligation is immoral either through its means, its ends, or inherently, it cannot be a moral obligation and thus you must negate on face. Because moral obligations have to be moral, then moral obligations cannot be immoral. Proving moral obligations are immoral will be reason enough for voting negative.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Observation 2: </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">An axiom of deontology is that if an action is obligatory then it is possible. <strong>Macnee<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Negative/Neg%20-%20Test%20Infinity%20Bitch.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">**[3]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Kant said that it was not our duty to do what is impossible for us to do. For Kant, the fact that we ought to do something means that it is logically possible to do –</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">‘ought’ implies ‘can’</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Moral statements are prescriptive; they prescribe an action.</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> If ‘ought’ implies ‘can’ then the statement, ‘I ought to do x’, implies that ‘I can do x’.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is why we’d never say that a quadriplegic has a moral obligation to save a drowning person or that a person in Los Angeles has a moral obligation to stop a carjacking in New York. Systems of morality that obligate us to bring about something but don’t permit us to do so are nonsensical. It follows from the contrapositive of this axiom that if an action is not possible then it is not obligatory. It is my sole thesis that it is impossible to assist more than one person in need. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore: <strong>If the negative can prove that moral obligations to assist people in need are at some point impossible to fulfill, then you vote negative, as the affirmative would not be able to show that we had a moral obligation to perform that action.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Furthermore: If there is no affirmative offense at the end of the round you presume negative as the affirmative would have failed their converse burden to prove the resolution true. Further, if the negative can prove that assisting people in need is merely permissible, not obligatory, then you vote negative as we would not have the obligation to assist people in need. Insofar as any specific part of the case fulfills the burden of proving the resolution false then you vote negative. </span><br />

(See e.g. [4], p. 19; but also [5].) Of course, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">it is vastly more probable for intelligent creatures to evolve on a planet than to spontaneously materialize by random combination of elementary particles.

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The affirmation ascribes moral obligations to each individual in need, and since the universe in infinite, there exist people in need who are physically unreachable from one another. This then follows that we would prescribe obligations to individuals that are impossible to fulfill. But no moral obligation is impossible to fulfill, and hence assisting people in need is not morally obligatory. </span><br />

<ol><li>b. Finite Universe Paradigms</li></ol><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Even if the universe is finite, we should not accept moral obligations that are conditional on the shape or size of the universe, <strong>Bostrom 3</strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">“</span></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Contemporary cosmology </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">is in considerable flux, so its conclusions </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">should be regarded as tentative. But it is </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">definitely </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">not reasonable, in light of the evidence we currently possess, to assume that we do not live in a[n]</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> canonically </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">infinite world. And that is sufficient for the predicament to arise. Any ethical theory that fails to cope with this</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">likely </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">empirical contingency must be rejected. We should not accept an ethical theory which [is], conditional on our current best scientific guesses about the size and nature of the cosmos</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">implies that it is ethically indifferent whether we cause or prevent another holocaust.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore even if the universe isn’t infinite, we cannot accept ethical theories based on finite guesses of the universes size that neglect the possibility of others. Hence, if you don’t accept sub-point a, then you must reject their ethical theory instead.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence we can never assist people since when I commit any attention to assisting one person I sacrifice my infinite obligation to assist others. But no moral obligation is impossible to fulfill, and hence assisting people in need is not morally obligatory.</span><br />

<strong>Contention 3:</strong> Moral obligations aren’t moral<br />
<br />
3. a. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Coercion of a moral obligation strips one’s liberty.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Universal moral obligations force individuals to do a certain actions. Professor Kluge argued against this by saying that ‘the person who acquires the obligation must be able to refuse it’ and that free will is always applicable. This ideology came under attack by Harry Lesser, who proved that there are some obligations in life that have no free will and are purely forced obligations. He provides a relatable example of such action. <strong>Lesser<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Negative/Neg%20-%20Test%20Infinity%20Bitch.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">**[6]**</a></strong> reads:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">“To this one could reply that, although the principle is not a logically necessary one it is nevertheless true, and the cases just mentioned are evidence of its truth. But there are counter-examples to this, of at least two sorts. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One is the obligation to members of one's family: one may choose one's spouse, and choose to have children, but one does not choose one's parents or siblings. Yet</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, although it is a matter of argument as to what one's obligations are, it is hard to deny that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">one has some obligations, or that they are partly unilateral: one may have fewer obligations to a cruel and neglectful parent, but one still has some which are unavoidable.”</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This nonconsentual moral obligation is taken one step further. <strong>Nozick<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Negative/Neg%20-%20Test%20Infinity%20Bitch.docx#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">**[7]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />

 <br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Observation 1: </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In order for a moral obligation to be so, it must be moral. Therefore if a moral obligation is immoral either through its means, its ends, or inherently, it cannot be a moral obligation and thus you must negate on face. Because moral obligations have to be moral, then moral obligations cannot be immoral. Proving moral obligations are immoral will be reason enough for voting negative.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I <strong>Value</strong> morality because the resolution is centered on the evaluative term ‘moral obligation’ which calls into question what is moral. The concept of morality must come as an a priori to any moral obligation, because if something isn’t moral than it can’t be a moral obligation.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">All moral theories must be universizable. <strong>Pettit</strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Every prescription as to what an agent ought to do should be capable of being universalized, so that it applies not just to that particular agent, and not just to that particular place or time or context,</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> or whatever. So at any rate we generally assume in our moral reasoning. <strong><u>If we think that it is right for one agent in one circumstance to act in a certain way, but wrong for another, then we commit ourselves to their being some further descriptive difference between the two cases, in particular a difference of a non-particular or universal kind.</u></strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">To achieve morality, I use the <strong>Standard</strong> of respecting human rights. This works under a deontological framework, <strong>Kant</strong> reads:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Beings whose existence depends not on our will but on nature, if they are not rational beings, have only relative value as means, and are therefore called ‘things’</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">[Sachen]; </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">whereas rational beings are called ‘persons’, because their nature already marks them out as ends in themselves</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(i.e. as not to be used merely as means)—which makes such a being •an object of respect, and •something that sets limits to what anyone can choose to do. Such beings are not merely subjective ends whose existence as a result of our action has value for us, but are objective ends, i.e. things [Dinge] whose existence is an end in itself. It is indeed an irreplaceable end: you can’t substitute for it something else to which it would be merely a means. If there were no such ends in themselves, nothing of absolute value could be found, and if all value were conditional and thus contingent, no supreme practical principle for reason could be found anywhere.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is a universizable ethical theory, and thus achieves morality.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Prefer this for three reasons:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">1. Human rights are essential for protecting lives, the <strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Negative/Neg%20-%20Dehumanization.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">**[1]**</a></strong> reads:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">“</span></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Whereas </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">disregard and contempt for</span></u></strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.surfcanyon.com/search?f=sl&amp;q=human%20rights&amp;partner=wtigca" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**human rights**</a><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Whereas</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">by the rule of law,”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore human rights are the only way to properly secure life. Without such standards for life, life would be worthless and society would be in anarchy. Locke wrote about how in such a time of anarchy, human rights were formed in order to protect human lives. Therefore the purpose and function of such rights protects life.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">2. Life is essential for morality. If there was no life than there would be no morality, because no one could impose their views of right and wrong and justify something as moral. Therefore human rights, which secure life, are necessary to discuss any form of morality.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">3. Human rights are inviolable. <strong>Rawls<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Negative/Neg%20-%20Dehumanization.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">**[2]**</a></strong> writes<strong>:</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> It has seemed to many philosophers, and it appears to be supported by the convictions of common sense, that we distinguish as a matter of principle between the claims of liberty and right on the one hand and the desirability of increasing aggregate social welfare on the other; and that we give a certain priority, if not absolute weight, to the former.</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Each member of society is thought to have an inviolability founded on justice or, as some </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">say, on natural right, which even the welfare of everyone else cannot override. Justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others. The reasoning which balances the gains and losses of different persons as if they were one person is excluded. Therefore in a just society the basic liberties are taken for granted and the rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to the calculus of social interests.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, human rights are morally justified because they are inviolable and thus don’t treat their holders as means to an end, but rather as ends in themselves. This is the only just way to treat moral agents.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 1:</strong> Moral obligations strip human rights<br />
<br />
<ol><li>a. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Coercion of a moral obligation strips one’s liberty.</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Universal moral obligations force individuals to do a certain actions. Professor Kluge argued against this by saying that ‘the person who acquires the obligation must be able to refuse it’ and that free will is always applicable. This ideology came under attack by Harry Lesser, who proved that there are some obligations in life that have no free will and are purely forced obligations. He provides a relatable example of such action. <strong>Lesser<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Negative/Neg%20-%20Dehumanization.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">**[3]**</a></strong> reads:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">“To this one could reply that, although the principle is not a logically necessary one it is nevertheless true, and the cases just mentioned are evidence of its truth. But there are counter-examples to this, of at least two sorts. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One is the obligation to members of one's family: one may choose one's spouse, and choose to have children, but one does not choose one's parents or siblings. Yet</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, although it is a matter of argument as to what one's obligations are, it is hard to deny that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">one has </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">some</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> obligations, </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">or</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> that </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">they</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> are partly unilateral: one may have fewer obligations to a cruel and neglectful parent, but one still has some which are unavoidable.”</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This nonconsentual moral obligation is taken one step further. <strong>Nozick<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Negative/Neg%20-%20Dehumanization.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">**[4]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">“The claim that the proponent of the ultraminimal state is inconsistent, we now can see, assumes that he is a “utilitarian of rights.” It assumes that his goal is, for example</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, to minimize the weighted amount of the violation of rights in the society</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">[claims] that he should pursue this goal even through means that themselves violate people’s rights. Instead, he may place the nonviolation of rights as a constraint upon action,</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> rather than (or in addition to_ </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">building it into the end state to be realized. The position held by this proponent of the ultraminimal state will be as consistent one if his conception of rights holds that your being <em>forced</em> to contribute to another’s welfare violates your rights</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, whereas someone else’s not providing you with things you need greatly, including things essential to the protection of your rights, does not itself violate your rights, even though it avoids making it more difficult for someone else to violate them. (That conception will be consistent provided it does not construe the monopoly element of the ultraminimal state as itself a violation of rights.) That it is a consistent position does not, of course, show that it is an acceptable one.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, the affirmative’s moral obligation strips individuals of their human right to liberty, an inviolable rights, which is immoral to violate. Thus the moral obligations are being inherently immoral toward the enablers and actors of such obligations.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<ol><li>b. The Pursuit of Happiness</li></ol><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">In order to assist someone else, you yourself have to give up one of two things: Money or time. You can either donate money to people in need or donate your time by directly aiding them. This moral obligation thus takes away either money or time through your assistance to those in need. The first of those, money has a clear and direct link to happiness. <strong>Taylor<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Negative/Neg%20-%20Dehumanization.docx#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">**[5]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The correlation between happiness and family income is very strong indeed - reported happiness rises in a nearly straight line through eight levels of annual</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">family income. At the highest income category</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">-- $150,000 and above - </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">fully 50% of respondents report being very happy; by contrast, just 23% of those who have a family income below $20,000 say they are very happy.’</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The other option, time, also shows a direct link to happiness. <strong>Mogilner<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Nov-Dec/Negative/Neg%20-%20Dehumanization.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">**[6]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 4pt;">Still, the message is clear: Despite the belief that money is the resource most </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">central to Americans’ pursuit of happiness, increased happiness requires a shift in attention toward time.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 4pt;"> This has been heard before, underlying such fables as Charles Dickens’s <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, in which Scrooge becomes a happier man once he stops counting his coins following visits from the ghosts of Christmases past, present, and future. Necessarily, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the current research provides empirical support for this frequently ignored lesson, and identifies a more feasible method</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 4pt;">(than inviting temporally imbued ghosts) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">to influence behavior. Simply</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>increasing the relative salience of time</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">(vs. money) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">can nudge someone</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>to</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 4pt;"> spend that extra hour at home rather than at the office, there </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">finding greater happiness</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 4pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, we can conclude that both money and time have some relevant link to happiness. Insofar as both lead to potential happiness, taking away either money or time takes away potential happiness. The moral obligations force people to give up either money or time to assist those in need, and thus deprives people of their pursuit of happiness, an inviolable right.</span><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Though</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> these women </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">may not be faced with a choice of killing or being killed, many are confronted with a dilemma nearly as dreadful. Unable to escape </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(orunable to recognize any viable means of escape) from the battering relationship, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">they face the &quot;choice&quot; of killing </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(either their batterers or themselves) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">or being reduced to a psychological state in which their continued physical existence will have little if any meaning or value</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Whatever one chooses to call this state--' </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">'life without feeling alive</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, '' &quot;partial death, '' or simply utter hopelessness—the net result for the battered woman </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is a life hardly worth living</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The victims are reduced to a point in which they no longer have value as humans at all, and thus the deadly force is proportional. Prefer this definition for 2 reasons.</span><br />
<br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">1. Equal Ground</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">If my opponent can define domestic violence at such a low threshold that scolding counts for repeat domestic violence, it pidgin-holes me to defend a world where killing is a justifiable response to any subjective harassment what-so-ever. As this is clearly not true, and is abusive for me to defend, it takes away a severe amount of my ground, forcing me to defend even the minimalist of violence, while they only have to provide one example. This is an unfair and abusive ground-skew, so prefer this more fair definition.</span><br />
<br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">2. Predictability</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">All of the topic literature about this resolution presupposes that domestic violence is severe and proportional to deadly force. If debaters aren’t predictable in their definitions, it is unfair, because they can run any abusive case they want, while I have to defend a totality. I have to show it is always permissible, while they can search for one instance in which it isn’t, causing a ground-skew. Therefore, prefer my predictable burden.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">I <strong>value</strong> morality, because the resolution calls into question what is moral.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">In order to determine what is moral, I offer the <strong>meta-ethic</strong> of rationality. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">These rational reasons allow us to make rational decision. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Velleman<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/AC%20-%20Penguins%20Version%208.2.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">**[4]**</a></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In the “Voice of Conscience”, Velleman tries to reconstruct the derivation of the Categorical Imperative as an attempt to derive the content of conscience from the nature of its authority. The kind of authority that conscience, and the </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">moral law</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, has </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">stems from its claim to be common knowledge among all rational thinkers; it claims to be what all rational thinkers would think, and would think rational thinkers think</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, etc. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The universalization procedure is then understood as a procedure that checks whether a first-personal practical thought</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(such as “I shall lie”) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">can be taken to be what all rational thinkers would think</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(and would think that all rational thinkers would think, etc.) in similar circumstances. Since no universalization procedure will succeed without assuming common knowledge that the maxim is a universal law, this interpretation has the advantage of making common knowledge essential to the nature of the procedure rather than an <em>ad hoc</em> assumption.</span><br />

We, and he, want to be reassured. And the reassurance turns out to be one more inference (if useful, then true)--as if this inference were not, once we accept his evolutionary picture, [33] under the same suspicion as all the rest. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If the value of our reasoning is in doubt, you cannot try to establish it by reasoning</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">.

Such beings are not merely subjective ends whose existence as a result of our action has value for us, but are objective ends, i.e. things [Dinge] whose existence is an end in itself. It is indeed an irreplaceable end: you can’t substitute for it something else to which it would be merely a means. If there were no such ends in themselves, nothing of absolute value could be found, and if all value were conditional and thus contingent, no supreme practical principle for reason could be found anywhere.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Domestic violence perpetrators have psychological problems. <strong>Franklin<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/AC%20-%20Penguins%20Version%208.2.docx#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">**[7]**</a> 1</strong> writes</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Domestic Violence - </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Domestic violence is a particular form of Intermittent Explosive Disorder</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, because often these </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">individuals</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">only</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> lose control within the context of a close </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">interpersonal </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">relationship</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. However, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">many</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> of these </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">individuals</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>have</u></strong> <strong><u>a[n]</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">generalized </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">anger management problem</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, but control it better outside their own home. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The criteria for a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder are always present in domestic violence situations, except when the violence occurs in conjunction with substance abuse</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> or intoxication. In those situations, the individual meets the criteria for a substance abuse diagnosis. Sometimes, intoxication is also a form of not accepting blame. The individual may choose to become intoxicated prior to a confrontation. This may be because of an inability to confront others. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The intoxication removes normal social restraints</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">and</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">also </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">gives the individual an excuse for loss of control</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Individuals who only lose control within relationships often attach tremendous emotional ultimatums to those relationships. If a person believes that loss of a relationship will doom them forever, then their reaction may be consistent with that belief, even if the belief is false. There are other </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">factors influencing domestic violence</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">do not always occur </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in other social conflicts. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Within a relationship, each spouse</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">may </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">ha[s]</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">ve</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> specific role expectations for the other spouse</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. That is, a man may expect his wife to behave a certain way, to think a certain way, and to respond a certain way to him. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">These expectations may be</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">immature and/or </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">irrational, although commonly held within his social group</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. These expectations may also serve to increase the emotional tension in the relationship, so that it surpasses his level of control. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Since these expectations may not exist in other relationships, he may be able to maintain control outside of the</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">marital </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">relationship</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, the actor of domestic violence acts out of irrational motives. <strong>Franklin 2</strong> writes</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dr. Franklin has found that the perpetrators of domestic violence rarely receive</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> adequate </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">psychological treatment</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">because they are viewed as criminals, rather than individuals with psychological problems. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Because denial is often a major component of this problem, the power of the courts may act as a motivating factor to move the person into treatment, but will seldom stop the behavior without treatment. Dr. Franklin recognizes that</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> men who cannot control their anger have a number of psychological issues that require treatment, and that this is a mental health issue</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, not a criminal one. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Treatment consists of </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">behavioral self-control techniques, stress management, and cognitive therapy to </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">change[ing] the irrational belief system that triggers the violent behavior.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Either they act out of an irrational belief system due to the intermittent explosive disorder or they act irrationally due to the substance abuse. Either way, they are not rational agents during the domestic violence.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">b. Moral Permissibility</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> My Kant card at the top of my case says that irrational beings can be used as a means to an end. Because of the state of their mind during the action, the actors were not rational. Therefore, you do not need to treat them as ends in themselves, rather as means to the victims’ end. They are not moral-agents and morality is not ascribed to them. Thus, it is morally permissible to kill them, just as it is morally permissible to kill any non-moral thing.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Contention 2: Rational beings</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Even if you don’t buy that they are irrational, it is morally permissible to kill them, due to proportionality. Kantian ethics relies on a system of punishment for breaking moral laws. <strong>Kant<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/AC%20-%20Penguins%20Version%208.2.docx#_ftn8" rel="nofollow">**[8]**</a> 2</strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">But what is the mode and measure of Punishment which Public Justice takes as its Principle and Standard? It is just </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the Principle of Equality</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, by which the pointer of the Scale of Justice is made to incline no more to the one side than the other. It </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">may be rendered by saying that the underserved evil which any one commits on another, is to be regarded as perpetrated on himself. Hence it may be said</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">: ‘If you slander another, you slander yourself; </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">if you steal from another, you steal from yourself</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">; if you strike another, you strike yourself; if you kill another, you kill yourself.’ </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is the Right of Retaliation</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (<em>jus talionis</em>); and properly understood</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, it is the only Principle which </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in regulating a Public Court, as distinguished from mere private judgment, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">can definitely assign both the quality and the quantity of a just penalty. All other standards are wavering and uncertain; and on account of other considerations </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">involved in them, they contain no principle conformable to the sentence of pure and strict Justice. It may appear, however, that difference of social status would not admit the application of </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the Principle of Retaliation</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, which is that of ‘Like with Like.’ But although the application may not in all cases be possible according to the letter, yet as regards the effect it </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">may always be attained in practice</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, by due regard being given to the disposition and sentiment of the parties in the higher social sphere. Thus a pecuniary penalty on account of verbal injury, may have no direct proportion to the injustice of slander; for one who is wealthy may be able to indulge himself in this offence for his own gratification. Yet the attack committed on the honour of the party aggrieved may have its equivalent in the pain inflicted upon the pride of the aggressor, especially if he is condemned by the judgment of the Court, not only to retract and apologize, but to submit to some meaner ordeal, as kissing the hand of the injured person. In like manner, if a man of the highest rank has violently assaulted an innocent citizen of the lower orders, he may be condemned not only to apologize but to undergo a solitary and painful imprisonment, whereby, in addition to the discomfort endured, the vanity of the offender would be painfully affected, and the very shame of his position would constitute an adequate Retaliation after the principle of ‘Like with Like.’ </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But how </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">then would </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">we render the statement: ‘If you steal from another, you steal from yourself’</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">? </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In this way, that who</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">ever </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">steals anything makes the property of all insecure: he therefore robs himself of all security in property</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, according to the Right of Retaliation. Such a one has nothing, and can acquire nothing, but he has the Will to live; and this is only possible by others supporting him. But as the State should not do this gratuitously, he must for this purpose yield his powers to the State to be used in penal labour; and thus he falls for a time, or it may be for life, into a condition of slavery. – but </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">whoever has committed murder, must <em>die</em>. There is, </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in this case, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">no juridical substitute </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">or surrogate, that can be given or taken </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">for the satisfaction of Justice</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. There is no <em>Likeness</em> or proportion between Life, however painful, and Death; and therefore there is no Equality between the crime of Murder and the retaliation of it but what is judicially accomplished by the execution of the Criminal. His death, however, must be kept free from all maltreatment that would make the humanity suffering in his Person loathsome or abominable. Even if a Civil Society resolved to dissolve itself with the consent of all its members – as might be supposed in the case of a People inhabiting an island resolving to separate and scatter themselves throughout the whole world – the last Murderer lying in the prison ought to be executed before the resolution was carried out. This ought to be done in order that every one may realize the desert of his deeds, and that bloodguiltiness may not remain upon the people; for otherwise they might all be regarded as participators in the murder as a public violation of Justice.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because the domestic violence was proportional to the retaliation of deadly force, it is justified under Kantian ethics. <strong>Stairs<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/AC%20-%20Penguins%20Version%208.2.docx#_ftn9" rel="nofollow">**[9]**</a></strong> furthers:</span><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Kant offers</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> perhaps</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the purest </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(though not necessarily the clearest) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">statement of the retributive theory of punishment</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The idea in brief is simple: it is wrong to punish people for utilitarian reasons. Legal punishment must<strong>always</strong> be a response to guilt. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If the core motive in punishing someone is to deter others</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, or to protect society, or to set an example, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">then the person punished is wronged; their humanity has not been respected. So punishment must always be in response to guilt</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, but Kant in effect goes further: the suggestion that seems to come through this reading is not only that</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> guilt is a necessary condition for punishment</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, but that</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the guilty</span></u></strong> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">must</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">be punished or else justice </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and equality, the only proper foundations for the law,</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> will not have been served.</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">Equality is the principle that must be used in selecting a punishment. Kant uses a metaphor. He refers to the principle of equality as the one by which the pointer of the scale of justice is made to incline no more to one side than to the other.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">There are two ideas</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> involved in Kant's </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">explanation of this. One is the familiar</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">idea of &quot;an eye for an eye.&quot; [is] The evil that a wrongdoer inflicts is the measure of how severely he should be punished. Kant points out</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">: we do not need to require that people who are assaulted should be assaulted, for example. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What is required is that the pain inflicted on the criminal should be equivalent to the pain inflicted on the victim.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> That is one part of the </span><strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">jus talionis</span></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> -- the right of retaliation. The other part is the puzzle embodied in a statement like:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, under Kant’s idea of proportionality, it is justified to kill the perpetrator, as that is the only way to achieve justice and equality, and thusly respect humanity.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally, <strong>Observation 3:</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Due to the grammatical differentiation of “a”, I need only to prove that deadly force is a permissible response, not the response for all cases. <strong>Straker</strong> writes<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/AC%20-%20Penguins%20Version%208.2.docx#_ftn10" rel="nofollow">[10</a>]</span> </span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> “The word 'the' is the definite article, because it refers to a defined, single noun. An unspoken effect is to create uniqueness, excluding the possibility of any other item that is the same</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">as this</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. <strong><u>The word ‘a’ is the indefinite article, because it refers to an instance of a noun. By implication, there is at least one other</u></strong> (and possibly many more) <u><strong>item</strong></u>s <strong><u>like this</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. How similar the items are depends on the level of definition of the noun. Thus 'a dog' gives a very broad scope for what other dogs may look like, whilst ‘a chocolate labrador bitch’ reduces this scope.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">To state that alternatives exist and are even preferable thereby has no effect on the permissibility of deadly force. All I have to show is that deadly force is permissible, not preferable.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, I affirm: It is morally permissible to use deadly force as </span><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">a</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> deliberate response to repeated domestic violence</span><br />

 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A. Is the interpretation: The negative must actively disprove the resolution.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, the only negative arguments that will count in this round will be ones that show moral prohibition. Any other negative arguments are extra-topical and don’t carry weight in this debate.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">C. Is the standard: Equal Ground</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">If the negative can prove any arguments that don’t actively negate the resolution, the negative will severely limit my ground to the ballot. They can access the ballot in several ways, while I can only access it through proving moral permissibility, causing an intense and unjust ground skew. A 1-1 burden is fair because we both have the same amount of ground and accessibility to the ballot.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">D. Is the voter: Fairness</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Debate is a fair event with the coin toss, equal speech times, etc. If debate wasn’t fair, there would be no one debating because one person could always run an abusive case and win the round, and no one else would debate against them.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The impact is to drop the argument</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Their abusive and unfair argument doesn’t facilitate debate, so you should drop it. If you let the debater continue to run abusive arguments in debate, it will show other debaters that abuse is okay to do, so to stop the trend of unfair arguments, drop these arguments here.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">E. Is the paradigm: Competing Interpretations</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Theory is a matter of competing interpretations. Putting defense on theory causes a time-skew on the affirmative and doesn’t provide actual negation of the rules for debate, thus the only way for theory to be evaluated is with a different competing rule for debate.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The second standard is time-skew</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">As the affirmative I have to respond to 7 minutes of negative case and extend 6 minutes of affirmative in just 4 minutes. I already have a severe time-skew and running inactive negative cases that I have to respond to before I can extend my case furthers this abusive time skew and causes a severe time-suck. This is a severely unfair practice, and thus the only fair arguments in this round will be those that actively disprove the resolution.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The third standard is predictability</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">A negation of the resolution is the most predictable negative position. The only predictable arguments are ones that prove the resolution true/false, and thus moral prohibition is the only predictable negative argument. This is fair, because if you cannot predict what your opponent is going to run, then you have a severe ground skew. They can run any arbitrary position that you won’t be prepared for, while I have to prove moral permissibility. Therefore, it is unfair in debate to unpredictable.</span><br />

 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">I <strong>value</strong> morality because the resolution calls into question what is moral. In order to determine what is moral, I offer two constraints on morality. First, ethics must be prescriptive. <strong>Hare</strong></span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/NC%20-%20Narwhals%20Version%206.3.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">****[1]****</a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> writes</span><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If we </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">were to </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">ask[ed] </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">of </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">a person 'What are his moral principles?' the </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">way in which we could be </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">most</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> sure of a </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">true answer would be </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">by</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> studying what he did</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">He might</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, to be sure, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">profess</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> in his conversation all sorts of </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">principles, which </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">his actions </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">he completely </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">disregard</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">ed; </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">but</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> it would be when, knowing all the relevant facts of a situation, he was faced with choices or decisions between alternative courses of </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">[in] action</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, between alternative answers to the question 'What shall I do?', that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">he would reveal </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in what </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">principles of conduct he really believed. The reason why actions are </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in a peculiar way </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">revelatory of moral principles is that the function of moral principles is to guide conduct. The language of morals is one sort of prescriptive language.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> And this is what makes ethics worth studying: for the question 'What shall I do?' is one that we cannot for long evade; the problems of conduct, though sometimes less diverting than crossword puzzles, have to be solved in a way that crossword puzzles do not. We cannot wait to see the solution in the next issue, because on the solution of the problems depends what happens in the next issue. Thus, in a world in which the problems of conduct become every day more complex and tormenting, there is a great need for an understanding of the language in which these problems are posed and answered. For confusion about our moral language leads, not merely to theoretical muddles, but to needless practical perplexities.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Second, all ethics must be universalizable. <strong>Petitt</strong></span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/NC%20-%20Narwhals%20Version%206.3.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">****[2]****</a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Every prescription as to what an agent ought to do should be capable of being universalized, so that it applies not just to that particular agent, and not just to that particular </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">place or time or </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">context,</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">or whatever. So at any rate we generally assume in our moral reasoning. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If we think that it is right for one agent in one circumstance to act in a certain way, but wrong for another, then we commit ourselves to their being some further descriptive difference between the two cases, in particular a difference of a </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">non-particular or </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">universal kind.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">My <strong>value criterion</strong>, is thusly deontology. Humans fit under such unconditional value to have morality because of their rationality. <strong>Kant</strong> <strong>1<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/NC%20-%20Narwhals%20Version%206.3.docx#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">**[3]**</a></strong> explains:</span><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Beings whose existence depends</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">not on our will but</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> on nature, </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">if they </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">are not rational beings, have only relative value as means, and are therefore called ‘things’ </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">[Sachen]</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">; whereas rational beings are called ‘persons’, because their nature already marks them out as ends in themselves </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(i.e. as not to be used merely as means)—which makes such a being an object of respect, and something that sets limits to what anyone can choose to do. Such beings are not merely subjective ends whose existence as a result of our action has value for us, but are objective ends, i.e. things [Dinge] whose existence is an end in itself. It is indeed an irreplaceable end: you can’t substitute for it something else to which it would be merely a means. If there were no such ends in themselves, nothing of absolute value could be found, and if all value were conditional and thus contingent, no supreme practical principle for reason could be found anywhere.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, human dignity must be respected and morality treats individuals as ends in themselves.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This ethical theory gives way to the Categorical Imperative. <strong>Kant 2<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/NC%20-%20Narwhals%20Version%206.3.docx#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">**[4]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, it is morally prohibited to not treat others as ends in themselves with dignity.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Observation 2: </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It might be necessary to use deadly force, but that in no way means that it is moral to use deadly force.</span><br />

All other standards are wavering and uncertain; and on account of other considerations involved in them, they contain no principle conformable to the sentence of pure and strict justice.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus, if it is morally permissible to kill the domestic violence actor, it would be morally permissible to kill anyone including the victim. <strong>Korsgaard<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/NC%20-%20Narwhals%20Version%206.3.docx#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">**[6]**</a></strong> furthers</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">A few lines later, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Kant says that this is equivalent to acting as though your maxim were by your will to become a law of nature</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and he uses this latter formulation in his examples of how the imperative is to be applied. Elsewhere, Kant specifies that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the test is whether you could will the universalization for a system of nature “of which you yourself were a part</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">”; and in one place he characterizes the moral agent as asking “what sort of world he would create under the guidance of practical reason,…a world into which, moreover, he would place himself as a member.” But how do you determine whether or not you can will a given maxim as a law of nature? Since the will is practical reason, and since everyone must arrive at the same conclusions in matters of duty, it cannot be the case that what you are able to will is a matter of personal taste, or relative to your individual desires. Rather, the question of what you can will is a question of what you can will <em>without contradiction</em>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus, justifying using deadly force, also justifies the actor using deadly force on the victim. Because these are clearly immoral actions, under deontology it is morally prohibited to kill the actor of such harms.</span><br />
<br />
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">b. Ends in themselves</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Every moral agent must be treated as ends in themselves with dignity. <strong>Kant 44</strong> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In the kingdom of ends everything has either <em>price</em> or <em>dignity</em>. Whatever has price can be replaced by something else which is <em>equivalent</em>; whatever</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, on the other hand</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, is above all price, and </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">therefore </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">admits of no equivalent, has a dignity</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Whatever has reference to the general inclinations and wants of humankind has a <em>market price</em>; whatever, without presupposing a need, corresponds to a certain taste, that is, to a delight in the mere purposeless play of our faculties, has a <em>fancy price</em>; but </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that which constitutes the condition under which alone anything can be an end in itself</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, this</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> has not merely relative worth, that is, price, but an inner worth, that is, <em>dignity</em>. Now morality is the condition under which alone a rational being can be an end in himself</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, since by this alone it is possible that he should be a legislating member in the kingdom of ends. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus morality, and humanity</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, insofar as it is capable of morality</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, is that which alone has dignity.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because the categorical imperative says that we can only act in manners that treat others as ends in themselves, and humanity – or simply put life – is necessary for them to be an end. Then, the only morally permissible actions are ones that maintain life and treat others as ends in themselves. Therefore, by the contrapositive of this axiom, it is morally prohibited to take away a moral agent’s life, because it doesn’t treat them as an end in themselves with dignity.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">There is no such thing as ‘good’ violence. <strong>Muller</strong></span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/Off%20-%20Lemurs%20Version%201.2.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">****[1]****</a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> writes:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Every act of violence which is exercised against a human being is rape: the rape of identity, of personality, rights, dignity, and humanity.</span></u></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">The image of a human being disfigured because of another human being's will represents the horror of violence. Violence is the disfigurement of the human's face. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">disfigurement </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is the tragedy of humanity</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> It deprives the existence of a sense and ruins hope. Violence is truly discouraging.</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What is tragic in the existence is not the fact that human beings are mortal but that they can kill. It is crucial to define violence in such a way that it becomes impossible for us to say that there is a «good violence». Violence is always a failure</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, a tragedy or a misfortune.</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Violence carries an indomitable share of injustice. Violence can never be justified because it is never just. As soon as one tries to distinguish «good» and «bad» violence, one can not name and point out violence anymore and the result is confusion</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Above all, as soon as we start developing criteria which can define what «good violence» is, each of us will be able to make them ours in order to justify our own violence.</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Violence is essentially negation. All acts of violence</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, whatever their degrees or intentions and even if they are not fully accomplished, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">are part of a process of murder</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, of a death sentence. As said, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the act will not necessarily be accomplished, but the final aim of violence is always the death of the other</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, their exclusion, elimination, annihilation. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Every act of violence is an attempt upon the other’s humanity.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">They are objectively saying that suffering is bad, because the ends of their actions are to minimize suffering, by saving the victim. However, they also subjectively say that suffering is permissible, in order to kill the perpetrator. Muller directly says that this is wrong, and that there is no good violence, rather the subjective violence is also bad. Therefore, the action is morally impermissible.</span><br />

 <br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">In order for any ethical theory to be true, or moral, its subjective and objective views must be aligned. <strong>Nagel <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/Off%20-%20Emus%20Version%201.3.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">**[1]**</a></strong> writes:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The statement “I am TN” is true if and only if uttered by TN. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The statement “Today is Tuesday” is true if and only if uttered on Tuesday. To understand the operation of such statements it is necessary</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">only </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">to place them in their context of utterance</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> in an entirely centerless conception of the world;</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> then we see that their significance and truth does not depend on the existence of further “facts,</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">”</span></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> expressible only in the first person (or the present tense), </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">which</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">mysteriously </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">seem to be both essential aspects of the world and completely excluded from it</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The sense of these statements requires only that the world contain ordinary people, like TN, who use the first person in the ordinary way. Their sense is not the same as that of the third-person statements that express their truth-conditions, since their truth depends on who makes them. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">They can’t be <em>replaced</em> by third-person analyses. But the facts that make them true or false are all expressible by such third-person statements.</span></u></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">On</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> this view the world </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">just is the centerless world, and it</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> can be spoken and thought about from within</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> partly with the help of expressions like “I,” which form statements whose truth-conditions depend on the context of utterance, a context which in turn is fully accommodated in the centerless conception of the world. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Everything about the use of the first person can be analyzed without using the first person. This </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">completely general point </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">provides a[n] </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">simple</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> answer to our question, what kind of truth is it that one of the people in the world, TN, is me? </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">It is quite minimal truth: </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the statement “I am TN” is automatically</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> and uninterestingly </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">true if TN makes it. Once we understand its logic, no further question arises as to what it says.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, once both the subjective and objective views coincide, can the ethic be true. Something cannot be morally permitted from the subjective view, yet morally prohibited from the objective view. Hence, the two realms – the objective ethic and the subjective action must be aligned. <strong>Parsons<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file:///C:/Users/Andoni/Documents/DEBATE%202011/Jan-Feb/Berkeley/Off%20-%20Emus%20Version%201.3.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">**[2]**</a></strong> furthers:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The differentiating criterion therefore involves the subjective point of view and can be stated in two ways: (a) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Action is logical in so far as the operations are logically united to their end from a subjective as well as an objective point of view. That is, in so far as the relations of means and end are concerned, they must be established in the mind of the actor by </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">a scientifically verifiable theory, or if the actor does not know the theory, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the effectiveness of the combination must be verifiable in terms of it.</span></u></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> (b) <u>The subjective end must coincide with the objective end. Subjective end</u> </span></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">here can</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> mean[s] </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">only</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the state of affairs that the actor desires or attempts to bring about. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">It can serve as an end only in so far as it anticipates the actual outcome before the &quot;operations&quot; in question; it is a &quot;subjective anticipation.&quot; To say that subjective and objective ends correspond is, then, to say that the subjective end is the state of affairs which can be scientifically demonstrated actually to come about as a result of the actor's proposed action.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The deadly force’s aim is to kill the perpetrator, meanwhile the deadly force is only a means to ending the victim’s suffering. Therefore, the objective view is to eliminate pain, yet the subjective view is that it is fine to use pain. The concept that you are using pain to end pain is a moral contradiction, which Nagel explains, forces the action to never be moral.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hence, it is morally prohibited to use deadly force.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Underview:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">If I say I am Andoni, it would be true, because I am saying it. But if I were to say I am Tommy, it wouldn’t be true. The objective statement that I am Tommy doesn’t align with the subjective view that Andoni is saying it, and thus the statement is false. Similarly, morals function like this. If you objectively say that suffering, pain, or violence is bad, yet you commit pain, suffering, or violence, then the ethic is not moral, and thus the action cannot be moral. Insofar as the affirmative is using deadly force, they are subjectively saying that violence is okay. Yet the end of the deadly force is to stop their suffering and their abuser’s violence. Thus the objective end is to stop suffering. By using suffering to stop suffering, you fall into this contradiction, which Nagel exploits and shows that the action is NEVER moral.</span><br />
