<br />
<span style="font-size: 70%;">Insight into and an understanding of cultural differences are therefore the crux of rebuilding efforts and cooperation with civilian actors as well as the other coalition forces in the mission area. Without this insight, the motives behind and meaning of the parties’ actions are extremely hard to comprehend, as are the daily incidents and conflicts that result from them. Consequently, cultural understanding is a prerequisite for assessing the current threat and, ultimately, for supporting the political formative process. As former commander of KFOR 7, Colonel Peter Bartram says: “In the civilmilitary encounter, mutual respect plus the recognition that it takes time to rebuild a society form the basis for fulfilling the objective. Honesty and transparency foster understanding of each other’s interests and motives. Finally, you have to be able to negotiate with both sides simultaneously, while coordinating all the various political and humanitarian initiatives. The civilian actors have careers as well, and you can exploit that in the civilmilitary power game – through military strength and authority and by creating a network of relations to the various NGOs and DANIDA.”15 Cultural understanding is thus what makes it possible to maneuver and negotiate in the maze of power positions in which a military force in the mission area finds itself. The military exercise of power assumes new significance in this context – or as Clausewitz might have put it: it reveals its inner nature, that is as an instrument of character building and for disciplining the forces of the soul (Clausewitz, [1832] 1986:73). The aim is not to eliminate an opponent or deprive him of his freedom, but rather to form him by involving him and giving him co-responsibility in a network of mutual obligations and trust relationships. In this capacity, the exercise of power becomes more “instructive” than suppressive, relying as it does on rebuilding and maintaining a number of trust strategies aimed at aiding the process of democratizing and reconstructing a functioning civil administration. The importance of this formative role can hardly be overestimated. Failure to acknowledge this normative turn in the military exercise of power can, in a worst case scenario, shatter the military’s hard-won trust relationship with the civilian population and ultimately compromise the forces’ own security. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 80%;">Cultural understanding is critical to an effective analysis of security, which breaks down the conditions of threat construction and aggression</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 80%;">Michael C. Williams – professor of international politics at Aberystwyth University, Wales – 03 “Words, Images, Enemies: Securitization and International Politics,” International Studies Quarterly, Volume 47, Issue 4, pages 511–531, December 2003</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 70%;">This shift in communicative structuresFin the medium of communication at the center of visual mediaFrepresents a key challenge for securitization theory. Most straightforwardly, this would entail a focus on how speech-acts are framed within visual imagery. As the linguistic and the image are reconfigured within performative action in an age of electronic media, a broader understanding of the rhetorics of securitization is required.41 More complexly, it also requires an examination of the ways in which images themselves may function as communicative acts, an analysis of how meaning is conveyed by images, as well as an assessment of how images interact with more familiar forms of verbal rhetoric. Finally, it also calls for a focus on how televisual communicationsFoften broadcast and received well beyond the political borders and cultural boundaries of their production42Fimpact on different audiences, and the securitizing consequences that may follow from this fact. Analyzing security within the shifting structures of communication thus requires broader techniques for ‘‘reading’’ the rhetorics of securitizing acts, techniques attuned to the rhetorics of visual representation and reception, and their contextual aspects.43 Such an approach would focus not only on the ways in which images impact on the speech-act of securitization in an age of images, but on the way in which visual representations of different policy options influence security practices. In what ways are visual representations structured, and how do they tap into deeply sedimented social perspectives? How do images have an impact on viewers that differs from the impact of words on listeners, or text on readers? How are images capable of contributing to processes of securitization or desecuritization, and how are they linked to more conventional speech-acts in this process? These are just some of the questions that a concern with mediums of representation and communication bring to the agenda of securitization theory and security studies. Nor are these by any means hypothetical questions. Security policies today are constructed not only with the question of their linguistic legitimation in mind; they now are increasingly decided upon in relation to acceptable image-rhetorics. Questions of the acceptability and sustainability of security policies cannot be divorced from considerations of the impact of these policies within a logic of images. This has been equally clearly illustrated in the case of the Kosovo conflict where, as has often been noted, the types of operations undertaken by NATO were clearly structured around their relationship to the images that would be generated, and where rapid television reporting of military actions and their results to the public meant that media coverage itself became a key component of the decision-making process (Der Derian, 2001:180–203; Ignatieff, 2000:161–215). Securitizing moves are indeed ‘‘argued’’ here, but in a context permeated by the power of images. Again, the different fields within which these operate and the resourcesFboth material and discursiveFthat different actors can mobilize in a given situation must be central to securitization theory. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 70%;">The Iraqi pointed at me, pointed at his watch, and mimed an explosion. He'd been shouting frantically since he arrived at our small forward operating base minutes before, but like most American soldiers, I didn't speak Arabic. Had he come to warn us or to threaten us? Car bomb? Another mortar attack? When and where? Looking around desperately, I spotted a young woman in her early 20s bounding toward us. Wissam, one of our Iraqi interpreters, had arrived. After a brief conversation with the man, she turned back to me and said, &quot;He says there is an IED [improvised explosive device] on the main road to Haswa. Good thing you have me around, I think.&quot; For a platoon leader on the streets of Iraq, a trusted interpreter can be the difference between a successful patrol and a body bag. At great personal risk, interpreters bridge the language gap, guide soldiers and marines through unfamiliar streets, serve as cultural advisers, and make crucial introductions. American strategy in Iraq hinges on building positive relationships between US forces and Iraqi communities, a task that would be impossible without dependable interpreters. Unfortunately, the same US military that depends on them has needlessly placed Iraqi interpreters and their families in jeopardy. For the past several months, commanders in Baghdad enforced an ill-considered policy prohibiting Iraqi interpreters from wearing masks to conceal their identities while on patrol. Although the policy was just rescinded, thanks to a public outcry and the efforts of Sen. Ron Wyden (D) of Oregon, much of the damage and confusion it caused remains. The military must now prove that it is still a partner Iraqis can trust. Interpreters have good reason to hide their faces. Terrorists and insurgent groups devote enormous time and effort to identifying and killing the Iraqis who work with Americans. They've slain some 300 so far, according to the Checkpoint One Foundation. Many, if not most, interpreters lead double lives, unable to tell their closest friends or even their families about their work. It is impossible to know how many Iraqi interpreters were identified while the mask ban remained in effect. What is for certain, however, is that insurgent groups such as the Mahdi Army circulate photos of suspected interpreters to terrorist cells across Iraq. While US troops return to well-guarded bases at the end of a patrol, interpreters go back to their unguarded homes, many in hostile communities. The military must now take steps to protect the Iraqi interpreters it so recklessly exposed. Failing to do so would betray some of our most important allies, and it would ultimately place US troops at risk. Since 2006, the military has shifted troops from large, fortified, and isolated bases to smaller outposts within Iraqi neighborhoods. Instead of relying on massive blast walls and guard towers, troops now count on the goodwill of locals to warn them of impending attacks. With their language skills and local knowledge, interpreters can transform an isolated platoon outpost from an embattled fortress into a welcome part of the community. Without that local knowledge to protect them, however, the troops are frighteningly vulnerable to attack. If interpreters cannot trust the military to protect them and their families, US troops will not be able to rely on them for the information their security depends on. A US military spokesman originally defended the mask ban by asserting: &quot;We are a professional army and professional units don't conceal their identity….&quot; Professional armies also protect their own. In some cases, interpreters and their families may need to be moved onto US bases where they can be protected. Interpreters under serious threat should be quickly resettled in the United States. Rescinding the ban has cooled the political heat, but it is not sufficient to protect our comrades. Those who risk their lives alongside us, and who stand for our shared vision of a peaceful Iraq, deserve better. Wissam believed deeply in that vision, but will never see it realized. In May of 2004, she and two other interpreters left the gates of our base, followed by three Mahdi Army gunmen. She never made it home. </span><br />

IN counterinsurgency, the most important thing is winning over the local population. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander in charge of all NATO forces in Afghanistan, was right to warn that a “crisis of confidence among Afghans” imperils the effort to rebuild the country. For most American troops, however, the only connection they have to the locals — whether soldiers in the Afghan army or villagers they’re trying to secure — is through their interpreters.<br />

<span style="font-size: 70%;">The F-bomb is called that for a reason: It has power to explode a conversation and obliterate important points. But my main question after watching this scene, so similar to many I've witnessed while reporting on America's wars abroad, was: How is an interpreter, even a very good one, supposed to haul that statement into his own language? Translation is such an everyday act that it is routinely omitted from most discussion of strategy and success. But, badly done, it is fatally dangerous. And the messages lost through faulty translation in Afghanistan are sabotaging the mission there as badly as any physical enemy ever could. U.S. troops rely on translators. There is no alternative. On the battlefield and in the shuras, young officers like Kearney, raised in the get-down-to-business culture of America and its military, often express themselves to their translators directly and with heaps of slang, roughly the way they might talk to a college buddy. The terp is then expected to decide not only how to translate the words but also how to bridge the gulf of propriety and custom. But although this colloquial language is informal, it is still complex. And unfortunately, it assumes even more common background and idiomatic understanding than a more formal diction would: Think of phrases like &quot;man up,&quot; &quot;freedom isn't free,&quot; or even &quot;shoulder responsibility&quot; and &quot;build your nation.&quot; In the best circumstances, the most successful shuras, it would be unrealistic to expect all this meaning to pass intact to a group of old men from another world. Try filtering it through a translator who didn't attend college, was never your buddy, and didn't grow up surrounded by phrases Americans take for granted, and the chances for error or insult multiply rapidly. This winter, I spent a month in the Pech Valley, next door to the Korengal, where Restrepo was filmed. There, and in other regions of Afghanistan, I met some pretty good terps who were able to develop the kind of rapport with the Americans that's crucial in understanding language and intent. Many, however, were only partially educated and only passable at their jobs. Quite a few were simply very bad. Language is far more than vocabulary and grammar — it is culture. Often terps weren't familiar enough with either to understand what the Americans were saying or what it meant. And choosing candidates for this crucial job is often relegated to contractors. When I asked officers why they worked with bad terps, they claimed they didn't have much choice; translators are hired by private companies and bad ones are difficult to replace, partly because demand is so high and the vetting process is slow. The effect of bad translators on the Afghan mission is difficult to estimate — but I believe that it's vast. Terps have a different stake from the Americans in the outcome of the war, and by definition they're working with people who can't understand half the things they say, meaning that there's no accountability if they're translating an English message into something totally different. I once asked the lieutenant colonel in charge of the Korengal Valley how many messages he thought were lost this way. I wagered that at least 40 percent of his troops' words were not getting through to Afghans. He thought it was more like 50 percent. At the time, January 2010, his soldiers were literally delivering U.S. President Barack Obama's new strategic message to Afghans. I watched them announce that the United States would soon begin withdrawal and that Afghans needed to take responsibility for their own future. If half that message were lost in translation, which half would you want it to be? In another Restrepo scene, Captain Kearney tries to explain to a group of Korengali elders that he is not like the captain who preceded him; that he, Kearney, will do things differently, kill fewer civilians, and bring wealth and jobs and progress. He says he wants a &quot;clean slate.&quot; That Christmas list of opportunities may or may not have been important to the Korengalis; that's a story for another time. But how did &quot;clean slate&quot; translate to men who remember insults for decades, in a land where grudges weave through generations? What did the terp actually say to the elders? Whatever he told them, Kearney never won his fresh start. Before dialogue could be reset, the killing intensified, covering the slate again with blood, as Restrepo shows. American troops withdrew from the Korengal valley this spring. Last December, I went on many foot patrols in the valleys along the Korengal as Americans traveled village to village bringing pieces of Obama's message. One day, high on a mountainside, I listened to a young lieutenant explain to a toothless elder that he needed to take a stand against the Taliban. &quot;You are a citizen of Afghanistan,&quot; the lieutenant said. &quot;This nation is your responsibility.&quot; He was tense, already expecting a Taliban attack. Another lieutenant chimed in: &quot;You need to form something like, you know, a neighborhood watch.&quot; The terp looked at both officers, then said something to the old man, who merely stared at them. Later I asked the terp if he knew what the word &quot;nation&quot; meant. &quot;It's, it's ...&quot; Then he shrugged and smiled and gave up. Maybe he just couldn't define it. I'm sure he had no idea what the words &quot;neighborhood watch&quot; meant. I imagined this scene replicating like a virus through the countryside, through the hundreds of small units operating in the mountains, on the plains. Occasionally I asked the soldiers how they believed their messages would ever take hold. The standard answer was that it was all about &quot;repetition, repetition, repetition.&quot; Say it enough times and the Afghans will get it. That might work. But if no one understands the words, the Americans will simply be bludgeoning the Afghans with noise</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 70%;">After nearly nine years in Afghanistan, U.S. and NATO leaders still do not adequately understand or communicate with the Afghan people, according to classified coalition assessments. That cultural disconnect, along with the West's continued support for a corrupt central government in Kabul, has made it easy for the Taliban to recruit insurgents and prevent NATO from making significant gains, according to classified coalition assessments. Those assessments, quoted to The Washington Examiner by officials with direct knowledge of their contents, paint a grim forecast for Afghanistan. Violence has escalated dramatically since the beginning of the year as insurgents have planted 94 percent more improvised explosive devices than the previous year, to cite one metric of military failure. &quot;We're getting beat up,&quot; said a U.S. military official with direct knowledge of a classified military report titled &quot;The State of the Taliban,&quot; which was published late last year and updated in January. &quot;They [the Taliban] know their own people -- they are culturally accurate. We know the facts but we are culturally inaccurate. The main message in the reports is that we don't fully understand our enemy and we are not clearly communicating our message to the people.&quot; The report -- put together by military intelligence officers who have interviewed high-level Taliban detainees in Afghanistan -- recommended that local U.S. commanders mediate cease-fire negotiations with local Taliban commanders. Taliban commanders are much more effective propagandists than the NATO coalition, the report found. In information-starved Afghanistan, the Taliban has been able to persuade many that the 9/11 attacks were actually a response to the planned invasion of Afghanistan by the United States. And ideas about Islam, including that America does not allow Muslim women to cover themselves and that mosques are not permitted in most American cities, have been easy to sell to potential recruits, the report found. Afghanistan has grown increasingly deadly for U.S. and coalition forces. Nine NATO soldiers, including five Americans, died in several different incidents in Afghanistan Monday. Lt. Col. Tadd Sholtis, spokesman for Gen. Stanley McChrystal, NATO's top commander in Aghanistan, acknowledged the existence of the sober assessments. He told The Examiner that the International Security Assistance Forces are &quot;stepping up engagements with Afghan media at all levels and are facilitating more meetings in which credible third parties.&quot; The aim is to assure that pro-coalition clerics, teachers and others can address false rumors spread by the Taliban. Sholtis said negotiations with Taliban commanders are never simple. &quot;The bulk of insurgents clearly do not see foreign forces as a credible negotiating partner,&quot; he said. &quot;It is likely that the insurgents will be more willing to relax their conditions for discussions with the government as the pressure on them from counterinsurgency efforts increases.&quot; U.S. military officials consider current operations to be the last phase of the nation's longest war, leading to a withdrawal planned to begin in about a year. Many military commanders believe that does not allow enough time to turn Pashtun tribal leaders away from the Taliban. And the Afghan army and police forces are years away from providing security for the nation, according to the classified assessments. Overwhelming corruption in President Hamid Karzai's government and an ingrained tribal system that has survived thousands of years has made Afghanistan it's &quot;own monster,&quot; said a U.S. military official. But Sholtis said the Taliban also is rife with corruption, including &quot;nepotism, bribes in the form of 'taxation' and a host of other abuses that are common features of areas that have been controlled by the Taliban.&quot; &quot;The Afghan government doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be better than the alternative,&quot; Sholtis said. But some U.S. and Afghan officials said the association of corruption with the Karzai government is an insurmountable obstacle to NATO credibility. &quot;The U.S. does not hold Karzai responsible for corruption,&quot; said an Afghan official in Afghanistan, who asked not to be named. &quot;The U.S. put Karzai in office -- he stole the last election and he uses NATO financing, U.S. money to line his coffers.&quot; Military officials involved in civil affairs work highlight other issues in Afghanistan: There are not enough civilian workers to help complete promised construction projects, local governments steal project funding, there are not enough Pashtun interpreters, security concerns inhibit local workers from taking coalition jobs. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 70%;">The prime requirement for a successful counterinsurgency effort is intelligence derived from a supportive population. While in conventional war the successful army is generally the side that masses firepower at the decisive point in time on the battlefield, a wily insurgent enemy rarely provides his superior conventional foe with a massed target, preferring to hide in &quot;the sea of the people.&quot; Massing intelligence collection and analysis resources, rather than firepower, is the key to capturing or killing insurgents. Armies confronting an insurgency have historically struggled with the transformation from their traditional focus on firepower to slowly and painfully cultivating the intelligence sources necessary to defeat an insurgent enemy. While the Army and Marine Corps have made significant strides in developing this capability, there is still much work to be done. The tank and infantry battalions on the front lines of counterinsurgency in Iraq were initially designed for a very different form of combat than the one they find themselves fighting today. Organized with an intelligence staff of just a handful of personnel among hundreds of tankers and infantrymen, they are learning that to wage counterinsurgency successfully these ratios must be dramatically revised. Turning every rifleman and tank driver into an intelligence collector and analyst is extraordinarily difficult, but necessary to defeat an insurgency. Chief among the skills required, but currently lacking in all but a few of the soldiers and Marines in Iraq, is facility in the Arabic language. The ability to talk with and thus gain intelligence from the local population allows the trained soldier to turn an everyday presence patrol into an opportunity to identify the enemy — the crucial and most difficult step on the road to defeating him. While the ability to talk with the local population is inherent in the ever-increasing number of capable Iraqi units, Americans will be required to serve alongside and within Iraqi units for many years to come. To make them as effective as possible, they need more translators and greater familiarity with Arabic language and Iraqi culture. The recent decision by the Marine Corps to require that every Marine develop expertise in a foreign area and language is a step in the right direction, one that the Army — and the State Department, CIA, U.S. Agency for International Development and FBI — would be well-advised to emulate. There are technological solutions to the demand for improved language skills in the works, but there is no substitute for the interpersonal nuance that only human interaction in the native language can provide. Dramatic efforts are required to ensure improvements in language capability for every patrol that goes outside the wire and corresponding improvements in the ability to analyze the greater quantities of intelligence that will flow from our soldiers as a result. Much more can be done to exploit captured insurgents and documents, understand enemy networks and conduct targeted raids to capture or kill the leadership of the insurgency. The missing nails in the horseshoe are interpreters who understand the local culture and the local insurgency and intelligence analysts who have the patience and cultural understanding to piece together the puzzle. It will take a comprehensive national effort to ensure that all government agencies place the same emphasis on success in Iraq that has marked the military effort there; redouble efforts to provide sufficient interpreters for every American patrol; improve manning, training and equipping of the advisory teams on the front lines of our efforts to improve Iraqi police and army battalions; reshape the intelligence effort in Iraq to provide sufficient properly trained and educated intelligence collectors and analysts to understand and identify the insurgents; and create and employ an information agency to fight and win the war of ideas in Iraq and beyond. These are all long-term investments. Successful counterinsurgency campaigns of the past suggest such improvements will enable us to win in Iraq — if we, as a nation, are patient enough to make the investment that a free Iraq deserves and a secure America requires. The most important lesson of the past is the critical role of national patience and persistence in defeating an insurgency. We are three years into a counterinsurgency campaign that history suggests will take at least a decade to win. This lesson cannot be repeated too often, sobering though it is for a democracy accustomed to quick victories or speedy withdrawals from intractable conflicts: Insurgencies are long wars. We should take comfort in the knowledge that armies rarely prepare correctly for the kind of war they will have to fight in the future and, therefore, generally have to adapt to the particular demands of the kind of war they are actually tasked to fight. In the words of British military historian and soldier Sir Michael Howard, &quot;In structuring and preparing an army for war, you can be clear that you will not get it precisely right, but the important thing to ensure is that it is not too far wrong, so that you can put it right quickly.&quot; In Iraq, the U.S. Army is learning counterinsurgency quickly, making up for lost time and making great strides in the effort to help the Iraqi people build a free, stable and secure Iraq. We must not falter in this effort.</span><br />

Overcoming the language barrier can be difficult.&quot; Grice, deployed with the 321st Expeditionary Advisory Squadron, has been part of a U.S. effort to teach the Iraq Air Force to assume responsibility for the nation's air space. The effort has included training of air traffic control operations in a course given at Camp Taji, Middle East Newsline reported. The course contains 16 Iraq Air Force cadets. The Iraqis have been divided into two groups and were taught basic air traffic control and relating skills, including responsibility for the tower at Taji. Taji has the busiest military air traffic control facilities in northern Iraq. U.S. advisers have reported significant language and cultural gaps in combat training courses. They said they often succeed by simply repeating the same motions until they are copied by their Iraqi students. In more advanced areas, such as air traffic control, comprehension has been regarded as vital. Advisers said the consequences of misunderstanding could mean an air collision. &quot;The accountability of an air traffic controller is huge because they're responsible for providing safe, expeditious and orderly air traffic services to all aircraft in order to prevent collisions while also issuing pilot advisories and separating aircraft both on ground and in the air to prevent collisions and to ensure their landing areas are free of vehicles and personnel,&quot; Grice said. The U.S. military has sought to teach English to Iraqi cadets before they advance to air training. But the advisers acknowledged that often Iraqi cadets, despite reaching a high level of understanding, become lost when technical terms and concepts are introduced.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 70%;">On September 10th, 2001, the United States government intercepted two phone calls placed from Afghanistan between Al Qaeda operatives. &quot;Tomorrow is zero hour,&quot; said one of the voices. &quot;The match is about to begin,&quot; came another ominous line. The National Security Agency intercepts millions of messages every hour, but these calls came from sources deemed to be high priority. They were, of course, spoken in Arabic, so they made their way to a translator's queue, waiting to be interpreted. Unfortunately, in the fall of 2001 our government did not have enough Arabic linguists to translate the messages quickly. The phone calls were not translated until two days later, on September 12, 2001. It was two days too late. The terrorist attacks of September 11th, as every American knows, changed everything. Almost immediately, a national consensus emerged, if only briefly, that nothing should stand in the way of true reform of the nation's broken intelligence apparatus. Nothing should stop a thorough and efficient re-orientation of our national security perspective, which must immediately be geared toward fending off future terrorist attacks. Nothing, that is, except letting gays in uniform take part in the fight. The story of the ongoing purges of gay soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines with language skills critical to waging the war on terrorism pits political expediency and moral dogma against national security, social scientific research and common sense. It is a story that shines a spotlight on certain truisms that Americans seem to grasp only when it's too late, and then to promptly forget until the next time it's too late: that prejudice is generally self-defeating rather than productive, and that it nearly always has unexpected consequences. But it's a story that should also be told with the hope — perhaps against our better judgment — that maybe this time we will learn from our mistakes, re-order our priorities, and face significant truths before we further compromise the security of our citizens and the safety of our troops. The shortage of language specialists in the intelligence and military forces has been hobbling national defense since the days of the Cold War. But between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the World Trade Center, only a few voices in the wind had noted the growing threat of Arab terrorists to American security, and the culture of the armed forces and the intelligence agencies had only just begun to budge from a fixation on Russian language as the essential skill for keeping the country safe from its enemies. Some students had begun to grasp the significance of the Arab world. The number of enrollees in Arabic language courses in colleges and universities nearly doubled between 1998 and 2002. But it wasn't nearly enough. The month before the 9/11 attacks, a major study from the University of Maryland's National Foreign Language Center warned that the country &quot;faces a critical shortage of linguistically competent professionals across federal agencies and departments responsible for national security.&quot; Less than a month after the attacks, a House Intelligence Committee report criticized the nation's three intelligence agencies – the FBI, CIA, and National Security Agency (NSA) – for relying on &quot;intelligence generalists&quot; rather than linguists with expertise in a specific foreign language, culture, and geographical area. The report concluded that &quot;at the NSA and CIA, thousand of pieces of data are never analyzed, or are analyzed 'after the fact' because there are too few analysts; even fewer with the necessary language skills. Written materials can sit for months, and sometimes years, before a linguist with proper security clearances and skills can begin a translation.&quot; Meanwhile, the intelligence agencies poured funds into advertisements, including internet marketing overseas, to try to lure linguists into the fight against terrorism. By the fall of 2002, one year after the attacks, CIA director George Tenet warned that the U.S. faced a terrorist threat every bit as grave as it did before 9/11. A week later, the Council on Foreign Relations issued an even more sobering report. Despite bipartisan support for intelligence reform, backed by overwhelming public demand for addressing unpreparedness, the study found that &quot;America remains dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic terrorist attack. In all likelihood, the next attack will result in even greater casualties and widespread disruption to American lives and the economy&quot; than those wrought by 9/11. Yet during the first year of the war in Afghanistan, the U.S. had 69 intelligence teams on the ground but had a 75% shortfall of daily intelligence reports. This meant that no matter the number of troops sent into foreign territory, and despite the billions of dollars being thrown into our military campaigns, a full three-quarters of the data collected about the looming threats from our enemies was not getting processed. A major obstacle to producing the reports, according to an assessment by the Center for Army Lessons Learned in Fort Leavenworth, was the shortage of Arabic speakers. The problem was not confined to intelligence agencies, but was felt in the armed forces too. In 2002, the Army reported, it could only find 42 of the 84 Arabic linguists it was seeking to hire. In addition to this 50 percent shortage of Arabic experts, it faced a 68 percent shortage of Farsi translators and a 37 percent shortage of Korean experts. According to a General Accounting Office (GAO) study released the same year, the Army, along with the FBI, State Department and Commerce Department, failed in 2001 to fill all their jobs that required expertise in Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Farsi, or Russian. The Army reported that the &quot;linguist shortfalls affect its readiness to conduct current and anticipated military and other missions.&quot; It said, for instance, that it lacked the linguistic capacity to support the prosecution of two major wars at one time, the baseline requirement of American military planners since the end of the Cold War. The GAO study concluded that staff shortages at these agencies &quot;have adversely affected agency operations and compromised U.S. military, law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism and diplomatic efforts.&quot; And it stated that shortages in language expertise resulted in &quot;less timely interpretation and translation of intercepted materials possibly related to terrorism or national security threats.&quot; Two years after 9/11, the situation had not improved. The shortage of Arabic speakers had become so desperate by 2003 that one of the top Arabic speakers in the Iraqi theater was being used to translate a common housekeeping exchange, taking him away from the critical duties needed to keep U.S. troops safe, mine the Iraqi desert for intelligence and win over Iraqi civilians. On several occasions, the impact of the shortage was downright treacherous. In the summer of 2003, the Wedding Island Bridge in Baghdad was the site of an explosion targeting U.S. troops. The soldiers, part of the 40th Engineer Battalion of the 2nd Brigade of the Army's 1st Armored Division, had crossed the bridge repeatedly in search of their translator. If the Army had been able to hire and retain enough of its own translators, it would have made unnecessary these perilous trips which ended this time with a land mine explosion that sent shrapnel and bits of road into the windshield and body of the engineers' Humvee. It also might have prevented tragedies before they occurred. An Arabic document was reportedly found in Kabul before the murder of journalist Daniel Pearl, describing a kidnapping plot strikingly similar to the one that ended in his disappearance and murder. It was never translated due to a shortage of Arabic speakers. An Army report released that year by the Center for Army Lessons Learned at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, found that &quot;the lack of competent interpreters throughout the theater impeded operations&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan. &quot;The US Army does not have a fraction of the linguists required.&quot; The 9/11 Commission Report concluded that the government &quot;lacked sufficient translators proficient in Arabic and other key languages, resulting in significant backlog of untranslated intercepts&quot; and the secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge, pleaded that &quot;we need more Arabic-speaking analysts.&quot; A Pentagon advisory panel reported in 2004 that the U.S. &quot;is without a working channel of communications to the world of Muslims and Islam.&quot; A Justice Department Inspector General Report that same year found that the government &quot;cannot translate all the foreign language counterterrorism and counterintelligence material it collects,&quot; due largely to inadequate translation capabilities in &quot;languages primarily related to counterterrorism activities&quot; such as Arabic and Farsi. In response, President Bush ordered a 50% increase in intelligence officers trained in &quot;mission-critical&quot; languages such as Arabic. But the shortage was a problem that could not be cleared up overnight — precisely the reason that &quot;preparedness&quot; was so important. Despite tens of thousands of responses to post-9/11 calls for more Arabic speakers to join the government's intelligence efforts, actual hires take time, especially for those positions that require security clearances. Background checks can take six months to a year. By the spring of 2005, Sen. Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican who chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee said the U.S. still had a &quot;broken system.&quot;] The U.S. military is the most powerful fighting force in the history of the world. Its troops are trained to crush the enemy with the sheer strength of superior technological might. But advances in precision warfare also allow commanders to locate and destroy highly specific targets while minimizing collateral damage — an essential feat in a world where the professed moral justification for using military power is not about gaining territory but about expanding security, democracy and markets. Yet the success of these missions relies on one prime ingredient: intelligence. On the tense streets of Baghdad; in the Sunni strongholds of Ramadi and Falluja, still seething with anti-Western resentment from the errant bomb dropped by a British plane during the first Gulf War; and in the restive outposts of Mosul, where insurgents have mastered the use of car bombs, roadside bombs and rocket-propelled grenades against American forces, nothing is more vital to staving off casualties and ultimately winning the war than information culled from Arabic-speaking natives. Without it, commanders and their troops are crippled in their efforts to protect American forces, plan attacks against the enemy and earn the trust and aid of Iraqi citizens. Poor, faulty or inadequate intelligence plays straight into the hands of guerrilla tactics, as the ignorant behemoth staggers about in the shadows, sets up camp in oblivion or accidentally strikes civilian targets, further alienating the people whose assistance is critical to winning the war. The astounding amount of money the U.S. invests in its campaigns, and the volume of soldiers risking their lives, mean little without knowing when and where and how to deploy. </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 80%;">Effective translators are critical to US success in Afghanistan</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 80%;">Reuters ’10 (Afghan Journal, 7/3, “Is the Afghan war going to be lost in translation?”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2374:http://blogs.reuters.com/afghanistan/2010/07/03/is-the-afghan-war-going-to-be-lost-in-translation/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/afghanistan/2010/07/03/is-the-afghan-war-going-to-be-lost-in-translation/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.reuters.com/afghanistan/2010/07/03/is-the-afghan-war-going-to-be-lost-in-translation/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2374 -->)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 70%;">My Afghan colleague shook his head in disbelief. The translator was consistently getting it wrong, he said. The soldier’s frustrations were growing by the minute. Aside from raising the possibility that the wrong flow of information could lead to suspicions falling on someone who had no connections to the bombing, the tedious exchanges raised wider questions. Is it possible that erroneous translation has undermined intelligence gathering on the Taliban, who have staged a comeback after their overthrow in 2001, fighting tens of thousands of foreign forces and draining Western budgets? Could the insurgency — now at its strongest — have been weakened if the translation was more precise? There is no time to go back and repeat all the questioning that has taken place before a U.S. troop pullout starts next summer. Maybe translators for Western troops fighting a war they say it vital for the security of millions of Afghans, as well as their own countymen, may actually need their own interpreters? It’s a troubling question that needs to be asked and answered very quickly, and clearly, if NATO troops are to get what they need badly in a counter-insurgency — reliable information.</span><br />
