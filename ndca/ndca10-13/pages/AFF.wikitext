**Plan Text:**
**The United States federal government should increase the use of nuclear bombs in rocket propulsion technology following the Project Orion model initiated in 1958.**

**Project Orion was a propulsion system that relied on exploding nuclear bombs behind a rocket as a means of propulsion. It outperformed all other propulsion systems of the time. Nevertheless, NASA still shut down the program in 1965.**

**The inability of the state to guarantee safety in a nuclear realm means that its ability to be a sovereign power has been compromised. However, the state legitimizes nuclear security through nuclear reclusion. The public’s lack of perception in regards to nuclear policy gives the state the ability to continue its sovereign rule.**

Nuclear pulse propulsion...about 40 years.

**The concept of sovereignty is based upon the idea that a state can exercise control over a certain geographical location. However, with colonization, the vastness of space exponentially decreases the State’s ability to exercise its power.**

None of these...of government power.

**The desire for security is based upon a framework of order and control. The State attempts to manage its nuclear stockpile and hide it in order to manipulate the population. This technological enframing culminates in mass graves and holocausts.**

**Contention 1 is the Fossil Fuel Industry**

In her book...vehicle for self-interest.

**This allows the fossil fuel industry to get away with mass murder – exploitation by the fossil fuel industry causes immense structural violence – environmental exploitation kills 150,000 people a year and causes 5 million incidents of disease in the world’s poorest nations. As one of world’s highest-emitting countries, the US must lead.**

**Contention 2 is Ethics**

**The fossil fuel industry has a long track record of human rights abuses – corporations use brutal repression to silence critics – this erodes the foundations of democracy and makes the chance of civil war 40 times greater.**

<span class="s3">There is an...</span>managed resource extraction.

**This is particularly true in Bahrain – oil corporations have hijacked Bahrain’s democratic uprising. Top corporations are rushing into Bahrain to ready the country for oil exploitation – this necessitates large-scale human rights abuses to suppress the democratic movement. The US has remained largely silent on the issue – its oil relationship with Saudi Arabia dominates its agenda.**

For the doctors...<span class="s3">by its self-deception.</span>

**This form of doubling makes extinction inevitable – accepting the suffering of the Bahraini people as a normalized part of life locks us into a train of thought where we see their suffering as natural and a necessary cost of the nuclear age. This legitimizes apocalyptic suicide – we become rendered passive consumers while the state builds nuclear bombs and marches toward Armageddon. Only affirming our ethical relationship to the Bahraini revolution allows us to break this frame – questioning the status quo’s insidious doubling is the first step to creating new political futures.**
