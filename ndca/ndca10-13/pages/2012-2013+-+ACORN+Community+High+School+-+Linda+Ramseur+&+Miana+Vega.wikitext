Ableism Aff
Contention One: Immobility 

Investment decisions for transportation infrastructure have systematically removed disabled populations from society by denying them of their mobility.
AAPD, 2012 (The American Association of People With Disabilities, "Equity in Transportation for People with Disabilities", May 23, http://www.infrastructueusa.org/equity-in-transportation-for-people-with-disabilities/)

Transportation and mobility play key roles in the struggle for civil rights..... a lack of requirements has meant very uneven progress. 

And - These seemingly innocent investment decisions render differently-abled people prisoner to a transportation infrastructure system that forces immobility upon them. Disabled people are confined to their own space and the only way out is through a transportation system that was designed and is maintained without consideration of their perspective. This is not unintentional, rather, fixed-routes and times are regulated to allow society to exist free from contact with these individuals 
Langan, 2001 (Celeste, Associated Professor of English at the of California Berkeley, "Mobility Disability", Publc Culture, Vol. 13,No. 3, Fall, Project Muse)

Plan - the United States Federal Government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure accessibility investment

Contention 2: Mobility 

Our current understanding of disability within transportation policy makes it such that the disable prespective is always relegated to the periphery. Traditional assumptions about transportation blame individuals for their lack of accessability and consider them ultimately responsible for their own mobility. Only repolitizing transportation infrastructure can shift responsibility to the institution that maintain exclusion and can open space to expose our complicity in ableist structures of knowledge
Koch, 2008 (Tom, Adjunct Professor of Medical Ethics at the University of British Columbia, "Spaced Out in the City: the Wrinkled World of Transit for Those With Limited Mobility", Disablity Studies Quarterly, Vol. 28 No. 2, Spring, http://dsq-sds-org/article/view/94/94)
It is strikinging, nonetheless, that so few leftist have understood disability to these terms..........we believe the need to equal the playing field to assure equal access to all will be not simpily a political ideal but a social goal in transit planning.

Ableism is a pre requisite to all oppression

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Abelism is an umbrella ism for other isms such as racism, sexism ..... ABECS could be used as the abelism equivilent to the NBICS S&T convergence</span>

As an American policy intellectual you are morally obligated to support domestic disability protections 
Olberheltzer, 2001 (Jerry, Professor at University of Norte Dame, "Equity of Attitude", May 7, http//www.nd.edu/frswrite/issues/2001-2002/Philbin-shtml)
As a Compassionate society, American has a moral obligation to help the disabled ....In turn, those whom the government helps will be less reliant upon these subsidy programs, and the same time, be productive, full members of society.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Disability has functioned historically to justify inequality for disabled people themselves, but it has also done so for women and minority groups....</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">disability has functioned for all such groups as a sign of and justification for inferiority.</span>

====<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">And – As students participating in policy debates we have an obligation to put disability at the center of our discussion because what we debate about here says a lot about human conduct on a larger scale – this is not a meta-theoretical quibble but central to change the way that disability is represented and conceived</span>====

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">I am here today to focus on the need for new transit operating models for increasing mobility for the growing senior population, particularly in areas with limited pubic transportation.....Thank you for the opportunity to raise these issues as you tackle the challenges of providing federal support for these critical services.</span>


====<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">Inclusion programs can act as a catalyst that changes the entire socio-economic system of disability – the call for the plan serves as the springboard for sweeping changes in the way that society looks at disability</span>==== 
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">__Metts, 2006__ (Robert, Professor of Economics at the University of Nevada, [[@http://www.ecomod.org/files/papers/181.pdf]])</span>

This paper has developed a theory of the connections between poverty and disability that suggests that societal factors such as prejudice and discrimination are more significant in the fight against poverty and disability than so called economic factors.....
In such a situation, in which people who experience impairments no longer have to face unnecessarily inhospitable environments, disability itself can be abolished.
