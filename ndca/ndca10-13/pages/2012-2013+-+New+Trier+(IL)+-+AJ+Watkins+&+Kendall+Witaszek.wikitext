Failed states offer attractive venues for terrorist groups seeking to evade counterterrorism efforts of the

Eliminating terrorist safe havens and support for terrorist groups in Africa is a top U
AND
of ungoverned or under-governed regions where they can operate without restraint.
Countering this threat is the common denominator that drives Ham’s theater engagement strategy and its

Energy security is now high on the foreign policy agendas of most countries. China
AND

We will isolate 2 Internal Links – First is Inflation

It is a big challenge to balance maintaining steady, fast economic growth with stepping
AND
down on speculative manipulation of prices and subsidizing the low-income groups.

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Second is energy insecurity – </span>

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">How extensive are China's oil interests in Africa?</span>
China's voracious demand for energy to feed its booming economy has led it to seek

Equatorial Guinea. This tiny West African country's total proven oil reserves are estimated at
