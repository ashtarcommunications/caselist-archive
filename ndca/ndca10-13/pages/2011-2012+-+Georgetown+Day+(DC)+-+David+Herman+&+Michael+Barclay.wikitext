==Solaris== 

===1AC - Harvard (Rd 2)=== 

**Part 1: Welcome to Solaris**
**Lem 61** (Stanislaw Lem. Solaris. 1961.)

So much for the mathematicians. … new norms and new phenomena.

**As the scientists attempted to quantify Solaris within the confines of anthropomorphic science, the resulting breakdown in reality was more revealing than their efforts. Only when they were able to rethink their blind reliance on rationality could they begin to understand the unintelligibility of extraterrestrial otherness.**
**Kerslake 07** (Patricia Kerslake. Adjunct senior lecturer at Central Queensland University and a contributor to The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy. Science Fiction and Empire. 2007.)

The image and metaphor of … of conversations with the dead.


**Dr. Kelvin and the other scientists that studied Solaris were confronted with a complex intelligence that broke the boundaries of the anthropomorphized science that their authority and knowledge of the universe is derived from. The omniscient blue seas of Solaris present the exception to a presumably objective understanding of the universe.**
**Kerslake 07** (Patricia Kerslake. Adjunct senior lecturer at Central Queensland University and a contributor to The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy. Science Fiction and Empire. 2007.)

With the production of such … into darkness, horror and destruction.


**Despite being relegated to the margins, this form of madness represents a beacon of heterogeneity in the constricted world of scientific rationalism. The science of Solaristics devolved into dogma attempting to explain the extraterrestrial other but madness stands as the last chance to see what others cannot.**
**Klapcsik 08** (Sandor Klapcsik. Professor at the University of Jvyaskala in Finnland. Solaris as Metacommentary: Meta-Science Fiction and Meta-Science-Fiction. Published in Extrapolation. Kent: Spring 2008. Vol. 49, Iss. 1)

When Foucault underlines the significance … using the language of methodology" (172).

**The knowledge of madness reveals the absurdity of scientific objectivity. The cryptic oceans of Solaris only become comprehensible when the blinders are taken off of rationality, showing how madness is more useful than dogma.**
**Klapcsik 08** (Sandor Klapcsik. Professor at the University of Jvyaskala in Finnland. Solaris as Metacommentary: Meta-Science Fiction and Meta-Science-Fiction. Published in Extrapolation. Kent: Spring 2008. Vol. 49, Iss. 1)

A further similarity between the … calculable for us" (Nietzsche, The Will 280).

**The netwonian worldview results in extinction from war, oppression, and environmental destruction. The atomization inherent in the Newtonian worldview is reductionist and ensures that we fail to understand the global consequences of our actions.**
**Nhanenge 07** – (2007, Jytte, MA in Philosophy at the University of South Africa, “Ecofeminism: Towards Integrating the Concerns of Women, Poor People, and Nature into Development,” published by University Press, available online, DH)

The problem is that modernism … of a potentially terminal nature. (Ekins 1992: 203-207).

**Anthropocentric science necessitates ecological destruction and extinction.**
**Ahkin, 10** – (Melanie Ahkin, Monash University, 2010, “Human Centrism, Animist Materialism, and the Critique of Rationalism in Val Plumwood’s Critical Ecological Feminism,” Emergent Australian Philosophers, a peer reviewed journal of philosophy, http://www.eap.philosophy-australia.com/archives.html DH)

These five features provide the … transformation of the human centric framework.

**Thus the plan:** The United States federal government should increase its exploration for Solaris beyond the Earth’s mesosphere.

**Part 2: The Triple Threat**

**Lem’s fiction reveals the insufficiency of anthropomorphized human science to explain the Otherness that is space beyond the Earth’s mesosphere. Solaris represents an intelligence that shatters the foundations of such an anthropocentric knowledge base.**
**Klapcsik 08** (Sandor Klapcsik. Professor at the University of Jvyaskala in Finnland. Solaris as Metacommentary: Meta-Science Fiction and Meta-Science-Fiction. Published in Extrapolation. Kent: Spring 2008. Vol. 49, Iss. 1)

Istvan Csicsery-Ronay describes Stanislaw … sciences and in the humanities.

**In the face of an inexplicable Otherness, the state uses science to dismiss it with stigmatization.**
**Wendt and Duvall 08** (Alex Wendt and Raymond Duvall. Professor of Political Science at Ohio State University and Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. Sovereignty and the UFO. Political Theory 2008 36: 607. [[http://ptx.sagepub.com/content/36/4/607]].)

On March 30-31, 1990, two Belgian F-16s … find out what UFOs are.”17

**Scientific objectivity and the state define the conditions of life to create specialized discourses that make threats knowable and controllable. Knowledge of the extraterrestrial is instantly marginalized in an attempt to sustain the taboo.**
**Wendt and Duvall 08** (Alex Wendt and Raymond Duvall. Professor of Political Science at Ohio State University and Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. Sovereignty and the UFO. Political Theory 2008 36: 607. [[http://ptx.sagepub.com/content/36/4/607]].)

In thinking about the problem … their need to be “governed”).


**Blind agnosticism becomes a tool of state denialism unless tempered with the power of a realist moment – we must act as if the extraterrestrial other is knowable, while being open to the possibility that is entirely outside of human cognition.**
**Wendt and Duvall 08** (Alex Wendt and Raymond Duvall. Professor of Political Science at Ohio State University and Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. Sovereignty and the UFO. Political Theory 2008 36: 607. [[http://ptx.sagepub.com/content/36/4/607]].)

First the argument. Adapting ideas … might ultimately exceed human grasp.

**Our stance of militant agnosticism successfully attacks anthropocentric sovereignty at its weakest points. The UFO taboo relies upon epistemic authority to validate it in judgment situations.**
**Wendt and Duvall 08** (Alex Wendt and Raymond Duvall. Professor of Political Science at Ohio State University and Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. Sovereignty and the UFO. Political Theory 2008 36: 607. [[http://ptx.sagepub.com/content/36/4/607.)/|http://ptx.sagepub.com/content/36/4/607.)\]]

We have called ours a “critical” … rule that requires and sustains it.

**When the legitimacy and existence of an entire population is in question, politics become murderous—the entirety of the world is reduced to bare life in an attempt to rid the public sphere of all difference. The only option becomes the extermination of all life.**
**Duarte 05** (Duarte, professor of Philosophy at Universidade Federal do Paraná, 05 André,” Biopolitics and the dissemination of violence: the Arendtian critique of the present.” http://hannaharendt.net/research/biopolitics.html)

These historic transformations have not … large-scale phenomena of population. 29)

==Delay Tolerant Networking== 

===1AC - Harvard Tournament=== 

Same as Harvard RR 1AC except new plan text and solvency contention

====Plan==== 

**Thus the plan:** The United States Department of Defense should substantially increase the deployment of delay/disruption tolerant networking,

===Case Kritiks=== 

====Accidents====

**Counterplan text:** The United States federal government should transfer all responsibility for space based space situational awareness to the United States Air Force Space Command. The United States Air Force Space Command should expand Joint Warfighting Space to meet the needs of Joint Force Commanders by providing dedicated and responsive on-orbit, near-space, and deployable space forces as an organic part of Joint Task Forces. The United States Department of Defense should set clear processes and guidelines for its new Space-Track program for disseminating orbital data to other states, commercial users and researchers and reverse its policies aimed at applying restrictions on how approved users publish and redistribute the data and analyses based on the data. The United States federal government and the Department of Defense should encourage other states to build capacity, particularly in the area of sensors and collision avoidance models and work with the commercial satellite industry and international community to establish clear processes for industry-to-industry communications, and to build and support a more robust system for registering satellite operations data. The United States federal government should endorse a Code of Conduct for all spacefaring nations modeled on the EU Code of Conduct. The United States federal government should not create a Space Guard.
