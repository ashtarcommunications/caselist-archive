===<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">Risk</span>=== 
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">Contention 1 is Risk</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">The negative will attempt to convince you that the plan is undesirable by appealing to far-fetched scenarios of global destruction – we ask that you remain skeptical of their convoluted internal link chains.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">1. Arguments like “there’s always a risk” is not a reason to vote negative – low probability internal link chains should not be used as an excuse to reject the plan.</span>
**<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">Herbeck and Katsulas 92 </span>**<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">(Dale A., Professor of Communication and Director of the Fulton Debating Society at Boston College; John P., Debate Coach at Boston College, 1992, “The Use and Abuse of Risk Analysis in Policy Debate,”, Available Online via ERIC Number ED354559, p. 10-12)</span>
