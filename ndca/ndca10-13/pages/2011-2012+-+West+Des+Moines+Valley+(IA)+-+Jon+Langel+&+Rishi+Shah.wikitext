And, We’ll isolate 4 internal links to hegemony



1. Military power – threats of attacks on space assets increasing that will crush capabilities

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">A grand strategy based on American.... to the economic prosperity it provides</span>.

We solve in two ways:

1.) A firm commitment to ORS is vital to credible deterrence by denial – it will prevent Chinese attacks against US space assets

Expanding ORS will deter Chinese attack against US space assets

2.) Swarms of small satellites create redundancy that makes successful attacks against US assets impossible

Contention III: Aerospace Industry
Commercial space development is vital to preventing terrestrial environmental collapse

This stimulates commercial launch markets and substantially lowers launch costs – in addition to creating credible deterrence by denial
