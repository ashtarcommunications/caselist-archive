**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The history of transportation in the United States is the spatialization of white supremacy – to speak of transportation is to already speak of race. From the original transportation policy of the Middle Passage to “separate but equal” to the “white flight” of suburbanization, the condition of possibility for the freedom and __[[#|mobility]]__ associated with transportation is the subjugation of raced bodies. </span>**

===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The prioritization of certain discourses is the ultimate form of nationalist violence, using psychological terrorism to define the boundaries of acceptable discourse creating systems of exclusion condemning groups of discourses to exile. This is the worse form of onto-discursive violence that devalues human existence and allows for the genocide of “worthless lives”</span>===

===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">We have reached the tipping point for debate where the current format encourages a moral and individual distancing from global atrocities. Individual rounds have become microcosms of an oppressive structure that prioritizes “quick fix” solutions ignoring moral complications of presented action. Debate is the way we define our culture which must confront the gradual destruction of the mind </span>===

===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">We now are left with a pressing question over the meaning of debate. Despite the work of many talented individuals debate remains an exclusionary activity in which the way we frame our discussions reinstates a mindset of power and hierarchies. We must become aware of the context in which debates take place and examine how our decisions affect others in the community</span>===

===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thus Jake and I advocate an examination of how we use our position in debate to characterize the activity and the education it creates</span>=== 





===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This examination presents the only scenario in which change can be created. We must provide a framework for refusal that does not grant credence to the current focus of debaters. Our individual agency is a profound source of substantive change </span>===
