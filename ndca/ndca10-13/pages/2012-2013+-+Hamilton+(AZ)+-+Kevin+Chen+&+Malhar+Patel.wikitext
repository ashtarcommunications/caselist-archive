<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">AND</span>
For them, it is the next meal that is the overriding concern.”

===Plan=== 

The United States federal government should invest in the construction of two new polar icebreakers to be operated by the United States Coast Guard. The United States federal government should ensure that the POLAR SEA remains mission capable and that the POLAR STAR remain available for reactivation.
10 points for every plan flaw you catch.

We also want the POLAR BEARS to remain mission capable, but we don't advocate that.

Oh yeah, and btw, POLAR SEA and POLAR STAR are both acronyms.
