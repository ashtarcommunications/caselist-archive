<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">When General David Petraeus testifies today on Capitol Hill, his main job will be to carefully define the timeline for the beginning of America's exit from Afghanistan, a timeline that has stakeholders in Washington and throughout the region confused and concerned. &quot;As the President has stated, July 2011 is the point at which we will begin a transition phase in which the Afghan government will take more and more responsibility for its own security,&quot; </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Petraeus wrote</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in his <span style="color: black;">advanced questions</span> submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee and obtained by <em>The Cable</em>. &quot;As the President has also indicated, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">July 2011 is not a date when we will be rapidly withdrawing our forces</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and -switching off the lights and closing the door behind us.&quot; </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">His job will</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">be to defend</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> President </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Obama's decision to set a public date for the beginning of the withdrawal in the first place</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, by arguing that having a time line in the public discussion helps pressure the Afghans to move faster toward being able to govern and secure their country on their own. &quot;I believe </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">there was value in sending a message of urgency -- July 2011... But it is important that July 2011 be seen for what it is: the date when a process begins, in which the reduction of US forces must be based on the conditions at the time, and not a date when the U.S. heads for the exits</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; he wrote to the committee. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">He stressed that multiple times that the pace of the drawdown would be &quot;conditions based.&quot; </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But even in his own writing to the committee, Petraeus acknowledged that the enemy, the Taliban and other insurgents in Afghanistan, are waiting out the coalition and biding their time until foreign forces decide to leave. &quot;Insurgent leaders view their tactical and operational losses in 2010 as inevitable and acceptable. The Taliban believe they can outlast the Coalition's will to fight and believe this strategy will be effective despite short-term losses. The Taliban also believe they can sustain momentum and maintain operational capacity,&quot; he wrote. One of the main enablers of any U.S. exit is the development of the Afghan National Security Forces, which has not gone at the pace the coalition had hoped. Petraeus wrote that he would review the situation of the ANSF within four months of assuming command, if confirmed. As of the latest review, only 5 out of 19 Afghan National Army brigades can function without a majority of their functions supported by the U.S., according to Petraeus, and only 2 out of 7 major headquarters can function properly without significant coalition support. As of June 27, there are 7,261 ANA troops in the city of Kandahar and 6,794 Afghan soldiers in Helmand province, Petraeus wrote. He also said that a comprehensive plan to reintegrate some Taliban fighters is under final review with President Hamid Karzai and &quot;offers the potential to reduce violence and provide realistic avenues to assimilate Pashtun insurgents back into Afghanistan society.&quot; Petraeus promised to take a look at the rules of engagement that U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan feel are tying their hands in the fight, but he didn't say whether he was leaning toward changing them or not. Meanwhile, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">confusion over the president's timeline persists both in Washington and abroad as interested parties try to interpret the July 2011 date in a way that serves their own political interests.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, said Monday that there would be &quot;<span style="color: black;">a serious drawdown</span>&quot; next summer, seemingly getting ahead of the administration in an effort to appease the liberal wing of her caucus, which is threatening to not support more funding for the war. Two of the committee members Petraeus will face today, Sens.

<strong>Staying is useless – prefer statistics to military propaganda</strong> <br />
<strong>Cohen 2/9</strong>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Michael, senior fellow at the American Security Project [“Deck Chairs on the Titanic,” </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/02/08/deck_chairs_on_the_titanic?page=full" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/02/08/deck_chairs_on_the_titanic?page=full</a><span style="font-size: 8pt;">] HURWITZ</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Over the past two weeks, as the world's attention has been focused on pro-democracy demonstrations in Egypt, </span>the tale of woe emanating from Afghanistan has only grown worse<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As if right on cue, President Hamid </span>Karzai announced<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the recent security conference in Munich </span>that provincial reconstruction teams<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- a key element of the U.S. military's counterinsurgency strategy -- </span>are undermining his governing authority<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and should be winded down by 2014. But </span>this<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> latest Karzai salvo </span>is the mere tip of the iceberg<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Although Gen. David Petraeus and other administration officials have tried to spin recent military gains as a reason for optimism, </span>by<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> President Barack </span>Obama's own criteria for success, the United States is failing badly in Afghanistan. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Back </span>in<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> December </span>2009<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, when </span>Obama<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> announced his plans for escalation in Afghanistan, he </span>identified three key elements<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the mission: </span>militarily breaking the Taliban's momentum<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and increasing Afghanistan's capacity to secure itself independently; </span>helping the Afghan government<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> take advantage of improved security to </span>improve governance<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span>and<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> finally, </span>forging a strong partnership between the United States and Pakistan. On<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nearly </span>all these fronts the U.S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. mission </span>is showing very little progress<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The military repeatedly claims it is regaining the momentum from Taliban insurgents. And though it appears the Taliban have been weakened by an uptick in U.S. military engagement, the facts also suggest a more complicated reality. According to the well-respected Afghan NGO Safety Office (ANSO), </span>2010 was the most violent year of the war.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The organization claims </span>the evidence is &quot;indisputable&quot; that security conditions in the country are worsening<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Only four provinces, according to ANSO are considered to have &quot;low insecurity,&quot; and across Afghanistan </span>civilian casualties are up<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- as is U.S. and NATO loss of life. Indeed, there were more than 1,430 insurgent incidents in January 2011, an 80 percent increase over the same period last year. But </span>even if one accepts<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Petraeus's claims </span>that America has &quot;got our teeth in the enemy's jugular<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> now</span>,&quot; the rest of the story is more uniformly negative<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Improvements in </span>Afghanistan's security forces are sketchy at best<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A new report from </span>the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Special </span>Inspector General<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for Afghanistan Reconstruction </span>describes a devastating tale of &quot;poor planning&quot; and weak management that is undermining ambitious U.S. training goals<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for Afghan security forces. </span>Training of the Afghan police isn't much better<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A recent survey of police mentoring in Afghanistan concluded that </span>&quot;corruption among the Afghan police was effectively universa<span style="font-size: 8pt;">l,&quot; and </span>even by NATO's own data, attrition rates<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for the Afghan police, though improved, </span>are still above 50 percent<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. How about the aforementioned Hamid Karzai? Here again the story is not good. </span>Karzai finally begrudgingly agreed<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> last month t</span>o seat the newly elected Afghan parliament <span style="font-size: 8pt;">-- four months after a fraud-scarred election. But he did so </span>only after &quot;intense pressure&quot; from the international community. Hopes that Karzai would move &quot;in a new direction<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; as Obama said at West Point, </span>have not materialized<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- and </span>economic and political corruption<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as well as poor governance, </span>remains a fundamental part of life in Afghanistan.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> With Karzai's government showing such little improvement, </span>relations between Kabul and the U.S. government have become increasingly frayed. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Across the </span>border in Pakistan, things aren't much better<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The United States has<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> just this week </span>suspended all high-level dialogue with Pakistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> over the continued detainment of an U.S. diplomat, Raymond Davis, who is being held in violation of his diplomatic immunity by Pakistani authorities. </span>It's indicative of the cloud of suspicion that continues to darken U.S.-Pakistan relations. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Indeed, last month there were reports that Washington plans to offer Islamabad a new set of inducements to remove the Afghan Taliban safe havens in Pakistan. But </span>nine years of enticements from the Obama and Bush administrations have failed to convince Islamabad to abandon the Taliban as a strategic ally<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- and </span>there is little reason to believe that a new offering of American baubles and assurances will soften Pakistani intransigence. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">These tales of unmet strategic objectives represent a fundamental failure of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. Yet this has not stopped U.S. policymakers from continuing to make grandiose claims of progress. In Obama's recent State of the Union address, he said that the fight is being &quot;taken&quot; to the enemy, words that dovetailed with those of his commanding general in Afghanistan, whose recent assessment to troops claimed the mission in Afghanistan is making &quot;impressive progress&quot; and has inflicted &quot;enormous losses&quot; on Taliban fighters. </span>The statements by Obama and Petraeus are now typical fare from the U.S. government<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: They offer glowing </span>optimism about recent<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> military </span>gains, but <span style="font-size: 8pt;">make </span>no mention of the larger strategic obstacles that imperil success<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in Afghanistan. However, </span>without tangible improvement in creating a capable and effective Afghan security force; without a competent and legitimate central government able to provide good governance to its people; without a choking-off of the supply of arms and fighters from across the border in Pakistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the </span>tactical gains<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> being made by U.S. troops </span>cannot be sustained and<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, quite simply, </span>the war in Afghanistan cannot be won<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>All<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span>elements of the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- </span>political, diplomatic, and military -- must be working if the effort is to be successful<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not just the latter. But instead of recognizing these failures and shifting course, there is abiding resistance to any change among policymakers. Proposals to begin the process of political reconciliation with the Taliban are pushed aside because on the ground, after all, the insurgents are back on their heels. So why negotiate? But this mindset creates a misleading sense of optimism that precludes any serious examination of the current strategy. That myopia was evident in the strategic review released last December by the White House -- a document that, at best, deserves to be called a whitewash. </span>Long overdue in Afghanistan is a sobering recognition by political and military leaders that the current U.S. and NATO strategy is failing, has little chance of success, and must be reformulated immediately<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That is the public discussion that needs to be taking place. But none of that will happen so long as the U.S. president and his military commanders ignore the many signs that America is losing the war in Afghanistan -- choosing instead to focus their public rhetoric solely on rosy assessments of military progress.</span><br />

<strong>COIN CAUSES BACKLASH IN PAKISTAN—THIS STRENGTHENS THE TALIBAN AND MAKES VICTORY IMPOSSIBLE</strong> <br />
<strong>Lieven 12/16</strong>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Anatol, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, [“How the Afghan Counterinsurgency Threatens Pakistan,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1929:http://www.thenation.com/article/157160/how-afghan-counterinsurgency-threatens-pakistan?page=0,1 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/157160/how-afghan-counterinsurgency-threatens-pakistan?page=0,1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenation.com/article/157160/how-afghan-counterinsurgency-threatens-pakistan?page=0,1</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1929 -->]</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">If the United States continues this strategy indefinitely, the consequences for Pakistan could be dire.</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> It has been argued (by the British military chief, Gen. Sir David Richards, for example, in <em>Prospect</em> magazine) that it is necessary to defeat the Afghan Taliban in order to protect Pakistan from Islamist extremism. The truth is almost exactly the opposite. More than any other factor, it is </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">our campaign in Afghanistan that has radicalized Pakistanis and turned many of them not only against the West but against their own government and ruling system. In the worst case, the consequence of Western actions could be to destroy Pakistan as a state</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and produce a catastrophe that would reduce the problems in Afghanistan to insignificance by comparison. Western military forces are seen by the overwhelming majority of Pakistanis with whom I have spoken over the past three years as engaged in an illegal occupation. The Pakistani government's cooperation with the United States is seen as a deep national humiliation and a betrayal of fellow Muslims. I do not endorse these views myself, but it is essential to recognize just how deep and widespread they are, and that a fateful symmetry is at work: while Western officials and journalists complain constantly that the Pakistani army is not doing enough to help the United States in Afghanistan, Pakistan's population regards it as doing far too much. To put it at its bluntest, most </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Pakistanis see our presence in Afghanistan as closely akin to that of the Soviets</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> from 1979 to 1989, and resistance to us as closely akin to the resistance of those days, and equally legitimate. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">These feelings are held not just by Islamists but by those Pakistanis—the great majority of the population—who have no desire to see a Taliban-style regime</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in their country; just as Pakistanis in the 1980s who sympathized with the Afghan mujahedeen had no desire to see such forces rule Pakistan. In other words, sympathy for the Afghan Taliban by no means necessarily equates to sympathy for the Pakistani Taliban. I have found the former sympathy among educated people in Karachi who detest the Taliban's social program but who are prepared to allow the Afghan Taliban at least some legitimacy as a &quot;resistance movement.&quot; In the Pashtun areas of Pakistan, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the consequence first of the anti-Soviet war in the 1980s and now of the anti-American war has been to weaken still further the effectiveness and meaning of the frontier dividing the Pashtuns of Afghanistan and Pakistan</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">this</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> ethno-religious solidarity, more than continuing support by the Pakistani state, that </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">is providing the Afghan Taliban with their bases inside Pakistan</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This support from large elements of the Pakistani population will continue as long as Western soldiers are present in Afghanistan. Their </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">presence</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, as well as US drone strikes on targets in Pakistan, also </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">helps legitimize the campaign of the Pakistani Taliban against the Pakistani state</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Since the survival of that state is a US interest that vastly outweighs anything that might happen in Afghanistan, it follows that the </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">US goal should be to reduce that presence as soon as this can be managed</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, not to follow a strategy that risks prolonging it indefinitely.</span><br />
<strong>BACKLASH AND INSURGENT SPILLOVER MEAN PAKISTAN COLLAPSES EVEN IF WE WIN THE WAR—ONLY DRAWING DOWN FORCES SOLVES</strong> <br />
<strong>SIMON, AND STEVENSON, 9</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">* adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, AND <strong>Professor of Strategic Studies at the US Naval War College, (Steven and Jonathan, “Afghanistan: How Much is Enough?” Survival, 51:5, 47 – 67, October 2009 <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1930:http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409" rel="nofollow">http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1930 -->)</strong> </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Whatever US officials might concede privately, the White House, State Department and Pentagon have thus far not acknowledged publicly the possibility that greater American intrusiveness in Afghanistan might mean less Pakistani cooperation. That, however, appears to be the case. To be sure, Pakistan has pragmatically responded to US pressure to thwart the Taliban in its tribal areas. But it is more significant in the broader strategic context that </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Pakistan has objected to expanded US military operations in Afghanistan on two grounds. Firstly, they would cause a cross-border spillover of militants into Pakistan and increase the counter-insurgency burden on the Pakistani military. Secondly, they would foment political instability in Pakistan by intensifying popular perceptions of American military occupation of the region and the Pakistani government's complicity with the Americans in suppressing a group that was not even considered an enemy of Pakistan</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Indeed, in a July 2009 briefing, Pakistani officials made it clear that, however concerned the United States was about the Taliban, they still regard India as their top strategic priority and the Taliban militants as little more than a containable nuisance and, in the long term, potential allies.<span style="color: black;">5</span> Pakistani officials made clear that they still regard India as their strategic priority In this light, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the realistic American objective should not be to ensure Afghanistan's political integrity by neutralising the Taliban</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and containing Pakistani radicalism, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">which is probably unachievable</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Rather, its aim should be merely to ensure that al-Qaeda is denied both Afghanistan and Pakistan as operating bases for transnational attacks on the United States and its allies and partners</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Pitfalls of the current policy The Obama administration's instincts favouring robust counter-insurgency and state-building in Afghanistan reflect the 1990s-era US and European predilection for peacekeeping, reconstruction and stabilisation, and the multilateral use of force for humanitarian intervention, deployed to positive effect in the Balkans and withheld tragically in Rwanda. To the extent that this mindset was premised on an expansion of the rule of law to hitherto poorly and unjustly governed areas, such as Somalia and Bosnia, it reflects the broader conception of counter-terrorism adopted after 11 September. Insofar as it favours collective action by major powers with the unambiguous endorsement of the UN Security Council, it is also consistent with the Obama administration's rejection of Bush-era unilateralism. And an aggressive internationalist approach to spreading democracy and the rule of law, notwithstanding the shortsightedness and inefficacy of the Bush doctrine, is admirable and in some instances appropriate.<span style="color: black;">6</span> In this case, however, it is more likely to hurt than help. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">While a larger US military footprint might help stabilise Afghanistan in the short term, the effects of collateral damage and the aura of US domination it would generate would also intensify anti-Americanism in Pakistan</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">This </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">outcome, in turn, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">would frustrate both core American objectives by rendering it politically far more difficult for the Pakistani government to cooperate with Washington </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(and easier for the quasi-independent Inter-Services Intelligence to collude with the Taliban and al-Qaeda), </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">thus making it harder for the United States to defeat al-Qaeda. It would also increase radicalisation in Pakistan, imperil the regime and raise proliferation risks, increasing rather than decreasing pressure on India to act in the breach of American ineffectuality</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></strong> <br />

POPULAR BACKLASH ALLOWS THE TALIBAN TO EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE IN PAKISTAN AND TAKE OVER <br />

<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Extremist forces are beginning to align. The spread of their influence could come easily. To secure power, the Taliban</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—currently concentrated in the tribal areas west of the Indus and all along the border with Afghanistan—</span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">would need to move east. This would take them from the Pashtun-dominated regions into the Punjabi heartland</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, where they need to gain significantly more support. There is good evidence this is already happening. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The Pakistani Taliban is now coalescing with the Punjab-based Lashkar-e-Taiba.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Though differences between the organizations remain (they have no common leader or agreed-upon agenda other than jihad against India and the West), </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">they could well overcome their differences and make overthrowing the government their common priority. Terrorist leaders would likely be able to tap into the deep anger among landless peasants as well</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the India-bordering provinces of Punjab and Sindh, where they already have a great deal of support, the extremists could mobilize a mass movement similar in some respects to that which toppled the shah of Iran in 1979. Press reports suggest antilandlord agitation has been a part of the extremists’ success in the last year in Swat and elsewhere. And in this way the current civilian government would be swept from power and the army would be pressed to make an accommodation with the new Islamist leadership. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Since many in the army back the jihadists already, a deal with an Islamist movement would be attractive,</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> especially if the Islamists made promises of protecting the army’s interests (which might or might not be kept later). The </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">new government would be composed of representatives of the Pakistani Taliban, LET and possibly the Islamist political parties</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that have contested electoral power in the past. It might even draw some support from disaffected parts of the two mainstream political parties, the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) and Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), hoping to “moderate” the movement and to “tame” the Taliban. </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep filled with troops today, killing five and wounding as many as 21, including several children who were waiting for a ride to school. Residents of the region where the attack took place are fleeing in terror as gunfire rings out around them, and government forces have been unable to quell the violence. Two regional government officials were beheaded by militants in retaliation for the killing of other militants by government forces. As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where we have come to expect such terrible events. This, unfortunately, is a whole new ballgame</span>. It is part of another conflict that is brewing, one which puts what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in deep shade, and which represents a grave and growing threat to us all. Pakistan is now trembling on the edge of violent chaos, and is doing so with nuclear weapons in its hip pocket, right in the middle of one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The situation in brief: </span>Pakistan for years has been a nation in turmoil, run by a shaky government supported by a corrupted system, dominated by a blatantly criminal security service, and threatened by a large fundamentalist Islamic population with deep ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>All this is piled atop an ongoing standoff with neighboring India that has been the center of political gravity in the region for more than half a century. The fact that Pakistan, and India, and Russia, and China all possess nuclear weapons and share the same space means any ongoing or escalating violence over there has the real potential to crack open the very gates of Hell itself. Recently, the Taliban made a military push into the northwest Pakistani region around the Swat Valley. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">According to a recent Reuters report</span>: <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The (Pakistani) army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control. But insecurity mounted after a civilian government came to power last year and tried to reach a negotiated settlement. A peace accord fell apart in May 2008. After that, hundreds — including soldiers, militants and civilians — died in battles. Militants unleashed a reign of terror, killing and beheading politicians, singers, soldiers and opponents. They banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls' schools. About 1,200 people were killed since late 2007 and 250,000 to 500,000 fled, leaving the militants in virtual control. Pakistan offered on February 16 to introduce Islamic law in the Swat valley and neighboring areas in a bid to take the steam out of the insurgency. The militants announced an indefinite cease-fire after the army said it was halting operations in the region. President Asif Ali Zardari signed a regulation imposing sharia in the area last month. But the Taliban refused to give up their guns and pushed into Buner and another district adjacent to Swat, intent on spreading their rule. T</span>he United States, already embroiled in a war against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, must now face the possibility that Pakistan could collapse under the mounting threat of Taliban forces there<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Military and diplomatic advisers to President Obama, uncertain how best to proceed, now face one of the great nightmare scenarios of our time. &quot;Recent militant gains in Pakistan,&quot; reported The New York Times on Monday, &quot;have so alarmed the White House that the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the situation as 'one of the very most serious problems we face.'&quot; </span>&quot;Security was deteriorating rapidly,&quot; reported The Washington Post on Monday, &quot;particularly in the mountains along the Afghan border that harbor al-Qaeda and the Taliban,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> intelligence chiefs reported, and there were signs that those groups were working with indigenous extremists in Pakistan's populous Punjabi heartland. </span>The Pakistani government was mired in political bickering<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The army, still fixated on its historical adversary India, remained ill-equipped and unwilling to throw its full weight into the counterinsurgency fight. But despite the threat the intelligence conveyed, Obama has only limited options for dealing with it. </span>Anti-American feeling in Pakistan is high, and a U.S. combat presence is prohibited. The United States is fighting Pakistan-based extremists by proxy, through an army over which it has little control, in alliance with a government in which it has little confidence.&quot; <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is believed </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Pakistan is currently in possession of between 60 and 100 nuclear weapons</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Because </span>Pakistan's stability is threatened by the wide swath of its population that shares ethnic, cultural and religious connections to the fundamentalist Islamic populace of Afghanistan, fears over what could happen to those nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government collapses are very real. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span>As the insurgency of the Taliban and Al Qaeda spreads in Pakistan,&quot;<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> reported the Times last week, &quot;</span>senior American officials say they are increasingly concerned about new vulnerabilities for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, including the potential for militants to snatch a weapon in transport or to insert sympathizers into laboratories or fuel-production facilities.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In public, the administration has only hinted at those concerns, repeating the formulation that the Bush administration used: that it has faith in the Pakistani Army. But that cooperation, according to officials who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity surrounding the exchanges between Washington and Islamabad, has been sharply limited when the subject has turned to the vulnerabilities in the Pakistani nuclear infrastructure.&quot; &quot;</span>The prospect of turmoil in Pakistan sends shivers up the spines of those U.S. officials charged with keeping tabs on foreign nuclear weapons,&quot;<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> reported Time Magazine last month. &quot;Pakistan is thought to possess about 100 — the U.S. isn't sure of the total, and may not know where all of them are. Still, if Pakistan collapses, the U.S. military is primed to enter the country and secure as many of those weapons as it can, according to U.S. officials. Pakistani officials insist their personnel safeguards are stringent, but a sleeper cell could cause big trouble, U.S. officials say.&quot; In other words, a </span>shaky Pakistan spells trouble for everyone, especially if America loses the footrace to secure those weapons in the event of the worst-case scenario. If Pakistani militants ever succeed in toppling the government, several very dangerous events could happen at once<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Nuclear-armed India could be galvanized into military action of some kind, as could nuclear-armed China or nuclear-armed Russia. If the Pakistani government does fall, and all those Pakistani nukes are not immediately accounted for and secured, the specter (or reality) of loose nukes falling into the hands of terrorist organizations could place the entire world on a collision course with unimaginable disaster. We have all been paying a great deal of attention to Iraq and Afghanistan, and rightly so. The developing situation in Pakistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span>needs to be placed immediately on the front burner.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Obama administration appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all. </span><br />

<span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">A brief nuclear war between India and Pakistan would rip apart the ozone layer and unleash global devastation - killing millions, besides triggering catastrophic health problems</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, according to a study by US scientists. Using </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">sophisticated computer modelling,</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> University of Colorado scientists Micahel Mills and Owen Brian Toon </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">have showed that a nuclear war between the two South Asian neighbours, involving 100 Hiroshima-sized nuclear devices, would ignite urban fires and blast five million tonnes of soot 80 km into the air. The soot would absorb enough solar radiation to heat surrounding gases, setting in motion a series of chemical reactions that would break down the stratospheric ozone layer, which protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “</span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The scenario</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of a war between India and Pakistan was used as a representative of regional nuclear conflict, </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">potential</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for which </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">remains high with the increase in nuclear arsenal and the number of nuclear armed nations</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” Mills, who led the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the US, told IANS. Mills is a research associate with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the Boulder-based university’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. Toon is the director of the department. India and Pakistan are known to possess the smallest arsenals of the eight nuclear-armed powers. India has about 60 nuclear devices and Pakistan under 50. A nuclear exchange involving a hundred 15 kiloton, Hiroshima-type weapons is only 0.03 percent of the total explosive power of the world’s nuclear arsenal, Toon said. Mills said their research found that </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the catastrophic impact from even a small nuclear conflict would be much larger than estimated earlier from a bigger nuclear war</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, when simulation was not that sophisticated</span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">. The indirect human casualties elsewhere in the world would be many times more than those who actually die from the war. “We would see a dramatic drop in ozone levels that would persist for many years,” he said</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “At mid-latitudes </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the ozone decrease </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">would be up to 40 percent, which </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">could have huge effects on human health and on terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” The upper stratosphere, heated by massive smoke injections, would accelerate catalytic reaction cycles, particularly reactions of nitrogen oxide gases that destroy ozone. “By adopting the Montreal Protocol in 1987, society demonstrated it was unwilling to tolerate a small percentage of ozone loss because of serious health risks,” said Toon. “But </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">ozone loss from a limited nuclear exchange would be more than an order of magnitude larger than ozone loss from the release of gases like CFCs</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The ozone losses predicted in the study are much larger than losses estimated in previous “nuclear winter” and “ultraviolet spring” scenario calculations following nuclear conflicts</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A 1985 National Research Council Report in the US predicted a global nuclear exchange involving thousands of megatons of explosions, rather than the 1.5 megatons assumed in the Mills-Toon study, would deplete only 17 percent of the Northern Hemisphere’s stratospheric ozone, which would recover by half in three years. But the new study said ailments like cataracts and skin cancer, as well as damage to plants, animals and ecosystems at mid-latitudes would likely rise sharply as ozone levels decreased and allowed more harmful UV light to reach earth. Mills said the next step for researchers would be to study the biological impact of the nuclear war scenario, which will damage all organisms, on land and on ocean, thus polluting the food chain. </span><br />

<strong>PLAN SOLVES—PAKISTAN CAN DEFEAT THE TALIBAN AS LONG AS WE DRAW DOWN TROOPS</strong> <br />
<strong>LODHI 09</strong> [Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, Public Policy Scholar, Woodrow Wilson Center, Former Pakistan Ambassador to the US and UK, Testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, October 1] <br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Pakistan’s stability has been gravely undermined by three decades of conflict</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and strife </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">in Afghanistan</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The twin blowback from the Soviet invasion 30 years ago and the unintended consequences of </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the 2001 US military interve</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ntion has </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">created unprecedented</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> security, economic and social </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">challenges</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for Pakistan and contributed significantly to its systemic crises. Pakistan’s involvement in the long war to roll back the Russian occupation of Afghanistan bequeathed a witches brew of problems including militancy, religious extremism, proliferation of weapons and drugs, and a huge number of refugees, 2 million of whom remain in Pakistan. Their camps continue to add to the challenges facing Pakistan today. The </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">consequences of the 2001 intervention included fuelling</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> further the forces of </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">militancy in Pakistan’s tribal areas</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and producing ferment among the Pashtun tribes. The ramifications of installing a government in Kabul dominated by an ethnic minority were similarly deleterious. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">As the Afghan war was increasingly pushed across the border</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> into Pakistan and Islamabad took action in its frontier regions, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Islamic militants turned their guns on the Pakistani state</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and its security forces. It is easy to understand in this backdrop how militancy on both sides of the border between </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Pakistan and Afghanistan is interconnected</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But it is also distinct in origin, goals and magnitude. The conflict is connected first by common bonds of tribe and ethnicity; second, by the broad appeal of ideology; third, by links to Al-Qaeda and four, by the two-way cross border movement of insurgents who provide each other a degree of mutual support. It is also distinct because; one, the origin of the Afghan Taliban is older and the movement is more entrenched with an organized command and control structure. Two, the Taliban have geographically a much broader presence in Afghanistan compared to the Pakistani Taliban whose support base is confined to part of the tribal areas, which constitute just 3% of the country’s territory and represent 2% of the population. Three, there is greater confidence among the Afghan Taliban that they will prevail and outlast what they see as a foreign occupation force. In contrast to the ‘national objectives’ of their Afghan ‘cousins’, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (TTP) is a loose conglomeration of a dozen groups that primarily </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">have local origins, motives, grievances and ambitions. It lacks central command </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and control. Its core group led by Baitullah Mehsud has suffered a serious reversal by his death and the Pakistan military's aggressive actions to blockade and contain his followers in South Waziristan. Most importantly </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">public sentiment in Pakistan has now turned decisively against the TTP</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, leaving the organization in a position to launch periodic suicide missions, but not expand its influence. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The Pakistani Taliban today stands discredited</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the country and without public backing are in no position to extend their sway. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">But the continuing conflict in Afghanistan and the perceived obligation to help a movement resisting an alien force provides the TTP with its main motivation</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, mobilizing rationale and legitimacy among its tribal support base. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Pakistan is in a better position than the coalition forces in Afghanistan to disrupt, contain and ultimately defeat its “Taliban”, by building on the success of the recent operation in Swat and the tribal area of Bajaur</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Within four months of the military action launched against the Swat branch of the TTP in the northwestern part of the country the Taliban have been driven out of Malakand region, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">their advance into neighboring areas has been halted and the writ of the government has been re-established</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Over 90% of displaced people who were forced to evacuate ahead of the fighting have returned to their homes, defying doomsday predictions. The Pakistan army has demonstrated improved tactics and counter insurgency capabilities This reinforces the point that </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Pakistan has the capacity to deal with the threat of militancy</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by its own efforts, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">but without </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">compounding complications engendered by the fighting across its border</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is also a reminder of the most important lesson of counter insurgency: indigenous forces are better able to undertake successful missions. </span><br />

<strong><span style="color: black;">THE PLAN SOLVES THEIR TURNS—CT FOOTPRINT IS ENOUGH TO STOP THE TALIBAN—THEIR AUTHORS UNDERESTIMATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REMAINING TROOPS </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">LONG, 10</span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> - assistant professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (Austin, “Small is Beautiful: The Counterterrorism Option in Afghanistan,” Orbis, Spring 2010, Science Direct) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">This insoluble problem is why the counterterrorism option is important. If even a costly effort in Afghanistan cannot fully achieve the goal against al Qaeda, then it is crucial to determine whether a less costly effort can achieve a similar effect by keeping Afghanistan inhospitable to al Qaeda. This would be a clear and cost-effective alignment of resources with goals, the essence of strategy. Determining the viability of the counterterrorism option requires detailing what it might look like. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Most discussion of the counterterrorism option has been vague. Riedel and O’Hanlon sum it up as ‘‘a few U.S. special forces teams,</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> modern intelligence fusion centers, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">cruise-missile-carrying ships and u</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nmanned </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">a</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">erial </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">v</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">ehicle</span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">s</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">...’’ </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">But</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> there has been little effort to put flesh on this skeleton in terms of numbers and locations of U.S. troops. The following section presents </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">a</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> possible </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">counterterrorism force posture</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Possible Counterterrorism Force Posture First, this posture </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">would require maintaining bases in Afghanistan</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Three airfields (see map below) would be sufficient: Bagram (about 50 kilometers north of Kabul), Jalalabad (in eastern Afghanistan) and Kandahar (in southern Afghanistan). </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">This would enable forces to collect intelligence and rapidly target al Qaeda in the Pashtun regions where its allies would hold sway</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">In terms of special operations forces, this posture would rely on two squadrons of </span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">so-called ‘‘</span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Tier 1’’ operators</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, one at Jalabad Air Field (JAF) and one at Kandahar Air Field (KAF). These would be drawn from classified U.S. special mission units (SMUs) attached to Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), U.S. Army Special Forces’ Combatant Commanders in Extremis Forces (CIFs), and allied units such as the British Special Air Service (SAS) or Canada’s Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2).9 In addition, the posture would require a battalion equivalent of U.S. Army Rangers, U.S. Navy SEALs, U.S. Marine Special Operations Companies (MSOCs), British Special Forces Support Group, or some mix, with basically a company with each Tier 1 squadron or equivalent and one in reserve at Bagram.10 These forces would work together as task forces, with the Tier 1 operators being tasked with executing direct action missions to kill or capture al Qaeda targets while the other units would serve as security and support for these missions. According to Sean Naylor’s reporting, these direct action task forces are structured like the regional task forces in Iraq in 2006 that were tasked to hunt al Qaeda in Iraq. Naylor also reports similar units are already in place in Afghanistan.11 </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">In addition to these ground forces, a battalion task force from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment </span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">(SOAR) </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">would be used to provide helicopter transport, reconnaissance, and fire support for the task forces</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. The battalion would bring some mix of MH-47 heavy lift helicopters and MH60 medium lift helicopters, including the MH-60L gunship.12 The helicopters have a combat radius of at least 300 kilometers (km), giving the task forces operational reach to almost any part of the Pashtun region.13 This battalion could be supplemented with additional aviation assets from other units, such as CV-22 tilt rotor aircraft from the Air Force’s 8th Special Operations Squadron or AH-64 attack helicopters from any one of several Army aviation units.14 The JAF based task force would likely need to operate principally in the heartland of the Haqqani network (Khost, Paktia, and Paktika provinces) as this would be where al Qaeda’s principal ally in the east could best protect its members (who are not generally Pashtun). For similar reasons, the KAF based task force would principally operate against targets in Kandahar, the home of the Quetta Shura Taliban, and some of the surrounding provinces such as Helmand and Oruzgan. Both task forces would nonetheless be capable of acting against targets elsewhere in the Pashtun regions. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">In addition</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> to these two task forces, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">a counterterrorism option would retain the three Army Special Forces battalions and other elements that appear to be assigned to Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force Afghanistan</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> (CJSOTF-A).15 </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">This provides roughly 54 Special Forces Operational Detachment Alphas</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> (ODAs), </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the basic unit of Army Special Forces</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. While the task forces would focus purely on direct action, ODAs would partner with local forces to collect intelligence and secure specific areas.16 Additionally, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">these ODAs would provide crucial support to critical Afghan allies and reassure them that the U</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">S</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">is not going to entirely abandon them</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. CJSOTF-A should, in addition, have a dedicated helicopter battalion for its own lift. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">This reassurance and support of local allies is a crucial and underappreciated part of a counterterrorism option</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, though such support to local allies could also be part of a counterinsurgency campaign. Indeed, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the recently launched Community Defense Initiative </span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">(CDI) </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">seeks to use Special Forces troops to build effective tribal militias to fight the Taliban and other militants</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">.17 </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">With 54 ODAs, the United States could potentially support local allies in roughly 50 Afghan districts</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, assuming one ODA per district with a few deployed in other roles.18 Logistics might prevent this upper limit from being reached but at a minimum several dozen districts could be supported by CJSOTF-A’s ODAs. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">These local allies would in many cases be from non-Pashtun groups (Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">), which would limit their ability to be effective in Pashtun areas but would likely include at least a few other tribes that see more benefit working with the Afghan government and the United States than against them. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The non-Pashtun groups were the critical allies of the U</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">S</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">in 2001 and remain staunchly against the Taliban and other militants.</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> The Tajiks of the Panjshir Valley, for example, are probably even more anti-Taliban than the United States and have made the province one of the most secure in the country.19 </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">With U.S. support, these groups will be able to prevent the expansion of militants outside Pashtun areas</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Local allies in Pashtun areas will not only help contain militants but will also enable collection of intelligence to support the task force operations</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. One example is the Shinwari tribe in Nangarhar province, which has never valued the Taliban. Shinwari militias are reported to be working with Special Forces in the Achin district of Nangarhar.20 The Afghan Border Police commander on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border at Spin Boldak, General Abdul Razziq, also derives substantial revenue from cross-border trade and will likely continue to fight the Taliban to maintain this revenue, making him a probable local partner.21 Another potential ally is the Alokozai tribe in the Arghandab district of Kandahar province, which has a history of resisting the Taliban.22 Supporting local allies does not mean abandoning the Afghan government any more than supporting local allies in the Awakening movement in Iraq’s Anbar province meant abandoning the Iraq government. However, it does pose risks, as local allies interests may not always align with those of the central government.23 Balancing the two will require deftness which will be discussed later. In addition to the two task forces and CJSOTF-A, a few more ‘‘enablers’’ would be required. First, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">this posture would need additional special operations personnel focused on intelligence collection, along with a substantial complement of intelligence community personnel to collect both human and signals intelligence.</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">24 Second, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">it would require a significant complement of</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) including </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Predators, Reapers, and other specialized types along with their support personnel, equivalent to </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">perhaps</span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"> three squadrons</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Third, an AC-130 gunship squadron for air support would be needed, along with combat search and rescue teams from Air Force Special Operations Command. Clearly, ‘‘small’’ is a relative term. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">This special operations posture alone would be roughly five battalions of ground forces, eight aviation squadrons/ battalions</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, and a few odds and ends plus higher headquarters. This would be approximately 5,000 U.S. and Coalition troops.25 In addition, a conventional force component would be needed to serve as a quick reaction force, to provide security for the bases, and to protect convoys. A reasonable estimate for this force would be a brigade or regimental combat team, giving a battalion to each base with the higher headquarters at Bagram. This would add about another 3,500 troops.26 In addition, about 500 U.S. personnel would remain as advisers and liaisons to Afghan security forces, particularly the Afghan National Army where they would be attached at brigade and corps level. Additional air support besides the UAVs and AC-130s would also be needed. Two squadrons of fighter-bombers (F-15E, A-10, etc.) likely would be sufficient, adding another 2,000 personnel or so.27 Finally, this posture would require additional staff, logistics, and support personnel (medical for instance), some but not all of which could be contractors, adding another 2,000 military personnel.28 </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">This would be a total force of about 13,000 military personnel </span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">and some supporting intelligence community personnel and contractors. This is a high-end estimate and the counterterrorism option could potentially be done with fewer troops. Some military personnel with Afghanistan experience believe this mission could be undertaken with half this number of troops but the posture described above errs on the side of caution.29 </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">This is small compared to the current posture in Afghanistan</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, smaller still than the forces implied in General McChrystal’s report, and tiny compared to the peak number of forces in Iraq. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">On the other hand, it is vastly larger than any other counterterrorism deployment.</span></span><br />

It is now a deeply entrenched conventional wisdom that the decision to “abandon” Afghanistan after the Cold War was a tragic mistake. In the oft-told story, our “abandonment” led to<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> civil </span>war<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, state collapse, the rise of the Taliban, and inevitably terrorist attacks on American soil. </span>This narrative is now reinforced by dire warnings about the risks<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to Pakistan </span>from instability in Afghanistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Taken all together, critics of the Afghan commitment now find themselves facing a nearly unshakable consensus in continuing and deepen our involvement in Afghanistan. </span>The problem with the consensus is that virtually every part of it is wrong. Abandonment did not cause the collapse of the state. Failed states are not<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> always </span>a threat to U.S. national security<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And Pakistan’s problems have little to do with the situation across the border. First, </span>the collapse of the Afghan state after the Soviet withdrawal had little to do with Western abandonment. Afghanistan has always been beset by powerful centrifugal forces. The country is poor, the terrain rough, the population divided into several ethnic groups<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Because of this, </span>the country has rarely been unified even nominally and has never really had a strong central government<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The dominant historical political system in Afghan is warlordism. This is not a consequence of Western involvement or lack thereof. </span>It is a function of geography<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, economics, and demography. Second, there is no straight-line between state failure and threats to the United States. Indeed, </span>the problem with Afghanistan was not that it failed but rather that it “unfailed” and becameruled by the Taliban. Congo/Zaire is a failed state. Somalia is a failed state<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>There are many parts of the globe that are essentially ungoverned<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Clearly criminality, human rights abuses, and other global ills flourish in these spaces. But </span>the notion that any and all ungoverned space represents a core national security threat<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to the United States </span>is simply unsustainable<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Third, the problem was the Taliban regime was not that it existed. It was that it was allowed to fester without any significant response or intervention. We largely sought to ignore the regime — refusing to recognize it despite its control of 90% of Afghan territory. Aside from occasional tut-tutting about human rights violations and destruction of cultural sites, the only real interaction the United States sought with the regime was in trying to control drugs. Counter-drug initiatives are not a sound foundation for a productive relationship for reasons too numerous to enumerate here. Had we recognized the Taliban and sought to engage the regime, it is possible that we could have managed to communicate red lines to them over a period of years. </span>Their failure to turn over bin Laden immediately after 9/11 does not necessarily imply an absolute inability to drive a wedge between the Taliban and al Qaeda over time<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Fourth, we are now told that defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan is imperative in order to help stabilize Pakistan. But, most observers seem to think that Pakistan is in worse shape now — with the Taliban out of power and American forces in Afghanistan — than it was when the Taliban was dominant in Afghanistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>For five years from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban ruled Afghanistan and the Islamist threat to Pakistan then was unquestionably lower<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is not surprising actually. Insurgencies are at their most dangerous — in terms of threat of contagion — when they are fighting for power</span>. The number of insurgencies that actually manage to sponsor insurgencies elsewhere after taking power is surprising low<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The domino theory is as dubious in the case of Islamist movements as it was in the case of Communist expansion.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There is a notion that “everything changed on 9/11.” We are backing away as a nation from that concept in the case of torture. Perhaps we should also come to realize that our pre-9/11 assessment of the strategic value and importance of Afghanistan was closer to the mark that our current obsession with it. </span>We clearly made some mistakes in dealing with the Taliban regime. But addressing those mistakes through better intelligence, use of special forces raids, and, yes, diplomacy is likely a better solution than trying to build and sustain a reliable, pro-Western government in Kabul with control over the entire country. <br />

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> Over the winter break I had an epiphany about the interrelation of U.S. hard and soft power: </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">I</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> now </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">oppose a </span><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">counterinsurgency</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(COIN)</span> <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">strategy</span></span><span style="color: black;"> <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">in Afghanistan and advocate a purely counterterror</span></span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> (CT) </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">strategy</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> (PDF link) there instead. Blame history—or histories—that I've read recently, starting with Livy's works on early Rome (books I-V) last spring and Donald Kagan's <em>The Peloponnesian War</em> at the end of 2009. I've taken occasional dips back into Robert Kaplan's <em>Warrior Politics</em> and his source materials (Churchill, the Federalists, Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and several others). What I've taken from that reading is that </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the U.S. must pull back</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> from its current efforts to remake Iraq and Afghanistan in the image of a Western democracy, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">or risk long-term political and economic exhaustion</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. What follows is not an argument about morality, and readers may find much of it amoral. It <em>is</em> about making cold-blooded political and economic calculations about where U.S. national interests will lie in the next decade. They do not lie in an open-ended COIN mission. The history of the Peloponnesian War is particularly relevant here. Athens began fighting Sparta with the resources of an empire and thousands of talents of silver in the bank—enough to fight expensive, far-flung naval and land campaigns for three years without lasting financial consequences. Athens was <em>rich</em>, and if peace with Sparta had come by the end of the third year, Athens would have continued to prosper and rule over much of the Mediterranean. (Athens had a &quot;hard&quot;—conquered or cowed—empire as opposed to the &quot;soft&quot; empire of alliances and treaties the U.S. currently has.) But the war with Sparta dragged on for decades, despite occasional peace overtures by both sides. By war's end—despite the spoils of battle and increased taxes and tribute extracted from its shrinking dominion—Athens was broke, depopulated by fighting and plague, bereft of its empire, and could no longer project power into the Mediterranean. Where its former interests ranged from Black Sea Turkey to southern Italy, it spent decades as a small-bore power and never regained its former strength or influence. I worry that the U.S. is similarly locked into an open-ended commitment to democratize a nation that is of regional rather than global importance—a parallel to Athens convincing itself that it had to conquer distant, militarily insignificant Sicily. </span><span style="color: black;">&quot;Winning&quot; in Afghanistan</span> <span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The U.S. could &quot;win&quot; in Afghanistan</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> where victory is defined as a stable, legitimate central government that can project power within its own borders. I don't doubt that the U.S. and its allies could accomplish this given enough time and resources. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">But</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> I think—as many COIN experts also do—that </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">it will take at least another decade or more of blood and treasure to produce such a result, if ever</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Of course I'd like to see the results of a successful COIN campaign: a stable democracy, women's rights, and general prosperity for Afghans, who among all Asia's peoples surely deserve those things. I certainly want to end al-Qa'ida's ability to operate freely in South Asia and elsewhere. The U.S. is the only country that would both conceive of these missions and attempt to carry them out. But goals beyond keeping al-Qa'ida on the run don't serve the long-term interests of the U.S., and I am more interested in regaining and preserving U.S. hard power than I am in the rewards that would come from &quot;winning&quot; a lengthy COIN war. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">I fear the U.S. people and government becoming exhausted from the costs of a lengthy COIN effort, just as they are already exhausted from</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> (and have largely forgotten about) the </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Iraq</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> war. I worry that </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">if this fatigue sits in, the U.S. will abandon foreign-policy leadership</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> as it has done periodically throughout history. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">This outcome would be worse than a resurgent Taliban</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, worse than Afghan women and men being further oppressed, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">and worse than al-Qa'ida having plentiful additional caves </span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">to plot in. Here are some signs of an exhaustion of U.S. power: </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The U.S. is already overextended</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, with commitments in Iraq (shrinking for now), Afghanistan (expanding), Yemen (pending) and Iran (TBD). At home, the U.S. economy remains feeble and in the long term is increasingly hostage to other nations for goods and services it no longer produces (and increasingly, no longer <em>can</em> produce). Even more worrisome is the U.S. credit situation. The wars, and much other U.S. government spending, are now heavily underwritten by other countries' purchases of debt the U.S. issues. It has borrowed trillions from foreign countries and especially China, which continues its steady, highly rational policy of promoting exports while freeriding under the American security umbrella (just as the U.S. once rode for free beneath Britain's). Over time, those countries accrue enough debt to have a say in U.S. policies that may threaten the dollar's value, which is why you now see high U.S. officials flying to Beijing to soothe PRC nerves and explain why America keeps borrowing money. At home, there are few resources to apply following a major disaster, such as a Katrina-style hurricane or a major earthquake. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The U.S. needs to start rebuilding its reserves—of capital, of credit, of political goodwill abroad, of military force—to be ready for these and more serious crises</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">for which we currently have few resources to spare.

Whatever<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100614_afghanistan_significance_mineral_wealth?fn=7216610552" rel="nofollow">Afghanistan’s vast mineral riches</a>, mining them in the midst of war is not going to happen. More important</span><span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">,</span> </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the United States is overcommitted in the region and lacks a strategic reserve of ground forces</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Afghanistan ultimately is not strategically essential, and this is why the United States has not historically used its own forces there. Obama’s attempt to return to that track after first increasing U.S. forces to set the stage for the political settlement that will allow a U.S. withdrawal is hampered by the need to begin terminating the operation by 2011 (although there is no fixed termination date). It will be difficult to draw coalition partners into local structures when the foundation — U.S. protection — is withdrawing. Strengthening local forces by 2011 will be difficult. Moreover, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100223_afghanistan_campaign_part_2_taliban_strategy?fn=6316610519" rel="nofollow">the Taliban’s motivation</a> to enter into talks is limited by the early withdrawal. At the same time, </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">with no ground combat strategic reserve, the United States is vulnerable elsewhere in the world, and the longer the Afghan drawdown takes, the more vulnerable it becomes</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (hence the 2011 deadline in Obama’s war plan). In sum, this is the quandary inherent in the strategy: It is necessary to withdraw as early as possible, but early withdrawal undermines both coalition building and negotiations. The recruitment and use of indigenous Afghan forces must move extremely rapidly to hit the deadline (though officially on track quantitatively, there are serious questions about qualitative measures) — hence, the aggressive operations that have been mounted over recent months. But the correlation of forces is such that the United States probably will not be able to impose an acceptable political reality in the time frame available. Thus, Afghan President Hamid </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Karzai is said to be opening channels directly to the Taliban, while the Pakistanis are increasing their presence. Where a vacuum is created</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, regardless of how much activity there is, </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">someone will fill it.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Therefore, the problem is to define how important Afghanistan is to American global strategy, bearing in mind that the forces absorbed in Iraq and Afghanistan have left the United States vulnerable elsewhere in the world. </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The current strategy defines the Islamic world as the focus of all U.S. military attention. But the world has rarely been so considerate as to wait until the United States is finished with one war before starting another</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Though unknowns remain unknowable, </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">a principle of warfare is to never commit all of your reserves in a battle — one should always maintain a reserve for the unexpected. Strategically, it is imperative that the United States begin to free up forces and re-establish its ground reserves</span></span><span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Given the time frame the Obama administration’s grand strategy imposes, and given the capabilities of the Taliban, it is difficult to see how it will all work out. But the ultimate question is about the American obsession with Afghanistan. For 30 years, the United States has been involved in a country that is virtually inaccessible for the United States. Washington has allied itself with radical Islamists, fought against radical Islamists or tried to negotiate with radical Islamists. </span><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">What the United States has never tried to do is impose a political solution through the direct application of American force.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This is a new and radically different phase of America’s Afghan obsession. The questions are whether it will work and whether it is even worth it. </span><br />

In the meantime, the United States has only limited ground force capability ready to respond to other contingencies. The absence of a credible strategic reserve in our ground forces increases the risk that potential adversaries will be tempted to challenge the United States. Since the end of World War II, a core element of U.S. strategy has been maintaining a military capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating aggression in more than one theater at a time. As a global power with global interests, the United States must be able to deal with challenges to its interests in multiple regions of the world simultaneously. Today, however, the United States has only limited ground force capability ready to respond outside the Afghan and Iraqi theaters of operations. If the Army were ordered to send significant forces to another crisis today, its only option would be to deploy units at readiness levels far below what operational plans would require – increasing the risk to the men and women being sent into harm’s way and to the success of the mission. As stated rather blandly in one DoD presentation, the Army “continues to accept risk” in its ability to respond to crises on the Korean Peninsula and elsewhere. Although the United States can still deploy air, naval, and other more specialized assets to deter or respond to aggression, the visible overextension of our ground forces has the potential to significantly weaken our ability to deter and respond to some contingencies. <br />

<strong>INDEPENDENTLY, COIN DISTORTS TRAINING AND DESTROYS EQUIPMENT—KILLS READINESS FOR CONFLICTS ELSEWHERE</strong> <br />

<br />
The risk of being unready for major combat operations is partly a matter of choice: Defense Secretary Robert Gates has directed the military to focus its time, resources and energy on winning the counterinsurgency struggle in Afghanistan. That's the kind of conflict the United States is likely to be entangled in for the foreseeable future, according to <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.defense.gov/qdr/images/QDR_as_of_12Feb10_1000.pdf" rel="nofollow">current Defense Department plans</a>. It is also true, senior officials acknowledge, that the armed forces lack the time to train for and equipment to fight a major conflict that might ignite from friction with Iran, say, or China, or deal with a completely unanticipated crisis that requires American forces to quickly intervene -- like Korea, 1950. &quot;There's a belief that the president of the United States can pick up the red phone and order forcible entry operations'' like the 2003 invasion of Iraq, said Army Maj. Gen. Dan Bolger, who commands the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana. &quot;But that takes practice, and we don't get a lot of practice.'' Since 2003, the Army and Marines have focused almost exclusively on learning and conducting counterinsurgency operations, which rely heavily on language and cultural knowledge and the ability to work with local police and tribal elders. But commanders have increasingly fretted that their troops have lost skills that the military used to practice all the time: fast-paced &quot;kick-in-the-door'' attacks across a border, with armor columns, intelligence and logistics support coordinated with artillery and air strikes. With the drawdown of troops in Iraq, the Pentagon finally is able to begin rebuilding its strategic reserve, the battalions and brigades and equipment normally kept on standby for sudden crises. But the continuing demands in Afghanistan, where the Pentagon is sending 25,000 fresh troops in the coming months, leaves virtually no time for anything but Afghanistan-focused training. Moreover, the two wars have seriously depleted stockpiles of combat-ready vehicles, weapons, communications equipment and other gear. So, even if troops had time to practice big-war operations, they don't have the stuff to do it with. &quot;At a certain point,'' said a frustrated Bolger, &quot;you can't do more with less.'' In the past year, for instance, only one unit, the 3rd Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division, was able to break from counterinsurgency to practice an air assault to seize an airfield, a critical maneuver that would come at the start of a major combat operation. &quot;It was a new set of challenges,'' the division commander, Maj. Gen. James Huggins, said in an interview. Before 2001, dozens of Army and Marine Corps battalions cycled each year through the three major ground combat training centers, mastering high-intensity maneuvers with tank and armor formations, artillery, attack helicopters and fighter-bombers in grueling battles that went on day and night for weeks. But with Iraq and Afghanistan demanding different kinds of skills, the training centers were converted into mock villages of Iraqis or Afghans, where troops could practice searching cars at checkpoints, chatting with the local &quot;mayor,'' and walking foot patrols with native troops. That only one unit was able to break away from this counterinsurgency training &quot;gives you an idea of how close to the margin we are,'' said Bolger. The Army training centers at Fort Polk and Fort Irwin, Calif., each have one exercise scheduled for 2011 to train troops in what the Army calls &quot;full-spectrum operations.&quot; &quot;We are trying to get back to full-spectrum operations,'' Army Secretary John McHugh said in an interview. &quot;That is difficult given the high operational tempo we continue to face. ... We are rapidly deploying troops to Afghanistan and even the troops in the [reserve] pool are scheduled to go.'' The Marine Corps is in a similar predicament. Senior Marine officers often lament that a decade into counterinsurgency operations, the Corps has midcareer officers and non-commissioned officers who have never been on a ship, let alone learned the complex art of amphibious operations, the Marines' central mission. In an attempt to correct that shortcoming, the Marine Corps just completed its first major amphibious exercise in a decade -- by simulation. An exercise involving real Marines and actual weapons and ships is planned for 2012. A shortage of equipment is as big a problem as shortage of time. A decade of combat operations has worn down tanks, Humvees, radios, aircraft engines and almost every other piece of gear. The Marines think it will cost $8 billion just to fix its equipment. So much of the Corps' equipment is in Afghanistan that what it has on hand for training and any crises is &quot;seriously deficient,'' the then-commandant, Gen. James Conway, told Congress last spring. The bill to fix the Army's equipment may reach $36 billion, according to Gen. Peter Chiarelli, the service's vice chief of staff. The Air Force is short about $2 billion a year to fix its combat aircraft, a deficit that is building year after year and significantly shrinking the pool of planes not already committed in Afghanistan that could be sent into a come-as-you-are war. <br />

<strong><span style="color: black;">AND, COIN CREATES THE PERCEPTION OF OVERSTRETCH—INDEPENDENTLY COLLAPSES DETERRENCE AND CAUSES MULTIPLE SCENARIOS FOR CONFLICT </span></strong><br />
<strong>Haass 10</strong>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Richard, President of the Council on Foreign Relations [“Let’s Un-Surge in Afghanistan,” 12/20, <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/23669/lets_unsurge_in_afghanistan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/23669/lets_unsurge_in_afghanistan.html</a></span>] HURWITZ </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">So what should U.S. policy be?</span> Total withdrawal from Afghanistan is not the answer, as there is an enduring U.S. interest in combating any terrorists who have global reach. But the U.S. effort there should be sharply reduced. The next policy review, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">upcoming this spring</span>, should call for reducing U.S. forces to 30,000 by mid-2012. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">That's the number that were there when President Obama took office. The U.S. should channel aid to provincial leaders as well as to (and through) the government in Kabul. The U.S. should continue to train and arm friendly government and regional soldiers, but</span> U.S. combat operations should become increasingly rare. There is a good chance that the Taliban would make significant inroads in the south and east of the country under such a strategy—although there is a good chance they will make inroads regardless. What matters most is that they not allow al Qaeda and groups like it back in, and that they are attacked from the air and by special forces if they do. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The U.S. should continue to assist the Pakistani government and press it to end support for the Afghan Taliban and all terrorist groups. But Washington should do so without illusions</span>. Pakistan is unlikely to become a full partner. It will continue to see these groups and Afghan territory as part of a larger policy to confront arch-rival India. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Only a turnabout in Pakistan's relations with its larger neighbor would alter this strategic outlook. Alas, such a change is not in the offing. To justify adopting a more narrow policy toward Afghanistan this spring, President Obama would need to cite several factors</span>. First, the U.S. inability to eliminate the sanctuaries in Pakistan. Second, successful counterinsurgency depends on having a solid local partner. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Two years of sustained investment and multiple but fraudulent elections suggest that </span>Afghanistan's central government will not reach the point where it is considered effective or legitimate by the bulk of its own people. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">All this argues for adopting a policy of counterterrorism rather than state-building. There are also broader reasons to recast policy</span>. The greatest threat to U.S. national security stems from our own fiscal crisis. Afghanistan is a significant contributor to this situation and could play an important role in reducing it. A savings of $75 billion a year could help finance much-needed military modernization and reduce the deficit. Another factor is the increased possibility of a conflict with a reckless North Korea and the continued possibility of a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program. U.S. military forces must be freed up to contend with these issues. The perception that we are tied down in Afghanistan makes it more difficult to threaten North Korea or Iran credibly—and makes it more difficult to muster the forces to deal with either if necessary. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Ultimately</span> Afghanistan is a strategic distraction. U.S. interests there are limited. So, too, are the resources available for national security. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is not surprising that the commander in the field, Gen. David Petraeus, is calling for committing greater resources to the theater. But it is the commander-in-chief's responsibility to take into account the nation's capacity to meet all of its challenges, national and international. It is for this reason that the perspectives of Gen. Petraeus and President Obama must necessarily diverge. </span><br />

<strong>And the readiness of our military is key to deterrence – we aren’t invincible and we can’t afford to be tied down</strong><br />

However, <strong>the balance may be shifting</strong> again. In the last two years, Russia, India and China have all announced or clarified major defense programs that include everything from the development of advanced fighters to upgrading aircraft carriers. Turns out, adversaries took careful note of the way America and its allies used air dominance in all its operations. They reshaped their defense plans to make inroads on that asymmetric advantage. They are building advanced missiles, aircraft and subsystems and there’s also a world market for their best wares. For all these reasons, conventional deterrence is moving up the list of jobs for America’s military. According to Mullen: <strong>A big part of credibility</strong>, of course, <strong>lies in our conventional capability.</strong> The capability to project U.S. military power globally and conduct effective theater-level operations across the domains of land, sea, air, space, cyberspace, and information – including the capability to win decisively – remains essential to deterrence effectiveness. <strong>We must</strong> therefore <strong>address our conventional</strong> <strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">force structure and its</span> readiness as a deterrent</strong> <strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">factor,</span></strong> <strong>especially after 7 years at war</strong>. No one is suggesting that deterrence in this multi-polar world will be the same as the Cold War. Far from it. For one thing, America will not have the same economic dominance it once enjoyed. America’s economy will still probably be the biggest for a time, but economic and financial peers are already on the scene. Some forecast China’s economy may grow fast enough to overtake the US. With China, and other nations, military deterrence will be one part of a much wider relationship encompassing trade agreements, financial deals, diplomacy, and yes, other competition for global influence as China navigates its “peaceful rise.” Instead of spies and the Berlin Wall, the deterrence of the 21st Century will include gala state dinners, toasts with strong liquor, and a shifting series of international consortia and negotiations on everything from trade to climate change. However, low-level military friction is likely to be a constant. Russia will be active on its borders and China will continue to build global ties. Expect the spheres of influence of the major world powers to collide from time to time.

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Now we have President Obama and his domineering Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, both of whom have criticized the Pentagon's emphasis on conventional combat at the expense of low-intensity warfare. Iraq, Obama has said, was the &quot;wrong&quot; war, a distraction from the more urgent task of defeating Al Qaeda and its network of allies, including the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban. To rectify this strategic bungling, as he sees it, Obama has been redeploying combat resources from Iraq to Afghanistan. But this is just the beginning of his grand vision: </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Obama seeks to fashion a new military posture that shifts the emphasis from conventional combat to brush-fire wars and counterinsurgency</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;The struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly, and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan,&quot; Obama declared at West Point on December 1. &quot;Unlike the great power conflicts and clear lines of division that defined the twentieth century, our effort will involve disorderly regions, failed states, diffuse enemies.&quot; To prevail in these contests, &quot;we'll have to be nimble and precise in our use of military power. Where Al Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold--whether in Somalia or Yemen or elsewhere--they must be confronted by growing pressure and strong partnerships.&quot; Clearly, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">this is a long-term strategy with far-reaching implications. </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Even if Obama brings some forces back from Afghanistan in the summer of 2011, as he has pledged, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">US troops are likely to be engaged there</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> (some perhaps in a covert mode) </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">and in a number of other hot spots--&quot;two, three, many Afghanistans</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; to put Che's dictum into contemporary parlance. This strategy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, first enunciated in a series of speeches by Obama and Gates, <span style="color: black;">has been given formal character in the Quadrennial Defense Review,</span> the Pentagon's Congressionally mandated overhaul of strategy. Released on February 1, the QDR is expected to guide military planning over the next four years and to govern the Pentagon's budget priorities. Like earlier Pentagon reviews, the 2010 QDR begins by reaffirming America's stature as a global power with global responsibilities--a burden no other country can shoulder. &quot;The strength and influence of the United States are deeply intertwined with the fate of the broader international system,&quot; the document asserts. &quot;The U.S. military must therefore be prepared to support broad national goals of promoting stability in key regions, providing assistance to nations in need, and promoting the common good.&quot; But while this globalist mission has remained unchanged for many decades, the nature of the threats confronted by American forces has changed dramatically. &quot;The United States faces a complex and uncertain security landscape in which the pace of change continues to accelerate,&quot; the QDR indicates. &quot;The rise of new powers, the growing influence of non-state actors, the spread of weapons of mass destruction and other destructive enabling technologies...pose profound challenges to international order.&quot; The United States also faces a danger not unlike that envisioned by Kennedy in 1961: the emergence of radical insurgencies in the corrupt and decaying nations of the developing world. &quot;The changing international system will continue to put pressure on the modern state system, likely increasing the frequency and severity of the challenges associated with chronically fragile states,&quot; the QDR notes. &quot;These states are often catalysts for the growth of radicalism and extremism.&quot; In this environment, America's traditional advantages in conventional conflict--what the QDR calls &quot;large-scale force-on-force warfare&quot;--can no longer guarantee success. Instead, the US military must be prepared to prevail in any number of conceivable combat scenarios and employ the same sort of novel warfighting tactics as those used by America's rivals and adversaries. Our principal objective, the QDR affirms, is &quot;ensuring that US forces are flexible and adaptable so that they can confront the full range of challenges that could emerge from a complex and dynamic security environment.&quot; Within this mandate, <span style="color: black;">no priority is given greater weight than the task of preparing for an unending series of counterinsurgency campaigns in remote corners of the developing world</span>. &quot;The wars we are fighting today and assessments of the future security environment together demand that the United States retain and enhance a whole-of-government capability to succeed in large-scale counterinsurgency (COIN), stability, and counterterrorism (CT) operations in environments ranging from densely populated urban areas and mega-cities, to remote mountains, deserts, jungles, and littoral regions,&quot; the QDR explains. The language used here is instructive--both in the degree to which it reveals current Pentagon thinking and the ways it echoes Kennedy's outlook. &quot;Stability operations, large-scale counterinsurgency, and counterterrorism operations are not niche challenges or the responsibility of a single Military Department, but rather require a portfolio of capabilities as well as sufficient capacity from across America's Armed Forces,&quot; the QDR states. &quot;Nor are these type of operations a transitory or anomalous phenomenon in the security landscape. On the contrary, we must expect that for the indefinite future, violent extremist groups, with or without state sponsorship, will continue to foment instability and challenge U.S. and allied interests.&quot; As a result, &quot;U.S. forces will need to maintain a high level of competency in this mission area for decades to come.&quot; (Emphasis added.) As the QDR makes plain, this will require substantial retooling of military capabilities. In place of &quot;large-scale force-on-force warfare,&quot; the Pentagon must be configured to fight many small-scale conflicts in dissimilar locations on several continents at once. This requires that forces be equipped for counterinsurgency-type operations: helicopters, small arms, body armor, night-vision devices, mine-resistant vehicles, aerial gunships, surveillance drones and the like. Some of this material has already been provided to forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the entire military will have to be re-equipped. Also required will be increased military aid and training (provided by growing cadres of Special Forces) for the military and police forces of embattled governments in fraying Third World states. &quot;Terrorist groups seek to evade security forces by exploiting ungoverned and under-governed areas as safe havens from which to recruit, indoctrinate, and train fighters,&quot; the QDR notes. &quot;Where appropriate, U.S. forces will work with the military forces of partner nations to strengthen their capacity for internal security.... For reasons of political legitimacy as well as sheer economic necessity, there is no substitute for professional, motivated local security forces protecting populations threatened by insurgents and terrorists in their midst.&quot; Except for a slight modernization of terminology, these are exactly the words used by Kennedy to justify the deployment of thousands of counterinsurgency &quot;advisers&quot; in Vietnam, plus hundreds more in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America. The danger is that America's &quot;partner nations&quot; are not capable of deploying &quot;professional, motivated&quot; forces, so US soldiers will be compelled to shoulder an ever-increasing share of the burden. As proved true in Vietnam--and as is being repeated today in Afghanistan--this will likely be the case when the local army and police are viewed by the majority of the population as tools of a corrupt and unresponsive government. What should be cause for alarm is that</span> <span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">despite the worrisome picture in Afghanistan, the Pentagon is <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">determined to export this model</span> to other areas</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">many for the first time, including Africa. &quot;The need to assist fragile, post-conflict states, such as Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan, and failed states such as Somalia, and transnational problems, including extremism, piracy, illegal fishing, and narcotics trafficking, pose significant challenges,&quot; the document notes. &quot;America's efforts will hinge on partnering with African states, other international allies and partners, and regional and sub-regional security organizations to conduct capacity-building and peacekeeping operations, prevent terrorism, and address humanitarian crises.&quot; The United States is already assisting the Ugandan government in its seemingly futile efforts to eradicate the Lord's Resistance Army, a brutal guerrilla group with no discernible ideology, as well as the Somali government in its (equally futile) campaign to rid Mogadishu of Al Shabab, a militant Islamic group linked to Al Qaeda. It is likely that advisory teams from the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa, based at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti, are engaged in similar operations in North Africa and the Sahel. (The CJTF-HOA is the combat arm of the US Africa Command, a multiservice headquarters organization established by Bush in 2008 and given expanded responsibilities since then by Obama.) The Pentagon is also supporting counterinsurgency operations in Colombia, the Philippines and Yemen, among other countries. Typically, these operations entail deploying training and advisory teams, providing arms and intelligence information, and employing (often covert) specialized combat units. According to the QDR, &quot;U.S. forces are working in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, Colombia, and elsewhere to provide training, equipment, and advice to their host-country counterparts on how to better seek out and dismantle terrorist and insurgent networks while providing security to populations that have been intimidated by violent elements in their midst.&quot; Again, one must ask, Just how deeply is the United States involved? Where is this leading? What happens when the &quot;host-country counterparts&quot; prove unequal to the task? The worry that this will lead to an endless series of Vietnam- or Afghanistan-like counterinsurgencies is further heightened by the QDR's call for increased reliance on social scientists to better comprehend the perplexing social and cultural realities of these faraway places. Under its Minerva Initiative, the Defense Department is seeking &quot;the intellectual capital necessary to meet the challenges of operating in a changing and complex environment.&quot; For those whose memory stretches back far enough, this will recall the infamous Project Camelot, a Vietnam-era Army effort to secure academic assistance in assessing public attitudes in Third World countries for counterinsurgency purposes. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The greatest risk in all this</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, of course, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">is that the military will become bogged down in a constellation of grueling, low-level wars. This is the prospect of &quot;imperial over-stretch</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">&quot; spoken of by Yale historian Paul Kennedy in his 1987 classic, <em>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</em>. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">It is</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> also, says Fareed Zakaria in <em>The Post-American World</em>, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the scenario we must avoid if the U</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">S</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">is to escape the fate of the British Empire</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> and other failed imperiums. &quot;</span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Britain's strategic blunder was to spend decades--time and money, energy and attention--on vain attempts to stabilize peripheral places on the map</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; Zakaria wrote in 2008. &quot;The United States could easily fall into a similar imperial trap.&quot; </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Pentagon's renewed commitment to counterinsurgency and low-intensity warfare will also require a substantial investment in new hardware at a time when the country faces a record deficit, further eroding its long-term vitality. To obtain the added funds he deems necessary, Gates has asked for an $18 billion increase in the Pentagon's base budget for the 2011 fiscal year, raising total spending to $549 billion (which does not include combat costs in Iraq and Afghanistan). To gain additional financing for these projects, he has been willing to sacrifice some big-ticket items intended for major conventional wars, such as the F-22 jet fighter (discontinued in 2009). Gates calls this shift in emphasis &quot;rebalancing,&quot; and it is said to be the guiding principle of the new Pentagon budget. &quot;Rebalancing our forces in support of these strategic priorities means that US forces must be flexible and adaptable to confront the full range of plausible challenges,&quot; Under Secretary of Defense Michèle Flournoy, one of the QDR's principal authors, told a Pentagon press briefing on February 1. &quot;To underwrite this flexibility...we need more and better enabling capabilities...like intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, rotary-wing aircraft, language skills and so forth.&quot; The danger here is that Congress--prodded by powerful interests in the military-industrial complex--will approve the specialized counterinsurgency equipment sought by Gates and Flournoy, as well as an array of costly, super-sophisticated weapons designed to fight a full-scale war with some future, Soviet-like &quot;peer&quot; competitor. Under these circumstances, the Pentagon budget will continue to grow. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The Obama-Gates strategy</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> thus entails a double peril. On the one hand, it </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">risks involvement in an endless series of wars, wearing down the military and turning more and more non-Westerners against the U</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">S</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates--exactly the outcome envisioned by Che in his famous 1967 dictum. On the other hand, the &quot;rebalancing&quot; sought by Gates could lead to higher spending on low-intensity hardware while failing to curb investment in high-end weaponry, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">thereby producing ever-increasing military budgets, a growing national deficit and persistent economic paralysis. In the worst case, both outcomes will occur, dooming the U</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">S</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">to retreat, humiliation and penury.</span> </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">There is no reason to doubt that Obama and Gates believe they are acting in the nation's--and the world's--best interest by advocating a strategy of global counterinsurgency. Such a strategy could conceivably prevent Al Qaeda from gaining a temporary foothold in some &quot;ungovernable area&quot; on the fringe of the Islamic world. But it will not eliminate the conditions that give rise to Islamist extremism, nor will it ensure lasting peace. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The Pentagon's new strategy can only lead, in the end, to a world of increased anti-Americanism and violence</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<strong>NO TURNS—STAYING IN AFGHANISTAN IS WORSE FOR CREDIBILITY AND MILITARY DOMINANCE MEANS THE PLAN WON’T HURT IT</strong> <br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Former national security adviser Henry Kissinger, Council on Foreign Relations scholar Stephen Biddle, and many others, concede that </span>the war in Central Asia will be long, expensive, and risky,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> yet they claim it is ultimately worth waging because a withdrawal would boost jihadism globally and make America look weak. 26 But </span>what we’ve invested in the Afghanistan mission could all fall apart whether we withdraw tomorrow or 20 years from now. In fact, if leaving would make America look weak, trying to stay indefinitely while accomplishing little would appear even worse. If the issue is preventing U.S. soldiers from having died in vain, pursuing a losing strategy would not vindicate their sacrifice<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And </span>trying to pacify all of Afghanistan, much less hoping to do so on a permanent basis, is a losing strategy. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Regardless, some people invoke memories of America’s ignominious withdrawals from Vietnam, Somalia, and Lebanon to muster support for an open-ended commitment. President Bush in 2007 claimed that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today’s terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility. “Here at home,” he said, “some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently.” 27 Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute agrees with that reasoning, writing that “the 1983 withdrawal from Lebanon and the retreat from Somalia a decade later emboldened Islamists who saw the United States as a paper tiger.” 28 When opinion leaders in Washington talk about “lessons learned” from Vietnam, Somalia, Lebanon, and other conflicts, they typically draw the wrong lesson: not that America should avoid intervening in someone else’s domestic dispute, but that America should never give up after having intervened, no matter what the cost. 29 But </span>the longer we stay and the more money we spend, the more we’ll feel compelled to remain in the country to validate the investment. A similar self-imposed predicament plagued U.S. officials during the war in Vietnam<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: After 1968 </span>it became increasingly clear that<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the survival of the [government of </span>South Vietnam] was not worth the cost of securing it, but by then the United States had another rationale for staying—prestige and precedent setting. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The United States said the [South Vietnamese government] would stand, </span>and even those in the administration now long convinced of the hollowness of the domino argument could agree that a U.S. failure in South Vietnam might endanger vital US national interests elsewhere or in the future.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 30 For decades, the </span>fear of America losing the world’s respect after withdrawing from a conflict has been instrumental in selling the American public bad foreign policy.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Perhaps most troubling about the reflexively “stay the course” mentality of some Americans is the widespread insensitivity about the thousands of people—civilian and military, domestic and foreign—killed, maimed, and traumatized in war. But when the stakes seem unrelated to vital national interests, the American public rightly resents their country’s interference in third party problems, and is extremely skeptical of nation building. History shows that, sooner or later, disenchantment will manifest in public and congressional opposition. After nearly a decade in Afghanistan, even the memory of 9/11 might not be sufficient to outweigh the sacrifice in blood and treasure. </span>Perhaps the most important argument against the “withdrawal is weak-kneed” meme is that America’s military roams the planet, controls the skies and space, faces no peer competitor, and wields one of the planet’s largest nuclear arsenals. America is responsible for almost half of the world’s military spending and can project its power around the globe. Thus, the contention that America would appear “weak” after withdrawing from Afghanistan is ludicrous.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Unfortunately, bureaucratic inertia and a misplaced conception of Washington’s moral obligations (an argument that more often than not legitimizes America’s military occupation of a foreign people) threaten to trap the United States in Afghanistan for decades. Overall, </span>remaining in Afghanistan is more likely to tarnish America’s reputation and undermine U.S. security than would withdrawal. <br />

<strong>Heg solves every impact – the only threat to global stability is if we allow it to collapse</strong> <br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Thayer, 6 - </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">professor of security studies at Missouri State (Bradley, The National Interest, “In Defense of Primacy”, November/December, p. 32-37) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">A grand strategy based on American primacy means ensuring the United States stays the world's number one power‑the diplomatic, economic and military leader. Those arguing against primacy claim that the United States should retrench, ei­ther because the United States lacks the power to maintain its primacy and should withdraw from its global commitments, or because the maintenance of primacy will lead the United States into the trap of &quot;imperial overstretch.&quot; In the previous issue of The National Interest, Christopher Layne warned of these dangers of pri­macy and called for retrenchment.1 Those arguing for a grand strategy of retrenchment are a diverse lot. They include isolationists, who want no foreign military commitments; selective engagers, who want U.S. military commitments to centers of economic might; and offshore balancers, who want a modified form of selective engagement that would have the United States abandon its landpower presence abroad in favor of relying on airpower and seapower to defend its in­terests. But</span><span style="color: black;"> retrenchment</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, in any of its guis­es, must be avoided. If the United States adopted such a strategy, it would be a profound strategic mistake that</span><span style="color: black;"> would lead to far greater instability and war in the world</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, imperil American security and deny the United States and its allies the benefits of primacy. There are two critical issues in any discussion of America's grand strategy: Can America remain the dominant state? Should it strive to do this? America can remain dominant due to its prodigious military, economic and soft power capa­bilities. The totality of that equation of power answers the first issue. The United States has overwhelming military capa­bilities and wealth in comparison to other states or likely potential alliances. Barring some disaster or tremendous folly, that will remain the case for the foreseeable future. With few exceptions, even those who advocate retrenchment acknowledge this. So the debate revolves around the desirability of maintaining American pri­macy. Proponents of retrenchment focus a great deal on the costs of U.S. action­ but they fall to realize what is good about American primacy. The price and risks of primacy are reported in newspapers every day; the benefits that stem from it are not. A GRAND strategy of ensur­ing American primacy takes as its starting point the protec­tion of the U.S. homeland and American global interests. These interests include ensuring that critical resources like oil flow around the world, that the global trade and monetary regimes flourish and that Washington's worldwide network of allies is reassured and protected. Allies are a great asset to the United States, in part because they shoulder some of its burdens. Thus, it is no surprise to see NATO in Afghanistan or the Australians in East Timor. In contrast, a strategy based on re­trenchment will not be able to achieve these fundamental objectives of the United States. Indeed, retrenchment will make the United States less secure than the present grand strategy of primacy. This is because </span><span style="color: black;">threats will exist no mat­ter what role America chooses to play in international politics. Washington can­not call a &quot;time out&quot;, and it cannot hide from threats</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Whether they are terror­ists, rogue states or rising powers, his­tory shows that threats must be confront­ed. Simply by declaring that the United States is &quot;going home&quot;, thus abandoning its commitments or making unconvinc­ing half‑pledges to defend its interests and allies, does not mean that others will respect American wishes to retreat. To make such a declaration implies weak­ness and emboldens aggression. In the anarchic world of the animal kingdom, </span><span style="color: black;">predators prefer to eat the weak rather than confront the strong</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. The same is true of the anarchic world of interna­tional politics. If there is no diplomatic solution to the threats that confront the United States, </span><span style="color: black;">then the conventional and strategic military power of the United States is what protects the country from such threats.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> And when enemies must be confront­ed, a strategy based on primacy focuses on engaging enemies overseas, away from .American soil. Indeed, a key tenet of the Bush Doctrine is to attack terrorists far from America's shores and not to wait while they use bases in other countries to plan and train for attacks against the United States itself. </span><span style="color: black;">This requires a phys­ical, on‑the‑ground presence that cannot be achieved by offshore balancing. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Indeed, as Barry Posen has noted, U.S. primacy is secured because America, at present, commands the &quot;global com­mon&quot;‑‑the oceans, the world's airspace and outer space‑allowing the United States to project its power far from its borders, while denying those common avenues to its enemies. As a consequence, the costs of power projection for the United States and its allies are reduced, and the robustness of the United States' conventional and strategic deterrent ca­pabilities is increased.' This is not an advantage that should be relinquished lightly. A remarkable fact about international politics today‑-in a world where Ameri­can primacy is clearly and unambiguous­ly on display--is that countries want to align themselves with the United States. Of course, this is not out of any sense of altruism, in most cases, but because doing so allows them to use the power of the United States for their own purposes, ­their own protection, or to gain greater influence. Of 192 countries, 84 are allied with America‑-their security is tied to the United States through treaties and other informal arrangements‑and they include almost all of the major economic and military powers. That is a ratio of almost 17 to one (85 to five), and a big change from the Cold War when the ratio was about 1.8 to one of states aligned with the United States versus the Soviet Union. Never before in its history has this coun­try, or any country, had so many allies. </span><span style="color: black;">U.S. primacy‑-and the bandwagon­ing effect‑has also given us extensive in­fluence </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">in international politics, allowing the United States to shape the behavior of states and international institutions. Such influence comes in many forms, one of which is America's ability to cre­ate coalitions of like‑minded states to free Kosovo, stabilize Afghanistan, invade Iraq or</span><span style="color: black;"> to stop proliferation</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> through the Pro­liferation Security Initiative (PSI). Doing so allows the United States to operate with allies outside of the where it can be stymied by opponents. American‑led wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq stand in contrast to the UN's inability to save the people of Darfur or even to conduct any military campaign to realize the goals of its charter. The quiet effec­tiveness of the PSI in dismantling Libya's WMD programs and unraveling the A. Q. Khan proliferation network are in sharp relief to the typically toothless attempts by the UN to halt proliferation. You can count with one hand coun­tries opposed to the United States. They are the &quot;Gang of Five&quot;: China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Venezeula. Of course, countries like India, for example, do not agree with all policy choices made by the United States, such as toward Iran, but New Delhi is friendly to Washington. Only the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; may be expected to consistently resist the agenda and ac­tions of the United States. China is clearly the most important of these states because it is a rising great power. But even Beijing is intimidated by the United States and refrains from openly challenging U.S. power. China proclaims that it will, if necessary, re­sort to other mechanisms of challenging the United States, including asymmetric strategies such as targeting communica­tion and intelligence satellites upon which the United States depends. But China may not be confident those strategies would work, and so it is likely to refrain from testing the United States directly for the foreseeable future because China's power benefits, as we shall see, from the international order U.S. primacy creates. The other states are far weaker than China. For three of the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; cases‑‑Venezuela, Iran, Cuba‑it is an anti‑U.S. regime that is the source of the problem; the country itself is not intrin­sically anti‑American. Indeed, a change of regime in Caracas, Tehran or Havana could very well reorient relations. THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power‑‑Rome, Britain or the United States today. Schol­ars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. </span><span style="color: black;">Everything we think of when we con­sider the current international order‑free trade, a robust monetary regime, increas­ing respect for human rights, growing de­mocratization‑‑is directly linked to U.S. power</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it. In that they are dead wrong and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons:</span><span style="color: black;"> Appalling things happen when international orders collapse</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="color: black;">The Dark Ages fol­lowed Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="color: black;">With­out U.S. power, the liberal order cre­ated by the U</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="color: black;">S</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="color: black;">will end just as assuredly.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">As country and western great Rai Donner sang: &quot;You don't know what you've got (until you lose it).&quot; Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washing­ton and the world. The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists, most notably France and West Germany. Today, </span><span style="color: black;">American primacy helps keep a number of complicated rela­tionships aligned‑-between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war. Wars still occur where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, but </span><span style="color: black;">a Pax Americana does reduce war's likelihood, particularly war's worst form: <strong>great power wars</strong>. Second, American power gives the U</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="color: black;">S</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="color: black;">the ability to spread de­mocracy</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and other elements of its ideol­ogy of liberalism. Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because, as John Owen noted on these pages in the Spring 2006 issue, liberal democracies are more likely to align with the United States and be sympathetic to the American worldview.3 So, spreading democracy helps maintain U.S. primacy. In addition, </span><span style="color: black;">once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> This is not because democracies do not have clashing inter­ests. Indeed they do. Rather, </span><span style="color: black;">it is because they are more open, more transparent and more likely to want to resolve things amicably </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">in concurrence with U.S. lead­ership. And so, in general, democratic states are good for their citizens as well as for advancing the interests of the United States. Critics have faulted the Bush Admin­istration for attempting to spread democ­racy in the Middle East, labeling such an effort a modern form of tilting at windmills. It is the obligation of Bush's crit­ics to explain why democracy is good enough for Western states but not for the rest, and, one gathers from the argument, should not even be attempted. Of course, whether democracy in the Middle East will have a peaceful or sta­bilizing influence on America's interests in the short run is open to question. Per­haps democratic Arab states would be more opposed to Israel, but nonetheless, their people would be better off. The United States has brought democracy to Afghanistan, where 8.5 million Af­ghans, 40 percent of them women, voted in a critical October 2004 election, even though remnant Taliban forces threat­ened them. The first free elections were held in Iraq in January 2005. It was the military power of the United States that put Iraq on the path to democracy. Wash­ington fostered democratic governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Caucasus. Now even the Middle East is increasingly democratic. They may not yet look like Western‑style democracies, but democratic progress has been made in Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, Ku­wait, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt. By all accounts, the march of democracy has been impressive. Third, along with the growth in the number of democratic states around the world has been the growth of the glob­al economy. </span><span style="color: black;">With its allies, the U</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="color: black;">S</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="color: black;">has labored to create an economically liberal worldwide network character­ized by free trade and commerce, respect for international property rights, and mo­bility of capital and labor markets</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. The economic stability and prosperity that stems from this economic order is a glob­al public good from which all states ben­efit, particularly the poorest states in the Third World. The United States created this network not out of altruism but for the benefit and the economic well‑being of America. </span><span style="color: black;">This economic order forces American industries to be competitive, maximizes efficiencies and growth, and benefits defense as well because the size of the economy makes the defense burden manageable</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Economic spin‑offs foster the development of military technology, helping to ensure military prowess. Perhaps the greatest testament to the benefits of the economic network comes from Deepak Lal, a former Indian foreign service diplomat and researcher at the World Bank, who started his ca­reer confident in the socialist ideology of post‑independence India. Abandoning the positions of his youth, Lal now recog­nizes that </span><span style="color: black;">the only way to bring relief to desperately poor countries of the Third World is through the adoption of free market economic policies and globaliza­tion, which are facilitated through Amer­ican primacy</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">.4 As a witness to the failed alternative economic systems, Lal is one of the strongest academic proponents of American primacy due to the economic prosperity it provides. </span><br />

<strong>HEG OUTWEIGHS—COLLAPSE IS THE ONLY SCENARIO FOR GREAT POWER WAR</strong> <br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">William </span><span class="Heading2Char">Wohlforth</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (professor of government at Dartmouth College) </span><span class="Heading2Char">2009</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “ Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War”Project Muse </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">evidence suggests that narrow and asymmetrical capabilities gaps foster status competition</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even among states relatively confident of their basic territorial security for the reasons identified in social identity theory and theories of status competition. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Broad patterns of evidence are consistent with this expectation, suggesting that unipolarity shapes strategies of identity maintenance in ways that dampen status conflict</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The implication is that </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">unipolarity helps explain low levels of military competition and conflict among major powers after 1991 and that a return to bipolarity or multipolarity would increase the likelihood of such conflict</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This has been a preliminary exercise. The evidence for the hypotheses explored here is hardly conclusive, but it is sufficiently suggestive to warrant further refinement and testing, all the more so given [End Page 56] the importance of the question at stake. If status matters in the way the theory discussed here suggests, then the widespread view that the rise of a peer competitor and the shift back to a bipolar or multipolar structure present readily surmountable policy challenges is suspect. Most scholars agree with Jacek Kugler and Douglas Lemke’s argument: “[S]hould a satisfied state undergo a power transition and catch up with dominant power, there is little or no expectation of war.” 81 </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Given that today’s rising powers have every material reason to like the status quo, many observers are optimistic that the rise of peer competitors can be readily managed by fashioning an order that accommodates their material interests. Yet it is far harder to manage competition for status than for most material things. While diplomatic efforts to manage status competition seem easy under unipolarity, theory and evidence suggest that it could present much greater challenges as the system moves back to bipolarity or multipolarity.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> When status is seen as a positional good, efforts to craft negotiated bargains about status contests face long odds. And this positionality problem is particularly acute concerning the very issue unipolarity solves: primacy. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The route back to bipolarity or multipolarity is</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> thus </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">fraught with danger</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. With two or more plausible claimants to primacy, positional competition and </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the potential for major power war could once again form the backdrop of world politics</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span class="date-display-single"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; color: #222222; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">December 15, 2010</span></span> <span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">— A new report on Afghanistan says that </span><span style="color: #222222;">the U.S</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">. public </span><span style="color: #222222;">should prepare to have roughly 30,000 troops there for years to come – conducting “a prolonged low level of unconventional war”</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> – in large part because the terrorist threat from the region is not going away, probably for decades. “It’s time to recognize that the war in Afghanistan will not end in July 2011, and that the United States and its allies need a new strategy,” says the report from the Center for a New American Security. CNAS is an influential think tank founded in 2007 by Michelle Flournoy and Kurt Campbell, who are now top government officials in the Obama administration at the Pentagon and the State Department, respectively. </span><span style="color: #222222;">Obama</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">, the report said, </span><span style="color: #222222;">has yet to articulate an “‘end game’</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> in Afghanistan – what the enduring U.S. presence and commitment would look like, or if there would be one at all.” The report was authored by retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2003, and Andrew Exum, a former Army Ranger and civilian adviser to Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who commanded the mission from June 2009 to June 2010. In fact, President </span><span style="color: #222222;">Obama has already in recent weeks moved the deadline for the removal of U.S. troops from July 2011 to</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> December </span><span style="color: #222222;">2014</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="color: #222222;">But</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> Barno and Exum argued that </span><span style="color: #222222;">the perception remains in the region that the U.S. is just biding its time until it abandons Afghanistan. The message received by Afghans</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> at all levels of society from Obama’s December 2009 speech at West Point – where he first announced both a 30,000 troop increase and the July 2011 withdrawal date – </span><span style="color: #222222;">was simple</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">, the report said: “</span><span style="color: #222222;">The Americans are leaving</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">.” “</span><span style="color: #222222;">The U.S. has to dispel that uncertainty. We have to a commit to a long term strategy</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> and a long term military deployment: </span><span style="color: #222222;">not a large one but a sustainable one </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">in Afghanistan,” Barno said. “</span><span style="color: #222222;">Today</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> if you’re a Pakistani national security adviser, or you’re an Afghan adviser to President Karzai, </span><span style="color: #222222;">you’re operating under the assumption that the U.S. is leaving,</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> and that’s it’s only a matter of time. We have to dispel that notion.” Their report is clear-eyed both about the rapidly declining level of support among Americans for the war, as well as the dwindling amount of treasure available to fund such expensive military operations, because of the nation’s deficit and debt troubles. “By 2018, the baseline U.S. defense budget of about $550 billion will be matched by annual interest payments on [the national] debt, which will only grow thereafter,” they note. But they argue that </span><span style="color: #222222;">the impact of a destabilizing exit</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> from Afghanistan </span><span style="color: #222222;">is</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> a </span><span style="color: #222222;">grave enough</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> threat </span><span style="color: #222222;">to</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> U.S. national security to </span><span style="color: #222222;">merit a continued investment</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">, albeit a smaller one. There would be a greater ability for terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda to plan attacks on the U.S., and an increasing risk of Pakistan’s nuclear weaponry falling into the hands of rogue actors if the government there falls. Barno and Exum’s report states that </span><span style="color: #222222;">they are offering “a responsible alternative to an exit strategy that ends the U.S. presence by precipitately turning the war over to the Afghans</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> and … once again abandoning Central Asia as the United States tried in the 1990’s, to devastating effect.” Obama met with his national security team regarding Afghanistan and Pakistan for two hours on Tuesday, in advance of a speech to the nation on the topic Thursday. White House officials say the U.S. has made clear that the U.S. is committed to Afghanistan, but not without limits. “We are committed to a long term partnership with both Afghanistan and Pakistan and have repeatedly express this publicly and privately. But, we are not providing an open ended commitment on troops,” a senior White House official told The Daily Caller. The official said that Afghan President Hamid Karzai has made clear “he would like to transition to full Afghan control by 2014,” and that the Obama administration and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has about 40,000 troops to the 100,000 American in Afghanistan, are on board with that timeline. “An integral part of our strategy all along has been the training of the [Afghan National Army] and [Afghan National Police] in order to enable them to take over providing security for their people. Our continued military presence will be determined by conditions on the ground and as the President said at the NATO summit in Lisbon, our aim is to end our combat mission in 2014,” the White House official said. “The rationale is that by making clear that we will not be there indefinitely, it puts more of a sense of urgency on the Afghans to assume responsibility. This approach worked quite well in Iraq.” </span><span style="color: #222222;">Barno and Exum share the goal of turning over most security throughout the country </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">– a task done now largely by regular U.S. military and NATO troops – to Afghans. </span><span style="color: #222222;">But they argued</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> Tuesday </span><span style="color: #222222;">that in order for this hand over to happen, the Afghan people and society need to have confidence that the U.S. will be a partner for many years to come. </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">Only a clear promise of </span><span style="color: #222222;">boots on the ground –</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> Barno and Exum argue for a force </span><span style="color: #222222;">primarily comprised of special operations forces</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> to conduct surgical strikes – that is “</span><span style="color: #222222;">for many years to come” will give this confidence. </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="color: #222222;">The psychological impact of this on</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> the government of </span><span style="color: #222222;">Pakistan</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">, the government of </span><span style="color: #222222;">Afghanistan</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">, and on </span><span style="color: #222222;">the Taliban</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> – when they look at what their future is going to look like – </span><span style="color: #222222;">could be quite substantial,”</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> Barno said at a forum hosted by the Newseum. Exum added: “What we need the Afghan people to do, we at least need them to send their sons into the Afghan national security forces. We’ve got to convince the Afghan people to make a choice … toward the government of Afghanistan.” “You do that with a long term commitment to Afghanistan.” </span><br />

Second, a U.S. drawdown would not make Al Qaeda substantially more lethal. In order for events in Afghanistan to enhance Al Qaeda’s ability to threaten the U.S. homeland, three separate steps must occur: 1) the Taliban must seize control of a substantial portion of the country, 2) Al Qaeda must relocate there in strength, and 3) it must build facilities in this new “safe haven” that will allow it to plan and train more effectively than it can today. Each of these three steps is unlikely, however, and the chances of all three together are very remote. For starters, a Taliban victory is unlikely even if the United States reduces its military commitment. The Taliban is a rural insurgency rooted primarily in Afghanistan’s Pashtun population, and its seizure of power in the 1990s was due to unusual circumstances that no longer exist and are unlikely to be repeated. Non-Pashtun Afghans now have ample experience with Taliban rule, and they are bound to resist any Taliban efforts to regain control in Kabul. Moreover, the U.S. military presence has helped the Taliban rally its forces, meaning that the group may well fragment and suffer a loss of momentum in the face of a U.S. drawdown. Surveys suggest that popular support for the Taliban among Afghans is in the single digits. Even with significantly reduced troop levels, we can build a credible defense against a Taliban takeover through support for local security forces, strategic use of airpower, and deployment in key cities without committing ourselves to a costly and counterproductive COIN (counterinsurgency) campaign in the south. And if power-sharing and political inclusion is negotiated, the relevance of the Taliban as an alternative to Kabul is likely to decline. And even if the Taliban were to regain power in some of Afghanistan, it would likely not invite Al Qaeda to re-establish a significant presence there. The Taliban may be reluctant to risk renewed U.S. attacks by welcoming Al Qaeda onto Afghan soil. Bin Laden and his associates may well prefer to remain in Pakistan, which is both safer and a better base from which to operate than isolated and land-locked Afghanistan. Most importantly, no matter what happens in Afghanistan in the future, Al Qaeda will not be able to build large training camps of the sort it employed prior to the 9/11 attacks. Simply put, the U.S. would remain vigilant and could use air power to eliminate any Al Qaeda facility that the group might attempt to establish. Bin Laden and his associates will likely have to remain in hiding for the rest of their lives, which means Al Qaeda will have to rely on clandestine cells instead of large encampments. Covert cells can be located virtually anywhere, which is why the outcome in Afghanistan is not critical to addressing the threat from Al Qaeda. In short, a complete (and unlikely) victory in Afghanistan and the dismantling of the Taliban would not make Al Qaeda disappear; indeed, it would probably have no appreciable effect on Al Qaeda. At the same time, dramatically scaling back U.S. military engagement will not significantly increase the threat from Al Qaeda. Third, the current U.S. military effort is helping fuel the very insurgency we are attempting to defeat. An expanded U.S. presence has reinforced perceptions of the United States as a foreign occupier. Religious extremists have used the U.S. presence as an effective recruiting tool for their cause. Efforts to limit civilian casualties and other forms of collateral damage have been only partially successful, leading additional Afghans to take up arms against us. Fourth, the expanded U.S. presence and a more energetic counterinsurgency effort in Afghanistan and Pakistan have reinforced a tacit alliance among different extremist groups whose agendas are not identical. The Taliban is itself a loose coalition of Pashtuns, many of whom are motivated by local concerns rather than by any deep commitment to global jihad. Al Qaeda, by contrast, is a global network of radical Islamists seeking to topple governments throughout the Middle East. The “Pakistani Taliban” are a separate alliance of different Islamist groups challenging the authority of the Pakistani state. The Haqqani network in Waziristan is led by a local warlord who is strongly opposed to foreign interference but reportedly also a sometime ally of Pakistan’s Inter-Service Intelligence agency (ISI). Although cooperation among these disparate groups has increased in recent years, this development is largely a reaction to the increased foreign presence in the region and our efforts to convince the Pakistani government to take more aggressive action against these groups. Thus, our current strategy is helping drive these groups together, when our real aim should be to drive wedges between as many of them as possible and to win over those who do not share Al Qaeda’s anti-Western agenda or its commitment to global jihad. Fifth, keeping 100,000-plus U.S. troops in yet another Muslim country lends credence to jihadi propaganda about America’s alleged hostility to Islam. Their presence may actually be increasing the overall danger that we face back home. Anger at U.S. military action in the Af/Pak theater inspired Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen, to attempt an unsuccessful car bomb attack in Times Square, and other home-grown terrorists appear to have been inspired by similar motivations. <br />
