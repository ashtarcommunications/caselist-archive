<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Given the huge potential for space exploration to alleviate some of the world’s most important issues, David and I strongly affirm the resolution. Specifically, we believe that one of the gravest threats facing us today is the impact human beings have had on the environment, thus we present the following plan: The United States federal government should develop and launch the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory. The program we are proposing, known as CLARREO for short, is a satellite which will be instrumental in Earth observation data and is able to synthesize systems we already have to make them more effective. </span>


<span style="text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Observation 1 is Inherency:</span></span>


<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Funding for NASA’s Earth science program has been steadily increasing but unfortunately, CLARREO, a key satellite, was not fully funded </span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">First, in a 2011 article written in the Scientific Journal Nature, it was noted that current climate change satellite systems are insufficient and outdated, absent next-generation satellites gaps in current data will continue to worsen preventing effective implementation of policies to fix warming </span>

==<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">1AC-Lexington-WELCOME TO THE COSMOS</span>== 
**Over 2,000 years ago, a collective group of human beings created the Ancient Library of Alexandria. The city itself was a sprawling metropolis with diverse citizens and a hunger for knowledge. Alexandria sat as the hub for human collaboration and understanding. “On any given day, its harbors were thronged with merchants, scholars and tourists.” The library held the greatest accumulation of knowledge in early human history. To our horror, the great library of Alexandria burned at the hands of fanatics and power hungry leaders before the year 270 AD, followed by centuries known as “the dark ages.”**
Carl Sagan, Astronomer, Philosopher, Scientist. COSMOS (1980). Pg. 190

__<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,serif;">Here clearly were the seeds of the modern world....</span>__<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,serif;"> __there was nobody to stop them.__</span>

**As debaters, we learn that the destruction of Alexandria represented an aversion to education and a denial of knowledge. Our participation in debate feeds our skepticism, and teaches us to think critically about the world around us. Debate is a microcosm of the Library, a place for the celebration of knowledge. In other words, debate is the manifestation of the scientific PROCESS of evaluating claims. Debate invites us to think about different topics and ideas, to modify our understanding and to be attuned to cosmic relationship**

**In that sense, we are inspired by this year’s resolution. Space exploration is an opportunity to meditate on the nature and meaning of the cosmos. It is a method for developing new ideologies and ethical positions. We are deeply troubled that the majority of debaters use this resolution to discuss hegemony and power relations in a modernist framework, precisely because this topic opens doorways to profoundly existential questions about the cosmos. Carl Sagan is one famous thinker that elucidated these questions and drew connections between our cosmological perspective and our ethical positions. Carl explains how a cosmological perspective can lead to the development of an ethic of**

**Sagan’s insight is as important as it is unique. Like Sagan, we believe that exploring space and learning about the cosmos is a humbling experience that challenges the worst impulses of humanism. Indeed, in the absence of cosmological wonder, humans are left to their own vanity. This vanity mutates into competition, which occasionally becomes violence. On the other hand, Sagan’s cosmic perspective exposes the danger of our current course and redirects our power of imaginatio**

__<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,serif;">We have held the peculiar notion that a person...</span>__<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,serif;"> __is clearly the universe or noth__</span>

**There is no doubt that the stakes are high. We are an endangered species with our hands on nuclear technology. Our future survival and happiness depends on how we interpret the meaning of our technology and the purposes of our efforts. Science is neither a mirage nor a panacea, but a process for exploring the limits of our understanding.**

**<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,serif;">We are inspired and motivated by Carl Sagan to use our performance of the 1AC to promote a form of education that redirects our collective efforts towards cosmological investigations. In this sense, we agree that the United States Federal Government should substantially increase its exploration and development of space beyond the mesos</span>**

**<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,serif;">The first step to exploring space beyond the mesosphere is to turn an eye towards the night sky, conscious of our fleeting time here. The goal of our Affirmative is to inspire another human being to look up at the sky, to ask deeply existential questions, and to find their place among the stars. A cascade of public interest in astrophysics and cosmology will usher in a new epoch of communication and travel throughout an infinite number of galaxies. We believe this is the ONLY plausible scenario for successful human exploration and development of outer space.</span>**

<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">Specifically, the United States Federal Government should pass a resolution to use the Spaceship of the Imagination to send us into the super massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.</span>
**First – The Politics of the Singularity**

**The Universe is so large that traveling between stars and planets faces seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The only feasible way to actualize space exploration is to use the forces of the universe to our advantage. Black holes may provide the right conditions of gravity and pressure to propel us through space/time.**

**Black holes may be the key to accessing the fourth dimension, or wormholes to new universes, or even time machines. Our Aff meditates on the idea of black holes as gateways to new realities. This is a good metaphor for the topic, which is a gateway to transcend our repetitive hegemony and economy debates year in and out. Meditation about black holes hoists us to a vantage point that can begin to understand the Universe as a fractal.**
Carl Sagan, Astronomer, Philosopher, Scientist. COSMOS (1980). Pg 153-154

Poised at the edge of forever, we would jump off.</span>__**

**Second – Spaceship of the Imagination**

**This moment right now is a critical juncture in space time. Even the smallest actions have enormous consequences when time is stretched out far enough, and the universe boasts an infinite timescale. Our Affirmative is an act of imagination that has the power to literally transform history. In only takes an ideological microorganism to reorient the lever of time.**

It is hardly anything at all.</span>__

**Now is the time to celebrate and protect life in all its forms. We hope that sharing our own inspirations can influence the other people in this debate space to contemplate the beauty and interconnectedness of the Cosmos. We have one real advantage, which is that thinking about the Cosmos promotes our compassion for others and inspires us to commit ourselves to survival.**
