==Port Dredging== 

===Economy Advantage=== 

**Contention 1 is Economic Leadership**

<span style="vertical-align: baseline;">**Investment in ports is crucial to the competitiveness and employment of the US**</span>

Aging infrastructure for marine ports, … importance of our nation’s ports."


**We will Isolate Four Internal Links to Competitiveness:**

**First – Seaport Competitiveness – ports are the vital internal link to US economic growth – seaports represent a quarter of US GDP and contribute over 3 trillion to the economy in exports and trade**
**Nagle, 11**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> —- president and chief executive officer of the American Association of Port Authorities (December 2011, Kurt, Industry Today, "Association: American Association of Port Authorities; Port-Related Infrastructure Investments Can Reap Dividends," vol. 14, no. 3, [[http://www.industrytoday.com/article_view.asp?ArticleID=F370-http://www.industrytoday.com/article_view.asp?ArticleID=F370]])</span>

It seems the United States ….. to maintain federal navigation channels.

**Increasing exports decrease the trade deficit and makes growth sustainable – prevents investment bubbles and collapses**

Other Tangible Benefits Indirect benefits ….. to a handful of coastal states. 

**Second - Certainty - the federal government~’s uncertain commitment prevents new projects - Federal funding is increasing but not for new harbor deepening** 

**Szakonyi 12****<span style="font-size: 7pt;">—</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> associate editor of the Journal of Commerce (Mark, "The Hill Ramping Up Dredging Efforts", Journal of Commerce, 5/7, ProQuest) EL</span>

The push by U.S. ports for …., more meaningful long-term decisions.

**Federal regulations prevent other actors from solving – only federal action to streamline the process and increase funding solves**

Just like the nation itself, our maritime industry is facing a multitude of challenges ….not a cost, in the future of our inland waterways transportation system.

**Weakley 8**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> – Realize America~’s Maritime promise, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Fairness Coalition, testimony of James Weakley the president of the Lake Carriers~’ Association (James, "Realize America~’s Maritime Promise", Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Fairness Coalition, 4/30/08, [[http://www.ramphmtf.org/speeches_043008.html-http://www.ramphmtf.org/speeches_043008.html]])//MM</span>

Port-related jobs are critical to augment our economy. Direct and indirect jobs……
would be used for their intended purpose and not merely for deficit reduction.

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">~~[Michael, The Case for Goliath: How America Acts As the World~’s Government in the Twenty-First Century, p. 224~~]</span>

At best, an American withdrawal ….large numbers, of nuclear weapons.

===Agriculture Advantage=== 

**Contention 2 is Agriculture**

**U.S. agriculture exports are facing a crisis of competitiveness** 
**AgriMoney, 2/20** - investors~’ link to the food chain. The increasing numbers of mouths to feed, the demand for ever-more sophisticated diets, and the potential for turning food into fuel has turned the growing business into big business.
