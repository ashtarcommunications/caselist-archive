<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">Structural reforms of entitlements can also contribute to the recovery, if they succeed in making the system more sustainable without creating a fear of the future among the broad middle class. For example, raising the age of access to Medicare, by itself, may not pass that test. It would save money and appear to reduce future debt, but that could be offset, at least in part, by increased anxiety among those with insufficient medical coverage, leading them to cut back spending at once and so reducing growth. A more targeted reform of Medicare, with greater cost sharing by those most able to afford it, would have the same effect in reducing debt with less deflationary anxiety. </span>

<span class="TitleChar">FOR decades, we have neglected … our heads and history books</span><span style="font-size: 9.33px;">. </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">But how we will pay for it? Given the fights over the deficit and the debt, it is doubtful that a second, costly stimulus package could gain traction. President Franklin D. Roosevelt faced a similar predicament in the 1930s when the possibility of a double-dip Depression loomed.</span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">For this reason, the New Deal’s second wave aggressively pursued public-private partnerships and quasi-public authorities. Roosevelt described the best-known of these enterprises, the Tennessee Valley Authority, as a “corporation clothed with the power of government but possessed of the flexibility and initiative of a private enterprise.” </span>

**Only federal action solves – States are not able to leverage Funds—multiple warrants**

<span class="TitleChar">The merits of establishing a National … </span><span style="font-size: 9.33px;">of the American Jobs Act 1 . </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">A review of the Jobs Act offers a vivid illustration of how far the debate has moved under the Obama Administration. Earlier White House budgets had proposed allocating USD 4 billion as seed funding to a National Infrastructure Innovation and Finance Fund tasked with supporting individual projects as well as “broader activities of significance”. Offering grants, loans and long term loan guarantees to eligible projects, the resulting entity would not have constituted an infrastructure bank in the generally accepted sense of the term. Nor would the Fund have been an autonomous entity, making mere “investment recommendations” to the Secretary of Transportation2 . </span>
<span class="TitleChar">Despite a number of important alterations, … investment</span><span style="font-size: 9.33px;">. The Authority thus established: </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;"> is set up as a distinct, self-supporting entity headed by a Board of Directors requiring Senate confirmation </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;"> offers loans & credit guarantees to large scale projects with anticipated costs in excess of USD 100,000,000 </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;"> extends eligible recipients to corporations, partnerships, trusts, States and other governmental entities </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;"> subjects loans to credit risk assessments and investment-grade rating (BBB-/ Baa3 or higher) </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;"> conditions loans to a full evaluation of project economic, financial, technical and environmental benefits </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;"> caps Federal loans at 50% of anticipated project costs </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;"> requires dedicated revenue sources from recipient projects, such as tolls or user fees </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;"> sets and collects loan fees to cover its administrative and operational costs (with leftover receipts transferred </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">to the Treasury)</span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">Particularly striking are the layers of risk assessment contained in the BUILD Act. These translate into a dedicated risk governance structure with the appointment of a Chief Risk Officer and annual external risk audits of AIFA’s project portfolio. At project level, applicants are required to provide a preliminary rating opinion letter and, if the loan or loan guarantee is approved, the Authority’s associated fees are modulated to reflect project risk. Lastly, as a Government-owned corporation, AIFA is explicitly held on the Federal balance sheet and is not able to borrow debt in the capital markets in its own name (although it may reoffer part of its loan book into the capital markets, if deemed in the taxpayers’ interest).</span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">Rationale </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">As a percentage of GDP, the United States currently invests 25% less on transportation infrastructure than comparable OECD economies 4 . There is broad agreement that absent a massive and sustained infusion of capital in infrastructure, the backlog of investment in new and existing transportation assets will hurt productivity gains and ripple economy-wide5 </span>
<span class="TitleChar">The establishment of AIFA is predicated on a number of market considerations</span>
<span class="TitleChar">Dwindling demand for municipal bonds, … </span><span style="font-size: 9.33px;">a State”, such as the SIBs. </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">SIBs were formally authorized nationwide in 2005 through a provision of the SAFETEA-LU Act 13 to offer preferential credit assistance to eligible and economically viable surface transportation capital projects. A provision of the Act also authorizes multistate Banks, although such cooperative arrangements have yet to be established. </span>
<span class="TitleChar">SIBs operate primarily as revolving … </span><span style="font-size: 9.33px;">value of over USD 6.5 billion12. </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">While SAFETEA-LU provided a basic framework for establishing SIBs, each State has tailored the size, structure and focus of its Bank to meet specific policy objectives. The following table14 illustrates the scales of SIBS at the opposite end of the spectrum. </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">These State-driven arrangements warrant a number of observations: </span>
<span style="font-size: 9.33px;">The more active SIB States are those that have increased the initial capitalization of their banks through a combination of bonds and sustained State funding. South Carolina’s Transportation Infrastructure Bank receives annual amounts provided by State law that include truck registration fees, vehicle registration fees, one-cent of gas tax equivalent, and a portion of the electric power tax. Significantly, all SIBs have benefited from the ability to recycle loan repayments – including interest and fees – into new infrastructure projects, a facility currently not available to the American Infrastructure Financing Authority under the terms of the BUILD Act. </span>
More than 87 percent<span class="TitleChar"> of all … applications citing “state budget issues</span><span style="font-size: 9.33px;">”. </span>
