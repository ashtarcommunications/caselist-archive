<span style="font-size: 90%;"> Because of their ability to move large amounts of cargo, the nation’s inland waterways are a strategic economic and military resource… With an average rehabilitation cost of $50 million per lock, the current level allows the Corps to fully fund only two or three lock projects each year. </span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Faced with flat funding, the Corps has adopted a "fix when fail" approach to maintaining locks and dams… Because the water level rises and falls at different points along rivers, locks are used to raise and lower barges depending on the depth of the river where they are coming from and the depth of the river where they are headed.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 90%;">Congress must act to increase funding—only increasing funding for modernization of inland waterways addresses problems of SQ infrastructure to improve economy and jobs.

**<span style="font-size: 90%;">Specifically, we isolate two internal links to the economy that investment in the inland waterways solves</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 90%;">First manufacturing exports—</span>**

<span style="font-size: 90%;"> Perspectives on America’s Economic Future Like those who participated in the previous Ignite reports, the state of the U.S. economy and the potential fallout of other global economic crises were also of significant concern for the labor leaders participating in this report… Doing so, according to the labor leaders, would eliminate many uncertainties about the future of manufacturing in America, and result in inspirational goals and objectives that incentivize manufacturers to increase investments in R&D and create jobs in the United States. </span>

**<span style="font-size: 90%;">Second internal link—jobs</span>**

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Inland waterways are part of the nation’s infrastructure for moving goods, and they require federal assistance for maintainance and improvements… Assuming that the impacts of the total proposed investment occur over three years, the average annual increase would be about 22,300 jobs.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Since China has basically attained food security at the national level, its participation in the world grain markets over the years has also been minimal, except for two particular years, 1994 and 2003…Therefore, the current level of soybean imports has not endangered China's food security — quite the reverse, it has served to buttress China's food security.</span>
