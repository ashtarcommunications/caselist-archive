**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thus the plan – </span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">The United States federal government should substantially increase its deployment of nanosatellite constellations beyond the Earth’s mesosphere through the electromagnetic rail gun. </span>**

1ac- Solvency [Railgun Addendum]
**Railgun is key to reconstitution and low cost nanosatellite launches**
**AWST, ‘06** <span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Aviation Week & Space Technology, July 31st, ‘Scientists Hope Rail Gun Could Launch Satellites’, 533/JK)</span>

__An electromagnetic rail gun could be the easiest and least costly way of launching small__ communications __satellites by theoretically eliminating the need for the huge quantities of fuel, multistage rockets and redundant systems necessary to lift a payload into space. The rail gun may prove so effective that networks of satellites could be launched at low cost--and if one fails, another would quickly be sent up in its place__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. This is the vision of Harry D. Fair, director of the Institute for Advanced Technology at the University of Texas, and an expert on hypervelocity systems and rail guns. Fair believes that "</span>__nano satellites__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">" --which would use nanotechnology in electronics and other components and </span>__would be a fraction the size of conventional satellites--are ideal candidates for a rail gun launch__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. "</span>__That's a concept we're trying to develop__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">," he says. "</span>__It's not a funded program, but it's something that's certainly doable__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">." </span>__In a conventional satellite launch, less than 1% of the mass of a rocket going into orbit is payload. As a result, a launch is virtually a one-shot deal, and the costs and amount of engineering necessary to reduce the chance of failure are exorbitant__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Fair estimates </span>__it costs at least $10,000/kg. to put a satellite in orbit with the space shuttle__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>__If the size of satellites could be reduced through the use of nanotechnology, and rail guns built that would lift them into orbit, the cost, complexity and complications of rocket launches would be eliminated__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Fair says </span>__it would require__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> long rails and </span>__an "embarrassingly little" amount of stored energy__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">--maybe 600-800 megajoules--</span>__to launch a satellite with a rail gun__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The length of the rails would be computed with fundamental equations based on the force necessary to launch a satellite and the total energy required. </span>__A viable rail-launch system could be built on land and even placed on aircraft for use in the upper atmosphere.__
Specifically it solves constellations
Goebel 98
[Greg Goebel, Federation of American Scientists, May 1998, [[http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/1998/05/980500-bull.htm]]]
__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The energy requirements for launching large payloads</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with a space gun are still extreme, however, and so the approach </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">appears best suited to launch</span>____<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> of large numbers of small "hardened" payloads. Constellations of "nanosatellites" for communications or similar applications could be placed in orbit at relatively low cost, using the space gun as a "first stage" for launch of a rocket-boosted projectile.</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Such a projectile would weigh about a tonne and carry about a 60 kilogram payload; </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">the space gun would have to accelerate it </span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">to a muzzle velocity of 9,000 to 14,400 KPH</span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">. None of the space gun technologies investigated to date have been scaled up to this size,</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and doing so would require a major capital investment that would demand high launch rates for a long period of time to break even. However, </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">building such a gun does not require the development of any major new technologies</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and remains an interesting possibility for the future. </span>

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Rail guns have also been proposed as important components of the Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as Star Wars. Star Wars is a U.S. government program responsible for the research and development of a space-based system to defend the nation from attack by strategic ballistic missiles. Rail guns could fire projectiles to intercept the incoming missiles.Some scientists argue that</span>__rail guns could also protect Earth from rogue asteroids, by firing high-velocity projectiles from orbit. Upon impact, the projectiles would either destroy the__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">incoming</span> __asteroid__ <span style="font-size: 6pt;">or change its trajectory.</span>
