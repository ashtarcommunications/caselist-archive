Using official figures, </span>the CFR shows that less than half of that crucial increase in consumption resulted from rising incomes, with the rest coming from what they call "unsustainable items". More than a third <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">– 36% – </span>came from reduced savings, as Americans dipped into their rainy-day funds <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">to cope with unemployment and lacklustre wage growth. </span>And another 20% came from the payroll tax<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span>That shows that <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the emergency tax-cut package</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, which included a 2% cut in the payroll tax (similar to national insurance contributions in Britain) </span><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">was</span> doing its job<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span>**<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">helping to prevent the economy sliding into a renewed recession in 2011</span>**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. But when they were introduced a year ago, the cuts were meant to be a short-term boost to consumption, helping to prop up the economy until the good times returned. Recent data from the US has been relatively upbeat, including news that American firms created 120,000 jobs in November. But </span><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">unemployment remains well above normal</span>, <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">at 8.6%; </span><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the housing market is</span> still <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">in the doldrums</span>; <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">and with America's trading partners</span> in Asia and Europe <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">heading for hard times in 2012, the economic climate is about to get tougher.
