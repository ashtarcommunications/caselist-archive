<strong>Vinay Pai</strong> : David Herman is, without a doubt, the most noble and most generous wiki user in the debate community. The speed and effectiveness with which he responded to my cite request was stunning; I very nearly creamed mine pantaloons. Zach Rosenthal, cuteness aside, cannot dream to match up to Mr. Herman's wiki prowess, or the sheer artistry with which he fulfills cite requests. If you would like to validate the accuracy of this testimonial, or you're just looking for a good time, please call Mr. Jordan Trafton at 925-588-1323.<br />

<strong>Evan McCarty (badass):</strong> Whenever I'm sitting at home alone and have nothing to do, I go to GDS HS's wiki. It just makes me feel so good about humanity, seeing how devoted to disclosure they are. Their wiki also has the suffix &quot;-gasm&quot; appear on it, which is the suffix of another word that I very much enjoy<br />

<strong>Matt Harkins aka SpankDaddy</strong> : lol<br />
i've had a change of heart on the wiki war<br />
few reasons<br />
1. length matters- although zach may have a bigger card amount, yours is longer, which, although I'm no expert, is generally accepted as preferrable<br />
2. your wiki has zero mentions of zizek, whereas z-ro has 12<br />
3. if you scroll down your page really fast, foucault's face appears out of the letters<br />
4. There's a suprise party going on in your wiki, and spank daddy loves can't resist a party<br />
even if zach had a party on his wiki, the feminist authors would probably crash it and kill my game<br />
<br />

When World War II ended, the U.S. occupied Japan… for everyone except the people who live there.<br />
<br />
<strong>The United States occupied Japan in the wake of one of the most racially charged war efforts of the 20th century. US soldiers that had been conditioned to equate every Japanese person with an image of a buck-toothed savage now occupied the streets in order to liberate the Japanese from themselves. Basing in Okinawa is steeped in racism, relegating the under-civilzied Okinawans to a position of inferiority.</strong><br />

The situation for Okinawans was different from… repatriate like the peoples of Japan’s former colonies.<br />

<strong>Scenario 1 is racism –</strong><br />

<strong>And racism enables the political bodies of the US and Japan to systematically ignore Okinawa for the sake of the greater good</strong><br />

For all the recent decline in overt racism, for all… good people of, say, Long Island or Dade Country.<br />
<br />
<strong>The globalization of racial hierarchies relegate difference to the realm of invisibility culminating in exclusion and extermination.</strong><br />
<strong>Rodriguez, 7</strong> - University of California, Riverside (Dylan, “american globality and the u. s. prison regime: state violence and white supremacy from abu ghraib to stockton to bagong diwa” Kritika Kultura, Issue 9, November 2007)<br />
<br />
Variable, overlapping, and mutually constituting white… and mobilization across global geographies.<br />
<br />
<strong>And racism makes war and violence inevitable – it presents our enemies as biologically inferior to justify their extermination</strong><br />
<strong>Mendieta 2</strong> - (4/25/02, Eduardo Mendieta, PhD and Associate professor of Stonybrook School of Philosophy, “ ‘To make live and to let die’ –Foucault on Racism Meeting of the Foucault Circle, APA Central Division Meeting”)<br />
<br />
This is where racism intervenes, not from without… then these threat and foes are biological in nature.<br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, inaction is complicity - you have a unique obligation to reject racism</strong><br />
<strong>Memmi, 2k</strong> - Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ University of Paris (Albert-; RACISM, translated by Steve Martinot, pp.163-165)<br />
<br />
The struggle against racism will be long, difficult… is a wager, but the stakes are irresistible.<br />
<br />
<strong>Scenario 2 is ethics–</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>And the racial origins of this relationship have justified oppression on both sides of the Pacific. Japan views Okinawas as inferior and the US treats them as expendable creating Okinawa as the absolute other.</strong><br />

The situation for Okinawans was different from that… like the peoples of Japan’s former colonies.<br />
<br />

The forgiveable transgression, apart from its magical significance… it is beyond forigveness,but because it does not belong to the order of forgiveness.<br />

<strong>Two-level utilitarianism solves all your offense</strong><br />

<br />
There is, however, a problem with this version of utilitarianism… such principles clash that we should try to think like an archangel.<br />

A consequentialist is one who evaluates morally-significant… death if he so wishes and, if he has, what grounds it?<br />
<br />
<strong>And our moral system is an internal link turn to consequentialism—only by following deontological moral rules can we maximize the good</strong><br />

<strong>Contention 1 is the dawn of an era:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The disaster at Fukushima has afforded a unique opportunity to reckon with the danger of nuclear entanglements in Japan – the nuclear umbrella represents the logic that allowed the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</strong><br />

This disaster unites, in a dramatic way, two phenomena… deterrence that is advocated by nuclear powers.<br />

The price of denial. While Americans were preparing… antinuclearism following the horrors of World War II.<br />

<strong>The nuclear umbrella casts the sigificance of the bomb in strategic rather than commemorative terms – the grand narative of American power has created a hegemonic monopoly on our historical memory.</strong><br />

All three examples – the controversy over the cenotaph epigraph… pan-Asian regime of truth to the U.S. cold war commonwealth.<br />

<strong>First, current US nuclear policy is counterproductive, inherently violent, and makes proliferation and nuclear use inevitable – we are obligated to end the immoral practice of nuclear deterrence.</strong><br />
<strong>Kazuo, 9</strong> – Japanese Communist Party Chair speech to the International Meeting of the 2009 World Conference (8/3, Shii, “Japan must break away from U.S. nuclear umbrella and become nuclear-free,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4668:http://www.jcp.or.jp/english/jps_weekly09/20090804_01.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jcp.or.jp/english/jps_weekly09/20090804_01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcp.or.jp/english/jps_weekly09/20090804_01.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4668 -->)<br />
<br />
A new situation is emerging in the world towards… for a “nuclear-free Japan” in name and reality.<br />
<br />
<strong>Specifically, the detachment from a commemorative relationship with Hiroshima locks us into a mindset of violence and makes endless nuclear war inevitable.</strong><br />
<strong>Lifton and Mitchell, 96</strong> (Psychologist at Harvard Medical School AND Editor of E and P and author of 9 books, Hiroshima in America, 302)<br />
<br />
Since Hiroshima, we have been captives of nuclear… world of total insecurity, as Lewis Mumford observed.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second, our obsession with the bomb is rooted in a faux rationality that justifies violence through the logic of preventing apocalypse. Our interrogation of hiroshima can deconstruct the irresistability of nuclear desire.</strong><br />
<strong>Davis, 1</strong> – Professor Emeritus, Ohio State University, Ph.D: U of C, English language and literature (Walter A., “Deracination: historicity, Hiroshima, and the tragic imperative,” gbooks)<br />
<br />
That is why the Bomb provides an “object” irresistible… give history a “goal” and to exorcize or limit contingency.<br />
<br />
<strong>The impact is endless violence, misery, and destruction of all value to life.</strong><br />

Nuclearism does not remain confined to the nuclear… already dead morally, socially and psychologically.<br />
<br />
<strong>Thus Isaac and I advocate the following plan:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The United States federal government should withdraw its nuclear umbrella from Japan.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 2 is the end of an era:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The plan functions as a sustained criticism of current US nuclear policy. An interrogation of the events preceding and following from the use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki can provide the critical force necessary to reorient our understanding of nuclear weapons</strong><br />
<strong>Davis, 1</strong> – Professor Emeritus, Ohio State University, Ph.D: U of C, English language and literature (Walter A., “Deracination: historicity, Hiroshima, and the tragic imperative,” gbooks)<br />
<br />
For several reasons, Hiroshima presents an ideal forum… modernism, Hiroshima the inaugural postmodern act.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our interrogation of the violent nature of memory surrounding Hiroshima is the duty of engaged intellectuals. There is no middle ground – either you are raising hell or you are complicit in the extinction of humanity.</strong><br />
<strong>Hayer, 94</strong> – (“A World of Corpses,” Positions)<br />
<br />
What I have tried to say in this essay and… therefore be realistic and demand the impossible.<br />
<br />
<strong>And this is specifically true in the context of nuclear history.</strong><br />

The image thereby reveals what perception cannot… joy, dread—in the human face and the human deed.<br />

<br />
The US uses END as its justification for maintaining… biggest threats to nuclear disarmament worldwide.<br />
<br />
<strong>Costs are too high and there is no real incentive for America to interevene – the umbrella alone isn’t enough of a a guarantee to dissuade conflict.</strong><br />

<br />
But these are not the tough cases. The real question… yet accept this. The sooner they do the better for everyone.<br />
<br />
<strong>Refusing to continue our policy of extended nuclear deterrence in East Asia will have a stabilizing effect on the region – removes the incentive for conflict.</strong><br />
<strong>Hayes, 10</strong> - (12/6/10, Peter Hayes, Professor of International Relations, RMIT University, Melbourne and Executive Director, Nautilus Institute of America, “The US needs a new North Korea policy: a nuclear weapons free zone,”)<br />

<br />
<strong>And the plan can create a new security architecture not based on the destructive influence of nuclear deterrence.</strong><br />

<br />
Moreover, as has been pointed out many times… otherwise antagonistic states, and the need for shared solutions.22<br />

<strong>And North Korean proliferation makes the collapse of our nuclear deterrent inevitable.</strong><br />

Henceforth, the credibility of US END with allies… far the state held most accountable for these dismal outcomes.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 4 is no disads:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1) The logic of nuclear apocalypse is rooted in a perverse desire to sanitize the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Because the events were so small compared to the potential for extinction, we can divorce our actions from their historical significance.</strong><br />
<strong>Foard, 97</strong> (JH, JAAR, Prof of Religion at ASU, &quot;Imagining Nuclear Weapons,&quot; JSTOR)<br />
<br />
This ambivalence about Hiroshima has been partially… as a cultural construct rather than a self evident fact.<br />
<br />
<strong>2) The recourse to calculability in the face of nuclear destruction disguises the awesomely destructive power of the bomb and desensitizes us to its use – it is a supremely dangerous illusion.</strong><br />

While renewed warfare within Iraq’s borders is bad… manage international peace and security at a critical time in its evolution.<br />
<br />
<strong>That’s an existential threat.</strong><br />

The Middle East conflict is unparalleled in terms of… President Obama’s position does not completely rule out such a possibility.<br />
<br />
<strong>Thus the Plan:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The United States federal government should withdraw its private military contractors from Iraq and Afghanistan. We’ll clarify…</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 2 is the Sovereign:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The privatization of violence represents the undoing of the Westphalian state order – the globalization of legitimate violence is creating the “new war” in which all restrictions are moot.</strong><br />
<strong>Wulf 05</strong> – (2005, Herbert, PhD, former Director of the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC) where he is now associated as a Senior Fellow, “The bumpy road to re-establish a monopoly of violence,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4683:http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/HumanSecurityReport/Wulfdraft.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/HumanSecurityReport/Wulfdraft.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/HumanSecurityReport/Wulfdraft.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4683 --> DH)<br />
<br />
The second reason for the new wars is political… often a fight about political control and the power in states.<br />
<br />
<strong>The increasing use of PMC’s is directly tied to the death of the state monopoly on legitimate violence – in a world where violence is privatized, the sovereign no longer controls the experience of the political and war becomes individualized.</strong><br />
<strong>Krahmann, 09</strong> – (Elke, Senior Lecturer in International Relations, Department of Politics, University of Bristol, “Private Security Companies and the State Monopoly on Violence: A Case of Norm Change?” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4684:http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/PRIF_Prvt_Security_and_The%20State_Monopoly_on_Violence.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/PRIF_Prvt_Security_and_The%20State_Monopoly_on_Violence.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/PRIF_Prvt_Security_and_The%20State_Monopoly_on_Violence.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4684 --> DH)<br />
<br />
Altogether, the preceding analysis provides some evidence… these norms through their own discourses and practices.<br />
<br />
<strong>PMC’s change the strategic nature of war – violence is no longer the domain of the sovereign and the definition of war becomes unlimited.</strong><br />
<strong>Krahmann, 09</strong> – (Elke, Senior Lecturer in International Relations, Department of Politics, University of Bristol, “Private Security Companies and the State Monopoly on Violence: A Case of Norm Change?” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4685:http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/PRIF_Prvt_Security_and_The%20State_Monopoly_on_Violence.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/PRIF_Prvt_Security_and_The%20State_Monopoly_on_Violence.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/PRIF_Prvt_Security_and_The%20State_Monopoly_on_Violence.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4685 --> DH)<br />
<br />
Finally, the private use of armed force can affect… remain the primary goal of private security guards.<br />
<br />
<strong>We’ll isolate a few impacts:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First, Sovereign equality forms the basis for jus ad bellum – for the existence of LAW IN WAR. Without the sovereign monopoly on violence, war becomes unlimited and total, necessitating the destruction of the enemy rather than their defeat.</strong><br />
<strong>Axtmann, 07</strong> – (2007, Roland Axtmann, PhD, Department of Politics and International Relations, School of Humanities, Swansea University, Wales, “Humanity or Enmity? Carl Schmitt on International Politics,” International Politics, 2007, 44, (531–551) DH)<br />
<br />
Schmitt situated his critique of the idea of ‘just war’ and… for the bracketing, and thus ‘civilizing’, of war.<br />
<br />
<strong>And the sovereign decision regarding violence constitutes the monopoly on its legitimate use. As sovereignty relies on the necessity of this decision, the enemy who brings this decision into being can never be annihilated and war can never become atrocity.</strong><br />
<strong>Zarmanian, 06</strong> – (Thalin Zarmanian, PhD, International Relations, Professor at the University of Milan, “Carl Schmitt and the Problem of Legal Order: From Domestic to International,” Leiden Journal of International Law, 19 (2006), pp. 41–67, Proquest, DH)<br />
<br />
Because of the guaranteeing role that every state… civilian populations during the Second World War.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second, the removal of the political from the domain of the sovereign is the negation of the “outside.” In such a world, otherness becomes impossible and the enemy becomes the foe, turning the world of kingdoms into the kingdom of Satan.</strong><br />
<strong>Prozorov 06</strong> - (2006, Sergei Prozorov, Professor of International Relations at Petrozavodsk State University, “Liberal Enmity: The Figure of the Foe in the Political Ontology of Liberalism,” Millennium – Journal of International Studies, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4686:http://mil.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/35/1/75.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://mil.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/35/1/75.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://mil.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/35/1/75.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4686 --> DH)<br />
<br />
For Schmitt, the immanentist orientation of modern… and, thus, will inevitably resist its subjection.<br />
<br />
<strong>Third, the denial of the sovereign as the node of violent decision deterritorializes violence and results in a Hobbsian state of war in which all violence poses the threat of annihilation.</strong><br />
<strong>Zarmanian, 06</strong> – (Thalin Zarmanian, PhD, International Relations, Professor at the University of Milan, “Carl Schmitt and the Problem of Legal Order: From Domestic to International,” Leiden Journal of International Law, 19 (2006), pp. 41–67, Proquest DH)<br />

<br />
<strong>Contention 3 is the War:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The trinitarian war is one in which the state, the army, and the people function in an agonistic balance – the presence of PMC’s in battle upsets that balance and results in the death of the trinity.</strong><br />

<strong>The modern age is characterized by a disavowal of tragedy. The triumph of Socratic reason manifests in our attempts to resolve the chaotic aspects of life and avoid suffering.

<strong>Positivism and rationalism are means of self-narcosis: as we are fixated on the microcosms of the world around us, we lose sight of what is really there within us. It is a means by which we can run and hide from the feelings that we do not want to deal with.</strong><br />

<strong>Contention 1 involves multiplicity:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Thus the plans:</strong><br />
<br />
The United States federal government should implement a phased withdrawal of United States counterinsurgency troops in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Independent from any decision regarding the location of the headquarters of the Third Marine Expeditionary Force, the Department of Defense should agree to gradually withdraw Marines from Japan other than the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit as well as a comparable number of Marines to maintain pre-positioned equipment and maintain access arrangement for the emergency use of Japanese facilities.<br />

The United States federal government should discontinue missile defense military presence in Japan.<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should phase out its military presence in Turkey.<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should substantially phase out its use of private military contractors in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />

I get out of the oppressive chains that wrap and squeeze the humanity out of the person. father free us from the bondages through the signiture of your ballot because the only way things will change is if the ballot demands it, breaking the existing paradigm that suppresses true creativity. the resolution is no effective solution to solve for majority of oppressed people.<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should substantially reduce its Central Intelligence Agency presence in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence assigned to the counterinsurgency mission in Afghanistan.<br />

We ask that you embrace the position of the iconoclast and smash the images and idols that we have devoted ourselves so dearly to. in the war against the world the united states seeks to protect it’s way of life above all else so that we can sit with pink flamingos next to our above-ground pools sipping on a bud light. these justifications, these icons that our leaders swear to us to protect form the very basis of the war system.<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence in South Korea.<br />
<br />
The United Stated federal government should withdraw ground troops from the Republic of Korea.<br />
<br />
We affirm the Guernica transformed by the face of another population killed to save it…now we are asked to substantially reduce military and or police presence in one of six nations.

<strong>Contention 2 involves becoming the historian:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Human understanding is mediated linguistically, through our individual and collective interpretations of the texts that surround us. To think and understand historically is to embrace the verbal and linguistic truth of all interpretations – of all versions of truth. Our affirmation of multiple diverse interpretations of the resolution is the ultimate act of being resolved.</strong><br />
<strong>Gadamer, writing in 1960</strong> – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)<br />
<br />
This brings us to the second aspect of the relationship… the possibility of this kind of mediating interpretation.<br />
<br />
<strong>We invite everyone in this room – the judges and the negative – to join us in the discovery of wonder. The act of writing and reading is valuable in that it is the ultimate expression of truth – the 1AC allows us to finally understand what we’ve been debating all year.</strong><br />
<strong>Gadamer, writing in 1960</strong> – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)<br />
<br />
This is also true in those cases when there is… and preserves its truth in the immediacy of understanding.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our affirmation of difference and alterity within the resolution turns the mundane, everyday experience of debate into something wondrous. A notion of political agency that incorporates wonder allows us to become more engaged and effective political and ethical actors in the world outside of debate.</strong><br />
<strong>McManus, 07</strong> – (2007, Susan McManus, Lecturer in Political Theory at Queens College, Theory &amp; Event, 10.3, muse)<br />
<br />
Jane Bennett, invoking wonder or enchantment, as a &quot;mood with ethical potential,&quot;… touched, wonderstruck, called beyond or on this side of what we already were.<br />
<br />
<strong>Put away your framework file – this 1AC is the ultimate act of affirmation. It is precisely the formlessness of our interpretive method that gives it meaning.</strong><br />
<strong>Gadamer, writing in 1960</strong> – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)<br />
<br />
These studies are concerned with the problem of … the conduct of life, but to try to correct false thinking about what they are.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our 1AC does not have stable meaning. It is valuable only insofar as it is an experience that is interpreted by the people in this room.</strong><br />
<strong>Gadamer, writing in 1960</strong> – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)<br />
<br />
This insight into the way interpretation and understanding are… Language is the language of reason itself.<br />
<br />
<strong>The belief that the 1AC corresponds with any material reality is a misunderstanding that turns truth into sophistry.</strong><br />
<strong>Gadamer, writing in 1960</strong> – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)<br />
<br />
But, as always with Plato, there is a reason for Socrates' being… in fact influences all further thinking about language<br />
<br />
<strong>There is no right and wrong. Their objections to our 1AC are merely alternative interpretations that do not disprove the value of our interpretation.</strong><br />
<strong>Gadamer, writing in 1960</strong> – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)<br />
<br />
Of course it can also happen that we do not address… reference to the appearance of the original, only more or less correct.<br />

<br />
The encounter with alterity, with that which is other, or as yet unknown,… (hierarchical) relationship between affect and episteme.<br />
<br />
<strong>The experience of wonder that is the 1AC is a moment of cognitive dissonance that transcends the particular ordering of the status quo. We must allow ourselves to be carried by the tide of interpretation and become fully open to change.</strong><br />

<br />
Throughout this essay, I am concerned to encourage and cultivate hopeful agency… the same, deploys wonder as its vital affective component.<br />

<strong>Our alternative is to draw clear lines in the sand as an expression of the fundamental equality of our enmity. The violence of the political will not just go away while modern liberals imagine a world without war – it is this dream that reproduces the worst forms of violence and absolute exclusion. Solvency is an irrelevant question - our duty is not to eliminate war, but rather to question the processes and discourses which unleash its true horror.</strong><br />

<strong>Living according to the Tao, or the way of the universe, precludes taking action to prevent death and suffering, even the extinction of all life on earth. As participants in the course of the universe, we are blind to its overarching meaning and thus any action we take will be misguided, unproductive, and immoral.</strong><br />

In the Taoist classic Huai-nan-tzu, one finds a famous story… emotional reaction to events does not mislead us into a foolish course of action.<br />
<strong>This applies equally to both individual suffering and the extinction of all life on earth – their calls to save humanity are based on a flawed fear of death and a misunderstanding of the continuous nature of the universe.</strong><br />

But by this definition, the natural order, which we are enjoined to respect… fuss to the immaterial state from which he or she originally emerged.<br />
<strong>The alternative is to embrace the practice of Wu Wei, or “doing nothing” in order to appreciate the flow of the Tao – only through appreciating the natural order of life can we live according to Taoism.</strong><br />

<strong>Counterplan Text:</strong> The United States federal government should publically declare that it will not cooperate with Taiwan on missile defense systems and that joint Japanese-US missile defense systems will not be extended to include Taiwan. The US should also implement an immediate ban on the development of space weapons and ASAT systems. The United States federal government will declare that it will not be the first state to use nuclear weapons in a conflict between the United States and China over Taiwan. The United States Federal Government should establish a policy of comprehensive and public congressional oversight of all activities related to the deployment of Japanese BMD. This should include declassifying details of developmental tests and all official threat assessments regarding Japanese TMD, ending evolutionary spiral development and acquisition processes for defense technology and take all necessary steps to encourage open public debate on the issue in both the United States and Japan.<br />

The recent reemergence of piracy as a threat to legitimate (and even dangerously illegitimate)… naval supremacy, potentially producing destabilizing environments.<br />
<br />
<strong>And maintaining the current commitment to a 313 ship navy is crucial to sustaining our naval power.</strong><br />

Rather, the most effective way of securing U.S. national interests… before the size of the Navy falls to a dangerously low level.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>No amount of flexibility or networking can get around the fact that a smaller navy is perceived as less dangerous and has less strategic reach and power. Especially true in the context of China and East Asia.</strong><br />

The Navy’s future is not immune to this fuzzy strategic view of the world… existing manpower commitments and the upwardly spiraling cost of added personnel.<br />

 <br />
<strong>Counterplan:</strong> The United States federal government should withdraw its forces from Atsugi naval air base and downsize its forces at Yokosuka naval base. The United States federal government should redeploy CVN 73 to the Mayport, Florida naval base. The United States federal government should comply with the Navy’s current plan for a 313 ship navy, but should procure the hulls for all new naval vessels abroad while continuing to produce weapons systems domestically.<br />
<br />
<strong>Counterplan solves their overstretch advantage – manufacturing the hulls for new ships abroad would massively reduce costs and make the navy’s 313 ship navy possible within the current budget. Only our evidence assumes this unique solution.</strong><br />
<strong>White 07</strong> – (2007, Robert J. White, senior engineer in the Ranges, Engineering, and Analysis Department at the Naval Sea Systems Command, He has been a Navy Staff action officer for modeling and simulation for weapon system test and evaluation, and an advanced development lead at the NAVSEA Wash- ington Navy Yard headquarters for combat system ship- board training, currently on detail to the Chief of Naval Operations Strategic Studies Group, “GLOBALIZATION OF NAVY SHIPBUILDING,” www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc (google))<br />
<br />
The first step to global production warships is to separate high-tech combat…They are two sides of the same coin. If a “thousand ships” can work, so can a “thousand shipyards.”<br />
<br />
<strong>And the carrier itself doesn’t matter – their own authors advocate redeployment to the US and none of their evidence advocates decommissioning. Withdrawal from the bases solves.</strong><br />

<strong>Overseas production would reduce the costs of shipbuilding to a reasonable level – allows the navy to maintain the full 313 ship force within the current budget.</strong><br />

<br />
The Navy states that 313 ships are necessary to support U.S. national security… affordability measure within the new maritime strategy now being formulated.<br />
<br />
<strong>Foreign production of warships could outfit the navy for half the current expenditure – solves the whole aff.</strong><br />

Global warship production would allow the Navy to combine the advantages… “unknowns” like requirements growth, and still save money.<br />
