===Plan=== 
**Thus the plan:**
**The United States federal government should substantially increase its development of Operationally Responsive Space.**

**The plan could consist of a program that launches satellites quickly and at low cost – it covers both launch system and satellite development.**

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">First, a bit of background.</span>__ORS officially consists of three tiers: Tier 1: Rapidly exploit existing assets Tier 2: Rapidly launch low-cost satellites from inventory Tier 3: Rapidly and economically develop and build new satellites__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">For the official definition of what all this means, read the DoD</span>[[http://www.responsivespace.com/ors/reference/ORS_Plan.pdf|//ORS Report to Congress//]]<span style="font-size: 7pt;">of April 17, 2007. (It can be downloaded from the Responsive Space website,</span><span style="color: #003366; font-size: 7pt;">[[http://www.responsivespace.com/|www.responsivespace.com]]</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This site also has all of the technical papers from the first five Responsive Space conferences that provide the technical background for most of the ORS work to date.) However, for the purpose of looking at ORS in the broader, non-bureaucratic context, I’ll argue that </span>__ORS consists of launching satellites quickly__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (i.e., </span>__within a few hours of a previously unidentified demand) and at low cost__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (less than $20–$25 million for the launch, payload, spacecraft bus, and one year of operations, but not including the non-recurring development cost). This is Tier 2 in the government terminology, although the government hasn’t yet bought into the cost or time numbers.</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The mesosphere is between 36-51 miles above the surface</span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">National Weather Service, 11</span>**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> (“Layers of the Atmosphere”, 2/11, [[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/atmos/layers.htm|http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream//atmos/layers.htm]])</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Layers of the Atmosphere</span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">The envelope of gas surrounding the Earth changes from the ground up. Five distinct layers have been identified using...</span>
* <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">thermal characteristics (temperature changes),</span>
* <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">chemical composition,</span>
* <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">movement, and</span>
* <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">density.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">Each of the layers are bounded by "pauses" where the greatest changes in thermal characteristics, chemical composition, movement, and density occur.</span>
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Troposphere</span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">The troposphere begins at the Earth's surface and extends from 4 to 12 miles (6 to 20 km) high. This is the layer of the atmosphere in which we live.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> The height of the troposphere varies from the equator to the poles. At the equator it is around 11-12 miles (18-20 km) high, at 50°N and 50°S, 5½ miles and at the poles just under four miles high.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> As the density of the gases in this layer decrease with height, the air becomes thinner. Therefore, the temperature in the troposphere also decreases with height in response. As one climbs higher, the temperature drops from an average around 62°F (17°C) to -60°F (-51°C) at the top of the troposphere. Almost all weather occurs in this region.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> The transition boundary between the troposphere and the layer above is called the tropopause. Together the tropopause and the troposphere are known as the lower atmosphere.</span>
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Stratosphere</span>**
__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The Stratosphere extends from the top of the troposphere up to around 31 miles </span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">(50 km) above the Earth's surface. This layer holds 19 percent of the atmosphere's gases but very little water vapor.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> In this region the temperature increases with height. Heat is produced in the process of the formation of Ozone and this heat is responsible for temperature increases from an average -60°F</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> (-51°C) at tropopause to a maximum of about 5°F (-15°C) at the top of the stratosphere.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> This increase in temperature with height means warmer air is located above cooler air. This prevents "convection" since there is no upward vertical movement of the gases and is the reason for the 'anvil-shaped' tops of cumulonimbus clouds. These anvils occur at the tropopause.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> The transition boundary which separates the stratosphere from the mesosphere is called the stratopause.</span>
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Mesosphere</span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">T</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">he mesosphere extends from the top of the stratosphere to about 56 miles</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> (90 km) </span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">above the earth</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">. The gases, including the oxygen molecules, continue to become thinner and thinner with height.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> As such, the effect of the warming by ultraviolet radiation also becomes less and less leading to a decrease in temperature with height. On average, temperature decreases from about 5°F (-15°C) to as low as -184°F (-120°C) at the mesopause.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> However, the gases in the mesosphere are still thick enough to slow down meteors hurtling into the atmosphere, where they burn up, leaving fiery trails in the night sky. Both the stratosphere to the mesosphere is considered the middle atmosphere.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">The transition boundary which separates the mesosphere from the thermosphere is called the mesopause.</span>
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Thermosphere</span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">Above the mesosphere the thermosphere extends up to near 375 miles (600 km) above the earth. This layer is known as the upper atmosphere.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> The gases of the thermosphere are increasingly thinner than in the mesosphere. As such, incoming high energy ultraviolet and x-ray radiation from the sun, absorbed by the molecules in this layer, causes a large temperature increase.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;"> Because of this absorption, the temperature increases with height and can reach as high as 3,600°F (2,000°C) near the top of this layer; however, despite the high temperature, this layer of the atmosphere would still feel very cold to our skin because of the extremely thin air. The total amount of energy from the very few molecules in this layer is not enough to heat our skin.</span>
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Exosphere</span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">The Exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere. It extends from the top of the thermosphere to 6,200 miles (10,000 km) above the earth. In this layer, atoms and molecules escape into space and satellites orbit the earth.</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10.5pt;">Development means creating technology for the use of space</span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10.5pt;">Space Development Promotion Act, 5</span>**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> – of the Republic of Korea (5/31, reprinted in the UN Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, [[http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/limited/c2/AC105_C2_2009_CRP14E.pdf]])</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">The terms in this act are defined as follows:</span>

Violation: The affirmative creates a space guard that occurs on earth.

Extra T is a voting issue

a) Removes ALL aff boundaries and justifies super-plans with planks to get out of every disad. Debate becomes impossible – unpredictable advs, addons, plan texts working
b) Trivializes the resolution, corrupting all topic education.
c) Promotes an unrealistic form of advocacy skills. Policy makers can’t just wish away their limitations with a magical mandate.

d) Topical version of the aff: The United States federal government should substantial increase space situational awareness.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This analysis brings into focus several observations about how whiteness operates rhetorically and ideologically in public political discourse</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. First, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the ideology of white privilege maintains its invisibility through rhetorical silence. Rhetorical silence protects the invisibility of whiteness because it both reflects and sustains the assumption that to silence about whiteness preserves material white privilege because it masks its existence and makes the denial of white privilege plausible</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Hall argues that language is the principle medium of ideologies because ideologies are sets or chains of meaning which are located in language. However, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">ideologies</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also “</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">work” through rhetorical silences which conceal privilege. Ideological systems are made up of both presences and absences because positively marked terms ‘signify’ in relation to what is absent, unmarked, the unspoken, the unsayable</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” (Hall, “Signification” 109).</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In this case, the ideology of white privilege “works” through rhetorical silence about whiteness.</span>
