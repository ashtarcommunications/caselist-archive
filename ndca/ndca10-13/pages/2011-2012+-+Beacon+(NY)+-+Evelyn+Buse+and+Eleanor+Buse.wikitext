<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span class="s1">**"What the astronomers saw through the telescope," said Mr. Pool, "changed their lives completely and changed completely the whole order of things. However, the asters were not men to blow their cool. They had a sense of humor. "'This might just stop the war for a while,' one of them said. Another said, 'And stop the population explosion.' "'And riots,' they boy had said, getting into the swing of it, 'and poverty and going to the Statue of Liberty every field trip day.' "After that," said Mr. Pool, "Junior Brown was always welcome at the planetarium. The astronomers never caught what his name was and never knew how they happened to call the amazing planet, Junior Brown.**</span> <span class="s2">But they were glad to have a name for it right off like that. Now, they wouldn't have to name it My Old Lady, which had been the suggestion of one graduate assistant." "Oh, sure, man," Buddy Clark said, taking up the story fro</span></span><span class="s2">m Mr. Pool. Buddy's voice was a soft, high purr.</span> <span class="s1">**"Those astronomers measured and experimented and even ate their meals looking through that telescope. They had to admit that the ten-planet solar system after about fifty thousand years was stable and up there to stay for the rest of time." In the feeble light of the miniature solar system, Big Buddy's hands flipped over, palms down. His hands crossed and slowly uncrossed, while in the room the planets slowed into gliding, peaceful revolutions.**</span> <span class="s2">There were three speeds to Mr. Pool's and Buddy Clark's solar system, the same as there were to any decent record player.</span> <span class="s1">**It was Mr. Pool who had changed the pace of the planets while Junior watched Buddy's hands. But for Junior the slowing down of the planets had seemed like magic."**</span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span class="s1">**The Planet of Junior Brown**</span>**'s reconstruction of the solar system is a metaphor for power systems in our social universe that are responsible for the displacement and marginalization of individuals unable to occupy positions of power. This year's exploration of space in an educational setting invites us as debaters, and readers to recognize the dominant universal values of both systems to change them.**</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**“But I lost heart, thought Mr. Pool. I could no longer teach in so rigid a regime. Maybe I was wrong. This change—has any of it really changed? Only now, through his work with Buddy Clark and the example of Buddy's devotion to Junior Brown, did Mr. Pool slowly begin to believe in himself again. He could no longer remember when he arrived at the curious notion that the two-legged beings on earth were only disguised as men. Working with Buddy, he sensed a whole new being lying in wait within the boy. Perhaps the human race is yet to come, thought Mr. Pool We must make life ready.”**</span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**Invisibility of spaces augment racial binaries through a racing of space: the partitioning of areas by their relation to dominant forms of civil society.

<span class="s1" style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**“The sound of Buddy's voice fell in a pattern of musical notations. 'We are together,' Buddy told them, 'because we have to learn to live for each other.' So that was it, he told himself.
