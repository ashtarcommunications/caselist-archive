Dolman: Well, I think ...<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> some sort of order.</span>



===Observation Two: China=== 

China’s weaponizing space and will gain supremacy over the US
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Adams 2010</span> (Jonathan, China Specialist at CSM, “China is on path to 'militarization of space',” October 28, [[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2010/1028/China-is-on-path-to-militarization-of-space]])

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The United States...</span> clear military goal.




China will escalate the conflict—perception of rational escalation ensures US gets drawn into a broader nuclear conflict
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Glaser 2011</span> (Charles, Political Science Professor @ George Washington University, March/April, “Will China’s Rise Lead to War?” Foreign Affairs, Vol. 90 Issue 2, EbscoHost)

The prospects... U.S.-Chinese relations.



=== === 
History proves that realists are right about the inevitability of a space race with China—both sides want the military and economic benefits
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dolman 2010</span> (Everett, PhD and Professor of Comparative Military Studies @ US Air Force School of Advanced Air and Space Studies and Recipient of Central Intelligence’s Outstanding Intelligence Analyst Award, “The Case for Weapons in Space: A Geopolitical Assessment,” September, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1532576)

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The coming war ... cheaply and effectively. </span>


Perception of loss of capabilities independently leads to an attack on Taiwan
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Burke 2006</span> (Alan, Lt Col, Air War College, “SPACE THREAT WARNING: FOUNDATION FOR SPACE

Although a major...<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> a fait accompli.</span> 45

The alternative will cause the US to preemptively strike China - causes escalation

Finally, the growing ...<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and further misperception.</span>96





===Contention Three: Solvency=== 
The best covert seizure of space would be deployment of micro-satellites in the form of a Parasitic Attitude Control System to hack and dismantle enemy capabilities without debris or negative perception
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Page 2006</span> (Joseph, Assistant flight commander and ICBM combat crew commander (Squadron Command Post) at
the 741st Missile Squadron, 91st Space Wing, Minor AFB, North Dakota, “Stealing Zeus's Thunder” Air & Space Power Journal Summer 2006 pg. 29-31)

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The idea of covertly ... </span>necessarily<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> obliterating them</span>


Even if it was detected, PACS renders countermeasures or escalation pointless
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Klein 2006</span> [Commander John - United States Navy, Space Warfare: Strategy, Principles and Policy (Space Power and Politics) Pg. 77]

<span style="color: #2d2d2d; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Perhaps </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the best ...</span><span style="color: #2d2d2d; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> from defensive strategy.</span>

And, PACS is the most effective microsat technology—cohesive with anti-ASAT capabilities and easily developed

the 741st Missile Squadron, 91st Space Wing, Minor AFB, North Dakota, “Stealing Zeus's Thunder” Air & Space Power Journal Summer 2006 pg. 27-28)

If the United States ...<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and space warfare.</span>

Arms control or codes of conduct fail—only allow challengers to outpace us and put our satellites in jeopardy
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Kueter 2007</span> - is president of the George C. Marshall Institute, a nonprofit think tank dediicated to science and technology in public policy (Jeff, New Atlantis, “China's Space Ambitions -- And Ours,” Spring, lexis)

<span style="color: black;">Setting aside such ... </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> futile diplomatic efforts</span><span style="color: black;">.</span>


Microsat defense systems are the best and ONLY way to protect current satellites and stay covert until necessary
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Schendzielos 2008</span> (Kurt, Director, 13th Air Force Commander's Action Group at US Air Force, “Protection in Space: A Self-Defense Acquisition Priority for U.S. Satellites” http://dodreports.com/pdf/ada485553.pdf)

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">An inherent advantage... satellite is orbiting.</span>




**Plan: The United States federal government should develop and deploy microsatellites tasked with inspection, surveillance, maintenance, and propulsion capabilities as well as the deployment of a Parasitic Attitude Control System.**
