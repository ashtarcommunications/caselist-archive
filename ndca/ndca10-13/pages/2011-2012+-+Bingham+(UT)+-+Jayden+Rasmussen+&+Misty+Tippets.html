<strong>U.S. climate satellites are battered and outdated—inevitable data gaps destroy environmental monitoring</strong><br />
<strong>Bohan 10</strong>—Suzanne Bohan, Washington Post writer, Sept 19, 2010, “A dim view for Earth emerges” Washington Post pg. A06<br />
The satellite, Landsat 7, is broken. And it's emblematic of the nation's battered satellite environmental monitoring program. The bad news: It's only going to get worse, unless the federal agencies criticized for their poor management of the satellite systems over the past decade stage a fast turnaround. Many, however, view that prospect as a long shot. &quot;I would say our ability to observe the Earth from space is at grave risk of dying from neglect,&quot; said Field, director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University. Inez Fung, a noted climatologist at the University of California at Berkeley, was shocked as she scanned a recent federal report warning of impending gaps in the country's ability to monitor Earth from space. The federal document, released in May, listed cuts in climate-monitoring sensors from the next generation of Earth-observing satellites. The current satellites beam down many types of indispensable data about the planet, such as ocean currents, ozone levels and snow cover, as well as the pictures viewers see every day on TV weathercasts. But key instruments on the new satellites have been eliminated: Gone is a sensor that would relay new data about the atmosphere and environmental conditions in the ocean and along coastal areas. The movement of pollutants and greenhouse gaseswould have been under the instrument's mechanical gaze, as well. Also absent is a critical sensor that monitors temperature changes over time on Earth. &quot;That's like if you have a sick patient, and then say, 'I have no more thermometers,' &quot; Fung said. In all, nine new climate instruments on the next generation of satellites were canceled or their capabilities scaled back in 2006, according to the Government Accountability Office report. Combined with a five-year delay in launching these next-generation satellites, with the first scheduled to blast off in 2011, these canceled or &quot;degraded&quot; instruments leave the nation facing critical gaps in satellite monitoring of the planet beginning in 2015, the report stated. And a National Academy of Sciences analysis of the disarray in the satellite program stressed that because of Earth's growing population, it's more crucial than ever to monitor pollution, water quality, land use and other environmental conditions. Many blame the cuts on Bush administration policies that favored manned moon and Mars missions over shoring up aging Earth-observing satellite systems. Critics cite a 30 percent decline between 2000 and 2006 in NASA's Earth science budget - which funds environmental satellites - as evidence of the administration's lukewarm support of keeping an eye on the planet's condition. The National Academy of Sciences report, along with a chorus of experts in the field, also warns that the country is at risk of losing its worldwide technological leadership in Earth-observing satellites. Other casualties of the 2006 cuts include an instrument for tracking airborne particles such as sea spray, smog, volcanic ash and smoke - all factors contributing to the warming or cooling of the planet. The inclusion of a new instrument for monitoring soil moisture was canceled, which would have yielded information valuable to, among others, farmers and those monitoring the spread of deserts worldwide. These cuts spell a 46 percent decline in data about the Earth's conditions that these new satellites were designed to provide, and the GAO report concluded that because of the trouble-plagued satellite program, &quot;our nation's ability to understand climate change may be limited.&quot; Those in the field use harsher language. Many Earth-monitoring satellites &quot;are really in desperate shape,&quot; said Field, with Stanford's Carnegie Institution. In the 1960s, the United States began using satellites to observe its lands, oceans, atmosphere and the space environment near Earth. The satellites continuously monitor the planet's dynamic environment and allow humans to peer into inaccessible places. Information beamed by these spacecraft is now essential for forecasting weather, tracking conditions on Earth and in its atmosphere, and projecting long-term climate trends. With satellite data, rising sea levels can be monitored, helping communities on islands and along coastal areas plan. Satellites help farmers assess soil conditions before planting, allow foresters to examine logging activities, let water managers monitor the mountain snowpack that provides water to cities, and track the migration of wildlife such as buffalo and elephants. Satellite data are also essential for crafting international agreements for reducing global warming, said Molly Macauley, an economist with Resources for the Future, a research institute in Washington.<br />

<strong>Data gaps impede climate risk-management—monitoring key to prevent tipping point</strong><br />
<strong>Government Office for Science 3/14</strong>- UK, Tipping Points meeting, London, 14 March 2011 Note prepared on behalf of the Gov-ernment Office for Science by the Met Office: Peter Good, Jason Lowe, Richard Wood <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2507:http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/goscience/docs/t/11-974-tipping-points-meeting-london-14-march-2011 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/goscience/docs/t/11-974-tipping-points-meeting-london-14-march-2011" rel="nofollow">http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/goscience/docs/t/11-974-tipping-points-meeting-london-14-march-2011</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2507 --><br />
There is wide acceptance in the scientific community that there are likely to be “tipping points” in the climate system, where a significant, qualitative change in state occurs in response to a small perturbation. Crossing such tipping points could lead to accelerated, committed or irreversible change. However there is substantial scientific uncertainty in quantifying the position and likelihood of passing key thresholds, and in terms of associated impacts. Current estimates of the likelihood of triggering large-scale and/or irreversible climate events are largely based on expert judgement, informed by paleo-climatic evidence, computer models and current understanding of the underlying physical processes. The high level of uncertainty, combined with the potential for very significant impacts if one or more “tipping points” were to be triggered, means that the policy response is likely to require a risk management approach. Paleo-climate reconstructions provide evidence of past rapid change events, for example the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which took place around 50 million years ago and involved a major climatic warming which took place over around 1000 years, possibly driven by rapid methane release. Current cumulative anthropogenic carbon release is around one third of the way towards the level that triggered such events in the past. Climate models are used to provide short term forecasts and longer term projections, to interpret recent climatic variations and paleo-climatic changes, and to understand the physical processes that may drive threshold behaviour. However several examples are known where the models used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment may not represent physical mechanisms of tipping elements correctly, due to limitations in resolution and in the processes that can currently be included in models. ‘Early warnings’ for tipping points through Earth system monitoring may be possible and may help manage the risks, although the uncertainty in modelling such events remains large. Three types of ‘health check’ approach were mentioned: (i) general statistical methods, (ii) process-based identification of key variables to monitor, and (iii) initial value prediction. Each was seen to have different advantages and disadvantages. The critical need for long-term monitoring was emphasised, while many existing observations are tied to short-term research programs. A clear set of long term monitoring priorities for tipping points has not yet been developed. It is important to be able to interpret ‘surprises’ in new observations (e.g. the 2007 dip in Arctic sea-ice), so that such observations can be put into context. These interpretations must be developed through careful application of quantitative, process-based knowledge of the climate system. After a high level review of the scientific evidence, the meeting considered how the risk of “tipping points” and system thresholds could be better included in policy development and wider public debate. There was consensus that the science in this area is particularly hard to communicate clearly. In part this is due to the danger of communicating an overly negative message; positive messages that make the public feel part of the solution are more likely to effect behaviour change. There was broad agreement on the requirement for a set of different (but self-consistent) narratives to meet the needs of individual audiences, using metaphors to aid clarity and understanding, and applying a risk-management framework.<br />

<strong>Current uncertainty about climate change prevents adaptation</strong><br />
<strong>Gifford 11</strong> - Robert Gifford, Professor of psychology at University of Victoria, May – June 2011, “The dragons of inaction: Psychological Barriers That Limit Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,” American Psychologist Vol. 66, No. 4, 290–302 DOI: 10.1037/a0023566<br />
Experimental research on resource dilemmas demonstrates that perceived or real uncertainty reduces the frequency of pro-environmental behavior (e.g., de Kwaadsteniet, 2007; Hine &amp; Gifford, 1996). Individuals tend to interpret any sign of uncertainty, for example in the size of a resource pool or the rate at which the resource regenerates, as sufficient reason to harvest at a rate that favors self-interest rather than that of the environment. Uncertainty about climate change also quite likely func- tions as a justification for inaction or postponed action related to climate change. In the climate change context, presentations of the very carefully chosen level-of-confi- dence phrases (such as “likely” or “very likely,” p. 3) from the 2007 assessment report of the United Nations Intergov- ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) led many individuals to interpret the phrases as having a lower like- lihood than the IPCC experts intended (Budescu, Broomell, &amp; Por, 2009). Thus, well-intended efforts by climate change scien- tists to fairly characterize the degree of certainty about climate change seem to lead to a general underestimation of climate change risk on the part of the lay audience. Yet the scientific and ethical reality is that a certain degree of uncertainty is an inescapable element of any climate model—or any model, for that matter. Thus, climate sci- entists are left with a very perplexing problem: how to present the likelihood of climate change outcomes honestly without promoting misguided optimism on the part of the lay audience, which of course helps to justify inaction on the part of the public.<br />

<strong>Climate change is progressing now – now is the key time</strong><br />

Thompson The Ohio State University Climate Change: The Evidence and Our Options Byrd Polar Research Center Publication 1402 The Behavior Analyst 2010, 33, 153–170 No. 2 (Fall) <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2508:http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/TBA&amp;#45;-LTonly.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/TBA--LTonly.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/TBA--LTonly.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2508 --><br />
Positive feedback increases the rate of change. Eventually a tipping point may be reached, after which it could be impossible to restore normal conditions. Think of a very large boulder rolling down a hill: When it first starts to move, we might stop it by pushing against it or wedging chocks under it or building a barrier, but once it has reached a certain velocity, there is no stopping it. We do not know if there is a tipping point for global warming, but the possibility cannot be dismissed, and it has ominous implications. Global warming is a very, very large boulder. Even if there is no tipping point (or we manage to avoid it), the acceleration of warming means serious trouble. In fact, if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere tomorrow, temperatures would continue to rise for 20 to 30 years because of what is already in the atmosphere. Once methane is injected into the troposphere, it remains for about 8 to 12 years (Prinn et al., 1987). Carbon dioxide has a much longer residence: 70 to 120 years. Twenty percent of the CO2 being emitted today will still affect the earth’s climate 1,000 years from now (Archer &amp; Brovkin, 2008). If, as predicted, global temperature rises another 3u C (5.4u F) by the end of the century, the earth will be warmer than it has been in about 3 million years (Dowsett et al., 1994; Rahmstorf, 2007). Oceans were then about 25 m higher than they are today. We are already seeing important effects from global warming; the effects of another 3u C (5.4u F) increase are hard to predict. However, such a drastic change would, at the very least, put severe pressure on civilization as we know it.<br />

<strong>Scenario 1 Migration</strong><br />
<strong>And, failure to adapt to climate change could cause up to 1 billion refugees</strong><br />
<strong>Tacoli 10</strong> - Cecilia Tacoli, Acting Head, Human Settlements Group, Team Leader, Rural-urban @ international institute for environment and development, December 2010, “Moving to adapt to climate change,” reflect and act, IIED<br />
By 2050, climate change is expected to push hundreds of millions of people — up to 1 billion, by some estimates — to leave their homes seeking better land, jobs and other resources. The figures are intimidating — but they don’t offer the specifics needed to prepare for the transformation. Uncertainties about local impacts of climate change, as well as thin data on migration today, make it difficult or impossible to precisely predict future mobility patterns. But we can better understand how environmental change in fragile areas affects people’s livelihoods and influences migration — and how governments and civil society can take these links into account. In 2009, IIED, in partnership with three local NGOs — Mainumby, IED Afrique and Tamasha — began case studies looking at these questions in Bolivia, Senegal and Tanzania.<br />

<strong>Displacement causes conflict which will escalate</strong><br />

Climate change-related disasters not only affect ecosystems, but cause people to relocate either by choice or by force. Some will be displaced within the boundaries of their affected countries (Internal Displacement or ID) and others will cross state borders. Some will be displaced because of sudden-onset hydro-meteorological disasters, such as flooding, hurricanes, landslides, etc. Others will be affected by slow-onset disasters, like desertification, rising sea levels and droughts. Sea level rise will, in some cases, lead to permanent loss of small state islands, Maldives being an example, which means permanent displacement of the inhabitants of the island. In high-risk zones authorities have to choose between the cost of rebuilding every time a disaster hits or of just displacing the people permanently. Furthermore, as a result of displacement, disputes over resources such as water and land will cause violence. It is more than likely that some of the violence will end up in armed conflict.<br />

In the case of severe climate change, projected massive nonlinear events in the global environ- ment give rise to massive nonlinear societal events. In this scenario, nations around the world will be overwhelmed by the scale of change and perni- cious challenges, such as pandemic disease and water and food shortages. The internal cohesion of nations will be under great stress, including in the United States, due to a dramatic rise in migration, changes in agricultural patterns and water avail- ability, and wealthier members of society pulling away from the rest of the population. Protests, civil unrest, and violent upheaval of governments are possible. The flooding of coastal communities around the world, especially in the Netherlands, the United States, South Asia, and China, has the potential to challenge regional and even national identities. Armed conflict between nations over resources and even territory, such as the Nile and its tributaries, is likely, and nuclear war is possible. Globalization could halt and alliances collapse. The catastrophic scenario finds strong and sur- prising intersections between the two great security threats of the day — global climate change and international terrorism waged by Islamist extremists. The catastrophic scenario means the destruction of hope itself, as human society struggles to adapt. Both migration and religious fervor are likely to spike. The scenario notes that understanding the threat in light of the other great threat of our age, terrorism, can be illuminating. Although distinct in nature, both threats are linked to energy use in the industrialized world, and, indeed, the solutions to both depend on trans- forming the world’s energy economy — America’s energy economy in particular. Indeed, aviation fuel and non-nuclear fuel for destroyers could become unobtainable just as logistical issues and the demand for military use are strained.<br />

Epidemiologists are adopting new remote sensing techniques to study a variety of vector-borne diseases. Associations between satellite-derived environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and land cover type and vector density are used to identify and characterize vector habitats. The convergence of factors such as the availability of multi-temporal satellite data and georeferenced epidemiological data, collaboration between remote sensing scientists and biologists, and the availability of sophisticated, statistical geographic information system and image processing algorithms in a desktop environment creates a fertile research environment. The use of remote sensing techniques to map vector-borne diseases has evolved significantly over the past 25 years. In this paper, we review the status of remote sensing studies of arthropod vector- borne diseases due to mosquitoes, ticks, blackflies, tsetse flies, and sandflies, which are responsible for the majority of vector-borne diseases in the world. Examples of simple image classification techniques that associate land use and land cover types with vector habitats, as well as complex statistical models that link satellite-derived multi-temporal meteorological observations with vector biology and abundance, are discussed here. Future improvements in remote sensing applications in epidemiology are also discussed. Hematophagous arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, and flies are responsible for transmitting bacteria, viruses, and protozoa between vertebrate hosts, causing such deadly diseases as malaria, dengue fever, and trypanosomiasis. Until the early 20th century, vector-borne diseases were responsible for more deaths in humans than all other causes combined. These diseases prevented the development of large areas of the tropics, especially in Africa [1]. Table 1 provides a list of common arthropod vectors, the diseases they carry, and the type of pathogen responsible for the disease. Floods and other natural disasters create environments conducive to the spread of communicable diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, and cholera. Some studies suggest that climate change and increased climate variability are fostering the spread of infectious diseases beyond their traditional geographic domains [2]. For example, West Nile virus, which was previously confined to Africa, Asia, and Europe (i.e., the Old World), has recently spread to North America. The mosquito Aedes albopictus, a vector of both dengue fever and West Nile virus and a native to Asia, has recently established in North America [3]. The ‘‘burden’’ of prominent infectious diseases worldwide transmitted by arthropod vectors is given in Table 2 [4]. Disease burden is expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), which is the sum of years lost prematurely due to mortality and disability for incidence cases of the disease [5]. One DALY represents the loss of a year of healthy life. Passive disease surveillance involves voluntary reporting by people who are ill enough to go to a treatment center; such centers are therefore only effective for detection and mitigation after a person has been infected. On the other hand, active disease surveillance, which involves ‘‘searching’’ for evidence of disease proactively through routine and continuous monitoring in endemic areas, could help prevent an outbreak, or slow transmission at an earlier stage of an epidemic. Improved methods are required for forecasting, early detection, and prevention of vector-borne diseases due to the increasing trend of large-scale epidemics such as malaria [6]. Of late, satellite remote sensing technology has shown promising results in assessing the risk of various vector-borne diseases at different spatial scales. Satellite measurements and other remote sensing techniques cannot identify the vectors themselves, but may be used to characterize the environment in which the vectors thrive. Environmental variables such as land and sea surface temperature and amount, type, and health of vegetation can be identified and measured from space. A list of environmental factors that can be mapped through remote sensing and their potential linkages with various diseases has been previously described [7]. Satellites have the ability to detect anomalies and deviations from the normal climate patterns that are conducive to the breeding of disease- carrying vectors such as mosquitoes. Techniques to map disease occurrence and risk from satellite data therefore require at least some understanding of the relationships between a vector-borne disease and the air, land, and water environment in which it occurs. The objectives of this review are to summarize developments in the application of remote sensing techniques for studying infectious diseases in humans due to arthropod vectors and to identify future opportunities for further research.<br />

Global epidemics If Earth doesn't do us in, our fellow organisms might be up to the task. Germs and people have always coexisted, but occasionally the balance gets out of whack. The Black Plague killed one European in four during the 14th century; influenza took at least 20 million lives between 1918 and 1919; the AIDS epidemic has produced a similar death toll and is still going strong. From 1980 to 1992, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mortality from infectious disease in the United States rose 58 percent. Old diseases such as cholera and measles have developed new resistance to antibiotics. Intensive agriculture and land development is bringing humans closer to animal pathogens. International travel means diseases can spread faster than ever. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert who recently left the Minnesota Department of Health, described the situation as &quot;like trying to swim against the current of a raging river.&quot; The grimmest possibility would be the emergence of a strain that spreads so fast we are caught off guard or that resists all chemical means of control, perhaps as a result of our stirring of the ecological pot. About 12,000 years ago, a sudden wave of mammal extinctions swept through the Americas. Ross MacPhee of the American Museum of Natural History argues the culprit was extremely virulent disease, which humans helped transport as they migrated into the New World<br />

<strong>Scenario 3 – Nuke War</strong><br />
<strong>Unanticipated Climate Change makes war, instability, and nuclear proliferation inevitable</strong><br />
<strong>Schwartz and Randall 3</strong>- An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States National Security By Peter Schwartz, co-founder and chairman of Global Business Network and Doug Randall, California-based Global Business Network, October 2003 <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2512:http://www.edf.org/documents/3566_AbruptClimateChange.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.edf.org/documents/3566_AbruptClimateChange.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.edf.org/documents/3566_AbruptClimateChange.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2512 --><br />
The two most likely reactions to a sudden drop in carrying capacity due to climate change are defensive and offensive. The United States and Australia are likely to build defensive fortresses around their countries because they have the resources and reserves to achieve self-sufficiency. With diverse growing climates, wealth, technology, and abundant resources, the United States could likely survive shortened growing cycles and harsh weather conditions without catastrophic losses. Borders will be strengthened around the country to hold back unwanted starving immigrants from the Caribbean islands (an especially severe problem), Mexico, and South America. Energy supply will be shored up through expensive (economically, politically, and morally) alternatives such as nuclear, renewables, hydrogen, and Middle Eastern contracts. Pesky skirmishes over fishing rights, agricultural support, and disaster relief will be commonplace. Tension between the U.S. and Mexico rise as the U.S. reneges on the 1944 treaty that guarantees water flow from the Colorado River. Relief workers will be commissioned to respond to flooding along the southern part of the east coast and much drier conditions inland. Yet, even in this continuous state of emergency the U.S. will be positioned well compared to others. The intractable problem facing the nation will be calming the mounting military tension around the world. As famine, disease, and weather-related disasters strike due to the abrupt climate change, many countries’ needs will exceed their carrying capacity. This will create a sense of desperation, which is likely to lead to offensive aggression in order to reclaim balance. Imagine eastern European countries, struggling to feed their populations with a falling supply of food, water, and energy, eyeing Russia, whose population is already in decline, for access to its grain, minerals, and energy supply. Or, picture Japan, suffering from flooding along its coastal cities and contamination of its fresh water supply, eying Russia’s Sakhalin Island oil and gas reserves as an energy source to power desalination plants and energy-intensive agricultural processes. Envision Pakistan, India, and China – all armed with nuclear weapons – skirmishing at their borders over refugees, access to shared rivers, and arable land. Spanish and Portuguese fishermen might fight over fishing rights – leading to conflicts at sea. And, countries including the United States would be likely to better secure their borders.With over 200 river basins touching multiple nations, we can expect conflict over access to water for drinking, irrigation, and transportation. The Danube touches twelve nations, the Nile runs though nine, and the Amazon runs through seven. In this scenario, we can expect alliances of convenience. The United States and Canada may become one, simplifying border controls. Or, Canada might keep its hydropower—causing energy problems in the US. North and South Korea may align to create one technically savvy and nuclear-armed entity. Europe may act as a unified block – curbing immigration problems between European nations – and allowing for protection against aggressors. Russia, with its abundant minerals, oil, and natural gas may join Europe. In this world of warring states, nuclear arms proliferation is inevitable. As cooling drives up demand, existing hydrocarbon supplies are stretched thin. With a scarcity of energy supply – and a growing need for access -- nuclear energy will become a critical source of power, and this will accelerate nuclear proliferation as countries develop enrichment and reprocessing capabilities to ensure their national security. China, India, Pakistan, Japan, South Korea, Great Britain, France, and Germany will all have nuclear weapons capability, as will Israel, Iran, Egypt, and North Korea. Managing the military and political tension, occasional skirmishes, and threat of war will be a challenge. Countries such as Japan, that have a great deal of social cohesion (meaning the government is able to effectively engage its population in changing behavior) are most likely to fair well. Countries whose diversity already produces conflict, such as India, South Africa and Indonesia, will have trouble maintaining order. Adaptability and access to resources will be key. Perhaps the most frustrating challenge abrupt climate change will pose is that we’ll never know how far we are into the climate change scenario and how many more years – 10, 100, 1000 --- remain before some kind of return to warmer conditions as the thermohaline circulation starts up again. When carrying capacity drops suddenly, civilization is faced with new challenges that today seem unimaginable.<br />

<strong>Now is the key time for Obama to assert leadership on climate change</strong><br />
<strong>New York Times, 6-22</strong>- John M. Broder, June 22, 2011, “Gore Criticizes Obama for Record on Climate”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2513:http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/science/earth/23gore.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/science/earth/23gore.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/science/earth/23gore.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2513 --><br />
Former Vice President Al Gore sharply criticized President Obama as lacking leadership on climate change in a magazine essay published online Wednesday, saying his policies had been little more effective than those of President George W. Bush. Related in Opinion In the 7,000-word article in Rolling Stone, Mr. Gore said that Mr. Obama clearly understood the threat to the planet posed by global warming and that he had appointed a number of committed environmental advocates to key positions. But Mr. Gore said that in the face of well-financed attacks from fossil fuel industries and denial and delay from Republicans in Congress, Mr. Obama had failed to act decisively to alter the nation’s policies on climate change and energy. Addressing climate change on national and international levels will require forceful American leadership, Mr. Gore said. “Yet President Obama has never presented to the American people the magnitude of the climate crisis,” he wrote. “He has simply not made the case for action. He has not defended the science against the ongoing, withering and dishonest attacks. Nor has he provided a presidential venue for the scientific community — including our own National Academy — to bring the reality of the science before the public.” A White House spokesman defended Mr. Obama’s record in a written statement. “The president has been clear since Day 1 that climate change poses a threat domestically and globally, and under his leadership we have taken the most aggressive steps in our country’s history to tackle this challenge,” said Clark Stevens, a White House press officer. Under Mr. Obama, Mr. Stevens said, the United States has spent billions of dollars on clean-energy technology, imposed tough new emissions standards for cars and trucks and taken the lead in international talks on climate change. Mr. Gore’s extended outburst of frustration signals a public turning point for him, and perhaps for other environmental advocates who have been quietly seething for months over what they view as the administration’s timidity. Mr. Gore, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize for his climate advocacy, praised some of the president’s actions, including the new vehicle standards and the investments in green technology. But in recent months he has told friends that the president has been too passive on climate change and has not been sufficiently supportive of Lisa P. Jackson, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who has tried to advance greenhouse gas regulation against stiff Congressional opposition. Much of Mr. Gore’s essay is devoted to criticism of the news media as failing to report accurately on the scientific consensus that climate change is real and that it is most likely caused by human activities. He said the media had been cowed by an aggressive lobbying and public relations campaign financed by the oil, gas and coal industries, or had presented ideological entertainment in the guise of news reporting. Mr. Obama has tried to move the country away from fossil fuels, and has made the connection between oil imports and national security, Mr. Gore wrote. “But in spite of these and other achievements, President Obama has thus far failed to use the bully pulpit to make the case for bold action on climate change,” he said. “After successfully passing his green stimulus package, he did nothing to defend it when Congress decimated its funding. After the House passed cap and trade, he did little to make passage in the Senate a priority.” Paul Bledsoe, a former energy aide in the Clinton White House and now senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said: “I entirely disagree with Gore here. Obama has consistently made a compelling case for climate action based on the science and has fought in Congress and internationally for robust policies to cut emissions and promote clean energy. The administration’s failing on climate has in fact been political.” Mr. Gore also turned to public officials of both parties. “Many politicians, unfortunately, also fall into the same two categories: those who cheerlead for the deniers and those who cower before them,” he wrote. “The latter group now includes several candidates for the Republican presidential nomination who have felt it necessary to abandon their previous support for action on the climate crisis; at least one has been apologizing profusely to the deniers and begging for their forgiveness.” Mr. Gore does not name them, but Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts; Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former governor of Utah and ambassador to China; and Tim Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota, have backtracked on their support for state and federal action to address global warming. Near the end of the article, Mr. Gore acknowledged that he might be hobbling a president trying to do the right thing in a difficult environment. “All of his supporters understand that it would be self-defeating to weaken Obama and heighten the risk of another step backward,” he wrote. But he said he felt compelled to speak out because the stakes were incalculable. “The climate crisis, in reality, is a struggle for the soul of America,” Mr. Gore concluded, using the voice of prophet and teacher that he has assumed on this topic for more than 20 years. “It is about whether or not we are still capable — given the ill health of our democracy and the current dominance of wealth over reason — of perceiving important and complex realities clearly enough to promote and protect the sustainable well-being of the many. What hangs in the balance is the future of civilization as we know it.”<br />

<strong>Earth Observation satellites key to US environmental leadership- near-term support key to long-term credibility</strong><br />

Finally, the third challenge relates to the collection of environmental data through earth observation satellites. Global concern with climate change makes the sacrifice of earth observation to support human space exploration a very unappealing option. Further, the United States has already committed to a bold leadership role with the July 2003 launch, by former secretary of state Colin Powell and current National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) administrator VADM Conrad Lautenbacher (USN, ret.), of a worldwide effort to build the Global Earth Observation System of Systems. If we establish an organization to create a system like GEOSS and then immediately fail to meet our agreed-on commitments, it will be very difficult indeed to generate future support for international projects, and as a consequence, our basic ability to lead in other space-related areas—especially returning to the Moon—will be greatly compromised. Historically, the way that NASA has dealt with such competing priorities is through the senseless cannibalism of one project after another. This may not, however, currently be an option. On one hand, the broad, bipartisan support for a national vision of space exploration and the immediate interest should encourage solid, robust support for human space exploration; on the other hand, the growing concern of global climate change necessitates full support of earth observation. In these space leadership challenges, failure to provide near-term support will immediately erode our credibility, while in the longer term, our leadership role is at great risk.<br />

Will Obama Meet New Standards?<br />
Even with these goals and very early achievements it is unclear if the overall “political will”, no matter how different from the last eight years, is sufficient to tackle the challenges of global environmental change, particularly when the will of the presidential administration may not be enough. There are many representatives who do not share Obama’s enthusiasm for environmental issues. As pointed out previously, there have already been compromises made that have decreased funding for environmental initiatives. The American people can help by not letting the environmental agenda once again take a back seat, though only time will tell just how strong the will and influence of the Obama administration is. Opportunity for Leadership in Copenhagen The U.S. is the world superpower. I argue that the latest world economic troubles only serve to accentuate the extent to which this is true, as economies of the world are suffering due to the domino effect triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market. The Kyoto treaty was only a piece of paper without the U.S. on board. The other major polluting nations such as China and India will not take the problem of global environmental change seriously until America does. Copenhagen is a chance to right the ship before it is too late. Our nation is just as capable of steering the ship in the right direction as it is in the wrong direction. This means allowing Earth to take the helm, and remembering humanity adapts to her, not her to humanity. Update: Copenhagen; What happened? Dissapointment seems to be the predominant reaction from environmental organizations to the Copenhagen Climate Summit. Indeed, no binding agreement, or even a pledge to make a binding agreement in 2010 was achieved. This was not, however, the true test of the Obama administration's environmental policy. The real test is whether Obama can get a legitimate climate bill through the Senate. U.S. environmental leadership can still be the beacon it needs to be with a strong message from our lawmakers.<br />

<strong>Environmental leadership is the crucial determinant of US primacy—more important than power projection or force posture</strong><br />

Dramatic events such as the end of the Cold War, the turn of the century, and now a new presidency offer opportunities for the United States to reconsider its national security policy.[1] The notion that the focus should be limited to defending against an emerging peer competitor or rogue state is flawed, however, and current analyses of emerging threats are generally too narrowly defined. Internal regional strife, not power-projecting challengers to US primacy, will likely spark the crises of the 21st century for which US strategy must be prepared. A tidal wave of public outcry over the deteriorating state of regional economies and the global environment is rushing toward the shores of the world's most powerful nations. In an era in which there are few imminent threats to US security, government as well as corporate leaders praise the superpower status of our nation. In such times it is not surprising that labor and environmental reform issues are often placed on the back burner. Nevertheless, these are the issues that will take center stage in the coming decades. From its current position of vast global power, the United States can either choose to meet this challenge head on, or be overcome by it. My intent is not to dismiss the current theories of strategy, but rather to add to them. Four such strategies (and many variations on these) compete for relevancy in the current public debate: neo-isolationism, selective engagement, cooperative security, and primacy.[2] The implications of each are normally outlined in a traditional analysis of foreign affairs in which there exists a constant competition for power between states. Although this tradition continues, the real danger the world now faces &quot;stem[s] not from conflicts between countries but from conflicts within them.&quot;[3] Such internal strife over distribution of wealth, labor inequality, scarcity of resources, and declining environmental conditions will spill over into neighboring states, creating chaos. The new grand strategy of the United States, therefore, needs to respond to regional internal weaknesses, not to the external strengths of perceived rogue and competitor states. [continues] With the rising inequality brought on by globalization comes a torrent of economic, labor, and environmental problems which, if left unchallenged, will fuel the fires of regional crisis in the 21st century. For the global market to survive, nations need to collectively establish and maintain economic, labor, and environmental policies that provide for the common good. Such standards also need to be collectively enforced with the same zeal as is currently reserved for defense against armed attack. In the eyes of the world, American leadership diminishes every time we choose not to act upon a potentially devastating human crisis. To the contrary, successful actions in support of regional economic and environmental well-being bolster confidence in American leadership at home and abroad. Further, immediate action today may prevent the wars of tomorrow, especially in those areas where imminent chaos is most pronounced. The United States cannot afford to look away from global economic and environmental despair, saving its strength for the &quot;big fight.&quot; The future US grand strategy, if not entirely based on environmental and economic internationalism, should expand the definition of US interests to include global economic reform and environmental standards enforcement. The greatest danger America faces is neither China nor Iraq. It is indifference to this emerging crisis.<br />

<strong>Second is readiness – Climate change kills it- disrupts electricity grid, energy, military bases and battle ground conditions</strong><br />

Severe weather has a direct effect on military readiness. Ships and aircraft operations are made more difficult; military personnel themselves must evacuate or seek shelter. As Army Gen. Paul Kern explained of his time dealing with hurricanes in the U.S. Southern Command: “A major weather event becomes a distraction from your ability to focus on and execute your military mission.” In addition, U.S. forces may be required to be more engaged in stability operations in the future as climate change causes more frequent weather disasters such as hurricanes, flash floods, and extended droughts. A warming Arctic holds great implications for military operations. The highest levels of planetary warming observed to date have occurred in the Arctic, and projections show the high northern latitudes warming more than any other part of the earth over the coming century. The Arctic, often considered to be the proverbial “canary” in the earth climate system, is showing clear signs of stress [33]. The U.S. Navy is concerned about the retreat and thinning of the ice canopy and its implications for naval operations. A 2001 Navy study concluded that an ice-free Arctic will require an “in creased scope of naval operations” [35]. That increased scope of operations will require the Navy to consider weapon system effectiveness and various other factors associated with operating in this environment. Additionally, an Arctic with less sea ice could bring more competition for resources, as well as more commercial and military activity that could further threaten an already fragile ecosystem. The DoD is almost completely dependent on electricity from the national grid to power critical missions at fixed installations and on petroleum to sustain combat training and operations. Both sources of energy and their distribution systems are susceptible to damage from extreme weather. The national electric grid is fragile and can be easily disrupted. Witness the Northeast Blackout of 2003, which was caused by trees falling onto power lines in Ohio. It affected 50 million people in eight states and Canada, took days to restore, and caused a financial loss in the United States estimated to be between $4 billion and $10 billion [36]. People lost water supplies, transportation systems, and communications systems (including Internet and cell phones). Factories shut down, and looting occurred. As extreme weather events becomes more common, so do the threats to our national electricity supply. One approach to securing power to DoD installations for critical missions involves a combination of aggressively applying energy efficiency technologies to reduce the critical load (more mission, less energy); deploying renewable energy sources; and “islanding” the installation from the national grid. Islanding allows power generated on the installations to flow two ways—onto the grid when there is excess production and from the grid when the load exceeds local generation. By pursuing these actions to improve resiliency of mission, DoD would become an early adopter of technologies that would help transform the grid, reduce our load, and expand the use of renewable energy. For deployed systems, the DoD pays a high price for high fuel demand. In Iraq, significant combat forces are dedicated to moving fuel and protecting fuel supply lines. The fuel delivery situation on the ground in Iraq is so limited As extreme weather events becomes more common, so do the threats to our national electricity supply that that the Army has established a “Power Surety Task Force” to help commanders of forward operating bases cut the number of fuel convoys by using energy more efficiently. Maj. Gen. Richard Zilmer, USMC, commander of the multinational force in the Anbar province of Iraq, asked for help in August 2006. His request was for renewable energy systems. According to Gen. Zilmer, “reducing the military’s dependence on fuel for power generation could reduce the number of road-bound convoys … ‘Without this solution [renewable energy systems], personnel loss rates are likely to continue at their current rate. Continued casualty accumulation exhibits potential to jeopardize mission success.…’ ” Along a similar vein, Lt. Gen. James Mattis, while commanding general of the First Marine Division during Operation Iraqi Freedom, urged: “Unleash us from the tether of fuel.” Energy-efficiency technologies, energy conservation practices and renewable energy sources are the tools forward bases are using to stem their fuel demand and reduce the “target signature” of their fuel convoys. Numerous DoD studies dating from the 2001 Defense Science Board report “More Capable Warfighting Through Reduced Fuel Burden” have concluded that high fuel demand by combat forces detracts from our combat capability, makes our forces more vulnerable, diverts combat assets from offense to supply line protection, and increases operating costs. Nowhere are these problems more evident than in Iraq, where every day 2.4 million gallons of fuel is moved through dangerous territory, requiring protection by armored combat vehicles and attack helicopters [37]. DoD planners estimate that it costs $15 to deliver one gallon of fuel from its commercial supplier to the forward edge of the battlefield and about $26 to deliver a gallon of fuel from an airborne tanker, not counting the tanker aircraft cost. Furthermore, DoD’s procedures for determining the types of systems it needs do not take these fuel burden considerations into account. DoD should require more efficient combat systems and should include the actual cost of delivering fuel when evaluating the advantages of investments in efficiency [38, 39]. DoD should have an incentive to accurately account for the cost of moving and protecting fuel and to invest in technologies that will provide combat power more efficiently. Deploying technologies that make our forces more efficient also reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting technologies would make a significant contribution to the vision President Bush expressed in his State of the Union speech when he said, “America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will … help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change.” Given the human and economic cost of delivering fuel to combat forces and the almost total dependence on the electric grid for critical missions, DoD has strong operational economic incentives to aggressively pursue energy efficiency in its combat systems and its installations. By investing at levels commensurate with its interests, DoD would become an early adopter of innovative technologies and could stimulate others to follow. Climate change threats also create opportunities for constructive engagement such as stability operations and capacity building. The U.S. military helped deliver relief to the victims of ... reducing the military’s dependence on fuel for power generation could reduce the number of road-bound convoys … 41 the 2005 Indian Ocean tsunami because it is the only institution capable of rapidly delivering personnel and materiel anywhere in the world on relatively short notice. DoD Directive 3000.05, issued in 2006, provides the mandate to conduct military and civilian stability operations in peacetime as well as conflict to maintain order in states and regions. The Com-batant Command’s Theater Security Cooperation Program, which seeks to engage regional states, could be easily focused on climate change mitigation and executed in concert with other U.S. agencies through U.S. embassy country teams. The objective would be to build the host nation military’s capabilities and capacity to support civilian government agencies. It also enhances good governance and promotes stability, making failed states and terrorist incursion less likely. Because many climate change problems cross borders, it could also promote regional communication and cooperation. If the frequency of natural disasters increases with climate change, future military and political leaders may face hard choices about where and when to engage. Deploying troops affects readiness elsewhere; choosing not to may affect alliances. And providing aid in the aftermath of a catastrophic event or natural disaster can help retain stability in a nation or region, which in turn could head off U.S. military engagement in that region at a later date.<br />

<strong>Loss of U.S. hegemony causes nuclear wars around the globe</strong><br />

The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying — its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War II would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe’s stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that ’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world ’s great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China ’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe — if it adopted what some call a strategy of “offshore balancing” — this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, “offshore” role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel ’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn ’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn ’t changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.<br />

<strong>CLARREO ensures accurate data and guarantees successful adaptation</strong><br />
<strong>Madigan 11</strong> – Jay Madigan, Senior Engineer and Web Development - Science Programmer at SSAI /NASA, 03/15/2011, “Societal Benefits,” online: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2519:http://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/about-SocietalBenefits.php --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/about-SocietalBenefits.php" rel="nofollow">http://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/about-SocietalBenefits.php</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2519 --><br />
In 2007, the National Research Council (NRC) conducted a survey of Earth science and its applications from space, identifying key scientific questions and societal objectives on which to focus Earth observations beginning in 2005. The Council organized the science missions into three time-phased tiers, identifying the mission(s) most appropriate to answer key science questions and address societal objectives. In addition to the NRC’s Decadal Survey, a summary of the policy documents that support the science goals of the CLARREO mission can be found here. Selected as a high-priority, tier one mission, the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) is a climate mission that will bring revolutionary accuracy to climate measurement—and provide a global benchmark measurement for conclusively determining long-term climate trends. The urgency for CLARREO results from the growing need for higher accuracy, long-term climate change observations than current instruments are capable of providing. Data from CLARREO will dramatically increase how accurately we define the real climate future that society faces—and assist policy makers in formulating more informed decisions about how to respond. The timing of the CLARREO mission is a result of recent advances in a wide range of scientific, measurement, and technological areas. These advances combine to enable CLARREO to be a completely new type of climate mission: a mission focused on accuracy at decade time scales. Because CLARREO measurements will cover the majority of the solar and infrared spectrum, CLARREO will provide this accuracy for most of the climate variables essential for assessing climate change, greatly expanding the uses of existing space-based data sets for societal benefit. Previous Earth science missions have focused on providing data for one aspect of the climate system such as clouds or aerosols. CLARREO will provide a global perspective of climate change, becoming the first mission to collect data that provide a single and highly accurate view of the entire climate system. By obtaining this global view, CLARREO will be used by climate modelers and decision makers to accurately predict climate change and to develop intelligent plans and methods to minimize and adapt to it. Kevin Brown, CLARREO Project Manager who is leading the CLARREO mission states, “The integrity of CLARREO measurements and their ability to accurately portray the Earth’s climate on a global scale, allows for greater confidence in policy derived from CLARREO observations.” CLARREO differs from other satellites because its measurements are tied to internationally-recognized standards, the same type of rigorously-tested standards used by National Metrology Institutes to determine the temperature of a material or length of a second. Using these international standards, measurements from CLARREO, as well as other satellites, may be pooled into one long-term observational record that is free from small drifts in measurements due to slight differences between satellites. This allows scientists to test the satellite observations for small errors that mirror the variability of the climate itself. Testing for these errors provides for a clear interpretation of measurement trends, greatly enhancing confidence in the data’s accuracy.<br />

CLARREO is a Highly Leveraged Interdisciplinary Climate Change Mission • Accurate decadal-length records are essential for climate change detection, attribution, and for testing climate prediction accuracy. They represent the most critical test of uncertainty in future climate change prediction. • While process study missions (e.g. CALIPSO/CloudSat) are critical to improve underlying climate model physics (e.g. clouds), decadal change observations are critical to determine the impact of those climate model improvements on the accuracy of predicting future climate change. Both elements are critical, and CLARREO is the major Decadal Study mission addressing serious accuracy issues in decadal climate change observation. • The CLARREO mission is unique in its broad interdisciplinary impact on climate change science: the other NRC Decadal Survey missions are primarily focused on one climate process or discipline. • CLARREO provides new solar reflected and infrared emitted high spectral resolution benchmark radiance climate data records that can be used to test climate model predictions, improve climate change fingerprinting, and attribution. • CLARREO provides an orbiting calibration observatory that can be used to calibrate other solar and infrared space-borne sensors (e.g. VIIRS, CrIS, Landsat, Geostationary, CERES) and thereby improve to climate accuracy a wide range of sensors across the GEO observing system. It also improves the scientific value of all of these instruments. • Key climate variable decadal records<br />

The ability of this CLARREO mission to calibrate passive sensors on-orbit via SI traceability and to address sampling issues without subsidiary information is a notable departure from the current strategy pursued for climate satellite records. The necessity for this departure was recognized by the NRC as follows: NRC Objective: Global Benchmark Climate Record Benchmark Observations: What are they? The NRC Decadal Survey recognized that when the global climate record emerges as a significant contributor to public policy (societal) decisions, that record will be attacked relentlessly. If the climate record cannot stand up to those attacks, the record cannot effectively serve society. Recognition of this led to the requirement that the design of climate observing and monitor-ing systems from space must ensure the establishment of global, long-term climate records, which are of high accuracy, tested for systematic errors on-orbit, and tied to irrefutable standards such as those maintained in the U.S. by the National Institute of Standards and Technology For the NRC report, this mission definition was essential for the prioritization process that fully considered scientific/societal impact, cost, ability to complement other systems, degree of readiness, risk mitigation, and contributions to other thematic areas. The ASIC3 report also chose a CLARREO-like mission as one of its high priority recommendations based on similar requirements. Once the context of responsiveness to societal objectives is understood, the path leading all the way to details of instrument design may be defined. A summary of requirements flowdown from high level science requirements to data products to mission and payload requirements for the IR and GPS components is included below.<br />

2) Monitoring and predicting climate change and the impact of mitigation strategies. 3) Stimulating the reinvention of the US air transportation system into an environmentally friendly, safe and energy efficient system. 4) Development of the replacement for the Space Shuttle and continuation of human space exploration. 1) Intelligent, robotic exploration of the solar system and universe There is still the spirit of exploration in much of what NASA does today, no more so than the programs that produce the robotic explorers of the universe. While no one disputes that exploration and discovery in our universe and beyond must remain a key part of NASA, it is a very real question as to how best to achieve the maximum amount of exploration/discovery given real budget, technology and time constraints. Given that human space exploration is massively expensive, one should ask the obvious question, “Should NASA’s continued exploration of the Moon, Mars, and other worlds involve just a handful of humans (astronauts), or should this exploration program be restructured so that it will provide the opportunity for all humans to explore?” Robotic explorers will increasingly provide, through the technologies of machine intelligence, 8 virtual reality, and high bandwidth communication, a near-real-time space exploration experience to all citizens, making everyone a virtual astronaut instead of a privileged few. Further, not requiring the development and fielding of future exploration systems that protect humans from the harsh environment of space will radically reduce the cost and time required to explore other worlds. With current projections showing that machine intelligence will begin to rival human intelligence by the beginning of the third decade of this century, the argument that human intelligence is required as the primary emphasis in space exploration is greatly diminished. Impact on Innovation &amp; Competitiveness: Information technology will be a key driver of the 21st century economy including the rapid advancement in machine intelligence and communication bandwidth. Focusing NASA on robotic space exploration will create investments in both of these key areas as the agency strives to build ever more intelligent robots that can explore autonomously and send vast quantities of data back to earth. In fact, the demands of robotic space exploration will serve to accelerate the development of machine intelligence and provide that critical early adoption of each succeeding generation of machine needed to spur its introduction into commerce. This approach to exploration will serve to solidify the US’s global leadership in the development and commercialization of these key technologies. 2) Monitoring and predicting climate change and the impact of mitigation strategies Climate change is likely to be a dominating global issue for the rest of this century. NASA’s Earth science program is already the global leader in the measurement and prediction of climate change. The focus of climate change science/studies is now shifting to better prediction of its evolution and impacts, and developing and monitoring effective mitigation strategies. NASA must next be challenged with dramatically improving its climate prediction capability as well as taking on the new challenge of accurately predicting the impacts of climate change on our civilization and the biosphere. Additionally, there are already many speculative proposals for climatechange mitigation strategies which attempt to introduce climate forcing that acts opposite to the greenhouse effect or which attempt to capture or reduce existing greenhouse gases. Given the complex feedbacks in the climate system, understanding the possible unintended consequences of such mitigation strategies will become more important Impact on Innovation &amp; Competitiveness: NASA is uniquely positioned to take on this challenge of predicting the efficacy of potential mitigation strategies and monitoring their effectiveness once implemented. Innovation will be supported by the development of enormous supercomputing resources needed to both crunch data, and also to model the earth’s climate and atmosphere. Given the massive amounts of national and international wealth that may be invested in mitigation strategies, global competitiveness will either be harmed or advanced by shifting budgetary resources to deal with global warming, or saving those expenditures if little action is warranted. 9<br />
Taking on such a role will provide the US a global leadership position in this most vital effort of our civilization for the remainder of the century<br />

<strong>The current Outer Space Treaty contains a loophole that allows for the testing and development of weapons in space. Countries only need to say it’s for “defensive” purposes.</strong><br />
<strong>Krishnaswamy 2011</strong> Wednesday, January 19, , 22:00 [IST]A A A Free Newsletter Sign up New Delhi, Jan 19 (ANI): Former Air Chief S. Krishnaswamy (Air Marshal retired) on Wednesday stressed on the need to plug holes in the 'Outer Space Treaty' of the United Nations to prevent space from being used to attack targets.- Plug holes in UN 'Outer Space Treaty<br />
&quot;India would like to appeal to international community to see that the holes (in the Outer Space Treaty) must be plugged,&quot; Krishnaswamy said, while delivering the keynote address at an international conference on 'Space, Science and Security: The Role of Regional Expert Discussion. &quot;We also need a strong policing force in the UN. If somebody crosses the line, we need to bring down quickly,&quot; he told the three-day conference organised by Observer Research Foundation, Secure World Foundation, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and the Jawaharlal Nehru University. Krishnaswamy said: &quot;the authors of the treaty have left some gaps in the treaty. And probably with a sense of purpose. After all, law is very clever.&quot; &quot; The treaty also allows testing of all weapons in space and floating military bases. And also, there is no ban on anti-satellite, anti-missile weapons as the treaty says outer space is free for all nation states,&quot; Krishnaswamy said. &quot;We all should get together and work for peaceful use of space,&quot; he told the conference attended by delegates from the US, Australia, Switzerland, Israel and other countries.<br />

<strong>China and US space fight happening now- other countries joining the arms race</strong><br />

In 2007, China shot an obsolete weather satellite with a ground missile, creating so much space junk that crew members on the International Space Station had to change orbit to avert a collision last year. Schulte said in his remarks that U.S. concerns had prompted U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates to seek to include space in stability talks being pursued with the Chinese. The official said China's capabilities were going beyond shooting at spacecraft. Beijing's counter-space activities include jamming satellite signals. It is also in the process of developing directed energy weapons that emit a disabling burst of energy toward a target rather than firing a projectile at it. Other countries believed to be developing counter-space technology include Iran and Ethiopia. Diplomatic cables distributed by WikiLeaks and published by the British Daily Telegraph newspaper said that the United States and China had engaged in a show of military strength in space by testing anti-satellite weapons on their own satellites on separate occasions. The memos feature more than 500 leaked cables that detail the fears of the countries as they race to gain supremacy in space.<br />

A decision to deploy space weapons would not face many constraints, whether technological or legal. After years of development, the technology required for space weapons is now feasible, albeit still expensive. Both the US and Russia have the capability to deploy advanced space weapons in a matter of years. Several other nations have the capability to launch lower technology space weapons in a similar timeframe. The Reagan and Bush I administrations funded, on the order of ten billion dollars, a variety of initiatives which laid the groundwork for contemporary space weapons systems. As a result, the development and deployment of space weapons, is no longer a technological challenge, but a question of political will. The legal framework governing space weapons is minimal. The only explicit rules regarding space weapons are those prohibiting conventional weapons on celestial bodies and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in space. Conventional space weapons are therefore legal as long as they are based on a satellite rather than the moon. The legal framework has been further weakened by the abolition of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Law is therefore no obstacle to deployment. At the same time as the technological and legal constraints on deployment are abating, the incentives are mounting. The critical role that space has become to play, in both civil and military activity, has created the potential for future conflict. The US military is now dependent on space assets to wage its preferred style of war. Perhaps even more important, the economic benefits of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and other space-based technologies gives the US and other countries a substantial interest in maintaining, protecting, and augmenting those assets. Discord between peer competitors, such as the one surrounding Galileo, the European satellite navigation system, are seen by some as early seeds of greater conflict. Other conflicts have arisen due to differences of opinion over the distribution of reconnaissance data and in controversies over the use of radio spectra. The effect of all these developments is that space policy is being increasingly securitised and framed as a core national interest. Against the backdrop of waning constraints and rising incentives, it is no surprise that political will is emerging. There have recently been prominent voices within the US military (US Space Command Master Plan 2001 and Air Force 2025) and political (Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Operations, Rumsfeld, 2000) leadership in favour of considering the acquisition of space weapons. In the US military document ‘Vision 2020’, for instance, it is argued that the United States should seek capacity to operate freely within all technological domains of land, sea, air, space, and information. A decision on deployment could therefore be impending.<br />
<br />
<strong>And, that weaponization won’t benefit the United Sates. Other countries are developing counter-abilities to challenge space dominance.</strong><br />

The increasing militarization of space is not exclusively a superpower story, however. The United States certainly dominates military space spending—accounting for more than 90 percent of the total, by some measures. The country's military space budget totals exceed $15 billion a year. But other countries besides the United States and Russia have also increasingly sought military satellites, largely for reconnaissance and communications purposes so far, and will surely continue to pursue space capabilities of many types in the future. They may make use of civilian and commercial assets for military purposes as well. They are surely studying American capabilities to find, track, and quickly attack targets using space assets. Some are trying to emulate the United States; some are trying to find vulnerabilities in U.S. space systems so they can challenge them in any future wars. China may be the most notable example of a country that is doing both. Its progress to date is limited, as far as we can tell, and its progress in the coming years is likely to be modest as well—but these prognostications may prove wrong, and in any case will not be applicable forever.<br />
<br />
<strong>Scenario One: Arms Race</strong><br />
<strong>Weaponization of space sparks a massive arms race making war inevitable.</strong><br />
<strong>Malik 2004</strong> Tariq Malik, journalist, “Think Tank Warns Against Space Weapons Systems,” SPACE.COM, January 22, 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.space.com/news/weaponized_space_040122.html" rel="nofollow">www.space.com/news/weaponized_space_040122.html</a><br />
Satellites orbiting high above Earth are a crucial resource for the U.S. military in terms of communications, reconnaissance and global positioning. But a new report warns that too much of a space military presence, mainly the use of space-based weapons systems, may inevitably cause more problems than they're meant to solve. Should the U.S. military &quot;weaponize&quot; space, the report states, it will most likely be affect global commerce, weaken American ties with other nations and eventually lead to space weapons proliferation as other groups develop countermeasures or their own space weapons systems. The study, called Space Assurance or Space Domination? The Case Against Weaponizing Space , was released by the Henry L. Stimson Center, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank aimed at enhancing international peace and security. <strong>&quot;</strong>When you weaponize space, you invite company,&quot; said Michael Krepon, who wrote the report and served as the founding president of the Stimson Center. &quot;When we go first, others will come second. That is an absolute certainty.&quot; Once killer satellites start destroying one another above Earth, they will cause space debris that could harm benign satellites used by civilian agencies and companies around the world, which in turn affects global economy, according to the Stimson report. If other nations or groups choose not to put their own space weapons in orbit, they could develop ground-based countermeasures like electronic jamming or spoofing devices to confuse U.S. machines. A ballistic missile could disable satellites in low-earth orbit by detonating a nuclear device, subjecting any ground troops relying intelligence from those satellites to possible attack, the study noted.<br />

<strong>A war in space would paralyze our military, destroy the global economic system, and cause accidental nuclear exchange.</strong><br />
<strong>Myers 2008</strong> (Steven lee, writer for the New York Times, “Look Out Below. The Arms Race in Space May Be On.” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2524:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/weekinreview/09myers.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Space+War&amp;st=nyt --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/weekinreview/09myers.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Space+War&amp;st=nyt" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/weekinreview/09myers.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Space+War&amp;st=nyt</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2524 -->)<br />
IT doesn't take much imagination to realize how badly war in space could unfold. An enemy -- say, China in a confrontation over Taiwan, or Iran staring down America over the Iranian nuclear program -- could knock out the American satellite system in a barrage of antisatellite weapons, instantly paralyzing American troops, planes and ships around the world. Space itself could be polluted for decades to come, rendered unusable. The global economic system would probably collapse, along with air travel and communications. Your cellphone wouldn't work. Nor would your A.T.M. and that dashboard navigational gizmo you got for Christmas. And preventing an accidental nuclear exchange could become much more difficult. ''The fallout, if you will, could be tremendous,'' said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. The consequences of war in space are in fact so cataclysmic that arms control advocates like Mr. Kimball would like simply to prohibit the use of weapons beyond the earth's atmosphere. But it may already be too late for that. In the weeks since an American rocket slammed into an out-of-control satellite over the Pacific Ocean, officials and experts have made it clear that the United States, for better or worse, is already committed to having the capacity to wage war in space. And that, it seems likely, will prompt others to keep pace. What makes people want to ban war in space is exactly what keeps the Pentagon's war planners busy preparing for it: The United States has become so dependent on space that it has become the country's Achilles' heel. ''Our adversaries understand our dependence upon space-based capabilities,'' Gen. Kevin P. Chilton, commander of the United States Strategic Command, wrote in Congressional testimony on Feb. 27, ''and we must be ready to detect, track, characterize, attribute, predict and respond to any threat to our space infrastructure.'' Whatever Pentagon assurances there have been to the contrary, the destruction of a satellite more than 130 miles above the Pacific Ocean a week earlier, on Feb. 20, was an extraordinary display of what General Chilton had in mind -- a capacity that the Pentagon under President Bush has tenaciously sought to protect and enlarge. Is war in space inevitable? The idea or such a war has been around since Sputnik, but for most of the cold war it remained safely within the realm of science fiction and the carefully proscribed American-Soviet arms race. That is changing. A dozen countries now can reach space with satellites -- and, therefore, with weapons. China strutted its stuff in January 2007 by shooting down one of its own weather satellites 530 miles above the planet. ''The first era of the space age was one of experimentation and discovery,'' a Congressional commission reported just before President Bush took office in 2001. ''We are now on the threshold of a new era of the space age, devoted to mastering operations in space.'' One of the authors of that report was Mr. Bush's first defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, and the policy it recommended became a tenet of American policy: The United States should develop ''new military capabilities for operation to, from, in and through space.'' Technology, too, has become an enemy of peace in space. Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative was considered so fantastical by its critics 25 years ago that it was known as ''Star Wars.'' But the programs Mr. Reagan began were the ancestors of the weaponry that brought down the American satellite. The Chinese strike, and now the Pentagon's, have given ammunition to both sides of the debate over war in orbit. Arms control advocates say the bull's-eyes underscore the need to expand the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which the United States and 90 other countries have ratified. It bans the use of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on the Moon. Space, in this view, should remain a place for exploration and research, not humanity's destructive side. The grim potential of the latter was hinted at by the vast field of debris that China's test left, posing a threat to any passing satellite or space ship. (The Pentagon said its own shot, at a lower altitude, would not have the same effect -- the debris would fall to earth and burn up.) The risk posed by space junk was the main reason the United States and Soviet Union abandoned antisatellite tests in the 1980's.<br />

Rauscher commented on HAARP. &quot;You're pumping tremendous energy into an extremely delicate molecular configuration that comprises these multi-layers we call the ionosphere.&quot; &quot;The ionosphere is prone to catalytic reactions,&quot; she explained, &quot;if a small part is changed, a major change in the ionosphere can happen.&quot; In describing the ionosphere as a delicately balanced system, Dr. Rauscher shared her mental picture of it -- a soap-bubble-like sphere surrounding Earth's atmosphere, with movements swirling over the surface of the bubble. If a big enough hole is punched through it, she predicts, it could pop. Slicing the Ionosphere Physicist Daniel Winter, Ph.D., of Waynesville, North Carolina, says, &quot;HAARP high-frequency emissions can couple with longwave (extremely-low-frequency, or ELF) pulses the Earth grid uses to distribute information as vibrations to synchronize dances of life in the biosphere.&quot; Dan terms this geomagnetic action 'Earth's information bloodstream,' and says it is likely that coupling of HAARP HF (high-frequency) with natural ELF can cause unplanned, unsuspected side effects. David Yarrow of Albany, New York, is a researcher with a background in electronics. He described possible interactions of HAARP radiation with the ionosphere and Earth's magnetic grid: &quot;HAARP will not burn holes in the ionosphere. That is a dangerous understatement of what HAARP's giant gigawatt beam will do. Earth is spinning relative to thin electric shells of the multilayer membrane of ion-o-speres that absorb and shield Earth's surface from intense solar radiation, including charged particle storms in solar winds erupting from the sun. Earth's axial spin means that HAARP -- in a burst lasting more than a few minutes -- will slice through the ionosphere like a microwave knife. This produces not a hole but a long tear -- an incision.&quot; Crudely Plucking the Strings Second concept: As Earth rotates, HAARP will slice across the geomagnetic flux<strong>,</strong> a donut-shaped spool of magnetic strings -- like longitude meridians on maps. HAARP may not 'cut' these strings in Gaia's magnetic mantle, but will pulse each thread with harsh, out-of-harmony high frequencies. These noisy impulses will vibrate geomagnetic flux lines, sending vibrations all through the geomagnetic web. &quot;&quot;The image comes to mind of a spider on its web. An insect lands, and the web's vibrations alert the spider to possible prey. HAARP will be a man-made microwave finger poking at the web, sending out confusing signals, if not tearing holes in the threads. &quot; &quot;Effects of this interference with symphonies of Gaia's geomagnetic harp are unknown, and I suspect barely thought of. Even if thought of, the intent (of HAARP) is to learn to exploit any effects, not to play in tune to global symphonies. &quot; Among other researchers quoted is Paul Schaefer of Kansas City. His degree is in electrical engineering and he spent four years building nuclear weapons. &quot;But most of the theories that we have been taught by scientists to believe in seem to be falling apart,&quot; he says. He talks about imbalances already caused by the industrial and atomic age, especially by radiation of large numbers of tiny, high-velocity particles &quot;like very small spinning tops&quot; into our environment. The unnatural level of motion of highly-energetic particles in the atmosphere and in radiation belts surrounding Earth is the villain in the weather disruptions, according to this model, which describes an Earth discharging its buildup of heat, relieving stress and regaining a balanced condition through earthquakes and volcanic action. Feverish Earth&quot; One might compare the abnormal energetic state of the Earth and its atmosphere to a car battery which has become overcharged with the normal flow of energy jammed up, resulting in hot spots, electrical arcing, physical cracks and general turbulence as the pent-up energy tries to find some place to go.&quot; In a second analogy, Schaefer says &quot;Unless we desire the death of our planet, we must end the production of unstable particles which are generating the earth's fever. A first priority to prevent this disaster would be to shut down all nuclear power plants and end the testing of atomic weapons, electronic warfare and 'Star Wars'.&quot; Meanwhile, the military builds its biggest ionospheric heater yet, to deliberately create more instabilities in a huge plasma layer -- the ionosphere -- and to rev up the energy level of charged particles. HAARP zaps the ionosphere where it is relatively unstable. A point to remember is that the ionosphere is an active electrical shield protecting the planet from the constant bombardment of high-energy particles from space. This conducting plasma, along with Earth's magnetic field, traps the electrical plasma of space and holds it back from going directly to the earth's surface, says Charles Yost of Dynamic Systems, Leicester, North Carolina. &quot;If the ionosphere is greatly disturbed, the atmosphere below is subsequently disturbed.&quot; Another scientist interviewed said there is a super-powerful electrical connection between the ionosphere and the part of the atmosphere where our weather comes onstage, the lower atmosphere. One man-made electrical effect -- power line harmonic resonance -- causes fallout of charged particles from the Van Allen (radiation) belts, and the falling ions cause ice crystals (which precipitate rain clouds). What about HAARP? Energy blasted upward from an ionospheric heater is not much compared to the total in the ionosphere, but HAARP documents admit that thousandfold-greater amounts of energy can be released in the ionosphere than injected. As with MacDonald's &quot;key to geophysical warfare,&quot; &quot;nonlinear&quot; effects (described in the literature about the ionospheric heater) mean small input and large output. Astrophysicist Adam Trombly told Manning that an acupuncture model is one way to look at the possible effect of multi-gigawatt pulsing of the ionosphere. If HAARP hits certain points, those parts of the ionosphere could react in surprising ways. Smaller ionospheric heaters such as the one at Arecibo are underneath relatively placid regions of the ionosphere, compared to the dynamic movements nearer Earth's magnetic poles. That adds another uncertainty to HAARP -- the unpredictable and lively upper atmosphere near the North Pole. HAARP experimenters do not impress commonsense Alaskans such as Barbara Zickuhr, who says &quot;They're like boys playing with a sharp stick, finding a sleeping bear and poking it in the butt to see what's going to happen.&quot; Could They Short-Circuit Earth? Earth as a spherical electrical system is a fairly well-accepted model. However, those experimenters who want to make unnatural power connections between parts of this system might not be thinking of possible consequences. Electrical motors and generators can be caused to wobble when their circuits are affected. Could human activities cause a significant change in a planet's electrical circuit or electrical field<strong>?</strong> A paper in the respected journal Science deals with manmade ionization from radioactive material, but perhaps it could also be studied with HAARP-type skybusters in mind: &quot;For example, while changes in the earth's electric field resulting from a solar flare modulating conductivity may have only a barely detectable effect on meteorology, the situation may be different in regard to electric field changes caused by manmade ionization... &quot; Meteorology, of course, is the study of the atmosphere and weather. ionization is what happens when a higher level of power is zapped into atoms and knocks electrons off the atoms. The resulting charged particles are the stuff of HAARP. &quot;One look at the weather should tell us that we are on the wrong path,&quot; says Paul Schaefer, commenting on HAARP-type technologies. Angels Don't Play This HAARP: Advances in Tesla Technology is about the military's plan to manipulate that which belongs to the world -- the ionosphere. The arrogance of the United States government in this is not without precedent.<br />

When chemists Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina first postulated a link between chlorofluorocarbons and ozone layer depletion in 1974, the news was greeted with scepticism, but taken seriously nonetheless. The vast majority of credible scientists have since confirmed this hypothesis. The ozone layer around the Earth shields us all from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Without the ozone layer, life on earth would not exist. Exposure to increased levels of ultraviolet radiation can cause cataracts, skin cancer, and immune system suppression in humans as well as innumerable effects on other living systems. This is why Rowland's and Molina's theory was taken so seriously, so quickly - the stakes are literally the continuation of life on earth<br />

This requires increasing use of space communications system assets for effective management “Ideally EW needs to be centrally planned and directed, and de-centrally executed with the various investments made by the different branches effectively applied in a coordinated fashion,” noted Asif Anwar, ADS Service Director. “To this end, there will be an increase in use of space-based assets to support airborne, naval and ground <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mwjournal.com/BuyersGuide/buyersguide.asp?CatId=114&amp;ref=AutoArticle" rel="nofollow">systems</a> as part of the electromagnetic battlefield management (EMBM) strategy.” “This strategy is already employed by the US Military.

<strong>The plan prevents usage of electronic warfare</strong><br />

Two recent bills in the US Congress hint at secret technologies that have been developed from research on the atmosphere since World War II. Exotic weapons systems are a reality and are intended for the militarisation of space. H.R. 2977: the Space Preservation Act of 2001, introduced in the House by Congressman Dennis Kucinich, defines weapons systems such as directed energy, plasma, mood control,<br />
mind control, psychotronics, and chemicals which can target objects, individuals, and populations from space.<br />

<strong>High alert status means any warning system failure escalates to full scale nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Cimbala, PolSci Prof at Penn State, ’99 (Stephen, “Accidental/Inadvertent Nuclear War and Information Warfare” Armed Forces and Society, Vol 25, SagePub)</strong><br />
Forces poised for immediate retaliation to possible surprise attack also interact with warning systems looking outward for indications of such an attack. False indicators planted by the other side's info warriors to bring down air defense systems and missile attack warning radars are harbingers of disaster once forces and command systems have been alerted to war-expectant levels. Under those conditions, the vanishing of information from radar screens or fusion centers could be assumed as the first infowave of a nuclear attack, calling forth a preemptive response. Blank screens and obstructed communications leaving personnel in the dark for orders helped the U.S. in Desert Storm to clear the way for its air strikes against targets in Baghdad and at other locations within Iraqi state territory. The same phenomena might create unacceptable panic if the stakes were vulnerability to nuclear instead of conventional attack. Terrible pressures would rise from lower to higher command levels to &quot;use them or lose them&quot; before communications between and among NCA, CINCs, and geographically dispersed force commanders were completely severed. Positive (reinforcing) feedback within a system of dense interconnections may have unpredictable impacts, as Jervis has noted: Thus warning systems can self-excite when they go on alert: When a decision maker thinks that an attack is likely, he will place more credence in reports indicating that a war is imminent than he would if the same information were received in a period of calm, and actions of the other side that usually would be missed or seen as innocent will be perceived as evincing hostile intentions<strong>.</strong> And the more such 'information' is received, the greater the fear of attack.32<br />

<strong>The US has failed thus far to support treaties banning the weaponization of space</strong><br />
<strong>Brown, Asia Times, ’10 (Peter, July 16, “Asia takes stock of new US space policy”</strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/LG16Df02.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/LG16Df02.html</a><strong>)</strong><br />
While the new US national space policy seems to lend support to a ban on space weapons or at least points to a reduced interest in the weaponization of space, serious questions remain about how this might actually come about. Previous Russian and Chinese proposals which have attracted much praise have sidestepped verification which is an absolute necessity called for by the Obama administration. &quot;The US just is not supportive of multinational treaties in general<strong>,</strong>&quot; said Johnson-Freese. &quot;What was done here was showing a more amenable attitude as opposed to outright rejection. More than anything the new policy says it will not be strictly relying on or looking to hardware to protect hardware.&quot; A speech in mid-July by Frank Rose, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of Verification, Compliance, and Implementation to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva reinforced this idea that the US government is opening a new chapter. [4] This receptivity contrasts with the Bush administration's tough stance which was not really an invitation, and asserted that a new treaty was simply not necessary because a pair of existing treaties were sufficient. &quot;Although heavily caveated, the new policy may mean that the US will participate in discussions,&quot; said Ghoshroy. &quot;US missile defense plans will continue to be a major obstacle in any movement toward a new space treaty.&quot; Because an agreement prohibiting intentional interference with US space systems is in the US national security interest - over half of the active satellites currently in orbit belong to the US - Kulacki supports the idea of a direct debate with the Russians and the Chinese. &quot;It is not a prize we are handing out to Russia or China, whose desire for such a treaty, while often expressed, has yet to be really tested. We should call them on it, begin to negotiate in earnest, and see just how interested they really are,&quot; said Kulacki. &quot;Our military space capabilities are far more advanced. Protecting those capabilities should be our highest priority. It would help establish much needed norms in space that are in our national security interests.&quot; Opponents are concerned that the US will pay too high a price and receive very little in return by pursuing this objective. A treaty is no guarantee, the argument goes, and some in the US voice support for offensive counter space capabilities that are unconstrained by international law. &quot;That is, in my view, short-sighted. It is much easier for nations like Russia and China, not to mention North Korea or Iran, to develop anti-satellite capabilities than it is for them to match our overall military space capabilities,&quot; said Kulacki. &quot;Removing legal constraints on attacks in space opens our strengths up to a weaker attacker and removes a layer of protection that could prove critical in the moments leading up to an outbreak of hostilities<strong>.</strong> Trading defense for offense in space is not to our advantage, but to the advantage of a potential aggressor.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>This guts US credibility on the international scene, undermining the effectiveness and utility of multilateral forums.</strong><br />
<strong>Gallagher, MD CISSM, 2005</strong>(Nancy, April 20, CISSM, “Towards a Redonsideration of the Rules for Space Sercurity” , <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://spacedebate.org/evidence/1653/" rel="nofollow">http://spacedebate.org/evidence/1653/</a>, DOA: 7/11/11)<br />
Technological diffusion means that if the United States deploys space weapons, a number of other countries have the ability to emulate or offset them, so the advantage to the United States would be short-lived. Now and for the foreseeable future, no country or combination of countries could match the United States in terms of total military space spending or technological sophistication of military space systems. This means that the United States can afford to exercise restraint knowing that other countries have even less incentive or ability to suddenly surge ahead of the U.S. than the Soviets did during the Cold War. If, however, the United States continues to forge ahead toward highly threatening space weapons, plenty of countries have enough knowledge, resources, and capabilities to expand their military space operations in ways that would increase the net uncertainty, expense, and insecurity of U.S. space activities. In a global economy, secrecy and export controls cannot protect the American technological advantage in space; instead, they sabotage the U.S. satellite industry and motivate other countries to develop indigenous capabilities and cooperative arrangements that exclude the United States.<br />
<br />
<strong>The plan solves – US leadership in a multilateral ban on weapons in space reinvigorates global multilateral cooperation</strong><br />
<strong>Meyer, Canadian Ambassador to the UN and Conference on Disarm, ’10</strong> (Paul, December 15, ““PAROS in Peril: Prospects for Renewed Outer Space Security Diplomacy” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nwgs/renewed-outer-space-security-diplomacy-pmeyer.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nwgs/renewed-outer-space-security-diplomacy-pmeyer.pdf</a><strong>)</strong><br />
These three forms of proposals: a legal ban on space weapons, a politically-binding code of responsible behaviour and some type of security-specific CBM, appear to represent the principal options for multilateral outer space security diplomacy in the near term. The position of the U.S. as the chief space-faring nation may be decisive in determining which, if any, of the above channels will be activated. In the wake of the National Space Policy, the Administration is giving more consideration to the realm of space security and has signalled its predisposition in favour of TCBMs versus treaty based arms control. Its preference may be to pursue most actively bilateral TCBMs with Russia and if possible with China as the key space powers of concern. Multilaterally, it may decide to embrace the EU Code as a low-cost way of expressing support for international cooperation in outer space. The U.S. appears to be poised to suggest a TCBM of its own, in the form of some cooperative space situational awareness initiative. Two years into office, there is an expectation that this Administration should put its own mark on the global space security canvas. It will be pushing on an open door internationally, in espousing some tangible step for global cooperation on outer space security. The current Administration has demonstrated its unmatched convening authority with the nuclear security summit of this April. Why not put that convening authority to use on the space security file, by hosting a diplomatic gathering to discuss options for international cooperation? It is time for Washington to get down off the fence and provide some diplomatic leadership to bring about the “safe and responsible operations in space” it aims to support.<br />

Jonathan Tepperman’s article in the September 7, 2009 issue of Newsweek, “Why Obama Should Learn to Love the Bomb,” provides a novel but frivolous argument that nuclear weapons “may not, in fact, make the world more dangerous….” Rather, in Tepperman’s world, “The bomb may actually make us safer.” Tepperman shares this world with Kenneth Waltz, a University of California professor emeritus of political science, who Tepperman describes as “the leading ‘nuclear optimist.’” Waltz expresses his optimism in this way: “We’ve now had 64 years of experience since Hiroshima. It’s striking and against all historical precedent that for that substantial period, there has not been any war among nuclear states.” Actually, there were a number of proxy wars between nuclear weapons states, such as those in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan, and some near disasters, the most notable being the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Waltz’s logic is akin to observing a man falling from a high rise building, and noting that he had already fallen for 64 floors without anything bad happening to him, and concluding that so far it looked so good that others should try it. Dangerous logic! Tepperman builds upon Waltz’s logic, and concludes “that all states are rational,” even though their leaders may have a lot of bad qualities, including being “stupid, petty, venal, even evil….” He asks us to trust that rationality will always prevail when there is a risk of nuclear retaliation, because these weapons make “the costs of war obvious, inevitable, and unacceptable.” Actually, he is asking us to do more than trust in the rationality of leaders; he is asking us to gamble the future on this proposition. “The iron logic of deterrence and mutually assured destruction is so compelling,” Tepperman argues, “it’s led to what’s known as the nuclear peace….” But if this is a peace worthy of the name, which it isn’t, it certainly is not one on which to risk the future of civilization. One irrational leader with control over a nuclear arsenal could start a nuclear conflagration, resulting in a global Hiroshima. Tepperman celebrates “the iron logic of deterrence,” but deterrence is a theory that is far from rooted in “iron logic.” It is a theory based upon threats that must be effectively communicated and believed. Leaders of Country A with nuclear weapons must communicate to other countries (B, C, etc.) the conditions under which A will retaliate with nuclear weapons. The leaders of the other countries must understand and believe the threat from Country A will, in fact, be carried out. The longer that nuclear weapons are not used, the more other countries may come to believe that they can challenge Country A with impunity from nuclear retaliation. The more that Country A bullies other countries, the greater the incentive for these countries to develop their own nuclear arsenals. Deterrence is unstable and therefore precarious. Most of the countries in the world reject the argument, made most prominently by Kenneth Waltz, that the spread of nuclear weapons makes the world safer. These countries joined together in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, but they never agreed to maintain indefinitely a system of nuclear apartheid in which some states possess nuclear weapons and others are prohibited from doing so. The principal bargain of the NPT requires the five NPT nuclear weapons states (US, Russia, UK, France and China) to engage in good faith negotiations for nuclear disarmament, and the International Court of Justice interpreted this to mean complete nuclear disarmament in all its aspects. Tepperman seems to be arguing that seeking to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is bad policy, and that nuclear weapons, because of their threat, make efforts at non-proliferation unnecessary and even unwise. If some additional states, including Iran, developed nuclear arsenals, he concludes that wouldn’t be so bad “given the way that bombs tend to mellow behavior.” Those who oppose Tepperman’s favorable disposition toward the bomb, he refers to as “nuclear pessimists.” These would be the people, and I would certainly be one of them, who see nuclear weapons as presenting an urgent danger to our security, our species and our future. Tepperman finds that when viewed from his “nuclear optimist” perspective, “nuclear weapons start to seem a lot less frightening.” “Nuclear peace,” he tells us, “rests on a scary bargain: you accept a small chance that something extremely bad will happen in exchange for a much bigger chance that something very bad – conventional war – won’t happen.” But the “extremely bad” thing he asks us to accept is the end of the human species. Yes, that would be serious. He also doesn’t make the case that in a world without nuclear weapons, the prospects of conventional war would increase dramatically. After all, it is only an unproven supposition that nuclear weapons have prevented wars, or would do so in the future. We have certainly come far too close to the precipice of catastrophic nuclear war. As an ultimate celebration of the faulty logic of deterrence, Tepperman calls for providing any nuclear weapons state with a “survivable second strike option.” Thus, he not only favors nuclear weapons, but finds the security of these weapons to trump human security. Presumably he would have President Obama providing new and secure nuclear weapons to North Korea, Pakistan and any other nuclear weapons states that come along so that they will feel secure enough not to use their weapons in a first-strike attack. Do we really want to bet the human future that Kim Jong-Il and his successors are more rational than Mr. Tepperman?<br />

<strong>Revitalizing credibility in multilateralism is critical to assume a global environmental leadership role and solve global warming.</strong><br />
<strong>Ivanova and Esty 2008</strong> (Maria, Assistant Professor of Government and Environmental Policy at The College of William and Mary, Daniel Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law and Policy at Yale University, “Reclaiming U.S. Leadership in Global Environmental Governance,” Volume 28, Number 2, Summer-Fall 2008, SAIS Review, MUSE, JR2)<br />
However, the United States has since retreated from its global environmental leadership role. The George W. Bush Administration has obstructed progress on a number of international environmental initiatives: protecting [End Page 57] biodiversity, regulating the trade in genetically modified products, and instituting a legally binding treaty banning mercury. The high watermark—or perhaps the low tide—of U.S. obstructionism, however, came with the U.S. “unsigning” of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change in 2001 and once more at the 2007 international climate negotiations in Bali, Indonesia. The only developed nation not having ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the United States was the main opponent in Bali to a proposal for greenhouse gas reductions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels. As the United States balked at the emerging Bali consensus, an extraordinary diplomatic breech occurred: the U.S. delegation was booed. Lest there be any doubt, Nobel Laureate Al Gore weighed in, observing that the United States was “obstructing progress.” The list of international environmental initiatives that the United States has failed to join has become longer. The United States has yet to ratify the 1982 Law of the Sea Treaty, the 1992 Basel Convention on Export of Hazardous Waste, the 1993 Convention on Biological Diversity, and, of course, the Kyoto Protocol (see Table 1 for a chronological overview of main international environmental conventions and the status of U.S. participation). The Bush Administration’s “go-it-alone” strategy in security issues has mirrored a similar unilateralism in the international environmental domain. Once a leader in international environmental policy, the United States has lost much of its political influence today. What is more, U.S. withdrawal from multilateralism has left the United Nations—the imperfect but important instrument for international cooperation—“in limbo, neither strengthened nor abandoned,”1 threatening the ability of the world community to resolve fundamental global problems. Two key dynamics now mark international environmental policy. First, while it is widely recognized that U.S. engagement and cooperation is not just important, but historically seen as essential for progress, other nations today seem willing to move ahead with or without the United States. Germany, for example, announced a national greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 40 percent by 2020 and threatened to boycott the U.S. “major emitters” initiative launched outside the Kyoto framework. That the United States could have gotten itself crosswise with so many other nations on so many issues is unprecedented. As Jonathan Lash, President of the World Resources Institute, recently observed, the extraordinary degree of anger and confrontation on environmental matters “reflects increasing alarm on climate change and the level of frustration with the U.S.”2 At the same time, many U.S. governors and mayors have launched state and local initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in California has gone so far as to open talks with the European Union on how to link his state-level initiatives with Europe’s emerging carbon market. Second, the Bush Administration’s reflexive unilateralism on international concerns—whether environmental, economic, or security—represents a break with the prevailing presumption since World War II favoring cooperation [End Page 58] and multilateralism through NATO, OECD, and other regional bodies, if not the UN. The “go-it-alone” approach is especially difficult to justify on issues that are inescapably global in scope, such as climate change. Even if the United States were able to eliminate its greenhouse gas emissions entirely, climate change would not be stopped. The build-up of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide driven by rising emissions in China, India, Indonesia, and other developing countries would continue, leaving the United States exposed to the threat of global warming, increased intensity of windstorms, altered rainfall patterns, melting ice caps, and rising sea levels.<br />

<strong>Morgan,</strong> Foreign Studies Prof at Hankuk, <strong>‘9</strong> (Dennis Ray, December, “World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race” Futures, Vol 41 Issue 10, p 683-693, ScienceDirect)<br />
4 Is it the end of human civilization and possible extinction of humankind? What Jonathon Schell wrote concerning death by the fire of nuclear holocaust also applies to the slow burning death of global warming: Once we learn that a holocaust might lead to extinction, we have no right to gamble, because if we lose, the game will be over, and neither we nor anyone else will ever get another chance. Therefore, although, scientifically speaking, there is all the difference in the world between the mere possibility that a holocaust will bring about extinction and the certainty of it, morally they are the same, and we have no choice but to address the issue of nuclear weapons as though we knew for a certainty that their use would put an end to our species [23].15 When we consider that beyond the horror of nuclear war, another horror is set into motion to interact with the subsequent nuclear winter to produce a poisonous and super heated planet, the chances of human survival seem even smaller. Who knows, even if some small remnant does manage to survive, what the poisonous environmental conditions would have on human evolution in the future. A remnant of mutated, sub-human creatures might survive such harsh conditions, but for all purposes, human civilization has been destroyed, and the question concerning human extinction becomes moot.<br />

<strong>US involvement in multilateral engagement solves global public health infrastructure and disease</strong><br />

The United States is in an excellent position to lead vigorous efforts to create drugs and vaccines that would have their greatest immediate effects in poor countries. Of the $56 billion spent worldwide on health research, less than 10 percent is devoted to the diseases that account for 90 percent of the global disease burden (Global Forum for Health Research 2000). The traditional foundation of public trust in science is progress in tackling major health issues, because such work is so clearly for the greater good. U.S. &quot;orphan drug&quot; legislation, which offers incentives to the market to develop new drugs for rare diseases, has shown the possibility of creating such products at the national level (Lang and Wood 1999). The nation seems interested in exploring this approach internationally. President Clinton's Millennium Initiative, for example, focuses on buying existing vaccines and developing new ones for the benefit of the international community as a whole. It offers increased funding for basic research to the National Institutes of Health, an institution that explicitly mentions enlightened self-interest in justifying its work on an AIDS vaccine. AIDS, claims NIH, has already depressed the GDP of developing countries, and this is expected to have &quot;macroeconomic effects worldwide&quot; (Office of AIDS Research 2001). The initiative aims to harness the drive and innovation of the private sector by offering incentives for the pharmaceutical industry to invest in vaccine research. Tax credits of up to $1 billion are also promised for sales of any future HIV/AIDS, malaria, or tuberculosis vaccine. This is a creative way to engage industry in a win-win context to develop drugs and vaccines for the global community. It also helps the pharmaceutical industry adapt to a changing world and keep the profits that drive innovation. Unless such efforts are strengthened, the market is unlikely to persist in developing orphan drugs. Foreign policy leaders are also confronted with the issue of unequal access to existing medicines. These drugs could have a profound positive impact on millions in the developing world. The furor over access to AIDS treatments has brought this issue to light. AIDS is now a disease of the poor, with 95 percent of HIV infections in developing countries, and rich-country epidemics increasingly confined to deprived communities (UNAIDS 2000). Even though scientific innovation has been impressive, with 40 AIDS therapies currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (for a complete list, see Food and Drug Administration 1999, 2000), very few of the benefits of that science now reach the poor. While AIDS deaths have fallen dramatically in the United States, advances in treatment have yet to help developing countries. It is important to note that the lack of access is a result of inadequate infrastructure and insufficient financing as much as the high price of drugs and vaccines. It is essential that all stakeholders find innovative ways to both provide incentives for research on new medicines and to ensure that patients in need, everywhere, have access to drugs and vaccines within effective health care systems. Many leading pharmaceutical companies have acknowledged that tiered pricing is a fundamental part of the solution to the problem of unequal access. They believe the challenge is primarily economic and that it also depends on the political will and national commitment of governments to invest in health care and social welfare services. Therefore, five of the largest drug companies have linked their promise to reduce the prices of HIV/AIDS drugs to commitments by national governments and the global community to invest in health delivery systems (Bloom and River Path Associates 2000). Patients in developing countries are unlikely to gain better access to medicines without adequate investment in public health infrastructure and a strong political will on the part of national governments to provide treatment. The case of access to prescription drugs is an excellent example of how health-related issues will become increasingly important in trade and related policies in the future, and of why it is essential for U.S. policymakers to ensure that public health issues are given a higher profile in trade deliberations. The U.S. government must stress the need to foster new partnerships among relevant multilateral organizations—for example, the United Nations, the European Commission, WHO, the World Bank, national governments, NGOs, and the pharmaceutical industry—and to build a broad political consensus on ways to improve access to medicines and to increase investment in public health infrastructure in the developing world.<br />

<strong>New pandemics will inevitably emerge – without vaccines they cause extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Yu 09 “Human Extinction: The Uncertainty of Our Fate,” Dartmouth Journal of Undergraduate Science,</strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2009/human-extinction-the-uncertainty-of-our-fate" rel="nofollow">**http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2009/human-extinction-the-uncertainty-of-our-fate**</a><br />
In the past, humans have indeed fallen victim to viruses. Perhaps the best-known case was the bubonic plague that killed up to one third of the European population in the mid-14th century (7). While vaccines have been developed for the plague and some other infectious diseases, new viral strains are constantly emerging — a process that maintains the possibility of a pandemic-facilitated human extinction. Some surveyed students mentioned AIDS as a potential pandemic-causing virus. It is true that scientists have been unable thus far to find a sustainable cure for AIDS, mainly due to HIV’s rapid and constant evolution. Specifically, two factors account for the virus’s abnormally high mutation rate: 1. HIV’s use of reverse transcriptase, which does not have a proof-reading mechanism, and 2. the lack of an error-correction mechanism in HIV DNA polymerase (8). Luckily, though, there are certain characteristics of HIV that make it a poor candidate for a large-scale global infection: HIV can lie dormant in the human body for years without manifesting itself, and AIDS itself does not kill directly, but rather through the weakening of the immune system. However, for more easily transmitted viruses such as influenza, the evolution of new strains could prove far more consequential. The simultaneous occurrence of antigenic drift (point mutations that lead to new strains) and antigenic shift (the inter-species transfer of disease) in the influenza virus could produce a new version of influenza for which scientists may not immediately find a cure. Since influenza can spread quickly, this lag time could potentially lead to a <strong>“</strong>global influenza pandemic,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (9). The most recent scare of this variety came in 1918 when bird flu managed to kill over 50 million people around the world in what is sometimes referred to as the Spanish flu pandemic. Perhaps even more frightening is the fact that only 25 mutations were required to convert the original viral strain — which could only infect birds — into a human-viable strain (10).<br />

<strong>The SPT provides an Outer Space Peacekeeping Agency formed in part by every signatory, funded with the latest tools and technologies, that prevents any weaponization of space.</strong><br />

The Outer Space Peacekeeping Agency under the Space Preservation Treaty will be funded, equipped and deployed with the latest tools of technology and information services that will make it possible to produce a Space Age effective monitoring, verification, and enforcement system that will be based on enhanced communication and observation, on information sharing, and on technology applications that will benefit all on earth. With the pooled resources and brains of the many space-faring nations and the developing parts of the world, this Agency, along with the forthcoming laws, will make it possible to prevent any aggressor that would attempt to place space-based weapons in outer space above the heads of the people on earth.<br />
<br />
<strong>Pursuing space as a sanctuary by agreeing to multilateral treaties cements US leadership in space, increases international pressure for others to follow suit, and guarantees enforcement efforts work.</strong><br />
<strong>Christy 2006</strong> (Don served a tour of duty as the Deputy Commander at Baghdad Airport in Iraq Usawc strategy research project United States policy on weapons in space (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil307.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil307.pdf</a>)<br />
The first step is leadership in setting the intended standard. As the world’s only superpower, and the one nation in the best position to weaponize space, by not doing so we may pave the way to ensure it never happens. Our current relative dominance in space gives the United States unique credibility in leading an international effort to limit space weapons, as the nation with presumably the most to give up. It would be easy for Peru to give up space weapons. Since they have no near-term prospects for a space program, they really are not giving up anything tangible. By renouncing space weapons, the United States is giving up something real and tangible. This can have the effect of setting a very high international value on preserving space as a weapons free sanctuary. Initially, the United States should announce a policy of unilateral constraint in the development and deployment of weapons in space. 61 From this position of strength<strong>,</strong> we should pursue and shape comprehensive and verifiable international conventions that limit weapons in space. The strength comes from a combination of our technological dominance in space and our leadership position in the world. As discussed, space weapons are a choice. If the United States, through international leadership, places great value on a space sanctuary, it increases the international pressure for others to follow suit. It also raises the political ramifications of any nation’s violation of the sanctuary or unwillingness to participate in the conventions. If, on the other hand, the United States acts as the pioneer for space weapons, not only do we pay the political cost of breaking the sanctuary of space, but we also reduce the cost (political and economic) of entry to those who follow. 62 Restraint increases the pressure for others to restrain as well. Failing restraint, should another space capable country be unwilling to sign and comply with the conventions and later develop space weapons, it would greatly enhance the political environment for the United States to counter any threat including a greater likelihood of having partners, political and otherwise, in the process.<br />

 <strong>U.S. climate satellites are <u>battered</u> and <u>outdated</u>—inevitable data gaps destroy environmental monitoring</strong><br />
<strong>Bohan 10</strong>—Suzanne Bohan, Washington Post writer, Sept 19, 2010, “A dim view for Earth emerges” Washington Post pg. A06<br />
The satellite, Landsat 7, is broken. And it's emblematic of the nation's battered satellite environmental monitoring program. The bad news: It's only going to get worse, unless the federal agencies criticized for their poor management of the satellite systems over the past decade stage a fast turnaround. Many, however, view that prospect as a long shot. &quot;I would say our ability to observe the Earth from space is at grave risk of dying from neglect,&quot; said Field, director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University. Inez Fung, a noted climatologist at the University of California at Berkeley, was shocked as she scanned a recent federal report warning of impending gaps in the country's ability to monitor Earth from space. The federal document, released in May, listed cuts in climate-monitoring sensors from the next generation of Earth-observing satellites. The current satellites beam down many types of indispensable data about the planet, such as ocean currents, ozone levels and snow cover, as well as the pictures viewers see every day on TV weathercasts. But key instruments on the new satellites have been eliminated: Gone is a sensor that would relay new data about the atmosphere and environmental conditions in the ocean and along coastal areas. The movement of pollutants and greenhouse gaseswould have been under the instrument's mechanical gaze, as well. Also absent is a critical sensor that monitors temperature changes over time on Earth. &quot;That's like if you have a sick patient, and then say, 'I have no more thermometers,' &quot; Fung said. In all, nine new climate instruments on the next generation of satellites were canceled or their capabilities scaled back in 2006, according to the Government Accountability Office report. Combined with a five-year delay in launching these next-generation satellites, with the first scheduled to blast off in 2011, these canceled or &quot;degraded&quot; instruments leave the nation facing critical gaps in satellite monitoring of the planet beginning in 2015, the report stated. And a National Academy of Sciences analysis of the disarray in the satellite program stressed that because of Earth's growing population, it's more crucial than ever to monitor pollution, water quality, land use and other environmental conditions. Many blame the cuts on Bush administration policies that favored manned moon and Mars missions over shoring up aging Earth-observing satellite systems. Critics cite a 30 percent decline between 2000 and 2006 in NASA's Earth science budget - which funds environmental satellites - as evidence of the administration's lukewarm support of keeping an eye on the planet's condition. The National Academy of Sciences report, along with a chorus of experts in the field, also warns that the country is at risk of losing its worldwide technological leadership in Earth-observing satellites. Other casualties of the 2006 cuts include an instrument for tracking airborne particles such as sea spray, smog, volcanic ash and smoke - all factors contributing to the warming or cooling of the planet. The inclusion of a new instrument for monitoring soil moisture was canceled, which would have yielded information valuable to, among others, farmers and those monitoring the spread of deserts worldwide. These cuts spell a 46 percent decline in data about the Earth's conditions that these new satellites were designed to provide, and the GAO report concluded that because of the trouble-plagued satellite program, &quot;our nation's ability to understand climate change may be limited.&quot; Those in the field use harsher language. Many Earth-monitoring satellites &quot;are really in desperate shape,&quot; said Field, with Stanford's Carnegie Institution. In the 1960s, the United States began using satellites to observe its lands, oceans, atmosphere and the space environment near Earth. The satellites continuously monitor the planet's dynamic environment and allow humans to peer into inaccessible places. Information beamed by these spacecraft is now essential for forecasting weather, tracking conditions on Earth and in its atmosphere, and projecting long-term climate trends. With satellite data, rising sea levels can be monitored, helping communities on islands and along coastal areas plan. Satellites help farmers assess soil conditions before planting, allow foresters to examine logging activities, let water managers monitor the mountain snowpack that provides water to cities, and track the migration of wildlife such as buffalo and elephants. Satellite data are also essential for crafting international agreements for reducing global warming, said Molly Macauley, an economist with Resources for the Future, a research institute in Washington.<br />

<strong>Data gaps impede climate risk-management—monitoring key to prevent tipping point</strong><br />
<strong>Government Office for Science 3/14</strong>- UK, Tipping Points meeting, London, 14 March 2011 Note prepared on behalf of the Government Office for Science by the Met Office: Peter Good, Jason Lowe, Richard Wood <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2531:http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/goscience/docs/t/11-974-tipping-points-meeting-london-14-march-2011 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/goscience/docs/t/11-974-tipping-points-meeting-london-14-march-2011" rel="nofollow">http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/goscience/docs/t/11-974-tipping-points-meeting-london-14-march-2011</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2531 --><br />
There is wide acceptance in the scientific community that there are likely to be “tipping points” in the climate system, where a significant, qualitative change in state occurs in response to a small perturbation. Crossing such tipping points could lead to accelerated, committed or irreversible change. However there is substantial scientific uncertainty in quantifying the position and likelihood of passing key thresholds, and in terms of associated impacts. Current estimates of the likelihood of triggering large-scale and/or irreversible climate events are largely based on expert judgement, informed by paleo-climatic evidence, computer models and current understanding of the underlying physical processes. The high level of uncertainty, combined with the potential for very significant impacts if one or more “tipping points” were to be triggered, means that the policy response is likely to require a risk management approach. Paleo-climate reconstructions provide evidence of past rapid change events, for example the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which took place around 50 million years ago and involved a major climatic warming which took place over around 1000 years, possibly driven by rapid methane release. Current cumulative anthropogenic carbon release is around one third of the way towards the level that triggered such events in the past. Climate models are used to provide short term forecasts and longer term projections, to interpret recent climatic variations and paleo-climatic changes, and to understand the physical processes that may drive threshold behaviour. However several examples are known where the models used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment may not represent physical mechanisms of tipping elements correctly, due to limitations in resolution and in the processes that can currently be included in models. ‘Early warnings’ for tipping points through Earth system monitoring may be possible and may help manage the risks, although the uncertainty in modelling such events remains large. Three types of ‘health check’ approach were mentioned: (i) general statistical methods, (ii) process-based identification of key variables to monitor, and (iii) initial value prediction. Each was seen to have different advantages and disadvantages. The critical need for long-term monitoring was emphasised, while many existing observations are tied to short-term research programs. A clear set of long term monitoring priorities for tipping points has not yet been developed. It is important to be able to interpret ‘surprises’ in new observations (e.g. the 2007 dip in Arctic sea-ice), so that such observations can be put into context. These interpretations must be developed through careful application of quantitative, process-based knowledge of the climate system. After a high level review of the scientific evidence, the meeting considered how the risk of “tipping points” and system thresholds could be better included in policy development and wider public debate. There was consensus that the science in this area is particularly hard to communicate clearly. In part this is due to the danger of communicating an overly negative message; positive messages that make the public feel part of the solution are more likely to effect behaviour change. There was broad agreement on the requirement for a set of different (but self-consistent) narratives to meet the needs of individual audiences, using metaphors to aid clarity and understanding, and applying a risk-management framework.<br />

<strong>Now is the key time – New reports indicate that this year is the worst increase of climate change on record – we are on the brink</strong><br />
<strong>Borenstein 11/3</strong> [Seth, AP Science Writer, “Biggest jump ever seen in global warming gases,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wishtv.com/dpps/green_living/world_green/biggest-jump-ever-seen-in-global-warming-gases-wd11-jpe_3979159" rel="nofollow">http://www.wishtv.com/dpps/green_living/world_green/biggest-jump-ever-seen-in-global-warming-gases-wd11-jpe_3979159</a>, Published : Thursday, 03 Nov 2011, 3:17 PM EDT, JR2]<br />
WASHINGTON (AP) — The global output of heat-trapping carbon dioxide jumped by the biggest amount on record, the U.S. Department of Energy calculated, a sign of how feeble the world's efforts are at slowing man-made global warming. The new figures for 2010 mean that levels of greenhouse gases are higher than the worst case scenario outlined by climate experts just four years ago. &quot;The more we talk about the need to control emissions, the more they are growing,&quot; said John Reilly, co-director of MIT's Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. The world pumped about 564 million more tons (512 million metric tons) of carbon into the air in 2010 than it did in 2009. That's an increase of 6 percent. That amount of extra pollution eclipses the individual emissions of all but three countries — China, the United States and India, the world's top producers of greenhouse gases. It is a &quot;monster&quot; increase that is unheard of, said Gregg Marland, a professor of geology at Appalachian State University, who has helped calculate Department of Energy figures in the past. Extra pollution in China and the U.S. account for more than half the increase in emissions last year, Marland said. &quot;It's a big jump,&quot; said Tom Boden, director of the Energy Department's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center at Oak Ridge National Lab. &quot;From an emissions standpoint, the global financial crisis seems to be over.&quot; Boden said that in 2010 people were traveling, and manufacturing was back up worldwide, spurring the use of fossil fuels, the chief contributor of man-made climate change. <span class="Heading1Char">India and China are huge users of coal. Burning coal is the biggest carbon source worldwide and emissions from that jumped nearly 8 percent in 2010</span>. &quot;The good news is that these economies are growing rapidly so everyone ought to be for that, right?&quot; Reilly said Thursday. &quot;Broader economic improvements in poor countries has been bringing living improvements to people. Doing it with increasing reliance on coal is imperiling the world.&quot; In 2007, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its last large report on global warming, it used different scenarios for carbon dioxide pollution and said the rate of warming would be based on the rate of pollution. Boden said the latest figures put global emissions higher than the worst case projections from the climate panel. Those forecast global temperatures rising between 4 and 11 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century with the best estimate at 7.5 degrees. Even though global warming skeptics have attacked the climate change panel as being too alarmist, scientists have generally found their predictions too conservative, Reilly said. He said his university worked on emissions scenarios, their likelihood, and what would happen. The IPCC's worst case scenario was only about in the middle of what MIT calculated are likely scenarios. Chris Field of Stanford University, head of one of the IPCC's working groups, said the panel's emissions scenarios are intended to be more accurate in the long term and are less so in earlier years. He said the question now among scientists is whether the future is the panel's worst case scenario &quot;or something more extreme.&quot; &quot;Really dismaying,&quot; Granger Morgan, head of the engineering and public policy department at Carnegie Mellon University, said of the new figures. &quot;We are building up a horrible legacy for our children and grandchildren.&quot; But Reilly and University of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver found something good in recent emissions figures. The developed countries that ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gas limiting treaty have reduced their emissions overall since then and have achieved their goals of cutting emissions to about 8 percent below 1990 levels. The U.S. did not ratify the agreement. In 1990, developed countries produced about 60 percent of the world's greenhouse gases, now it's probably less than 50 percent, Reilly said. &quot;We really need to get the developing world because if we don't, the problem is going to be running away from us,&quot; Weaver said. &quot;And the problem is pretty close from running away from us.&quot;<br />

<strong>Advantage 1 is Migration</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Failure to adapt to climate change could cause up to 1 billion refugees</strong><br />

By 2050, <u>climate change is expected to push hundreds of millions of people — up to 1 billion</u>, by some estimates — <u>to leave their homes</u> seeking better land, jobs and other resources. The figures are intimidating — but they don’t offer the specifics needed to prepare for the transformation. Uncertainties about local impacts of climate change, as well as thin data on migration today, make it difficult or impossible to precisely predict future mobility patterns. But we can better understand how environmental change in fragile areas affects people’s livelihoods and influences migration — and how governments and civil society can take these links into account. In 2009, IIED, in partnership with three local NGOs — Mainumby, IED Afrique and Tamasha — began case studies looking at these questions in Bolivia, Senegal and Tanzania.<br />

Climate change is <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">essentially</span> irreversible, according to a sobering new scientific study. As carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise, the world will experience more and more long-term environmental disruption. The damage will persist even when, and if, emissions are brought under control, says study author Susan Solomon, who is among the world's top climate scientists. &quot;We're used to thinking about pollution problems as things that we can fix,&quot; Solomon says. &quot;Smog, we just cut back and everything will be better later. Or haze, you know, it'll go away pretty quickly.&quot; That's the case for some of the gases that contribute to climate change, such as methane and nitrous oxide. But as Solomon and colleagues suggest in a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, it is not true for the most abundant greenhouse gas: carbon dioxide. Turning off the carbon dioxide emissions won't stop global warming. &quot;People have imagined that if we stopped emitting carbon dioxide that the climate would go back to normal in 100 years or 200 years. What we're showing here is that's not right. It's essentially an irreversible change that will last for more than a thousand years,&quot; Solomon says. This is because the oceans are currently soaking up a lot of the planet's excess heat — and <span class="DebateUnderline">a</span> lot of the carbon dioxide put into the air. The carbon dioxide and heat will eventually start coming out of the ocean. And that will take place for many hundreds of years. Solomon is a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Her new study looked at the consequences of this long-term effect in terms of sea level rise and drought.<br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Environmentally induced</span> displacement and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">migration</span> are already taking place, and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">because of</span> the impacts of <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">climate change</span> they <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are likely to increase markedly</span>.62 It is that expected that the adverse <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">impacts</span> of climate change <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">such as increased floods, droughts, sea level rise and intense storms will lead to</span> the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">mass movement </span>of peoples, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">resulting in up to 250 million environmental refugees</span> by the middle of the century.63 These figures have been frequently quoted by the IPCC, the Stern Review, and the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security, among others. The Norwegian Refugee Council recently indicated that as many as 20 million people may have been displaced by climate-induced sudden-onset natural disasters in 2008 alone.64 The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has identified <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">five</span> climate change related <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">scenarios</span> that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">may </span>directly or indirectly <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">cause</span> human <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">displacement: hydrometeorological disasters</span> (flooding, hurricanes/typhoons/cyclones, mudslides, etc.), zones designated by Governments as being too high-risk and dangerous for human habitation, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">environmental degradation</span> and slow onset disaster (e.g. reduction of water availability, desertification, recurrent flooding, salinization of coastal zones, etc.), the case of ‘<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sinking’</span> small <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">island states; and</span>, violent <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">conflict triggered by</span> a <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">decrease in essential resources</span> (e.g. water, land, food) owing to climate change. 65 It should be noted that gradual environmental degradation will cause significantly more people to migrate than extreme weather events.66 And most of those displaced by the effects of climate change will remain within their country’s borders or region.67 For those who stay within the country, the prevailing international normative standards would apply to them: they are internally displaced persons (IDPs). However, the legal status of those who are forced to leave their countries because of environmental factors is less clear: the term “environmental refugee” is poorly defined and has no legally binding mechanisms of protection or support.68 Despite many uncertainties about the delimitation of the definition of environmentally induced migration and its measurement, one fact remains certain in the face of the expected effects of climate change: the part played by environmental degradation and extreme weather events as causes of migration will increase. Security Implications <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Any climate-induced migration may increase tension and even conflicts in transit and destination areas</span>. For receiving areas, the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sudden influx of large numbers of people can be burdensome. </span>The <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">likelihood of</span> migration-induced <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">conflict increases if</span> environmental <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">migrants have to compete with the resident population for scarce resources</span> such as land, accommodation, water, employment and basic social services.69 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A competitive situation of this sort is particularly likely to arise in densely-populated regions.</span> A <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">competition</span> for resource <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">can be even more problematic if these migrants cross their national border and cause dissatisfaction in receiving state. </span>Mass <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">cross-border </span>migration may <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">also </span>increase <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">political </span>friction between states that already face contested borders and territorial disputes, such as China, India, and Pakistan.70 It is also conceivable that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">migration may lead to conflict if the newcomers upset the cultural or ethnic order within a country or region.</span>71 This <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">change of ethnic balance may lead to xenophobia and violent confrontation</span>, or further destabilize an already sensitive ethnic situation. One study refers to ‘clashes of national identity’ that may be caused by immigration if the dominance of one resident ethnic group is threatened.72 In the most extreme cases, migration has led to violent conflict in receiving areas. For example, civil wars in Jordan and Lebanon have involved Palestinian migrants; in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Hutu refugees from Rwanda contributed to local conflicts; and in Macedonia, refugees from Kosovo led to a minor armed conflict.73 On a smaller scale, internal migration has led to ethnic tensions in the North East regions of India as well as in non-Javanese regions of Indonesia.74 However, it is important to note that migrants themselves should not be labeled threats. These people, if they leave their home country, will be refugees, having been forced to leave by environmental or other factors. They will need support and protection. Migration will therefore need to be managed, rather than simply controlled.75 • Scenario Experts say Bangladesh could be<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the </span>ground zero<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> of climate change-induced migration</span>, mostly due to sea level rise. The country's 150 million inhabitants live in the delta of three waterways<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, and </span>the majority of the country sits less than 20 feet above sea level. It is also one of the poorest countries in the world. Although the knowledge on impact of sea level rise on Bangladesh remains limited, the past and current effects of sea level rise along the country’s coast are apparent. Accelerated sea level rise driven by global climate change has, for decades, badly affected Bangladesh coast through permanent inundation, drainage congestion in the polders, storm surge inundation and increased salinity intrusion of low-lying areas. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Floods and storms</span> also <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">pose increasing threat of damage to infrastructures, destruction of fisheries, reduction of cultivated land, crop failures and the loss of biodiversity</span> across the countries, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">which</span> as well <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">could affect </span>people<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> settlements.</span> The UN's IPCC predicts a global sea-level rise in the range of 18-59cm during the 21st century.76 Specifically for Bangladesh, World Bank expects 10 cm, 25cm and near 1 m rise in sea level by 2020, 2050 and 2100; affecting 2%, 4% and 17% of total land mass respectively.77 At the top of this range at one meter rise, it is expected that approximately 20 million people would be displaced.78 Bangladesh government actually acknowledges the 20 million figure in its Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan 2009, saying “(cross border) migration must be considered as a valid option for the country”.79 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Once the displacement starts to occur, </span>most will move inland, which will foment instability<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> as the resettled population competes for already scarce resources and jobs with established residents. Others will seek to migrate abroad. With cities like Dhaka</span> are <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">bursting at the seams, </span>migration<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> from Bangladesh </span>to<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> bordering </span>India appears<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to be </span>likely, possibly creating heightenedpolitical tension in South Asia<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. India </span>itself <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has</span> for many years <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">been concerned about the stream of immigrants from Bangladesh, and is building a fence</span> to keep illegal immigrants out.80 The <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">potential mass migration</span> due to climate change <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will increase the potential for social crisis</span> in a region which is already characterized by cross-border conflicts, unstable governments, and Islamism.81 The likelihood of ethnic conflict may also increase if the arrival of environmental migrants upsets the ‘ethnic balance’ in the area82. For example, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the majority Hindu population may reject the Muslim migrants. </span>The combination of deteriorating socioeconomic conditions, contested borders and territories and dire environmental insecurity<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> brought on by climate change </span>could prove a volatile mix with severe regional and potentially global consequences.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> These dynamics are the reason why the linkage between climate-induced migration and its security implications for South Asia are slowly coming to the forefront of security discussion </span>scenario<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> around the world</span>.<br />

<strong>Causes nuclear war</strong><br />
“Nuclear War A Real Fear In South Asia,” <strong><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">UPI</span></strong>, 17 December <strong><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">2004</span></strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/nuclear-india-pakistan%2004k.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacedaily.com/news/nuclear-india-pakistan 04k.html</a><br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">No conventional war between India and Pakistan will remain limited for long and will gradually lead to a full-scale war and ultimately to a nuclear conflict, warns a study by a Pakistani defense official. The study, presented recently at a Washington think-tank, looks at various scenarios that could lead to an all-out war</span> between the two South Asian neighbors, which conducted a series of nuclear tests in May 1998 and also possess nuclear-capable missiles. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from Britain in 1947 and are still engaged in 57-year-old conflict in the Himalayan valley of Kashmir which caused two of these three wars. Most of the possible war scenarios discussed in this study also focus on Kashmir where most international observers believe even a small conflict has the potential of escalating into a full-fledged war. Recently, both India and Pakistan have agreed to resolve their differences through dialogue and have taken several steps lessen tensions. The study by the Pakistani defense official envisages possible Pakistani response to a various proposals being discussed in India's defense circles for dealing with the Kashmir insurgency, which India blames on Pakistan-backed militants. The author, who wished not to be identified, argues that recently <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">India has put forward the concept of a limited conventional war aimed at achieving a specific political objective</span>, such as putting down the uprising in Kashmir. But the author warns that what India may see as a limited conventional war, may not be accepted to Pakistan<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> as such. </span>Similarly,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> what India defines as limited political perspective, may have a different implication for Pakistan,</span> he adds. The author points out that most Western analysts and scholars are not comfortable with India's limited war doctrine and they also believe that a limited war between India and Pakistan cannot remain limited for long. Comparing nuclear policies of the two countries, the author says that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the central theme of Pakistan's nuclear policy guidelines is to act in a responsible manner and to exercise restraint in conduct of its deterrence policy</span>. Pakistan, he said, also wants to ensure that its nuclear capability does not pose any threat to non-nuclear weapon states in the region. Pakistan's nuclear capability is very clear for deterrence of aggression and defense of its sovereignty, the author said. India's declared nuclear doctrine, he said, is based on a posture of no first use of nuclear weapons. India, however, retains the option of using nuclear weapons in retaliation against a nuclear, biological or chemical attack on Indian territory or on Indian forces anywhere. India's doctrine contains an inbuilt offensive design. The most dangerous aspect of this policy is that it keeps the option open for a conventional war against Pakistan, according to the author. Asked why Pakistan had used the option of a limited conventional war in Kargil in 1999, the author said Kargil is part of Siachen sector where limited battles have continued since 1984. Kargil, he said, was a continuation of the same ongoing skirmishes between India and Pakistan. The author then explains various options India may exercise for launching a limited conventional war against Pakistan. These include: -- Surgical strikes conducted along the Line of Control in Kashmir against Pakistani troops and jihadi camps, which India says Pakistan is running on its side of Kashmir. The Indians have already attacked along the LoC to prevent Kashmiri fighters from crossing into Indian Kashmir but never succeeded in acquiring the desired results. So far, India only uses artillery for launching these surgical strikes into Pakistani Kashmir but under the new strategy they will also use air strikes for hitting targets across the LoC. -- Hot pursuits that include physically crossing the LoC and battling envisaged jihadi camps or capturing certain areas. It is an open option, says the author. In any war scenario, India can use it.&quot; But if they do so, Pakistan is not going to sit quiet. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It will be an act of war which will not remain limited and it can escalate to a full-scale war and ultimately it can lead to a nuclear conflict if Pakistan's national interests are threatened,</span> the author warns. -- Cold start strategy for which India has been raising eight to 10 combat groups to implement this new strategy. Each group will include forces from the army and the air force and, if required, from the navy. Each combat group will have a hard-hitting force of 3,000-4,000 troops and it should be able to achieve its objective in 72 hours, before Pakistan reacts or approaches the international community. The author says that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Pakistan will not view an attack</span> by this new force <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as a limited war</span>. For us it will be a full-scale war, and Pakistan will respond with full resources, and if we fail to contain the Indians, the nuclear factor will definitely come in. Explaining how a conventional war can lead to a nuclear conflict, the author says: In<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> a full </span>conventional war, India has the potential to create impact<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. And if it does so, </span>it will force Pakistan to use its nuclear option.<br />

<strong><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Scenario 2 is North Africa</span></strong><br />
<strong>Climate migrations destabilize North Africa – the impacts are water wars, civil war, terrorism, collapse of the multilateral system, and war that sucks in the EU. Countries will respond by keeping climate migrants out magnifying the impacts.</strong><br />
Michael <strong>Werz and</strong> Kari <strong>Manlove,</strong> Senior Fellow @ American Progress, Research Associate for the Energy Opportunity Team, American Enterprise Institute, December 8, <strong>2009,</strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/12/on_the_move.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/12/on_the_move.html</a><br />
Africa will be one of the continents hardest hit by global warming. In the west and northwest, drought and desertification will intensify and threaten the livelihoods of local habitants. Sir Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, considers both the humanitarian and economic impacts on Africa in his groundbreaking climate change analysis. He cites Mali in the 1970s and 1980s as a precedent to the looming, potential conflict that water shortages and drought can cause. In that case, the native Tuareg were so devastated by drought that they were driven to other countries to seek sustainable livelihoods. Their migration and eventual return caused much unrest and rebellion. This example illustrates how northwestern Africa can become a battlefront, but other factors contribute to risk in the region: Sub-Saharan migrants enter the European Union through the region, and Islamist rebels threaten the governments of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, where Al Qaeda Maghreb’s presence has steadily grown in recent years. Resource allocation policies, drought, and water shortages are also factors within migration hubs like Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt, which all face their own environmental challenges. The European Union is keeping a close eye on these developments and how they could be affected by climate change. For example, the E.U. report, “Climate Change and International Security,” discusses mass migration and political destabilization that “puts the multilateral system at risk.” While this is a dark assessment, it appropriately calls attention to the issue. In response to growing migration pressures in Northern Africa, the European Union and especially the Spanish government have tightened border controls. The Spanish government, for example, has gone so far as to set up operations, such as sending officials of the Interior Ministry to countries like Senegal, Guinea-Conakry, Mali, Mauritania, and Cape Verde, often discouraging potential migrants from leaving. FRONTEX, a cooperative European effort on border security, has invested 24 million euros to control migratory routes toward Spain and control the coastal waters of Cape Verde, Morocco, Mauritania, and Senegal. Both the E.U. analysis and Spain’s actions reflect the understanding that increased climate migration amplifies existing security and humanitarian threats, which increases pressure on weak states along the North African coastline, and that these developments will affect Mediterranean security in a much broader sense.<br />

<strong>African civil war goes nuclear</strong><br />
Dr. Jeffrey <strong>Deutsch,</strong> founder of the Rabid Tiger Project, a political risk consulting and related research firm, 11-18-<strong>02,</strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rabidtigers.com/rtn/newsletterv2n9.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabidtigers.com/rtn/newsletterv2n9.html</a><br />
The Rabid Tiger Project believes that a nuclear war is most likely to start in Africa. Civil wars in the Congo (the country formerly known as Zaire), Rwanda, Somalia and Sierra Leone, and domestic instability in Zimbabwe, Sudan and other countries, as well as occasional brushfire and other wars (thanks in part to &quot;national&quot; borders that cut across tribal ones) turn into a really nasty stew. We've got all too many rabid tigers and potential rabid tigers, who are willing to push the button rather than risk being seen as wishy-washy in the face of a mortal threat and overthrown. Geopolitically speaking, Africa is open range. Very few countries in Africa are beholden to any particular power. South Africa is a major exception in this respect - not to mention in that she also probably already has the Bomb. Thus, outside powers can more easily find client states there than, say, in Europe where the political lines have long since been drawn, or Asia where many of the countries (China, India, Japan) are powers unto themselves and don't need any &quot;help,&quot; thank you. Thus, an African war can attract outside involvement very quickly. Of course, a proxy war alone may not induce the Great Powers to fight each other. But an African nuclear strike can ignite a much broader conflagration, if the other powers are interested in a fight. Certainly, such a strike would in the first place have been facilitated by outside help - financial, scientific, engineering, etc. Africa is an ocean of troubled waters, and some people love to go fishing.<br />
<br />
<strong><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Scenario 3 is Terrorism</span></strong><br />
<strong>Migration leads to terrorism</strong><br />
Paul J. <strong>Smith</strong>, associate professor of national security affairs at the US Naval War College, “Climate Change, Mass Migration and the Military Response,” Foreign Policy Research Institute, Fall <strong>2007</strong>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://transnet.act.nato.int/WISE/FSE/FuturesPap/ClimateCha0/file/_WFS/%20Orbis2--climate%20change%20and%20mass%20migration.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://transnet.act.nato.int/WISE/FSE/FuturesPap/ClimateCha0/file/_WFS/%20Orbis2--climate%20change%20and%20mass%20migration.pdf</a><br />
Another consideration related to climate change is the problem of weak or failed states, which are at high risk of being destabilized by climate change. Mass population movements (both internal and international) may be one mechanism through which this failure is triggered. Large and acute population movements may exacerbate internal social and ethnic tensions, or pose an enormous economic challenge that exceeds the host state’s ability to manage. Thus, climate change-induced environmental migration may cause states that are already experiencing social and economic instability to reach a ‘‘tipping point’’ leading to instability or state failure. A National Intelligence Council report assessing key security trends through the year 2020 asserted that ‘‘weak governments, lagging economies, religious extremism, and youth bulges will align to create a perfect storm for internal conflict in certain regions.’’55 In addition, as climate change contributes to state weakness or failure— a more likely scenario for poor, developing countries plagued with preexisting social and economic problems—it could lead to additional security challenges for the world community. For example, the 2005 U.S. National Defense Strategy states that ‘‘the absence of effective governance in many parts of the world creates sanctuaries for terrorists, criminals, and insurgents.’’56 Such an environment may invite outside military intervention, although probably at a stage where military forces would be less welcome and less able to restore order or mitigate the underlying causes of state failure.<br />

<strong>That causes US lash-out which escalates globally</strong><br />
Nicole <strong>Schwartz-Morgan,</strong> Assistant Professor of Politics and Economics at Royal Military College of Canada, 10/10<strong>/2001, “</strong>Wild Globalization and Terrorism,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2533:http://www.wfs.org/mmmorgan.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wfs.org/mmmorgan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wfs.org/mmmorgan.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2533 --><br />
The terrorist act can reactivate atavistic defense mechanisms which drive us to gather around clan chieftans. Nationalistic sentiment re-awakens, setting up an implacable frontier which divides &quot;us&quot; from &quot;them,&quot; each group solidifying its cohesion in a rising hate/fear of the other group. (Remember Yugoslavia?) To be sure, the allies are trying for the moment to avoid the language of polarization, insisting that &quot;this is not a war,&quot; that it is &quot;not against Islam,&quot; &quot;civilians will not be targeted.&quot; But the word &quot;war&quot; was pronounced, a word heavy with significance which forces the issue of partisanship. And it must be understood that the sentiment of partisanship, of belonging to the group, is one of the strongest of human emotions. Because the enemy has been named in the media (Islam), the situation has become emotionally volatile. Another spectacular attack, coming on top of an economic recession could easily radicalize the latent attitudes of the United States, and also of Europe, where racial prejudices are especially close to the surface and ask no more than a pretext to burst out. This is the Sarajevo syndrome: an isolated act of madness becomes the pretext for a war that is just as mad, made of ancestral rancor, measureless ambitions, and armies in search of a war. We should not be fooled by our expressions of good will and charity toward the innocent victims of this or other distant wars. It is our own comfortable circumstances which permit us these benevolent sentiments. If conditions change so that poverty and famine put the fear of starvation in our guts, the human beast will reappear. And if epidemic becomes a clear and present danger, fear will unleash hatred in the land of the free, flinging missiles indiscriminately toward any supposed havens of the unseen enemy. And on the other side, no matter how profoundly complex and differentiated Islamic nations and tribes may be, they will be forced to behave as one clan by those who see advantage in radicalizing the conflict,<br />

<strong>We get the best access to escalation – Migration destabilizes multiple flashpoints for conflict - the plan is key to generating momentum for a global migration framework.</strong><br />
Michael <strong>Werz and</strong> Kari <strong>Manlove,</strong> Senior Fellow @ American Progress, Research Associate for the Energy Opportunity Team, American Enterprise Institute, December 8, <strong>2009,</strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/12/on_the_move.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/12/on_the_move.html</a><br />
Fast forward to the year 2050. The world’s population will be up to 9 billion people according to the United Nations—an increase of one-third. More than 90 percent of this growth will take place in developing countries. Estimates also predict that 200 million people will be newly mobilized as climate migrants by 2050 due to global warming’s effects. This increased migration will very likely affect global security, which makes it imperative for the United States and other nations to begin formulating responses to climate migration now. As Thomas Friedman so bluntly writes, the world in 2050 will be crowded and it will be hot. Even if industrial and emerging societies were to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions tomorrow and reach instant carbon neutrality, existing pollution has locked into the atmosphere at least some unavoidable warming. No matter what steps the global community takes to mitigate emissions, we will still be forced to adapt to a warmer climate. Global warming’s consequences will be felt much earlier than 2050, too. Climate scientists argue that extreme weather events and resource shortages will affect millions of people in Africa, Australia, and Latin America by 2050. In Asia, warming will shrink freshwater resources from large river basins that could adversely affect 1 billion people. Parts of Africa could see rain-fed agricultural yields fall by much as 50 percent from today’s output, threatening food insecurity on top of water insecurity. Melting snowcaps in the Andean region will harm important agricultural regions in Latin America. CAP President and CEO John Podesta and his former CAP colleague Peter Ogden framed the stark reality of adaptation to a warmer climate two years ago: “Science only tells part of the story. The geopolitical consequences of climate change are determined by local political, social, and economic factors as much as by the magnitude of the climate shift itself.” And it’s inevitable that as global warming intensifies hurricanes, drought, and adds to resource shortages, we will need to prepare for extreme circumstances, including human migration. In 1991, Tropical Cyclone Gorky hit the Chittagong district of Southeastern Bangladesh and a 20-foot storm surge made landfall, killing approximately 138,000 people and leaving 10 million homeless. Refugees from natural disasters usually can return home over time—as in this case—but future climate migrants could be permanently forced to leave. Climate migration is often a result of natural disasters, but resource scarcity, food security, and water shortages will also be important drivers of voluntary and long-term climate migration in the 21st century. Worldwide, estimates suggest that as many as 200 million people could become climate migrants by 2050. Today there are roughly 214 million migrants globally, meaning if climate migration projections come true, they will double the total level of migration worldwide. In some cases, climate migration hot spots overlap with already volatile and unstable regions, where substantial migration could easily give rise to border conflicts and national security concerns. These factors will undoubtedly affect 21st century migration, and the United States and other nations would be wise to factor these new forms of human mobility into long-term policy strategies and security assessments now. We’ll offer a framework that can be used to address climate migration and its effects on security below. But first, we’d like to outline a handful of specific regions that could see migration and conflict due to a changing climate. Any assessment of climate migration and its security impacts should pay close attention to these areas.<br />

 <strong>Obama lacks leadership on climate change – both the NPP and the Durban talks were initiated by other countries.</strong><br />
<strong>New York Times, 6-22</strong>- John M. Broder, June 22, 2011, “Gore Criticizes Obama for Record on Climate”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/science/earth/23gore.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/science/earth/23gore.html</a><br />
Former Vice President Al <u>Gore sharply criticized</u> President Obama as lacking leadership on climate change in a magazine essay published online Wednesday, saying his policies had been little more effective than those of President George W. Bush. Related in Opinion In the 7,000-word article in Rolling Stone, Mr. Gore said that Mr. Obama clearly understood the threat to the planet posed by global warming and that he had appointed a number of committed environmental advocates to key positions. But Mr. Gore said that in the face of<span class="underline"> well-financed </span>attacks from fossil fuel industries<span class="underline"> and denial </span>and<span class="underline"> delay from </span>Republicans<span class="underline"> in Congress, Mr. </span>Obama had failed to act decisively to alter the nation’s policies on climate change<span class="underline"> and energy. </span>Addressing climate change on national and international levels will require forceful American leadership<span class="underline">, Mr. Gore said. “Yet President Obama has never presented to the American people the magnitude of the climate crisis,” he wrote. “</span>He has<span class="underline"> simply </span>not made the case for action<span class="underline">. He has not defended the science against the ongoing, withering and dishonest attacks. </span>Nor has he provided a presidential venue for the scientific community<span class="underline"> — including our own National Academy — </span>to bring the reality of the science before the public<span class="underline">.”</span> A White House spokesman defended Mr. Obama’s record in a written statement. “The president has been clear since Day 1 that climate change poses a threat domestically and globally, and under his leadership we have taken the most aggressive steps in our country’s history to tackle this challenge,” said Clark Stevens, a White House press officer. Under Mr. Obama, Mr. Stevens said, the United States has spent billions of dollars on clean-energy technology, imposed tough new emissions standards for cars and trucks and taken the lead in international talks on climate change. Mr. Gore’s extended outburst of frustration signals a public turning point for him, and perhaps for other environmental advocates who have been quietly seething for months over what they view as the administration’s timidity. Mr. Gore, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize for his climate advocacy, praised some of the president’s actions, including the new vehicle standards and the investments in green technology. But in recent months<span class="underline"> he has told friends that </span>the president has been too passive on climate change and has not been sufficiently supportive of Lisa P. Jackson, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who has tried to advance greenhouse gas regulation against stiff Congressional opposition. Much of Mr. Gore’s essay is devoted to criticism of the news media as failing to report accurately on the scientific consensus that climate change is real and that it is most likely caused by human activities. He said the media had been cowed by an aggressive lobbying and public relations campaign financed by the oil, gas and coal industries, or had presented ideological entertainment in the guise of news reporting. Mr. Obama has tried to move the country away from fossil fuels, and has made the connection between oil imports and national security, Mr. Gore wrote. “But in spite of these and other achievements, President Obama has<span class="underline"> thus far </span>failed<span class="underline"> to use the bully pulpit </span>to make the case for bold action on climate change<span class="underline">,” he said. “</span>After successfully passing his green stimulus package, he did nothing to defend it when Congress decimated its funding. After the House passed cap and trade, he did little to make passage in the Senate a priority.” Paul Bledsoe, a former energy aide in the Clinton White House and now senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said: “I entirely disagree with Gore here. Obama has consistently made a compelling case for climate action based on the science and has fought in Congress and internationally for robust policies to cut emissions and promote clean energy. The administration’s failing on climate has in fact been political.” Mr. Gore also turned to public officials of both parties. “Many politicians, unfortunately, also fall into the same two categories: those who cheerlead for the deniers and those who cower before them,” he wrote. “The latter group now includes several candidates for the Republican presidential nomination who have felt it necessary to abandon their previous support for action on the climate crisis; at least one has been apologizing profusely to the deniers and begging for their forgiveness.” Mr. Gore does not name them, but Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts; Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former governor of Utah and ambassador to China; and Tim Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota, have backtracked on their support for state and federal action to address global warming. Near the end of the article, Mr. Gore acknowledged that he might be hobbling a president trying to do the right thing in a difficult environment. “All of his supporters understand that it would be self-defeating to weaken Obama and heighten the risk of another step backward,” he wrote. But he said he felt compelled to speak out because the stakes were incalculable. “The climate crisis,<span class="underline"> in reality, </span>is a struggle for the soul of America,” Mr. Gore concluded, using the voice of prophet and teacher that he has assumed on this topic for more than 20 years. “<span class="underline">It is about whether or not we are still capable</span> — given the ill health of our democracy and the current dominance of wealth over reason — of perceiving important and complex realities clearly enough to promote and protect the sustainable well-being of the many. What hangs in the balance is the future of civilization as we know it<span class="underline">.”</span><br />

<strong>However, US-first action solidifies environmental leadership and credibility</strong><br />
Norbert <strong>Walter,</strong> chief economist at Deutsche Bank Group, “An American Abdication,” New York Times (NYT), 8/28/<strong>2002,</strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E7DE1F3CF93BA1575BC0A9649C8B63" rel="nofollow">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E7DE1F3CF93BA1575BC0A9649C8B63</a><br />
At present there is much talk about the unparalleled strength of the United States on the world stage. Yet at this very moment the most powerful country in the world stands to forfeit much political capital, moral authority and international good will by dragging its feet on the next great global issue: the environment. Before long, the administration's apparent unwillingness to take a leadership role -- or, at the very least, to stop acting as a brake -- in fighting global environmental degradation will threaten the very basis of the American supremacy that many now seem to assume will last forever. American authority is already in some danger as a result of the Bush administration's decision to send a low-level delegation to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg -- low-level, that is, relative to America's share of both the world economy and global pollution. The absence of President Bush from Johannesburg symbolizes this decline in authority. In recent weeks, newspapers around the world have been dominated by environmental headlines: In central Europe, flooding killed dozens, displaced tens of thousands and caused billions of dollars in damages. In South Asia, the United Nations reports a brown cloud of pollution that is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths a year from respiratory disease. The pollution (80 percent man-made) also cuts sunlight penetration, thus reducing rainfall, affecting agriculture and otherwise altering the climate. Many other examples of environmental degradation, often related to the warming of the atmosphere, could be cited. What they all have in common is that they severely affect countries around the world and are fast becoming a chief concern for people everywhere. Nobody is suggesting that these disasters are directly linked to anything the United States is doing. But when a country that emits 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases acts as an uninterested, sometimes hostile bystander in the environmental debate, it looks like unbearable arrogance to many people abroad. The administration seems to believe it is merely an observer -- that environmental issues are not its issues. But not doing anything amounts to ignoring a key source of world tension, and no superpower that wants to preserve its status can go on dismissing such a pivotal dimension of political and economic -- if not existential -- conflict. In my view, there is a clear-cut price to be paid for ignoring the views of just about every other country in the world today. The United States is jettisoning its hard-won moral and intellectual authority and perhaps the strategic advantages that come with being a good steward of the international political order. The United States may no longer be viewed as a leader or reliable partner in policymaking: necessary, perhaps inevitable, but not desirable, as it has been for decades. All of this because America's current leaders are not willing to acknowledge the very real concerns of many people about global environmental issues. No one can expect the United States to provide any quick fixes, but one would like to see America make a credible and sustained effort, along with other countries, to address global environmental problems. This should happen on two fronts. The first is at home in the United States, through more environmentally friendly policies, for example greater fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks and better insulation for buildings. The second is international, through a more cooperative approach to multilateral attempts at safeguarding the environment. Simply rejecting international treaties (like the Kyoto Protocol) then failing to offer a better proposal cannot be an acceptable option for American policymakers. Much of the world has come together to help the United States in the fight against terrorism, out of the realization that a common threat can only be beaten through a cooperative effort. It is high time for the United States, metaphorically speaking, to get out of its oversized, gas-guzzling S.U.V. -- and join the rest of the world in doing more to combat global warming and protecting the planet<strong>.</strong><br />

The shape of U.S. policy has many origins. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The United States found it especially difficult to meet the emissions targets set forth in the Kyoto Protocol </span>primarily because its own emissions rose rapidly during the economic boom of the late 1990s and because it chose not to require emissions reductions; the E<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">uropean </span>U<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nion</span>, by contrast, has seen its emissions rise much less sharplyfor a variety of reasons linked to its slower population growth, generally less robust economic expansion, fortuitous changes in its energy systems, and its active policies to cut emissions.20 The perceived lack of<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> a sufficiently </span>aggressive <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">U.S. </span>policy, along with the<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> United States’ </span>failure to ratify<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the </span>Kyoto<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Protocol at a time when many in the world view climate change as a paramount danger for the planet, </span>has undercut <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">U.S. </span>credibility in addressing global challenges. To be certain, the United States has adopted a variety of policies that will lead emissions to be lower than they otherwise would be, something discussed in more detail in the next chapter.

A rejuvenated America, with a renewed purpose<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, commitment and energy to make its contribution once again towards a better world </span>could well be the turning point that can reverse the current decline in <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the state of the global economy, </span>the health of its life support systems <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the morale of people everywhere</span>. This extraordinary change in regime brings with it the promise of a deep change in attitudes and aspirations of Americans, a change that will lead, hopefully, to new directions in their nation’s policies and action. In particular, we can hope that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">from being a very reluctant partner in global discussions, especially on issues relating to environment and sustainable development, the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will become an active leader in international efforts to address the Millennial threats</span> now confronting civilization and even the survival of the human species. For the conservation of biodiversity, so essential to maintaining life on Earth, this promise of change has come not a moment too soon. It would be a mistake to put all of our hopes on the shoulder of one young man, however capable he might be. The environmental challenges the world is facing cannot be addressed by one country, let alone by one man. At the same time, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">an inspired </span>US<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> President guided by competent people</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">who does not shy away from exercising the true responsibilities and leadership</span> his country is capable of, could do a lot to spur the international community into action. To paraphrase one of his illustrious predecessors, “the world asks for action and action now.” What was true in President Roosevelt’s America 77 years ago is even more appropriate today. From IUCN’s perspective, the first signals are encouraging. The US has seriously begun to discuss constructive engagement in climate change debates. With Copenhagen a mere 11 months away, this commitment is long overdue and certainly very welcome. Many governments still worry that if they set tough standards to control carbon emissions, their industry and agriculture will become uncompetitive, a fear that leads to a foot-dragging “you go first” attitude that is blocking progress<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. A positive intervention by the United States could provide </span>the vital catalyst that moves<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the basis of the present </span>negotiations beyond<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the narrowly defined </span>national interests<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that lie at the heart of the current impasse. The logjam in international negotiations on climate change should not be difficult to break if the US were to lead</span> the industrialized countries to agree that much of their wealth has been acquired at the expense of the environment (in this case greenhouse gases emitted over the past two hundred years) and that with the some of the benefits that this wealth has brought, comes the obligation to deal with the problems that have resulted as side-effects. With equitable entitlement to the common resources of the planet, an agreement that is fair and acceptable to all nations should be easy enough to achieve. Caps on emissions and sharing of energy efficient technologies are simply in the interest of everyone, rich or poor. And both rich and poor must now be ready to adopt less destructive technologies – based on renewables, efficiency and sustainability – both as a goal with intrinsic merit and also as an example to others. But climate is not the only critical global environmental issue that this new administration will have to deal with. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Conservation of biodiversity, a crucial prerequisite for the wellbeing of all humanity</span>, no less America, needs as much attention, and just as urgently. The United States’ self-interest in conserving living natural resources strongly <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">converges </span>with the global common good in every sphere: in the oceans,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> by arresting the precipitate decline of fish stocks and the alarming rise of acidification; </span>on land, by regenerating the health of our soils, forests and rivers; and in the atmosphere by reducing the massive emission of pollutants<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> from our wasteful industries, construction, agriculture and transport systems.</span><br />

<strong>CLARREO ensures accurate data and guarantees successful adaptation</strong><br />
<strong>Madigan 11</strong> – Jay Madigan, Senior Engineer and Web Development - Science Programmer at SSAI /NASA, 03/15/2011, “Societal Benefits,” online: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2536:http://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/about-SocietalBenefits.php --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/about-SocietalBenefits.php" rel="nofollow">http://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/about-SocietalBenefits.php</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2536 --><br />
In 2007, the National Research Council (NRC) conducted a survey of Earth science and its applications from space, identifying key scientific questions and societal objectives on which to focus Earth observations beginning in 2005. The Council organized the science missions into three time-phased tiers, identifying the mission(s) most appropriate to answer key science questions and address societal objectives. In addition to the NRC’s Decadal Survey, a summary of the policy documents that support the science goals of the CLARREO mission can be found here. Selected as a high-priority, tier one mission, the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) is a climate mission that will bring revolutionary accuracy to climate measurement—and provide a global benchmark measurement for conclusively determining long-term climate trends. The urgency for CLARREO results from the growing need for higher accuracy, long-term climate change observations than current instruments are capable of providing. Data from CLARREO will dramatically increase how accurately we define the real climate future that society faces—and assist policy makers in formulating more informed decisions about how to respond. The timing of the CLARREO mission is a result of recent advances in a wide range of scientific, measurement, and technological areas. These advances combine to enable CLARREO to be a completely new type of climate mission: a mission focused on accuracy at decade time scales. Because CLARREO measurements will cover the majority of the solar and infrared spectrum, CLARREO will provide this accuracy for most of the climate variables essential for assessing climate change, greatly expanding the uses of existing space-based data sets for societal benefit. Previous Earth science missions have focused on providing data for one aspect of the climate system such as clouds or aerosols. CLARREO will provide a global perspective of climate change, becoming the first mission to collect data that provide a single and highly accurate view of the entire climate system. By obtaining this global view, CLARREO will be used by climate modelers and decision makers to accurately predict climate change and to develop intelligent plans and methods to minimize and adapt to it. Kevin Brown, CLARREO Project Manager who is leading the CLARREO mission states, “The integrity of CLARREO measurements and their ability to accurately portray the Earth’s climate on a global scale, allows for greater confidence in policy derived from CLARREO observations.” CLARREO differs from other satellites because its measurements are tied to internationally-recognized standards, the same type of rigorously-tested standards used by National Metrology Institutes to determine the temperature of a material or length of a second. Using these international standards, measurements from CLARREO, as well as other satellites, may be pooled into one long-term observational record that is free from small drifts in measurements due to slight differences between satellites. This allows scientists to test the satellite observations for small errors that mirror the variability of the climate itself. Testing for these errors provides for a clear interpretation of measurement trends, greatly enhancing confidence in the data’s accuracy.<br />

CLARREO is a Highly Leveraged Interdisciplinary Climate Change Mission • Accurate decadal-length records are essential for climate change detection, attribution, and for testing climate prediction accuracy. They represent the most critical test of uncertainty in future climate change prediction. • While process study missions (e.g. CALIPSO/CloudSat) are critical to improve underlying climate model physics (e.g. clouds), decadal change observations are critical to determine the impact of those climate model improvements on the accuracy of predicting future climate change. Both elements are critical, and CLARREO is the major Decadal Study mission addressing serious accuracy issues in decadal climate change observation. • The CLARREO mission is unique in its broad interdisciplinary impact on climate change science: the other NRC Decadal Survey missions are primarily focused on one climate process or discipline. • CLARREO provides new solar reflected and infrared emitted high spectral resolution benchmark radiance climate data records that can be used to test climate model predictions, improve climate change fingerprinting, and attribution. • CLARREO provides an orbiting calibration observatory that can be used to calibrate other solar and infrared space-borne sensors (e.g. VIIRS, CrIS, Landsat, Geostationary, CERES) and thereby improve to climate accuracy a wide range of sensors across the GEO observing system. It also improves the scientific value of all of these instruments. • Key climate variable decadal records<br />

The ability of this CLARREO mission to calibrate passive sensors on-orbit via SI traceability and to address sampling issues without subsidiary information is a notable departure from the current strategy pursued for climate satellite records. The necessity for this departure was recognized by the NRC as follows: NRC Objective: Global Benchmark Climate Record Benchmark Observations: What are they? The NRC Decadal Survey recognized that when the global climate record emerges as a significant contributor to public policy (societal) decisions, that record will be attacked relentlessly. If the climate record cannot stand up to those attacks, the record cannot effectively serve society. Recognition of this led to the requirement that the design of climate observing and monitoring systems from space must ensure the establishment of global, long-term climate records, which are of high accuracy, tested for systematic errors on-orbit, and tied to irrefutable standards such as those maintained in the U.S. by the National Institute of Standards and Technology For the NRC report, this mission definition was essential for the prioritization process that fully considered scientific/societal impact, cost, ability to complement other systems, degree of readiness, risk mitigation, and contributions to other thematic areas. The ASIC3 report also chose a CLARREO-like mission as one of its high priority recommendations based on similar requirements. Once the context of responsiveness to societal objectives is understood, the path leading all the way to details of instrument design may be defined. A summary of requirements flowdown from high level science requirements to data products to mission and payload requirements for the IR and GPS components is included below.<br />

 <strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">U.S. climate satellites are battered and outdated—inevitable data gaps destroy environmental monitoring</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Bohan 10</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">—Suzanne Bohan, Washington Post writer, Sept 19, 2010, “A dim view for Earth emerges” Washington Post pg. A06</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The satellite, Landsat 7, is broken. And it's emblematic of the nation's battered satellite environmental monitoring program. The bad news: It's only going to get worse, unless the federal agencies criticized for their poor management of the satellite systems over the past decade stage a fast turnaround. Many, however, view that prospect as a long shot. &quot;I would say our ability to observe the Earth from space is at grave risk of dying from neglect,&quot; said Field, director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University. Inez Fung, a noted climatologist at the University of California at Berkeley, was shocked as she scanned a recent federal report warning of impending gaps in the country's ability to monitor Earth from space. The federal document, released in May, listed cuts in climate-monitoring sensors from the next generation of Earth-observing satellites. The current satellites beam down many types of indispensable data about the planet, such as ocean currents, ozone levels and snow cover, as well as the pictures viewers see every day on TV weathercasts. But key instruments on the new satellites have been eliminated: Gone is a sensor that would relay new data about the atmosphere and environmental conditions in the ocean and along coastal areas. The movement of pollutants and greenhouse gaseswould have been under the instrument's mechanical gaze, as well. Also absent is a critical sensor that monitors temperature changes over time on Earth. &quot;That's like if you have a sick patient, and then say, 'I have no more thermometers,' &quot; Fung said. In all, nine new climate instruments on the next generation of satellites were canceled or their capabilities scaled back in 2006, according to the Government Accountability Office report. Combined with a five-year delay in launching these next-generation satellites, with the first scheduled to blast off in 2011, these canceled or &quot;degraded&quot; instruments leave the nation facing critical gaps in satellite monitoring of the planet beginning in 2015, the report stated. And a National Academy of Sciences analysis of the disarray in the satellite program stressed that because of Earth's growing population, it's more crucial than ever to monitor pollution, water quality, land use and other environmental conditions. Many blame the cuts on Bush administration policies that favored manned moon and Mars missions over shoring up aging Earth-observing satellite systems. Critics cite a 30 percent decline between 2000 and 2006 in NASA's Earth science budget - which funds environmental satellites - as evidence of the administration's lukewarm support of keeping an eye on the planet's condition. The National Academy of Sciences report, along with a chorus of experts in the field, also warns that the country is at risk of losing its worldwide technological leadership in Earth-observing satellites. Other casualties of the 2006 cuts include an instrument for tracking airborne particles such as sea spray, smog, volcanic ash and smoke - all factors contributing to the warming or cooling of the planet. The inclusion of a new instrument for monitoring soil moisture was canceled, which would have yielded information valuable to, among others, farmers and those monitoring the spread of deserts worldwide. These cuts spell a 46 percent decline in data about the Earth's conditions that these new satellites were designed to provide, and the GAO report concluded that because of the trouble-plagued satellite program, &quot;our nation's ability to understand climate change may be limited.&quot; Those in the field use harsher language. Many Earth-monitoring satellites &quot;are really in desperate shape,&quot; said Field, with Stanford's Carnegie Institution. In the 1960s, the United States began using satellites to observe its lands, oceans, atmosphere and the space environment near Earth. The satellites continuously monitor the planet's dynamic environment and allow humans to peer into inaccessible places. Information beamed by these spacecraft is now essential for forecasting weather, tracking conditions on Earth and in its atmosphere, and projecting long-term climate trends. With satellite data, rising sea levels can be monitored, helping communities on islands and along coastal areas plan. Satellites help farmers assess soil conditions before planting, allow foresters to examine logging activities, let water managers monitor the mountain snowpack that provides water to cities, and track the migration of wildlife such as buffalo and elephants. Satellite data are also essential for crafting international agreements for reducing global warming, said Molly Macauley, an economist with Resources for the Future, a research institute in Washington.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">There is wide acceptance in the scientific community that there are likely to be “tipping points” in the climate system, where a significant, qualitative change in state occurs in response to a small perturbation. Crossing such tipping points could lead to accelerated, committed or irreversible change. However there is substantial scientific uncertainty in quantifying the position and likelihood of passing key thresholds, and in terms of associated impacts. Current estimates of the likelihood of triggering large-scale and/or irreversible climate events are largely based on expert judgement, informed by paleo-climatic evidence, computer models and current understanding of the underlying physical processes. The high level of uncertainty, combined with the potential for very significant impacts if one or more “tipping points” were to be triggered, means that the policy response is likely to require a risk management approach. Paleo-climate reconstructions provide evidence of past rapid change events, for example the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which took place around 50 million years ago and involved a major climatic warming which took place over around 1000 years, possibly driven by rapid methane release. Current cumulative anthropogenic carbon release is around one third of the way towards the level that triggered such events in the past. Climate models are used to provide short term forecasts and longer term projections, to interpret recent climatic variations and paleo-climatic changes, and to understand the physical processes that may drive threshold behaviour. However several examples are known where the models used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment may not represent physical mechanisms of tipping elements correctly, due to limitations in resolution and in the processes that can currently be included in models. ‘Early warnings’ for tipping points through Earth system monitoring may be possible and may help manage the risks, although the uncertainty in modelling such events remains large. Three types of ‘health check’ approach were mentioned: (i) general statistical methods, (ii) process-based identification of key variables to monitor, and (iii) initial value prediction. Each was seen to have different advantages and disadvantages. The critical need for long-term monitoring was emphasised, while many existing observations are tied to short-term research programs. A clear set of long term monitoring priorities for tipping points has not yet been developed. It is important to be able to interpret ‘surprises’ in new observations (e.g. the 2007 dip in Arctic sea-ice), so that such observations can be put into context. These interpretations must be developed through careful application of quantitative, process-based knowledge of the climate system. After a high level review of the scientific evidence, the meeting considered how the risk of “tipping points” and system thresholds could be better included in policy development and wider public debate. There was consensus that the science in this area is particularly hard to communicate clearly. In part this is due to the danger of communicating an overly negative message; positive messages that make the public feel part of the solution are more likely to effect behaviour change. There was broad agreement on the requirement for a set of different (but self-consistent) narratives to meet the needs of individual audiences, using metaphors to aid clarity and understanding, and applying a risk-management framework.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gases increased over the course of the 20th century due to human activities. The human-caused increases in these gases are the primary forcing that accounts for much of the global warming of the past fifty years, with carbon dioxide being the most important single radiative forcing agent (1). Recent studies have shown that the human-caused warming linked to carbon dioxide is nearly irreversible for more than 1,000 y, even if emissions of the gas were to cease entirely (2–5). The importance of the ocean in taking up heat and slowing the response of the climate system to radiative forcing changes has been noted in many studies (e.g., refs. 6 and 7). The key role of the ocean’s thermal lag has also been highlighted by recent approaches to proposed metrics for comparing the warming of different greenhouse gases (8, 9). Among the observations attesting to the importance of these effects are those showing that climate changes caused by transient volcanic aerosol loading persist for more than 5 y (7, 10), and a portion can be expected to last more than a century in the ocean (11–13); clearly these signals persist far longer than the radiative forcing decay timescale of about 12–18 mo for the volcanic aerosol (14, 15). Thus the observed climate response to volcanic events suggests that some persistence of climate change should be expected even for quite short-lived radiative forcing perturbations. It follows that the climate changes induced by short-lived anthropogenic greenhouse gases such as methane or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) may not decrease in concert with decreases in concentration if the anthropogenic emissions of those gases were to be eliminated. In this paper, our primary goal is to show how different processes and timescales contribute to determining how long the climate changes due to various greenhouse gases could be expected to remain if anthropogenic emissions were to cease. Advances in modeling have led to improved AtmosphereOcean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) as well as to Earth Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs). Although a detailed representation of the climate system changes on regional scales can only be provided by AOGCMs, the simpler EMICs have been shown to be useful, particularly to examine phenomena on a global average basis. In this work, we use the Bern 2.5CC EMIC (see Materials and Methods and SI Text), which has been extensively intercompared to other EMICs and to complex AOGCMs (3, 4). It should be noted that, although the Bern 2.5CC EMIC includes a representation of the surface and deep ocean, it does not include processes such as ice sheet losses or changes in the Earth’s albedo linked to evolution of vegetation. However, it is noteworthy that this EMIC, although parameterized and simplified, includes 14 levels in the ocean; further, its global ocean heat uptake and climate sensitivity are near the mean of available complex models, and its computed timescales for uptake of tracers into the ocean have been shown to compare well to observations (16). A recent study (17) explored the response of one AOGCM to a sudden stop of all forcing, and the Bern 2.5CC EMIC shows broad similarities in computed warming to that study (see Fig. S1), although there are also differences in detail. The climate sensitivity (which characterizes the long-term absolute warming response to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations) is 3 °C for the model used here. Our results should be considered illustrative and exploratory rather than fully quantitative given the limitations of the EMIC and the uncertainties in climate sensitivity. Results One Illustrative Scenario to 2050. In the absence of mitigation policy, concentrations of the three major greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide can be expected to increase in this century. If emissions were to cease, anthropogenic CO2 would be removed from the atmosphere by a series of processes operating at different timescales (18). Over timescales of decades, both the land and upper ocean are important sinks. Over centuries to millennia, deep oceanic processes become dominant and are controlled by relatively well-understood physics and chemistry that provide broad consistency across models (see, for example, Fig. S2 showing how the removal of a pulse of carbon compares across a range of models). About 20% of the emitted anthropogenic carbon remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years (with a range across models including the Bern 2.5CC model being about 19 4% at year 1000 after a pulse emission; see ref. 19), until much slower weathering processes affect the carbonate balance in the ocean (e.g., ref. 18). Models with stronger carbon/climate feedbacks than the one considered here could display larger and more persistent warmings due to both CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gases, through reduced land and ocean uptake of carbon in a warmer world. Here our focus is not on the strength of carbon/climate feedbacks that can lead to differences in the carbon concentration decay, but rather on the factors that control the climate response to a given decay. The removal processes of other anthropogenic gases including methane and nitrous oxide are much more simply described by exponential decay constants of about 10 and 114 y, respectively (1), due mainly to known chemical reactions in the atmosphere. In this illustrative study, we do not include the feedback of changes in methane upon its own lifetime (20). We also do not account for potential interactions between CO2 and other gases, such as the production of carbon dioxide from methane oxidation (21), or changes to the carbon cycle through, e.g., methane/ozone chemistry (22). Fig. 1 shows the computed future global warming contributions for carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide for a midrange scenario (23) of projected future anthropogenic emissions of these gases to 2050. Radiative forcings for all three of these gases, and their spectral overlaps, are represented in this work using the expressions assessed in ref. 24. In 2050, the anthropogenic emissions are stopped entirely for illustration purposes. The figure shows nearly irreversible warming for at least 1,000 y due to the imposed carbon dioxide increases, as in previous work. All published studies to date, which use multiple EMICs and one AOGCM, show largely irreversible warming due to future carbon dioxide increases (to within about 0.5 °C) on a timescale of at least 1,000 y (3–5, 25, 26). Fig. 1 shows that the calculated future warmings due to anthropogenic CH4 and N2O also persist notably longer than the lifetimes of these gases. The figure illustrates that emissions of key non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as CH4 or N2O could lead to warming that both temporarily exceeds a given stabilization target (e.g., 2 °C as proposed by the G8 group of nations and in the Copenhagen goals) and remains present longer than the gas lifetimes even if emissions were to cease. A number of recent studies have underscored the important point that reductions of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions are an approach that can indeed reverse some past climate changes (e.g., ref. 27). Understanding how quickly such reversal could happen and why is an important policy and science question. Fig. 1 implies that the use of policy measures to reduce emissions of short-lived gases will be less effective as a rapid climate mitigation strategy than would be thought if based only upon the gas lifetime. Fig. 2 illustrates the factors influencing the warming contributions of each gas for the test case in Fig. 1 in more detail, by showing normalized values (relative to one at their peaks) of the warming along with the radiative forcings and concentrations of CO2 , N2O, and CH4 . For example, about two-thirds of the calculated warming due to N2O is still present 114 y (one atmospheric lifetime) after emissions are halted, despite the fact that its excess concentration and associated radiative forcing at that time has dropped to about one-third of the peak value</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> Most scientists agree that global warming affects ecological systems, but there is less certainty about its social effects, especially regarding human mobility. Yet this has not prevented a number of scholars, multilateral agencies, and nongovernmental organizations from making alarming predictions that climate change processes will trigger historically unprecedented waves of mass migration. The more widely cited estimates for the number of people displaced by 2050 range from 50 million (UN University's Institute for Environment and Human Security) to 200 million (International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Stern Review). If the higher estimates pan out, climate change-related migration could dwarf current numbers of refugees and internally displaced people — about 45 million and 9 million by United Nations estimates, respectively. While there are no scientifically verified estimates of the number of people that will be displaced by climate change, several studies by UN agencies, IOM, and NGOs, including an influential report published in 2009, already show evidence that environmentally induced migration is occurring. Also, despite controversy surrounding the specifics of climate change data, there is no evidence to contradict the expected trend of continued global warming for at least a few decades to come. This article will examine the complex links between climate change and migration, how and where these links influence current and future migration patterns, and some of the problems with predicting future flows. It will also outline some current policy approaches and look at where the debate is headed. The Climate Change–Migration Nexus Migration has helped humans cope with environmental changes, such as droughts and floods, for centuries. The frequency, severity, and duration of such changes affect the broad types of migration patterns — temporary, permanent, internal, or international — that take place. The prevailing tendency thus far has been toward more circular, internal movements of people from mostly rural to urban areas and within national boundaries or regions. These trends are evident, for example, in the seasonal labor migration of Central American, Mexican, and West African farmers to compensate for lower agricultural productivity in rural areas, as well as in the temporary displacement of thousands of Bangladeshis to their capital, Dhaka, in response to annual monsoon floods. However, severe environmental damage, whether natural or manmade, can leave populations with little recourse but to move permanently and en-masse. This happened in the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Great Plains of the United States. Below-average rainfall, accompanied by the Great Depression, resulted in the widespread failure of small farms and the migration of about 300,000 &quot;Okies&quot; to California. Currently, people are beginning to leave some small island nations in the Pacific with low elevations because the islands are suffering high rates of coastal erosion and experiencing rising sea levels. Environmental degradation is also increasingly common in those areas, such as in West Africa and Haiti, where depleted agricultural land can no longer produce crops sustainably and is abandoned. Scientific evidence shows a trend toward rising sea and air temperatures. Manmade environmental degradation, which includes everything from fuel emissions to deforestation, is accelerating this trend. Global warming is expected to affect the climate through gradual processes, such as glacial melting, as well as through an increase in extreme weather events like cyclones. Both gradual changes and extreme weather events can heighten pressures on land, food, and water resources. In turn, these pressures can contribute to existing problems, including food insecurity, malnutrition, poverty, the spread of disease, rapid urbanization, and political instability, in areas of the world that already struggle with some of these issues. Add to the mix likely population growth, which demographers expect in places like Bangladesh and sub-Saharan Africa, and the chances of new or intensified migration patterns increase.</span><br />

However, the legal status of those who are forced to leave their countries because of environmental factors is less clear: the term “environmental refugee” is poorly defined and has no legally binding mechanisms of protection or support.68 Despite many uncertainties about the delimitation of the definition of environmentally induced migration and its measurement, one fact remains certain in the face of the expected effects of climate change: the part played by environmental degradation and extreme weather events as causes of migration will increase.

One study refers to ‘clashes of national identity’ that may be caused by immigration if the dominance of one resident ethnic group is threatened.72 In the most extreme cases, migration has led to violent conflict in receiving areas. For example, civil wars in Jordan and Lebanon have involved Palestinian migrants; in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Hutu refugees from Rwanda contributed to local conflicts; and in Macedonia, refugees from Kosovo led to a minor armed conflict.73 On a smaller scale, internal migration has led to ethnic tensions in the North East regions of India as well as in non-Javanese regions of Indonesia.74 However, it is important to note that migrants themselves should not be labeled threats. These people, if they leave their home country, will be refugees, having been forced to leave by environmental or other factors. They will need support and protection. Migration will therefore need to be managed, rather than simply controlled.75 • Scenario Experts say </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Bangladesh could be the ground zero of climate change-induced migration</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, mostly </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">due to sea level rise. The country's 150 million inhabitants live in the delta of three waterways, and the majority of the country sits less than 20 feet above sea level</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">. It is also one of the poorest countries in the world. Although the knowledge on impact of sea level rise on Bangladesh remains limited, the past and current effects of sea level rise along the country’s coast are apparent. Accelerated sea level rise driven by global climate change has, for decades, badly affected Bangladesh coast through permanent inundation, drainage congestion in the polders, storm surge inundation and increased salinity intrusion of low-lying areas. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Floods and storms</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> also </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">pose increasing threat of damage to infrastructures, destruction of fisheries, reduction of cultivated land, crop failures and the loss of biodiversity</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> across the countries, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">which</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> as well </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">could affect </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">people</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline"> settlements.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> The UN's IPCC predicts a global sea-level rise in the range of 18-59cm during the 21st century.76 Specifically for Bangladesh, World Bank expects 10 cm, 25cm and near 1 m rise in sea level by 2020, 2050 and 2100; affecting 2%, 4% and 17% of total land mass respectively.77 At the top of this range at one meter rise, it is expected that approximately 20 million people would be displaced.78 Bangladesh government actually acknowledges the 20 million figure in its Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan 2009, saying “(cross border) migration must be considered as a valid option for the country”.79 </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Once the displacement starts to occur, most will move inland, which will foment instability as the resettled population competes for already scarce resources and jobs with established residents.

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">No conventional war between India and Pakistan will remain limited for long and will gradually lead to a full-scale war and ultimately to a nuclear conflict, warns a study by a Pakistani defense official. The study, presented recently at a Washington think-tank, looks at various scenarios that could lead to an all-out war</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> between the two South Asian neighbors, which conducted a series of nuclear tests in May 1998 and also possess nuclear-capable missiles. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from Britain in 1947 and are still engaged in 57-year-old conflict in the Himalayan valley of Kashmir which caused two of these three wars. Most of the possible war scenarios discussed in this study also focus on Kashmir where most international observers believe even a small conflict has the potential of escalating into a full-fledged war. Recently, both India and Pakistan have agreed to resolve their differences through dialogue and have taken several steps lessen tensions. The study by the Pakistani defense official envisages possible Pakistani response to a various proposals being discussed in India's defense circles for dealing with the Kashmir insurgency, which India blames on Pakistan-backed militants. The author, who wished not to be identified, argues that recently </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">India has put forward the concept of a limited conventional war aimed at achieving a specific political objective</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, such as putting down the uprising in Kashmir. But the author warns that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">what India may see as a limited conventional war, may not be accepted to Pakistan as such. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Similarly,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline"> what India defines as limited political perspective, may have a different implication for Pakistan,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> he adds. The author points out that most Western analysts and scholars are not comfortable with India's limited war doctrine and they also believe that a limited </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">war between India and Pakistan cannot remain limited for long.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> Comparing nuclear policies of the two countries, the author says that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">the central theme of Pakistan's nuclear policy guidelines is to act in a responsible manner and to exercise restraint in conduct of its deterrence policy</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">. Pakistan, he said, also wants to ensure that its nuclear capability does not pose any threat to non-nuclear weapon states in the region. Pakistan's nuclear capability is very clear for deterrence of aggression and defense of its sovereignty, the author said. India's declared nuclear doctrine, he said, is based on a posture of no first use of nuclear weapons. India, however, retains the option of using nuclear weapons in retaliation against a nuclear, biological or chemical attack on Indian territory or on Indian forces anywhere. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">India's doctrine</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> contains an inbuilt offensive design. The most dangerous aspect of this policy is that it </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">keeps the option open for a conventional war against Pakistan</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, according to the author. Asked why Pakistan had used the option of a limited conventional war in Kargil in 1999, the author said Kargil is part of Siachen sector where limited battles have continued since 1984. Kargil, he said, was a continuation of the same ongoing skirmishes between India and Pakistan. The author then explains various options India may exercise for launching a limited conventional war against Pakistan. These include: -- Surgical strikes conducted along the Line of Control in Kashmir against Pakistani troops and jihadi camps, which India says Pakistan is running on its side of Kashmir. The Indians have already attacked along the LoC to prevent Kashmiri fighters from crossing into Indian Kashmir but never succeeded in acquiring the desired results. So far, India only uses artillery for launching these surgical strikes into Pakistani Kashmir but under the new strategy they will also use air strikes for hitting targets across the LoC. -- Hot pursuits that include physically crossing the LoC and battling envisaged jihadi camps or capturing certain areas. It is an open option, says the author. In any war scenario, India can use it.&quot; But if they do so, Pakistan is not going to sit quiet. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">It will be an act of war which will not remain limited and it can escalate to a full-scale war and ultimately it can lead to a nuclear conflict if Pakistan's national interests are threatened,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> the author warns. -- Cold start strategy for which India has been raising eight to 10 combat groups to implement this new strategy. Each group will include forces from the army and the air force and, if required, from the navy. Each combat group will have a hard-hitting force of 3,000-4,000 troops and it should be able to achieve its objective in 72 hours, before Pakistan reacts or approaches the international community. The author says that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Pakistan will not view an attack</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> by this new force </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">as a limited war</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">. For us it will be a full-scale war, and Pakistan will respond with full resources, and if we fail to contain the Indians, the nuclear factor will definitely come in. Explaining how a conventional war can lead to a nuclear conflict, the author says: </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">In a full conventional war, India has the potential to create impact. And if it does so, it will force Pakistan to use its nuclear option</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Michael Werz and Kari Manlove, Senior Fellow @ American Progress, Research Associate for the Energy Opportunity Team, American Enterprise Institute, December 8, 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/12/on_the_move.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/12/on_the_move.html</a></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Africa will be one of the continents hardest hit by global warming. In the west and northwest, drought and desertification will intensify and threaten the livelihoods of local habitants. Sir Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, considers both the humanitarian and economic impacts on Africa in his groundbreaking climate change analysis. He cites Mali in the 1970s and 1980s as a precedent to the looming, potential conflict that water shortages and drought can cause. In that case, the native Tuareg were so devastated by drought that they were driven to other countries to seek sustainable livelihoods. Their migration and eventual return caused much unrest and rebellion. This example illustrates how northwestern Africa can become a battlefront, but other factors contribute to risk in the region: Sub-Saharan migrants enter the European Union through the region, and Islamist rebels threaten the governments of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, where Al Qaeda Maghreb’s presence has steadily grown in recent years. Resource allocation policies, drought, and water shortages are also factors within migration hubs like Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt, which all face their own environmental challenges. The European Union is keeping a close eye on these developments and how they could be affected by climate change. For example, the E.U. report, “Climate Change and International Security,” discusses mass migration and political destabilization that “puts the multilateral system at risk.” While this is a dark assessment, it appropriately calls attention to the issue. In response to growing migration pressures in Northern Africa, the European Union and especially the Spanish government have tightened border controls. The Spanish government, for example, has gone so far as to set up operations, such as sending officials of the Interior Ministry to countries like Senegal, Guinea-Conakry, Mali, Mauritania, and Cape Verde, often discouraging potential migrants from leaving. FRONTEX, a cooperative European effort on border security, has invested 24 million euros to control migratory routes toward Spain and control the coastal waters of Cape Verde, Morocco, Mauritania, and Senegal. Both the E.U. analysis and Spain’s actions reflect the understanding that increased climate migration amplifies existing security and humanitarian threats, which increases pressure on weak states along the North African coastline, and that these developments will affect Mediterranean security in a much broader sense. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The Horn of Africa is a dangerous and strategically vital place. Small wars, which rage continuously, can easily escalate into big wars. Local conflicts have regional and global aspects. All of the conflicts in this tinderbox, which controls shipping lanes from the Indian Ocean into the Red Sea, can potentially give rise to regional, and indeed global conflagrations between competing regional actors and global powers. Located in and around the Horn of Africa are the states of Eritrea, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and Kenya. Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year civil war, is a major source of regional conflict. Eritrea has a nagging border dispute with Ethiopia which could easily ignite. The two countries fought a bloody border war from 1998-2000 over control of the town of Badme. Although a UN mandated body determined in 2002 that the disputed town belonged to Eritrea, Ethiopia has rejected the finding and so the conflict festers. Eritrea also fights a proxy war against Ethiopia in Somalia and in Ethiopia's rebellious Ogaden region. In Somalia, Eritrea is the primary sponsor of the al-Qaida-linked Islamic Courts Union which took control of Somalia in June, 2006. In November 2006, the ICU government declared jihad against Ethiopia and Kenya. Backed by the US, Ethiopia invaded Somalia last December to restore the recognized Transitional Federal Government to power which the ICU had deposed. Although the Ethiopian army successfully ousted the ICU from power in less than a week, backed by massive military and financial assistance from Eritrea, as well as Egypt and Libya, the ICU has waged a brutal insurgency against the TFG and the Ethiopian military for the past year. THE SENIOR ICU leadership, including Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys and Sheikh Sharif Ahmed have received safe haven in Eritrea. In September, the exiled ICU leadership held a nine-day conference in the Eritrean capital of Asmara where they formed the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia headed by Ahmed. Eritrean President-for-life Isaias Afwerki declared his country's support for the insurgents stating, &quot;The Eritrean people's support to the Somali people is consistent and historical, as well as a legal and moral obligation.&quot; Although touted in the West as a moderate, Ahmed has openly supported jihad and terrorism against Ethiopia, Kenya and the West. Aweys, for his part, is wanted by the FBI in connection with his role in the bombing of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Then there is Eritrea's support for the Ogaden separatists in Ethiopia. The Ogaden rebels are Somali ethnics who live in the region bordering Somalia and Kenya. The rebellion is run by the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) which uses terror and sabotage as its preferred methods of warfare. It targets not only Ethiopian forces and military installations, but locals who wish to maintain their allegiance to Ethiopia or reach a negotiated resolution of the conflict. In their most sensationalist attack to date, in April ONLF terror forces attacked a Chinese-run oil installation in April killing nine Chinese and 65 Ethiopians. Ethiopia, for its part has fought a brutal counter-insurgency to restore its control over the region. Human rights organizations have accused Ethiopia of massive human rights abuses of civilians in Ogaden. THEN THERE is Sudan. As Eric Reeves wrote in the Boston Globe on Saturday, &quot;The brutal regime in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, has orchestrated genocidal counter-insurgency war in Darfur for five years, and is now poised for victory in its ghastly assault on the region's African populations.&quot; The Islamist government of Omar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir is refusing to accept non-African states as members of the hybrid UN-African Union peacekeeping mission to Darfur that is due to replace the undermanned and demoralized African Union peacekeeping force whose mandate ends on December 31. Without its UN component of non-African states, the UN Security Council mandated force will be unable to operate effectively. Khartoum's veto led Jean-Marie Guehenno, the UN undersecretary for peacekeeping to warn last month that the entire peacekeeping mission may have to be aborted. And the Darfur region is not the only one at risk. Due to Khartoum's refusal to carry out the terms of its 2005 peace treaty with the Southern Sudanese that ended Khartoum's 20-year war and genocide against the region's Christian and animist population, the unsteady peace may be undone. Given Khartoum's apparent sprint to victory over the international community regarding Darfur, there is little reason to doubt that once victory is secured, it will renew its attacks in the south. THE CONFLICTS in the Horn of Africa have regional and global dimensions. Regionally, Egypt has played a central role in sponsoring and fomenting conflicts. Egypt's meddling advances its interest of preventing the African nations from mounting a unified challenge to Egypt's colonial legacy of extraordinary rights to the waters of the Nile River which flows through all countries of the region. Globally, the region is a hotbed of Wahabist activity. Osama bin Laden was based in Khartoum until 1995. The ICU receives support not only from Eritrea, but from the Arab League and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. So too, international attempts to end the genocide in Darfur have been stymied by the Arab League and the OIC. One of the main reasons for the recent US decision to establish a military command in Africa is its strategic importance to the forces of global jihad. The US's largest force in Africa is located in Djibouti. International efforts to resolve the manifold conflicts in the region have failed to address the roots of the conflicts and so, even when successful are generally short lived. As the situation in Southern Sudan and the Eritrean-Ethiopian border show, these agreements only last as long as neither side believes it can defeat the other. Beyond that, while US and European leaders have spoken eloquently of the need to end the slaughter in Darfur and help the Somalis establish order, Washington and Brussels have made clear that they will not take effective action to back up their declarations. Indeed, even if Khartoum weren't actively working to undermine the peacekeeping mission in Darfur, it is hard to see the mission actually succeeding. No NATO member will agree to donate helicopters to the peacekeeping force. Without the helicopters, the peacekeepers will be unable to perform their mission. THIS REGIONAL morass of wars and rivalries formed the backdrop last week to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's one-day visit to African Union headquarters in Ethiopia. It is far from clear what Rice hoped to accomplish by traveling to Africa. She didn't bring any plans to solve any of the region's problems or even suggest new ways of looking at them. Even more troubling, Rice devoted the majority of her attention not to pointing a finger at Eritrea and Sudan for their bad behavior, but to attacking Ethiopia and pressuring the southern Sudanese to cut a deal with Khartoum.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Another consideration related to climate change is the problem of weak or failed states, which are at high risk of being destabilized by climate change. Mass population movements (both internal and international) may be one mechanism through which this failure is triggered. Large and acute population movements may exacerbate internal social and ethnic tensions, or pose an enormous economic challenge that exceeds the host state’s ability to manage. Thus, climate change-induced environmental migration may cause states that are already experiencing social and economic instability to reach a ‘‘tipping point’’ leading to instability or state failure. A National Intelligence Council report assessing key security trends through the year 2020 asserted that ‘‘weak governments, lagging economies, religious extremism, and youth bulges will align to create a perfect storm for internal conflict in certain regions.’’55 In addition, as climate change contributes to state weakness or failure— a more likely scenario for poor, developing countries plagued with preexisting social and economic problems—it could lead to additional security challenges for the world community. For example, the 2005 U.S. National Defense Strategy states that ‘‘the absence of effective governance in many parts of the world creates sanctuaries for terrorists, criminals, and insurgents.’’56 Such an environment may invite outside military intervention, although probably at a stage where military forces would be less welcome and less able to restore order or mitigate the underlying causes of state failure.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The terrorist act can reactivate atavistic defense mechanisms which drive us to gather around clan chieftans. Nationalistic sentiment re-awakens, setting up an implacable frontier which divides &quot;us&quot; from &quot;them,&quot; each group solidifying its cohesion in a rising hate/fear of the other group. (Remember Yugoslavia?) To be sure, the allies are trying for the moment to avoid the language of polarization, insisting that &quot;this is not a war,&quot; that it is &quot;not against Islam,&quot; &quot;civilians will not be targeted.&quot; But the word &quot;war&quot; was pronounced, a word heavy with significance which forces the issue of partisanship. And it must be understood that the sentiment of partisanship, of belonging to the group, is one of the strongest of human emotions. Because the enemy has been named in the media (Islam), the situation has become emotionally volatile. Another spectacular attack, coming on top of an economic recession could easily radicalize the latent attitudes of the United States, and also of Europe, where racial prejudices are especially close to the surface and ask no more than a pretext to burst out. This is the Sarajevo syndrome: an isolated act of madness becomes the pretext for a war that is just as mad, made of ancestral rancor, measureless ambitions, and armies in search of a war. We should not be fooled by our expressions of good will and charity toward the innocent victims of this or other distant wars. It is our own comfortable circumstances which permit us these benevolent sentiments. If conditions change so that poverty and famine put the fear of starvation in our guts, the human beast will reappear. And if epidemic becomes a clear and present danger, fear will unleash hatred in the land of the free, flinging missiles indiscriminately toward any supposed havens of the unseen enemy. And on the other side, no matter how profoundly complex and differentiated Islamic nations and tribes may be, they will be forced to behave as one clan by those who see advantage in radicalizing the conflict,</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Former Vice President Al Gore sharply criticized President Obama as lacking leadership on climate change in a magazine essay published online Wednesday, saying his policies had been little more effective than those of President George W. Bush. Related in Opinion In the 7,000-word article in Rolling Stone, Mr. Gore said that Mr. Obama clearly understood the threat to the planet posed by global warming and that he had appointed a number of committed environmental advocates to key positions. But Mr. Gore said that in the face of well-financed attacks from fossil fuel industries and denial and delay from Republicans in Congress, Mr. Obama had failed to act decisively to alter the nation’s policies on climate change and energy. Addressing climate change on national and international levels will require forceful American leadership, Mr. Gore said. “Yet President Obama has never presented to the American people the magnitude of the climate crisis,” he wrote. “He has simply not made the case for action. He has not defended the science against the ongoing, withering and dishonest attacks. Nor has he provided a presidential venue for the scientific community — including our own National Academy — to bring the reality of the science before the public.” A White House spokesman defended Mr. Obama’s record in a written statement. “The president has been clear since Day 1 that climate change poses a threat domestically and globally, and under his leadership we have taken the most aggressive steps in our country’s history to tackle this challenge,” said Clark Stevens, a White House press officer. Under Mr. Obama, Mr. Stevens said, the United States has spent billions of dollars on clean-energy technology, imposed tough new emissions standards for cars and trucks and taken the lead in international talks on climate change. Mr. Gore’s extended outburst of frustration signals a public turning point for him, and perhaps for other environmental advocates who have been quietly seething for months over what they view as the administration’s timidity. Mr. Gore, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize for his climate advocacy, praised some of the president’s actions, including the new vehicle standards and the investments in green technology. But in recent months he has told friends that the president has been too passive on climate change and has not been sufficiently supportive of Lisa P. Jackson, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who has tried to advance greenhouse gas regulation against stiff Congressional opposition. Much of Mr. Gore’s essay is devoted to criticism of the news media as failing to report accurately on the scientific consensus that climate change is real and that it is most likely caused by human activities. He said the media had been cowed by an aggressive lobbying and public relations campaign financed by the oil, gas and coal industries, or had presented ideological entertainment in the guise of news reporting. Mr. Obama has tried to move the country away from fossil fuels, and has made the connection between oil imports and national security, Mr. Gore wrote. “But in spite of these and other achievements, President Obama has thus far failed to use the bully pulpit to make the case for bold action on climate change,” he said. “After successfully passing his green stimulus package, he did nothing to defend it when Congress decimated its funding. After the House passed cap and trade, he did little to make passage in the Senate a priority.” Paul Bledsoe, a former energy aide in the Clinton White House and now senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said: “I entirely disagree with Gore here. Obama has consistently made a compelling case for climate action based on the science and has fought in Congress and internationally for robust policies to cut emissions and promote clean energy. The administration’s failing on climate has in fact been political.” Mr. Gore also turned to public officials of both parties. “Many politicians, unfortunately, also fall into the same two categories: those who cheerlead for the deniers and those who cower before them,” he wrote. “The latter group now includes several candidates for the Republican presidential nomination who have felt it necessary to abandon their previous support for action on the climate crisis; at least one has been apologizing profusely to the deniers and begging for their forgiveness.” Mr. Gore does not name them, but Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts; Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former governor of Utah and ambassador to China; and Tim Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota, have backtracked on their support for state and federal action to address global warming. Near the end of the article, Mr. Gore acknowledged that he might be hobbling a president trying to do the right thing in a difficult environment. “All of his supporters understand that it would be self-defeating to weaken Obama and . What hangs in the balance is the future of civilization as we know it.”</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">At present there is much talk about the unparalleled strength of the United States on the world stage. Yet at this very moment the most powerful country in the world stands to forfeit much political capital, moral authority and international good will by dragging its feet on the next great global issue: the environment. Before long, the administration's apparent unwillingness to take a leadership role -- or, at the very least, to stop acting as a brake -- in fighting global environmental degradation will threaten the very basis of the American supremacy that many now seem to assume will last forever. American authority is already in some danger as a result of the Bush administration's decision to send a low-level delegation to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg -- low-level, that is, relative to America's share of both the world economy and global pollution. The absence of President Bush from Johannesburg symbolizes this decline in authority. In recent weeks, newspapers around the world have been dominated by environmental headlines: In central Europe, flooding killed dozens, displaced tens of thousands and caused billions of dollars in damages. In South Asia, the United Nations reports a brown cloud of pollution that is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths a year from respiratory disease. The pollution (80 percent man-made) also cuts sunlight penetration, thus reducing rainfall, affecting agriculture and otherwise altering the climate. Many other examples of environmental degradation, often related to the warming of the atmosphere, could be cited. What they all have in common is that they severely affect countries around the world and are fast becoming a chief concern for people everywhere. Nobody is suggesting that these disasters are directly linked to anything the United States is doing. But when a country that emits 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases acts as an uninterested, sometimes hostile bystander in the environmental debate, it looks like unbearable arrogance to many people abroad. The administration seems to believe it is merely an observer -- that environmental issues are not its issues. But not doing anything amounts to ignoring a key source of world tension, and no superpower that wants to preserve its status can go on dismissing such a pivotal dimension of political and economic -- if not existential -- conflict. In my view, there is a clear-cut price to be paid for ignoring the views of just about every other country in the world today. The United States is jettisoning its hard-won moral and intellectual authority and perhaps the strategic advantages that come with being a good steward of the international political order. The United States may no longer be viewed as a leader or reliable partner in policymaking: necessary, perhaps inevitable, but not desirable, as it has been for decades. All of this because America's current leaders are not willing to acknowledge the I‘; concerns of many people about global environmental issues. No one can expect the United States to provide any quick fixes, but one would like to see America make a credible and sustained effort, along with other countries, to address global environmental problems. This should happen on two fronts. The first is at home in the United States, through more environmentally friendly policies, for example greater fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks and better insulation for buildings. The second is international, through a more cooperative approach to multilateral attempts at safeguarding the environment. Simply rejecting international treaties (like the Kyoto Protocol) then failing to offer a better proposal cannot be an acceptable option for American policymakers. Much of the world has come together to help the United States in the fight against terrorism, out of the realization that a common threat can only be beaten through a cooperative effort. It is high time for the United States, metaphorically speaking, to get out of its oversized, gas-guzzling S.U.V. -- and join the rest of the world in doing more to combat global warming and protecting the planet.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Finally, the third challenge relates to the collection of environmental data through earth observation satellites. Global concern with climate change makes the sacrifice of earth observation to support human space exploration a very unappealing option. Further, the United States has already committed to a bold leadership role with the July 2003 launch, by former secretary of state Colin Powell and current National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) administrator VADM Conrad Lautenbacher (USN, ret.), of a worldwide effort to build the Global Earth Observation System of Systems. If we establish an organization to create a system like GEOSS and then immediately fail to meet our agreed-on commitments, it will be very difficult indeed to generate future support for international projects, and as a consequence, our basic ability to lead in other space-related areas—especially returning to the Moon—will be greatly compromised. Historically, the way that NASA has dealt with such competing priorities is through the senseless cannibalism of one project after another. This may not, however, currently be an option. On one hand, the broad, bipartisan support for a national vision of space exploration and the immediate interest should encourage solid, robust support for human space exploration; on the other hand, the growing concern of global climate change necessitates full support of earth observation. In these space leadership challenges, failure to provide near-term support will immediately erode our credibility, while in the longer term, our leadership role is at great risk.</span><br />

To paraphrase one of his illustrious predecessors, “the world asks for action and action now.” What was true in President Roosevelt’s America 77 years ago is even more appropriate today. From IUCN’s perspective, the first signals are encouraging. The US has seriously begun to discuss constructive engagement in climate change debates. With Copenhagen a mere 11 months away, this commitment is long overdue and certainly very welcome.

A positive intervention by the United States could provide the vital catalyst that moves the basis of the present negotiations beyond the narrowly defined national interests that lie at the heart of the current impasse.

With equitable entitlement to the common resources of the planet, an agreement that is fair and acceptable to all nations should be easy enough to achieve. Caps on emissions and sharing of energy efficient technologies are simply in the interest of everyone, rich or poor.

 <strong><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Only increased climate data can solve – information key to policy</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Brown '8</span></strong> <span style="background-color: white;">Oli is the Programme Manager with the International Institute for Sustainable Development (Forced Migration Review, &quot;The Numbers Game&quot;, October 2008, Issue 31)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> Estimates of the potential number of ‘climate change migrants' vary hugely. In order to persuade policymakers of the need to act and to provide a sound basis for appropriate responses, there is an urgent need for better analysis, better data and better predictions. As early as 1990 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (lPCC) was arguing that the greatest single impact of climate change could be on human migration. So far, the scientific community has focused on establishing the extent and nature of anthropogenic climate change and its impact on our weather systems and coastlines. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Much less time and energy</span><span style="background-color: white;">; however, have been spent </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">on empirical analysis of the impacts of climate change on</span><span style="background-color: white;"> human population distribution. Consequently the figures that analysts have produced to date represent little more than well-educated guesswork. This is unsurprising; the science of climate change is complex enough, even before considering its impact on societies with widely differing resources and varied capacities to adapt to external shocks. To assess the future impact of climate change on complex changing communities is to heap prediction upon prediction, multiplying the potential margin of error. Perhaps the best-known estimate for future migration forced by climate was made by Professor Norman Myers of Oxford University: Looking ahead to 2050 he has argued that &quot;when global warming takes hold there could be as many as 200 million people [displaced] by disruptions of monsoon systems and other change (from a predicted global population of nine billion people). Other estimates vary widely in terms of numbers, time frame and causes. In 2005 the UN University’s Institute for Environment and Human Security warned that the international community should prepare for 50 million 'environmental refugees' by 2010. The UN Environment widely cited. But repetition does not make the figure inherently accurate. Professor Myers himself admits that his estimate, although calculated from the best available (and limited) data, required some &quot;heroic extrapolations&quot;. The simple fact is that nobody really knows with any degree of precision what climate change will mean for human population distribution. We know that climate change will redraw our coastlines, alter where we can grow food, move where and when we can find water and expose us to fiercer storms or more severe droughts. We know that on current predictions the 'carrying capacity' of large parts of the world - the ability of different ecosystems to provide food, water and shelter for human populations - will be compromised by climate change. Intuitively we know that climate migration is likely to be a serious issue in future. we just don't know how serious. And it is hard to persuade policymakers of its importance without concrete (or at least more sophisticated) figures. The estimates we have so far are no real foundation for an appropriate response either. The challenge now is to better understand how climate change could affect population distribution and then to develop effective ways to address the possible consequences of forced migration, such as social and economic dislocation, delayed development or conflict. For that we need clearer answers to some key questions: How many people are likely to move as a result of climate change? Where are they likely to come from and go to? How much warning will they have? Will they be able to return? Better data on any or all of the questions above will help identify the most vulnerable populations, the regions of greatest concern and the potential effects of climate migration on development and stability: Ultimately better data would move the debate towards the three questions of most relevance to policymakers: Who should be responsible for providing for climate induced migrants? For how long will they typically need support? And how much will it all cost? The problem of prediction Developing more solid predictions will require a lot of hard number crunching that is only now really starting Those predictions are complicated by at least four factors. Disaggregating Causality Migrants’ decisions to leave their homes are influenced by a number of complex factors; deciding causality between economic 'pull' and environmental 'push' is often highly subjective. Disaggregating the role of climate change from other environmental, economic and social factors requires an ambitious analytical step into the dark. In short, deducing cause and effect between climate change and forced migration is very difficult. Eliminating the statistical ‘white noise': Future climate migration will take place against a background of unprecedented changes in the number and distribution of the world's population. The global population is currently growing at an annual rate of 1.1% and is predicted to peak at 9.075 billion by 2050 (from its 2005 level of 6.54 billion). Meanwhile, there is an accelerating move to urban areas. Already more than half of the world's population lives in urban settings and the growth rate of the urban population is nearly double that of total population growth. Clearly it would be absurd to attribute the entire urban drift to climate change but disaggregating the additional role of climate change on existing rural-urban migration is very hard. Dealing with the Lack of Data: Base-line data for current migration flows in many of the developing countries thought to be most vulnerable to climate change are patchy and incomplete. Nor is there much capacity in developing countries or the international community to gather this kind of dam, particularly for internal displacement. Census data rarely include the kind of questions that would give a nuanced understanding of the reasons behind internal population movements. What limited capacity exists is focused on tracking cross-border migration - which only captures a part of the picture, given that the majority of forced climate migrants are likely to stay within their own borders. Factoring in Uncertainty: Finally although climate modeling techniques have progressed dramatically over the past decade, we have not yet developed the modeling techniques that even begin to adequately account for the impact of individual choice, the potential for international action and the variability of future emissions and meteorological scenarios. Towards Better Data: We need more time, effort and energy to be put towards developing a better understanding of future forced migration.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> Satellites provide globally consistent observations and the means to make simultaneous observations of diverse measurements that are essential for climate studies. They supply high-accuracy global observations of the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface that cannot be acquired by any other method. Satellite instruments supply accurate measurements on a near-daily basis for long periods and across broad geographic regions. They can reveal global patterns that ground or air sensors would be unable to detect—as in the case of data from NASA satellites that showed us the amount of pollution arriving in North America from Asia as equal to 15 percent of local emissions of the United States and Canada. This sort of data is crucial to effective management of emissions— the United States, for example, could put in place regulations to decrease emissions and find them neutralized by pollution from other regions.15 Satellites allow us to monitor the pattern of ice-sheet thickening and thinning. While Arctic ice once increased a few centimeters every year, it now melts at a rate of more than one meter annually. This knowledge would not exist without satellite laser altimetry from NASA’s ICESat satellite.16 Satellite observations serve an indispensable role—they have provided unprecedented knowledge of inaccessible regions. Of the 44 essential climate variables (ECV) recognized as necessary to support the needs of the parties to the UNFCCC for the purposes of the Convention, 26 depend on satellite observations. But deployments of new and replacement satellites have not kept pace with the termination of older systems. Innovation and investment in Earth observation technology have failed to keep pace with global needs for monitoring and verification. Much of our data comes from satellites put in orbit for other purposes, such as weather prediction and monitoring. The sensors on these weather satellites provide valuable data, but they are not optimized for monitoring climate change or for adequately assessing the effect of mitigation efforts. More precise and specialized data are needed to understand and predict climate change, and getting these data will require new orbital sensors. Countries have improved many of their climate observation capabilities, but reports suggest little progress in ensuring long-term continuity for several important observing systems. The bulk of climate data is collected by the United States, and NASA’s investment in the Earth Observing System missions has provided the climate-quality data used to establish trends in sea level, ozone concentrations, ocean color, solar irradiance, Earth’s energy balance, and other key variables. While this investment has made an invaluable contribution, it is not an operational system. Many satellites currently in orbit are operating well past their planned lifetimes. In the next eight years, half of the world’s Earth observation satellites will be past their useful life. One reason for this is that many of the satellites that provide critical data for monitoring climate change are experimental satellites (such as TRMM—the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission). Satellites built as research efforts provide real benefit, but if they are not replaced when their service life ends and if a permanent operational capability for Earth observation is not put in place, we will face insurmountable problems for observing capabilities and our ability to manage climate change. Many missions and observations for collecting climate data are at risk of interruption. These include measurements of ocean color that are critical for studying phytoplankton bloom and the role of ocean biomass as a carbon source and sink and data on the role of forests in the carbon cycle. Perhaps the most important shortcoming involves the monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and greenhouse gases. Reduction and regulation of CO2 emissions are part of every discussion on how to manage climate change, but the crash of NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) satellite left the world essentially bereft of the ability to make precise measurements to assess emissions reduction efforts. OCO cost approximately $278 million,17 which was about 2 percent of NASA’s annual budget for manned space flight in 2009. Its loss will cripple global carbon monitoring until we have its replacement, finally funded this year and scheduled for launch no later than February 2013. Existing GHG monitoring networks and programs are predominantly ground-based, but they are not truly adequate to the task. Ground-based networks are limited because they can only provide disjointed pieces of a larger picture. Moreover, these systems are aging, and investment for replacement has declined. We now rely on Japan’s GOSAT, the European Space Agency’s SCIAMACHY sensor, and Canada’s microsatellite, CanX-2, for observations of atmospheric concentrations of carbon; however, these sensors are not advanced enough to meet data requirements needed to understand critical aspects of the carbon cycle, and they are highly constrained by their range of coverage. For example, the carbon produced from a fossil fuel power plant is too small to measure with GOSAT, and low spatial resolution and high uncertainty of measurements limit the monitoring capabilities of SCIAMACHY.18 The implications are serious for measuring the effectiveness of climate policies. If reduction in GHG emissions (the most significant being carbon dioxide) is the centerpiece of mitigation efforts and a goal for both national legislation and international agreement, we are woefully unprepared to assess the effectiveness of these measures. It will be difficult to assess and adjust CO2-reducing measures without greater investment in orbiting sensors.19 The need for information has never been greater, but there are significant gaps in global Earth monitoring capabilities.20 Although more than 50 nations operate or plan to operate Earth observation satellites, most of these are basic electro-optical satellites, essentially orbiting digital cameras that lack the necessary sensors for precise climate monitoring. There are only a handful of dedicated satellites for monitoring climate change, and the time has passed when general-purpose weather satellites can meet our informational needs. Japan, Europe, and the United States operate satellites with some of the sensors needed to monitor climate change, but a recent National Academies study found that of the 26 essential climate variables that can be monitored from space, we have coverage of only 16.21 Only a coordinated federal policy and investment-, including revised priorities for our civil space programs, can change this. For most of the last decade, NASA was unable to replace its climate-monitoring satellites. Replacing these satellites is crucial to avoid a drastic decline in collecting the most valuable information for monitoring climate change. The Obama administration has proposed a budget for NASA’s Earth science programs of $2.4 billion in new funding over the next five years, an increase of more than 60 percent. The new funding, which requires congressional approval, will help replace OCO and allow NASA to replace the twin GRACE satellites that make detailed measurements of Earth’s gravity field that can provide important climate data. The request for NOAA’s budget for climate-related activities has been increased as well. NOAA will be spending $2.2 billion to maintain and further develop satellites and to support climate research; $435 million has been requested to support the U.S. Global Change Research Program, with $77 million in new increases for core climate services and observations. Spending on space has always been a question of priorities. Until recently, those priorities were frozen in time, reflecting political needs that were decades out of date. Our national priorities have changed. A new priority, reflecting the new challenges to our security and national interest, involves monitoring and understanding climate change. Debate over climate change is fierce and there are many skeptics, but the signs of major changes are undeniable. Warnings of catastrophe are likely overblown, but we do not fully understand the implications of climate change or the utility of various measures to mitigate it. Climate change is occurring, and it creates new risks. In this context, the recent decision to scale back spending on human space flight and increase spending on Earth observation is a better match for national priorities and interests. It updates a space policy that has been badly out of date for years. Observation of climate change began more than a century ago with simple measurements of the Earth’s average temperature. These were interesting, but inadequate. The breakthrough in understanding climate change came with Earth observation satellites. Satellites provide global awareness in ways that other technologies cannot match. The monitoring needed for a serious effort requires observations that can only be done from space.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">In 2007, the National Research Council (NRC) conducted a survey of Earth science and its applications from space, identifying key scientific questions and societal objectives on which to focus Earth observations beginning in 2005. The Council organized the science missions into three time-phased tiers, identifying the mission(s) most appropriate to answer key science questions and address societal objectives. In addition to the NRC’s Decadal Survey, a summary of the policy documents that support the science goals of the CLARREO mission can be found here. Selected as a high-priority, tier one mission, the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) is a climate mission that will bring revolutionary accuracy to climate measurement—and provide a global benchmark measurement for conclusively determining long-term climate trends. The urgency for CLARREO results from the growing need for higher accuracy, long-term climate change observations than current instruments are capable of providing. Data from CLARREO will dramatically increase how accurately we define the real climate future that society faces—and assist policy makers in formulating more informed decisions about how to respond. The timing of the CLARREO mission is a result of recent advances in a wide range of scientific, measurement, and technological areas. These advances combine to enable CLARREO to be a completely new type of climate mission: a mission focused on accuracy at decade time scales. Because CLARREO measurements will cover the majority of the solar and infrared spectrum, CLARREO will provide this accuracy for most of the climate variables essential for assessing climate change, greatly expanding the uses of existing space-based data sets for societal benefit. Previous Earth science missions have focused on providing data for one aspect of the climate system such as clouds or aerosols. CLARREO will provide a global perspective of climate change, becoming the first mission to collect data that provide a single and highly accurate view of the entire climate system. By obtaining this global view, CLARREO will be used by climate modelers and decision makers to accurately predict climate change and to develop intelligent plans and methods to minimize and adapt to it. Kevin Brown, CLARREO Project Manager who is leading the CLARREO mission states, “The integrity of CLARREO measurements and their ability to accurately portray the Earth’s climate on a global scale, allows for greater confidence in policy derived from CLARREO observations.” CLARREO differs from other satellites because its measurements are tied to internationally-recognized standards, the same type of rigorously-tested standards used by National Metrology Institutes to determine the temperature of a material or length of a second. Using these international standards, measurements from CLARREO, as well as other satellites, may be pooled into one long-term observational record that is free from small drifts in measurements due to slight differences between satellites. This allows scientists to test the satellite observations for small errors that mirror the variability of the climate itself. Testing for these errors provides for a clear interpretation of measurement trends, greatly enhancing confidence in the data’s accuracy.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">CLARREO is a Highly Leveraged Interdisciplinary Climate Change Mission • Accurate decadal-length records are essential for climate change detection, attribution, and for testing climate prediction accuracy. They represent the most critical test of uncertainty in future climate change prediction. • While process study missions (e.g. CALIPSO/CloudSat) are critical to improve underlying climate model physics (e.g. clouds), decadal change observations are critical to determine the impact of those climate model improvements on the accuracy of predicting future climate change. Both elements are critical, and CLARREO is the major Decadal Study mission addressing serious accuracy issues in decadal climate change observation. • The CLARREO mission is unique in its broad interdisciplinary impact on climate change science: the other NRC Decadal Survey missions are primarily focused on one climate process or discipline. • CLARREO provides new solar reflected and infrared emitted high spectral resolution benchmark radiance climate data records that can be used to test climate model predictions, improve climate change fingerprinting, and attribution. • CLARREO provides an orbiting calibration observatory that can be used to calibrate other solar and infrared space-borne sensors (e.g. VIIRS, CrIS, Landsat, Geostationary, CERES) and thereby improve to climate accuracy a wide range of sensors across the GEO observing system. It also improves the scientific value of all of these instruments. • Key climate variable decadal records </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The ability of this CLARREO mission to calibrate passive sensors on-orbit via SI traceability and to address sampling issues without subsidiary information is a notable departure from the current strategy pursued for climate satellite records. The necessity for this departure was recognized by the NRC as follows: NRC Objective: Global Benchmark Climate Record Benchmark Observations: What are they? The NRC Decadal Survey recognized that when the global climate record emerges as a significant contributor to public policy (societal) decisions, that record will be attacked relentlessly. If the climate record cannot stand up to those attacks, the record cannot effectively serve society. Recognition of this led to the requirement that the design of climate observing and monitoring systems from space must ensure the establishment of global, long-term climate records, which are of high accuracy, tested for systematic errors on-orbit, and tied to irrefutable standards such as those maintained in the U.S. by the National Institute of Standards and Technology For the NRC report, this mission definition was essential for the prioritization process that fully considered scientific/societal impact, cost, ability to complement other systems, degree of readiness, risk mitigation, and contributions to other thematic areas. The ASIC3 report also chose a CLARREO-like mission as one of its high priority recommendations based on similar requirements. Once the context of responsiveness to societal objectives is understood, the path leading all the way to details of instrument design may be defined. A summary of requirements flowdown from high level science requirements to data products to mission and payload requirements for the IR and GPS components is included below.</span><br />

 <strong>1. Obama is pursuing space cooperation – US multilateral leadership is creating a framework against weaponization</strong><br />
<strong>Huntley, 11</strong> - senior lecturer in the National Security Affairs department at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California (Wade, “The 2011 U.S. National Space Security Policy: Engagement as a Work in Progress”, Disarmament Times, Spring, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarm.igc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=429:the-2011-us-national-space-security-policy-engagement-as-a-work-in-progress&amp;catid=154:disarmament-times-spring-2011&amp;Itemid=2" rel="nofollow">http://disarm.igc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=429:the-2011-us-national-space-security-policy-engagement-as-a-work-in-progress&amp;catid=154:disarmament-times-spring-2011&amp;Itemid=2</a>)<br />
As is well understood, the space policies of the Bush administration were decidedly oriented toward military security concerns and independent action. The 2006 National Space Policy unabashedly proclaimed the U.S. intention to maintain a dominant position in space indefinitely. This policy orientation dismissed multilateral cooperation as impinging on U.S. “freedom of action,” throwing weight instead behind a wide range of technology development initiatives founded on the assumption that deployment of weapons in space was, if not already factual, certainly inevitable.2 U.S. commercial and civil engagement was overshadowed by these security concerns, expressed through the tightening of export control restrictions inhibiting a broad range of technology sharing. Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns. This background is essential for appreciating how the space policies of the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails. The U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010 has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3 Less broadly noticed was this policy’s clarity and coherence in articulating a vision for U.S. space activities on its own terms. The document is organized around core principles, subsidiary goals and implementing guidelines that exceed its predecessors in delineating a longer-term direction for U.S. space policy that is integrated with, rather than derivative of, broader U.S. global aims.4 The policy also was generated and issued far earlier in the tenure of the administration than either of its predecessors, indicating an increased prioritization of attention to space policy at higher levels of policy-making. To some degree, a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, new budget realitiesand unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds. The 2011 National Security Space Strategy, released February 4, is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation and greater attention to space policy in general. This first-of-its-kind strategic statement culminates a congressionally mandated space posture review.6 The initial section portraying the strategic environment to which U.S. security policy must be responsive highlights the growing problems of space debris, orbital congestion and coordination among a growing number of space actors — not state-based security threats per se. The Security Space Strategy features the objective of a “stable space environment in which nations exercise shared responsibility.”7 Specific provisions intended to implement this strategy, relevant to the preceding observations, include:8 • The strategy presents a full section on “Partnering with Responsible Nations, International Organizations, and Commercial Firms.” This category is not wholly multilateral in the traditional sense, displaying a symbiosis of alliance-building and collective cooperation not always carefully distinguished; i.e., “The United States will lead in building coalitions of like-minded space-faring nations and, where appropriate, work with international institutions to do so.” • The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and <em>norms of behavior for responsible space operations</em>.” [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements in the longer-term. • The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships,” and to “expand provision of safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right. • The strategy commits to reforming export controls. “In particular, as new opportunities arise for international collaboration, a revised export control system will better enable the domestic firms competing for these contracts.” As noted above, the oppressive impact of current U.S. export controls not only impinges on U.S. commercial space actors but also epitomizes the high degree to which U.S. policy has subsumed commercial and civil interests to national security concerns. The strategy appears to acknowledge this connection and commit to remedy it. • The most assertive passages of the statement are moderated with community-building intent. For example, the strategy’s section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression” concludes that the U.S. “will retain the right and capabilities to respond in self-defense, should deterrence fail,” but immediately adds that the U.S. “will use force in a manner that is consistent with longstanding principles of international law, treaties to which the United States is a party, and the inherent right of self defense.” • The concluding and most conflict-oriented section of the strategy opens by noting that “some actors may still believe counterspace actions could provide military advantage.” Counterspace capabilities, unarticulated in the document, include ASATs, ground-based directed energy weapons and satellite transmission jamming. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Gregory Schulte explained at the strategy’s rollout that China is a principal concern in this regard, but so is the proliferation of these technologies: “If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry what others can do.”10 This section of the strategy does not, however, call for maintaining options to develop complementary space conflict capabilities. Rather, the strategy asserts that the U.S. “must be prepared to ‘fight through’ a degraded environment,” and identifies “resilience” and “space protection” as the key criteria. The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps as striking as the prevalence of such passages, however, is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand the kind of independent space-based military capabilities that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative “as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. These policy movements toward multilateral engagement and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 Critics also decried the strategy’s emphasis on “the old fallacious assumption that the power of example will prevent adversaries from doing the United States harm,” and endorsed maintaining the goal of U.S. retention of a “dominant position in military and intelligence space capabilities.”15 In fact, the administration’s warming toward normative commitments in general — and the EU Code of Conduct in particular — are in part intended to forestall pressure for more formal and binding measures that would definitively cut off the “hedge” of unilateral U.S. weapons development options.16 The balance of U.S. debate may have shifted toward greater international cooperation, but the terms of the debate remain the same. In sum, the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also, and more importantly, a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details.<br />

International cooperation is valuable to a given nation in that it tends to increase political sustainability. Within the United States, a program is made safer from cancellation to the extent that Congress and the administration are not willing to break international agreements. Indeed, the integration of Russia into the ISS program may well have saved the program from cancellation (consider that the year before Russia was introduced as a partner, the ISS was saved by one vote in Congress). Once cooperation has commenced, canceling a program becomes inconsistent with political sustainability as long as the utility cost associated with the loss of diplomatic benefits and the negative effects on reputation of terminating an international agreement is larger in magnitude than the utility cost that must be paid to maintain the system. In the case of the ISS, international cooperation does provide a rationale for sustaining the pro-gram, because canceling the program would result in a net loss in utility. The corollary to this is that there is a high cost to be paid by any nation that chooses to unilaterally withdraw from an existing cooperative endeavor. This cost comes in the form of damage to the departing nation’s reputation or credibility. In general, any unilateral action sends a signal that the actor is an unpredictable and therefore an unreliable and possibly disrespectful partner. This tends to sabotage the possibility of future cooperation. As such, there is a long-term benefit to maintaining cooperation, even when the immediate cost may seem to call for terminating it. If cooperation has never occurred (as is the case be-tween China and the United States), the advent of cooperation is a significant event, likely delivering a lot of diplomatic utility. On the other hand, if cooperation is the norm (as is the case between Canada and the United States), it is to be expected. The diplomatic utility of maintaining this cooperation is often not recognized. Nevertheless, the diplomatic utility cost of terminating this cooperation is large, because it would alienate a key ally. If it were necessary to cease cooperation, a mutual choice to do so would likely mitigate many of the negative reputation effects, because there would be no unilateral actor to whom one could assign blame. Indeed, if both parties choose to cease cooperat-ing simultaneously, this would mitigate the negative-reputation effect—rather, there would be a “mutual divorce.” Such a mutual decision would be significantly more tenable, in a diplomatic sense, because each party might outline a set of grievances and conditions for the termination of cooperation. Furthermore, since the agreement would be termi-nated in a spirit of mutual understanding, the possibility of future beneficial cooperation would be more likely.<br />

<strong>3. Multilateral cooperation against weaponization is vital to preventing miscalculation, first strike incentives and global war</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #0d0d0d;">Hitchens, 8</span></strong><span style="color: #0d0d0d;"> – president of the Center for Defense Information (Theresa, “Space Wars - Coming to the Sky Near You?”, Scientific American, February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you</a>)</span><br />
<span style="color: #0d0d0d;">Perhaps of even greater concern is that several other nations, including one of China’s regional rivals, India, may feel compelled to seek ­offensive as well as defensive capabilities in space. The U.S. trade journal Defense News, for instance, quoted unidentified Indian defense officials as stating that their country had already begun developing its own kinetic-energy (nonexplosive, hit-to-kill) and laser-based antisatellite weapons. If India goes down that path, its archrival Pakistan will probably follow suit. Like India, Pakistan has a well-developed ballistic missile program, including medium-range missiles that could launch an antisatellite system. Even Japan, the third major Asian power, might join such a space race. In June 2007 the National Diet of Japan began considering a bill backed by the current Fukuda government that would permit the development of satellites for “military and national security” purposes. As for Russia, in the wake of the Chinese test President Vladimir Putin reiterated Moscow’s stance against the weaponization of space. At the same time, though, he refused to criticize Beijing’s actions and blamed the U.S. instead. The American efforts to build a missile defense system, Putin charged, and the increasingly aggressive American plans for a military position in space were prompting China’s moves. Yet Russia itself, as a major spacefaring power that has incorporated satellites into its national security structure, would be hard-pressed to forgo entering an arms race in space. Given the proliferation of spacefaring entities, proponents of a robust space warfare strategy believe that arming the heavens is inevitable and that it would be best for the U.S. to get there first with firepower. Antisatellite and space-based weapons, they argue, will be necessary not only to defend U.S. military and commercial satellites but also to deny any future adversary the use of space capabilities to enhance the performance of its forces on the battlefield. Yet any arms race in space would almost inevitably destabilize the balance of power and thereby multiply the risks of global conflict. In such headlong competition—whether in space or elsewhere—equilibrium among the adversaries would be virtually impossible to maintain. Even if the major powers did achieve stability, that reality would still provide no guarantee that both sides would perceive it to be so. The moment one side saw itself to be slipping behind the other, the first side would be strongly tempted to launch a preemptive strike, before things got even worse. Ironically, the same would hold for the side that perceived itself to have gained an advantage. Again, there would be strong temptation to strike first, before the adversary could catch up. Finally, a space weapons race would ratchet up the chances that a mere technological mistake could trigger a battle. After all, in the distant void, reliably distinguishing an intentional act from an accidental one would be highly problematic. </span>Hit-to-Kill Interceptors According to assessments by U.S. military and intelligence officials as well as by independent experts, the Chinese probably destroyed their weather satellite with a kinetic-energy vehicle boosted by a two-stage medium-range ballistic missile. Technologically, launching such direct-ascent antisatellite weapons is one of the simplest ways to take out a satellite. About a dozen nations and consortia can reach low Earth orbit (between roughly 100 and 2,000 kilometers, or 60 to 1,250 miles, high) with a medium-range missile; eight of those countries can reach geostationary orbit (about 36,000 kilometers, or 22,000 miles, above Earth). But the real technical hurdle to making a hit-to-kill vehicle is not launch capacity; it is the precision maneuverability and guidance technology needed to steer the vehicle into its target. Just how well China has mastered those techniques is unclear. Because the weather satellite was still operating when it was destroyed, the Chinese operators would have known its exact location at all times. Ground-Based Lasers The test of China’s direct-ascent antisatellite device came on the heels of press reports in September 2006 that the Chinese had also managed to “paint,” or illuminate, U.S. spy satellites with a ground-based laser [see lower box on page 83]. Was Beijing actually trying to “blind” or otherwise damage the satellites? No one knows, and no consensus seems to have emerged in official Washington circles about the Chinese intent. Per­haps China was simply testing how well its network of low-power laser-ranging stations could track American orbital observation platforms. Even so, the test was provocative. Not all satellites have to be electronically “fried” to be put out of commission. A 1997 test of the army’s MIRACL system (for midinfrared advanced chemical laser) showed that satellites designed to collect optical images can be temporarily disrupted—dazzled—by low-power beams. It follows that among the satellites vulnerable to such an attack are the orbital spies. The U.S. and the former Soviet Union began experimenting with laser-based antisatellite weapons in the 1970s. Engineers in both countries have focused on the many problems of building high-power laser systems that could reliably destroy low-flying satellites from the ground. Such systems could be guided by “adaptive optics”: deformable mirrors that can continuously compensate for atmospheric distortions. But tremendous amounts of energy would be needed to feed high-power lasers, and even then the range and effectiveness of the beams would be severely limited by dispersion, by attenuation as they passed through smoke or clouds, and by the difficulty of keeping the beams on-target long enough to do damage. During the development of the SDI, the U.S. conducted several laser experiments from Hawaii, including a test in which a beam was bounced off a mirror mounted on a satellite. Laser experiments continue at the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. Pentagon budget documents from fiscal years 2004 through 2007 listed antisatellite operations among the goals of the Starfire research, but that language was removed from budget documents in fiscal year 2008 after Congress made inquiries. The Starfire system incorporates adaptive optics that narrow the outgoing laser beam and thus increase the density of its power. That capability is not required for imagery or tracking, further suggesting that Starfire could be used as a weapon. Yet despite decades of work, battle-ready versions of directed-energy weapons still seem far away. An air force planning document, for instance, predicted in 2003 that a ground-based weapon able to “propagate laser beams through the atmosphere to [stun or kill low Earth orbit] satellites” could be available between 2015 and 2030. Given the current state of research, even those dates seem optimistic. Co-orbital Satellites Recent advances in miniaturized sensors, powerful onboard computers and efficient rocket thrusters have made a third kind of antisatellite technology increasingly feasible: the offensive microsatellite. One example that demonstrates the potential is the air force’s experimental satellite series (XSS) project, which is developing microsatellites intended to conduct “autonomous proximity operations” around larger satellites. The first two microsatellites in the program, the XSS-10 and XSS-11, were launched in 2003 and 2005. Though ostensibly intended to inspect larger satellites, such microsatellites could also ram target satellites or carry explosives or directed-energy payloads such as radio-frequency jamming systems or high-powered microwave emitters. Air force budget documents show that the XSS effort is tied to a program called Advanced Weapons Technology, which is dedicated to research on military laser and microwave systems. During the cold war the Soviet Union developed, tested and even declared operational a co-orbital antisatellite system—a maneuverable interceptor with an explosive payload that was launched by missile into an orbit near a target satellite in low Earth orbit. In effect, the device was a smart “space mine,” but it was last demonstrated in 1982 and is probably no longer working. Today such an interceptor would likely be a microsatellite that could be parked in an orbit that would cross the orbits of several of its potential targets. It could then be activated on command during a close encounter. In 2005 the air force described a program that would provide “localized” space “situational awareness” and “anomaly characterization” for friendly host satellites in geostationary orbit. The program is dubbed ANGELS (for autonomous nanosatellite guardian for evaluating local space), and the budget line believed to represent it focuses on acquiring “high value space asset defensive capabilities,” including a “warning sensor for detection of a direct ascent or co-orbital vehicle.” It is clear that such guardian nanosatellites could also serve as offensive weapons if they were maneuvered close to enemy satellites. And the list goes on. A “parasitic satellite” would shadow or even attach itself to a target in geostationary orbit. Farsat, which was mentioned in an appendix to the [Donald] Rumsfeld Space Commission report in 2001, “would be placed in a ‘storage’ orbit (perhaps with many microsatellites housed inside) relatively far from its target but ready to be maneuvered in for a kill.” Finally, the air force proposed some time ago a space-based radio-frequency weapon system, which “would be a constellation of satellites containing high-power radio-frequency transmitters that possess the capability to disrupt/­destroy/disable a wide variety of electronics and national-level command and control systems.” Air force planning documents from 2003 envisioned that such a technology would emerge after 2015. But outside experts think that orbital radio-frequency and microwave weapons are technically feasible today and could be deployed in the relatively near future. Space Bombers Though not by definition a space weapon, the Pentagon’s Common Aero Vehicle/Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (often called CAV) enters into this discussion because, like an ICBM, it would travel through space to strike Earth-bound targets. An unpowered but highly maneuverable hypersonic glide vehicle, the CAV would be deployed from a future hypersonic space plane, swoop down into the atmosphere from orbit and drop conventional bombs on ground targets. Congress recently began funding the project but, to avoid stoking a potential arms race in space, has prohibited any work to place weapons on the CAV. Although engineers are making steady progress on the key technologies for the CAV program, both the vehicle and its space plane mothership are still likely decades off. Some of the congressional sensitivity to the design of the CAV may have arisen from another, much more controversial space weapons concept with parallel goals: hypervelocity rod bundles that would be dropped to Earth from orbital platforms. For decades air force planners have been thinking about placing weapons in orbit that could strike terrestrial targets, particularly buried, “hardened” bunkers and caches of weapons of mass destruction. Commonly called “rods from God,” the bundles would be made up of large tungsten rods, each as long as six meters (20 feet) and 30 centimeters (12 inches) across. Each rod would be hurled downward from an orbiting spacecraft and guided to its target at tremendous speed. Both high costs and the laws of physics, however, challenge their feasibility. Ensuring that the projectiles do not burn up or deform from reentry friction while sustaining a precise, nearly vertical flight path would be extremely difficult. Calculations indicate that the nonexplosive rods would probably be no more effective than more conventional munitions. Furthermore, the expense of lofting the heavy projectiles into orbit would be exorbitant. Thus, despite continued interest in them, rods from God seem to fall into the realm of science fiction. Obstacles to Space Weapons What, then, is holding the U.S. (and other nations) back from a full-bore pursuit of space weapons? The countervailing pressures are threefold: political opposition, technological challenges and high costs. The American body politic is deeply divided over the wisdom of making space warfare a part of the national military strategy. The risks are manifold. I remarked earlier on the general instabilities of an arms race, but there is a further issue of stability among the nuclear powers. Early-warning and spy satellites have traditionally played a crucial role in reducing fears of a surprise nuclear attack. But if antisatellite weapons disabled those eyes-in-the-sky, the resulting uncertainty and distrust could rapidly lead to catastrophe. One of the most serious technological challenges posed by space weapons is the proliferation of space debris, to which I alluded earlier. According to investigators at the air force, NASA and Celestrak (an independent space-monitoring Web site), the Chinese antisatellite test left more than 2,000 pieces of junk, baseball-size and larger, orbiting the globe in a cloud that lies between about 200 kilometers (125 miles) and 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) above Earth’s surface. Perhaps another 150,000 objects that are a centimeter (half an inch) across and larger were released. High orbital velocities make even tiny pieces of space junk dangerous to spacecraft of all kinds. And ground stations cannot reliably monitor or track objects smaller than about five centimeters (two inches) across in low Earth orbit (around a meter in geostationary orbit), a capability that might enable satellites to maneuver out of the way. To avoid being damaged by the Chinese space debris, in fact, two U.S. satellites had to alter course. Any shooting war in space would raise the specter of a polluted space environment no longer navigable by Earth-orbiting satellites. Basing weapons in orbit also pre­sents difficult technical obstacles. They would be just as vulnerable as satellites are to all kinds of outside agents: space debris, projectiles, electromagnetic signals, even natural micrometeoroids. Shielding space weapons against such threats would also be impractical, mostly because shielding is bulky and adds mass, thereby greatly increasing launch costs. Orbital weapons would be mostly autonomous mechanisms, which would make operational errors and failures likely. The paths of objects in orbit are relatively easy to predict, which would make hiding large weapons problematic. And because satellites in low Earth orbit are overhead for only a few minutes at a time, keeping one of them constantly in range would require many weapons. Finally, getting into space and operating there is extremely expensive: between $2,000 and $10,000 a pound to reach low Earth orbit and between $15,000 and $20,000 a pound for geostationary orbit. Each space-based weapon would require replacement every seven to 15 years, and in-orbit repairs would not be cheap, either. Alternatives to Space Warfare Given the risks of space warfare to national and international security, as well as the technical and financial hurdles that must be overcome, it would seem only prudent for spacefaring nations to find ways to prevent an arms race in space. The U.S. focus has been to reduce the vulnerability of its satellite fleet and explore alternatives to its dependence on satellite services. Most other space-capable countries are instead seeking multilateral diplomatic and legal measures. The options range from treaties that would ban antisatellite and space-based weapons to voluntary measures that would help build transparency and mutual confidence. The Bush administration has adamantly opposed any form of negotiations regarding space weapons. Opponents of multilateral space weapons agreements contend that others (particularly China) will sign up but build secret arsenals at the same time, because such treaty violations cannot be detected. They argue further that the U.S. cannot sit idly as potential adversaries gain spaceborne resources that could enhance their terrestrial combat capabilities. Proponents of international treaties counter that failure to negotiate such agreements entails real opportunity costs. An arms race in space may end up compromising the security of all nations, including that of the U.S., while it stretches the economic capacities of the competitors to the breaking point. And whereas many advocates of a space weapons ban concede that it will be difficult to construct a fully verifiable treaty—because space technology can be used for both military and civilian ends—effective treaties already exist that do not require strict verification. A good example is the Biological Weapons Convention. Certainly a prohibition on the testing and use (as opposed to the deployment) of the most dangerous class of near-term space weapons—destructive (as opposed to jamming) antisatellite systems—would be easily verifiable, because earthbound observers can readily detect orbital debris. Furthermore, any party to a treaty would know that all its space launches would be tracked from the ground, and any suspicious object in orbit would promptly be labeled as such. The international outcry that would ensue from such overt treaty violations could deter would-be violators. Since the mid-1990s, however, progress on establishing a new multilateral space regime has lagged. The U.S. has blocked efforts at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to begin negotiations on a treaty to ban space weapons. China, meanwhile, has refused to accept anything less. Hence, intermediate measures such as voluntary confidence-building, space traffic control or a code of responsible conduct for spacefaring nations have remained stalled. Space warfare is not inevitable. But the recent policy shift in the U.S. and China’s provocative actions have highlighted the fact that the world is approaching a crossroads. Countries must come to grips with their strong self-interest in preventing the testing and use of orbital weapons. The nations of Earth must soon decide whether it is possible to sustain the predominantly peaceful human space exploration that has already lasted half a century. The likely alternative would be unacceptable to all.<br />

<strong>4. Space control is impossible, countermeasures override deterrence and risk nuclear escalation</strong><br />

Security and South Asia Projects (Michael, Toward a Theory of Space Power: Selected Essays, February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf</a>)<br />
While some have compared space to another &quot;global commons,&quot; the high seas, we believe this analogy to be deeply flawed. Warships provide backup for sea-based commerce, but they are essentially instruments of warfighting. Satellites, on the other hand, usually serve multiple purposes in both military and nonmilitary domains. A ship damaged in combat can seek safety and repairs at a friendly port. The debris from combat at sea sinks and rarely constitutes a lingering hazard. Defensive measures are easier to undertake at sea than in space. If space weapons are deployed and used, no nation can expect there to be safe havens in space. And if the most indiscriminate means of space warfare are employed, debris will become a long-lasting hazard to military and nonmilitary satellite operations. All countries would be victimized if a new precedent is set and satellites are attacked in a crisis or in warfare. As the preeminent space power, the United States has the most to lose if space were to become a shooting gallery. The best offense can serve as an effective defense in combat at sea, but this nostrum does not apply in space, since essential satellites remain extremely vulnerable to rudimentary forms of attack. The introduction of dedicated and deployed weapons in space by one nation would be followed by others that feel threatened by such actions. The first attack against a satellite in crisis or warfare is therefore unlikely to be a stand-alone event, and nations may choose different rules of engagement for space warfare and different means of attack once this threshold has been crossed. Our analysis thus leads to the conclusion that the introduction and repeated flight-testing of dedicated ASAT weapons would greatly subtract from U.S. spacepower, placing at greater risk the military, commercial, civil, and lifesaving benefits that satellites provide. Instead, we propose that the United States seek to avoid further flight testing of ASATs while hedging against hostile acts by other spacefaring nations. We argue that realizing the benefits of spacepower requires acknowledgment of four related and unavoidable dilemmas. First, the satellites upon which spacepower depends are extremely vulnerable. To be sure, advanced spacefaring nations can take various steps to reduce satellite vulnerability, but the limits of protection will surely pale beside available means of disruption and destruction, especially in low Earth orbit (LEO). Vulnerabilities can be mitigated, but not eliminated. Second, the dilemma of the profound vulnerability of essential satellites has been reinforced by another dilemma of the space age: satellites have been linked with the nuclear forces of major powers. Nuclear deterrence has long depended on satellites that provide early warning, communications, and targeting information to national command authorities. Even nuclear powers that do not rely on satellites for ballistic missile warning may still rely on them for communications, forecasting, and targeting. To interfere with the satellites of major powers has meant—and continues to mean—the possible use of nuclear weapons, since major powers could view attacks on satellites as precursors to attacks on their nuclear forces. The third dilemma of spacepower is that space disruption is far more achievable than space control. A strong offense might constitute the best defense on the ground, in the air, and at sea, but this principle holds little promise in space since a strong offense in this domain could still be negated by asymmetric means. Space control requires exquisitely correct, timely, and publicly compelling intelligence; the readiness to initiate war and to prevent another nation from shooting back; as well as the ability to dictate the choice of strategy and tactics in space. It takes great hubris to believe that even the world's sole superpower would be able to fulfill the requirements of space control when a $1 bag of marbles, properly inserted into LEO, could destroy a $1 billion satellite. The ability of the United States to dictate military strategy and tactics in asymmetric, gravity-bound warfare has proven to be challenging; it is likely to be even more challenging in space, where there is less margin for error. The fourth overarching dilemma relating to spacepower therefore rests on the realization that hard military power does not ensure space control, particularly if other nations make unwise choices and if these choices are then emulated by others. The United States has unparalleled agenda-setting powers, but Washington does not have the power to dictate or control the choices of other nations. These dilemmas are widely, but not universally, recognized. Together with the widespread public antipathy to elevating humankind's worst practices into space, they help explain why the flight-testing and deployment of dedicated space weapons have not become commonplace. These capabilities are certainly not difficult to acquire, as they are decades old. Indeed, tests of dedicated ASAT weapons have periodically occurred, and such systems were deployed for short periods during the Cold War. If the weaponization of space were inevitable, it surely would have occurred when the United States and the Soviet Union went to extraordinary lengths to compete in so many other realms. The weaponization of space has not occurred to date and is not inevitable in the future because of strong public resistence to the idea of weapons in space, and because most national leaders have long recognized that this would open a Pandora's box that would be difficult to close. Much has changed since the end of the Cold War, but the fundamental dilemmas of space control, including the linkage of satellites to nuclear deterrence among major powers, have not changed. The increased post– Cold War U.S. dependence on satellites makes the introduction of dedicated space weapons even more hazardous for national and economic security. Advocates of muscular space control must therefore take refuge in the fallacy of the last move, since warfighting plans in space make sense only in the absence of successful countermoves. Offensive counterforce operations in space do not come to grips with the dilemmas of spacepower, since proposed remedies are far more likely to accentuate than reduce satellite vulnerability. This analysis leads inexorably to a deeply unsatisfactory and yet inescapable conclusion: Realizing the enormous benefits of spacepower depends on recognizing the limits of power. The United States now enjoys unparalleled benefits from the use of space to advance national and economic security. These benefits would be placed at risk if essential zones in space become unusable as a result of warfare. Spacepower depends on the preservation and growth of U.S. capabilities in space. Paradoxically, the preservation and growth of U.S. spacepower will be undercut by the use of force in space.<br />

 <strong><span class="StyleBold">A. Obama will win the election now – new polls show he is controlling independents and the economy vote</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">CBS News 2/14</span>/2012</strong>, “CBS Evening News for February 14, 2012, CBS,” CBS News Transcripts, Scott Pelley, Seth Doane, Norah O’Donnell, David Martin, John Dickerson, Allen Pizzey, Wyatt Andrews, Lexis<br />
PELLEY: Good evening. President Obama has not been enjoying the kind of popularity that gets presidents reelected. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in a new </span>CBS News/&quot;New York Times&quot; <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">poll </span>out tonight, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there are signs that he has turned a corner</span>. For the moment, at least, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">half the public now approves of the job that he is doing</span>. Have a look. Last May, right after Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden, the president`s job-approval rating soared to 57 percent. But by November it was back to 43 percent, tying his all-time low. Then the numbers started rising. Tonight hitting 50 percent. You`ve guessed why. Since November, the Dow is up about seven percent and unemployment is down four-tenths of a point. In our poll, the number of Americans who say the economy is getting better has risen from 18 percent in November to 34 percent now. Even so, when asked about the condition of the economy, 75 percent said it`s bad. More now about the president and the poll from our chief White House correspondent Norah O`Donnell at the White House tonight. Norah? NORAH O`DONNELL, CBS CORRESPONDENT: Scott, and the good economic news out there is boosting the president`s overall standing with voters, particularly independents, and that`s why there`s hardly a day that goes by that we don`t hear the president talking about the turnaround in the economy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Our economy is growing stronger. And the last thing we need, the last thing we can afford to do, is to go back to the same policies that got us in this mess in the first place. O`DONNELL: The president`s message seems to be resonating. 42 percent of voters think he is making progress fixing the economy. And that`s up 14 points in just two months. We found Democrat Kathie Maloney on a street corner in Chicago. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If he hadn`t taken the steps he did and enacted the proposals he did, we`d be in a much worse place than we are now, and I think that things are coming back and getting better. O`DONNELL: <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">At the heart of</span> Mr. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama`s reelection message is</span> a push for what he calls <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">economic fairness</span> and a proposal to raise taxes on millionaires, called the Buffett rule, named after Warren Buffett. OBAMA: I think asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes is just common sense. O`DONNELL: Two-thirds of Americans -- 67 percent -- agree that taxes should be increased on households making over a million dollars a year. Including, for the first time, a majority of Republicans. But Bud Faircloth, an independent from Delaware, doesn`t believe the president will make good on his goals. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m not sure if he`ll ever get the Congress to work with him, and I just don`t think he`ll ever get the job done. O`DONNELL: But in our poll, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">i</span>ndependents have shown a shift towards Mr. Obama. A month ago they favored Mitt Romney. Today independents favor the president. (END VIDEOTAPE) O`DONNELL: And, Scott, that swing among independents is why for the first time the president has a clear advantage against his Republican opponents if you put them in a general election matchup. PELLEY: <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">And independents decide these elections</span>. Norah, thanks very much. There is news in the numbers for Republicans as well. Rick Santorum has soared to the lead in our national poll of Republican voters. He`s at 30 percent. Followed by Mitt Romney at 27, Ron Paul 12, and Newt Gingrich ten. John Dickerson is our CBS News political director and, John, you`ve been digging into the numbers and you found something fascinating.<br />

The odds of President Obama being re-elected are much higher than the odds of him being elected in 2008. Don't take anything for granted, because this battle won't be easy. The<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> 2012 presidential </span>election promises to be a real humdinger. Speaking broadly, political pundits tell us that it will focus on the economy<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> (things like jobs, taxes, and spending) and</span> that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it will be brutal</span>. Political insiders put a finer point on it. For instance, Chris Lehane, who helped guide Al Gore's failed 2000 campaign for the presidency, said, &quot;<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It's going to be </span>extremely different, with much more hand-to-hand combat, from one foxhole to another, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">targeted to key states</span>.&quot; Terry Holt, a Republican consultant, said, &quot;You can expect a very negative campaign. In 2008, Barack Obama was peddling hope and change. Now he's peddling fear and poverty.&quot; Tuesday's election results prove that both Lehane and Holt were on the right track. The &quot;Personhood Amendment&quot; failed in Mississippi, and Ohioans rejected limits on collective bargaining &quot;which would have limited the bargaining abilities of 350,000 unionized public workers.&quot; But those issues are far from settled. Abortion opponents are pursuing &quot;life-at-fertilization ballot initiatives&quot; in six other states, and collective bargaining for public employees remains a hot topic in states across the fruited plain. The 2012 presidential election will help to resolve those and other issues. Demonstrating how muddy the political waters are right now, a few days ago, Colorado voters rejected tax hikes for education. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Colorado is a pivotal &quot;swing state,&quot; and both political parties are anxious to claim its nine electoral votes</span>. By clobbering Proposition 13 almost 2-to-1, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Colorado voters sent a message about taxation that was loud and clear</span>. Prior to the vote, Stateline called Proposition 13 &quot;the nation's most high-profile tax measure&quot; and said that &quot;<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the outcome is likely to be viewed as a barometer of attitudes toward the tough fiscal choices states have ahead.</span>&quot; After the vote, The Denver Post called Colorado &quot;a killing field for tax measures.&quot; It's becoming obvious that voters are fed up with profligate government spending and needless taxation to support questionable and marginal programs. John Avlon, a senior columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast, said that in Tuesday's election, &quot;swing voters asserted their independence&quot; by &quot;repudiating Republican ideological overreach in key votes but denying Democrats clear-cut victories heading into 2012.&quot; Michael Barone, a columnist for The Washington Examiner, called attention to the fact that &quot;the same Ohio voters ... who voted 61% against [Governor] Kasich's public employee union restrictions also voted 66% for Issue 3, which purported to shield Ohioans from any mandate to buy health insurance. This was a clear repudiation of Obamacare, and about half the folks that the unions turned out voted against Obamacare.&quot; Avlon and Barone are correct. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Voters in one state after another are throwing off their party mantles and making up their own minds</span>. The 2012 presidential election will address a wide range of economic and social issues, but the thing that sets it apart is the fact that it will determine where we stand as a nation on issues that have heretofore been dominated almost exclusively by political purists on the far left and far right. Stated simply, at long last, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">voters are engaged in the debate</span>. That means <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">liberals and conservatives will have to duke it out to determine which group holds sway over the middle</span>. Voters will be asked to decide whether the United States is going to continue on a path that leads to socialism or if our nation will return to its roots and reward individual initiative and effort. Judging by what we've seen so far, the answer will be a combination of the two. Voters don't want the United States to become a European-style socialist country; neither do they want it to be a pure laissez-faire capitalist state. Dogmatists on the left and right had better pay attention, because <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">voters are in no mood for politics as usual</span>. President <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama</span> and his ardent supporters reside on the far left of the political spectrum -- so far left that they have to hide their true proclivities. They know that the general public won't accept the president's ideas this time around if he presents them from his liberal perch, so <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">he's slowly and methodically gravitating to the center </span>in hopes of losing as few voters in the middle as possible while retaining his leftist base. Don't expect Obama 2.0 to closely resemble Obama 1.0. This time around, he'll be more circumspect. He'll present himself as a man of the people who sees both sides of critical issues, but his agenda will remain the same. Piece by piece, little by little, he'll present parts of his plan, believing that voters won't notice his maneuvering to the left. It's like the bullfrog: if you toss a bullfrog into boiling water, he will jump out and save himself because he has strong legs and quick reflexes, but if you place him in cold water and heat it up slowly, he will eventually die because he doesn't realize that the water is getting hotter. The president will use that approach because it works. History teaches us that voters adjust slowly to the world that politicians fashion, and they do it without making much of a fuss since gradual changes, although offensive to some, seem minor to most. But President Obama has an advantage in 2012 that he didn't have in 2008. He holds the reins of power, and he'll use tax dollars to buy off vocal critics. Whoever the president's opponent turns out to be had better beware, because conservative dogma will fail in 2012 just as surely as liberal dogma will. Fortunately for the GOP, after three years in office, President Obama can't run in 2012 on abstract promises about hope and change. He has a performance record, and it's a millstone around his neck, but it will mean nothing if Republicans nominate a conservative purist. That's what the results in Colorado, Ohio, and Mississippi tell us. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The 2012 presidential election will be won or lost in the middle, where people can be persuaded</span> by facts. That's what the GOP nominee must deliver.<br />

The findings of the comprehensive report: 'The impact of climate change on the world's marine ecosystems' emerged from a synthesis of recent research on the world's oceans, carried out by two of the world's leading marine scientists.One of the authors of the report is Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, professor at The University of Queensland and the director of its Global Change Institute (GCI). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">'We may see sudden, unexpected changes that have serious ramifications for the overall well-being of humans, including the capacity of the planet to support people.

'The findings have enormous implications for mankind, particularly if the trend continues. The earth's ocean, which produces half of the oxygen we breathe and absorbs 30 per cent of human-generated carbon dioxide, is equivalent to its heart and lungs.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> This study shows worrying signs of ill-health.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Over the past several decades, a pattern has developed in this aspect of US and Iranian competition. As Iran moves forward in areas that could give it nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, the United States reacts with diplomacy, sanctions, and efforts to strengthen US and Southern Gulf forces and deterrent capabilities. Tehran frequently acknowledges Washington’s diplomatic efforts and appears to respond to them, but delays ensue and even if promises are made, progress is not. Iran continues to pursue its nuclear program without full compliance with IAEA safeguards, without negotiating tangible agreements with either the US or other members of the P5+1, and with little practical regard to UN sanctions. Moreover, Iran has sought to counter American and UN sanctions by leveraging its international economic position through its energy exports. This, in turn, helps Iran undermine multilateral support for sanctions. Tehran can offer economic opportunities to nations which skirt or weaken sanctions because other countries voluntarily suspend ties with the Islamic Republic. This effort has had an important impact on China, Russia, and other states who support the sanctions process. It has delayed and weakened UN efforts, limited the impact of the P5+1 negotiating process, and had a wider impact on other states, including key players like Turkey. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">I</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;" class="UnderlinedCard">ran’s tactics of delay, denial, and move forward have forced American policymakers to either take a more confrontational approach to nations outside its sanctions regime—sometimes pushing them further towards cooperation with Iran—or to accept a weakening of sanction and pressures on Iran</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> At the same time, they have led the US to repeatedly make it clear that while it prefers a negotiated solution, it is keeping military options on the table. They also have led the US to increase pressure on other states, to use the UN sanctions process, and to limit all major arms sales and all nuclear and missile-related technology transfers to Iran. Iran has responded by steadily building up its conventionally armed long-range missile capabilities, its capabilities to conduct asymmetric warfare in the Gulf, and its capabilities to respond to any US (or Israeli) attack on Iran; by expanding its ties with Syria and with hostile states as far away as Venezuela; and by using its ties to non-state actors as a potential threat</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;" class="UnderlinedCard">The end result is that there are no clear boundaries to this aspect of US and Iranian competition: they affect a broad range of diplomacy, competition within the UN framework, sanctions and related economic and arms transfer efforts, energy exports and investment opportunities in Iran, and a wide range of competition in military options. The interaction between Iran’s nuclear programs and US sanctions efforts is the most direct and visible aspect of this competition and as the US continues to employ both carrots and sticks to try to alter Iranian behavior, the pattern continues.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> Tehran’s gradual progress, however, calls into question the efficacy of the American approach. Sanctions and diplomacy have successfully slowed Iran’s nuclear development. US actions have not changed Tehran’s strategic calculus or the shape of its nuclear and missile efforts.</span><br />

<strong><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Current Iranian missiles aren’t advanced enough – space expansion key</span></strong><br />
<strong>Arms Control Association</strong>, 7-12-<strong><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">2011</span></strong> (“Iranian Missile Messages: Reading Between the Lines of &quot;Great Prophet 6&quot;” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2555:http://www.armscontrol.org/print/4965 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.armscontrol.org/print/4965" rel="nofollow">http://www.armscontrol.org/print/4965</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2555 -->)<br />
Reading Between the Lines There are, however, other conclusions to be drawn from Iran’s flexing of missile muscles. For those seeking to prevent or dissuade Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, the most important question is how much progress the exercises demonstrate toward Iran developing and deploying the missiles, which would carry nuclear warheads. Realistically, medium-term delivery boils down to two existing systems: the liquid fuel, single stage Ghadr 1 MRBM, an advanced derivative of the Shahab 3, and the solid fuel Sejjil 2 MRBM, a two-stage system with sufficient range to target Israel from launch sites throughout Iran, but not yet operational. Neither missile was flown during “Great Prophet 6.” The only MRBM launched was announced to be a Shahab 3, an unlikely candidate for fulfilling Iran’s likely nuclear delivery capability aspirations. It is possible that the Iranians foresee using the Ghadr 1 as a nuclear weapons platform, in spite of the disadvantages inherent to liquid fuel mobile missiles – in terms of their limited mobility and greater vulnerability to attack. It is more likely that the Iranians see the Sejjil 2 as the preferred carrier for a possible future nuclear warhead. Iran is apparently feeling no need to exercise its only operational missile suited for the nuclear mission and the missile best suited for the nuclear mission has not yet reached an operational status appropriate for exercising. Thus, if the U.S. Government is correct in assessing that Tehran has not yet made a decision to build nuclear weapons, there would appear to be time for dissuading it from doing so. A Long-Range Missile Threat Not Yet in Sight In a 1999 National Intelligence Estimate, the U.S. intelligence community projected that Iran could test an ICBM within “a few years.” Most analysts predicted back then either “even odds” or a “likely chance” that Iran would test an ICBM by 2010. However, in 2009, senior military and defense officials testified to Congress that shifting from deployment of strategic interceptors to Europe in a third site to a program for deploying theater interceptors in a “Phased Adaptive Approach” was appropriate since the Iranian ICBM threat was evolving more slowly than previously thought. The Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis reported to Congress in 2011 that Iran was fielding increased numbers of SRBMs and MRBMs, “continuing to work on producing more capable MRBMs, and developing space launch vehicles, which incorporate technology directly applicable to longer-range missile systems.” [2] The still unofficial Report on Sanctions of the UN Panel of Experts completed in May 2011 revealed that the Iranians had conducted two unannounced tests of the Sejjil 2 MRBM (in October 2010 and February 2011) [3] in addition to the five flight tests it had conducted since 2007. (A senior Iranian Republican Guard Corps Commander recently confirmed two previously unannounced “1,900 km-range” missile flights tests in February.) The Iranians launched their second satellite in May 2011, using the Safir Space Launch Vehicle (SLV) and predicted that it would be followed by another satellite launch in the summer. Unlike the larger Samorgh SLV that had been displayed as a mockup in February, conversion of the Safir SLV to a ballistic missile would still only deliver a nuclear-sized payload about 2,100 km, according to the IISS Strategic Dossier, [4] roughly the same as the Sejjil 2 MRBM. This summer’s “Great Prophet 6” exercise provides more evidence that, while Tehran makes steady progress on augmenting its stocks of enriched uranium and while R&amp;D work continues on its most likely MRBM candidate for being able to deliver a future nuclear weapon within the region, Tehran’s present military focus is on demonstrating and enhancing its conventional capability to deter and defeat a preventive attack on the Islamic Republic itself. It has not flight-tested, or indeed even asserted a need for, an IRBM or ICBM – the missile categories most relevant to threatening the territories of NATO Europe and the United States.<br />

He said </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;" class="UnderlinedCard">Tehran's bid to develop new rocket and space technologies might be nothing more at this point than its exploring of technological options,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> at times quite modestly, as in its recent effort to loft experimental satellites. &quot;</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;" class="UnderlinedCard">That doesn't mean the potential should be minimized,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">&quot; Cordesman said. &quot;We know these states can achieve technical surprise.&quot; On Sunday, Iran said it had test-fired a fast underwater missile that could evade sonar, and on Friday announced that it had launched a new rocket that can carry multiple warheads and elude radar. The military actions, accompanied by film clips on state television during a week of naval maneuvers, seemed calculated to defy growing pressure on Tehran. So far, U.S. officials say they have not protested Iran's space program. Intelligence agencies reviewed information about the satellite launching last fall, but concluded that it warranted no action. Nor has the United States urged Russia - a key player in the current negotiations with Iran over its efforts to enrich uranium - to halt the launchings. But a senior American official who spoke anonymously because he was unauthorized to address the topic publicly said the United States was &quot;taking another look&quot; at pressing Moscow to end the space assistance as a way of pressuring Iran to stop the enrichment of nuclear material. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;" class="UnderlinedCard">Analysts</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> across the political spectrum seem to </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;" class="UnderlinedCard">agree</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;" class="UnderlinedCard">the Iranian missile and satellite programs bear watching, even if judged as presenting no current threat to the United States</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">. &quot;It's clearly interesting to see what direction they're going,&quot; said David Wright, a space analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a policy research group in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

 <strong>Text: The United States federal government should adopt a “Buy American” policy for the Aerospace industry. The United States federal government should __ through the “Buy American” Act of 1933.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>US aerospace sector uses technology from international agencies – it’s normal means</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Robert K. </span><strong>Perrons</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">B.Eng., Mechanical Engineering McMaster University, 1995 Master of Science in Technology and Policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology September 19</span><strong>97</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “Make-Buy Decisions in the U.S. Aircraft Industry” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://132.70.58.206/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/Make-Buy-Decisions-in-the-US-Aircraft-Industry%281%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://132.70.58.206/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/Make-Buy-Decisions-in-the-US-Aircraft-Industry%281%29.pdf</a></span><br />
Despite<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its glowing </span>sales projections<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span>the commercial aircraft sector is facing pressures of its own<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The two major players in the market, Boeing and Airbus, are fiercely vying against one another for sales contracts around the world. As well, </span>the deregulation of airlines in the United States has caused carriers to be more costconscious than ever.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Air travel is becoming somewhat of a commodity, and airlines are facing lower profit margins as a result. Towards improving these margins, </span>airlines are pressuring aerospace manufacturers to build airplanes that are cheaper and that have lower operating costs than before.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This </span>constant push to reduce costs has re-defined the industry significantly.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In the words of one manager in Boeing’s Commercial Airplane Group (BCAG), </span>“tomorrow’s leading commercial aerospace firms will probably be those that lead the way with... cost saving measures.”<span style="font-size: 8pt;">5 EXTERNAL CUES FOR CHANGE Indeed, </span>changing customer needs in both the defense and commercial aircraft sectors are causing firms to change the way they do business.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But there are also forces other than customer demand that are profoundly changing the face of the industry. </span>Many firms in the aerospace sector have consolidated their operations with those of their suppliers or even their competitors. Information technologies have evolved to a degree that allows firms to communicate with one another almost instantly, thereby allowing several companies to coordinate their design and manufacturing activities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.6 </span>International borders have become less of a barrier to commerce, and companies have undergone a process of “globalization.”<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In short, </span>the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> overall role of any one firm in the </span>U.S. aerospace industry is very different in many ways from what it used to be.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> However, </span>the new customer demands of the aerospace market and the new realities of the business world go further than merely redefining the role of the independent aerospace company in its changing environment; they are also reshaping the very boundaries of each firm in the industry<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Towards redesigning the boundaries of their firms in the marketplace, and adapting to the rapid changes in the business world, </span>U.S. aerospace companies in both the military and commercial sectors have begun to adopt the principles of the lean manufacturing system.<br />

As<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> President-Elect </span>Obama takes office, NASA stands positioned to benefit from the change and enthusiasm<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> brought by his new Administration. Five years out from the announcement of a new vision for America's Space Exploration program, important lessons about what NASA should be doing and how it can best meet those goals are available, and must be learned. </span>So long a source of national pride and inspiration as well as cutting edge research, NASA is now losing its position of world leadership. Thankfully, the ingenuity and the talent necessary to reassert America's pre-eminence are still hardwired into the fabric of this nation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. NASA and its peer agencies can be in a position to efficiently tap into it and direct it. </span>Engage the Private Community For too long, aerospace contractors have lacked the appropriate incentive to innovate. Internal research and development budgets have been low; the punishment for failure to deliver to specification and budget has been light or absent; and a culture of risk avoidance has kept major breakthroughs out of reach. Recently, a new type of commercial aerospace industry has emerged; one that seeks to access large sources of private revenue--and which therefore must make strategic business decisions that lead to rapid and impressive innovation. To allow NASA to accomplish its lofty goals while simultaneously stimulating the American economy, NASA must continue to engage this new commercial space community.<strong>This new commercial space industry should be viewed not as a competitor, but as a critical partner</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Therefore, trailblazing </span><strong>commercial programs</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">such as COTS, Centennial Challenges, and the now-defunct Mercury Fund </span><strong>should be renewed, expanded, and emulated throughout NASA's mission directorates.</strong><br />

<strong>Growth stops external wars – empirics</strong><br />

Using an unbalanced panel of 152 countries from 1950 to 1992<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, we estimate a Markov probability model to investigate the joint determination of internal conflict, external conflict, and the economy. We begin with a simple model that allows for a two-variable relationship: internal conflict and recessions, external conflict and recessions, and internal conflict and external conflict. We find that these are not independent events. In particular, </span>we find that recessions play an important role in determining internal conflict<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially in Africa and for nondemocratic countries. In this case</span>, the occurrence of a recession causes an increase in the probability of internal conflict starting in a given year to almost double. We then extend the model to allow for a three-variable relationship: internal conflict, external conflict, and recessions<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the more complicated system, </span>we continue to find an important link.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In this case, </span>we find that the presence of a recession coupled with an external war will actually cause the probability of an internal conflict starting in a given year to increase between two- and threefold.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> If this study is to convince readers and policy makers of anything, it is that </span>the linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favor.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Moreover, </span>the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which internal and external conflicts self-reinforce each other.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> However, </span>the ability of government organizations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to stop the spread of internal conflict to external conflict and vice versa by helping to reduce the incidence of recessions </span>may be<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> quite </span>limited<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Economic aid that is to improve a nation’s productive capacity is likely to be difficult to identify and implement in just such circumstances.</span><br />

 <strong>A) Humans fear the unknown and thus attempt to control it. This is “Crusoe Syndrome” -the ideology which encloses space so we can feel as if we are “in control” when in fact we are in a state of chaotic relation to the unknown. This paradox forces us to continually use space as a means to destroy it</strong><br />
<strong>Marzec 2002</strong> (Robert P. Associate Professor at the State University of New York at Fredonia, “A Genealogy of Land in a Global Context,” boundary 2, Volume 29, Number 2, Summer 2002, pp. 129-156 (Article), MUSE, JR2)<br />
<br />
When Robinson Crusoe first sees the island that will eventually become his homeland for twenty-seven years, he is so filled with anxiety that he codes the land as ‘‘more frightful than the Sea.’’1 Fearful of unknown space, he spends his first night inhabiting the land not on its own terms but metaphysically above it in a tree (RC, 36).2 Uncontrollably thrown into the space of uncultivated land, he is unable to immediately establish a frame of reference, which triggers a response of dread: The land appears as an example of the Lacanian Real, a nonsymbolizable, meaningless presence that bewilders Crusoe’s sensibility, and by extension the sociosymbolic order of the British Empire that he carries on his back.3He broods over the potential for ‘‘God to spread a table in the Wilderness’’ (RC, 69, 107) and gradually eases his dread by spending decades setting up a series of enclosures that slowly cover the landscape. It is not only Crusoe who fears uncultivated land and achieves order by enclosing it; Daniel Defoe himself was a great believer in the power of enclosures to establish a radically new mode of enlightened (imperial) existence that transformed the land into an object to be mastered by humankind. In A Tour through the Whole Island of Great Britain, Defoe surveys the domain of England’s immediate landscape, cataloging in some six hundred pages every quarter of English soil. Throughout, he advocates the scientific and market-driven normalization of the land, valorizing enclosures as ‘‘islands of improvement in a sea of open-field.’’4 In the fictional (but more widely read and thus more culturally significant) Robinson Crusoe, this same enclosing of the land authorizes Crusoe to spread God’s table and allows him to climb down from the tree (yet ‘‘remain’’ there in a metaphysical sense) to occupy the space of the Other. Only from within the pale of enclosures does Crusoe establish a relation to the land, a relation that is at the same time paradoxically not of the land, for the land must become English land before he can connect to it in any substantial fashion. After God’s table is spread, Crusoe says that he no longer ‘‘afflict[s] [his] self with Fruitless Wishes of being there,’’ for the island has come to radiate with the ‘‘Dispositions of Providence,’’ which ‘‘quiet his Mind’’ and ‘‘order every Thing for the best’’ (RC, 79–80; my emphasis). Crusoe tames the undifferentiated earth of the island by endowing the land with the positive and moral ‘‘seed’’ of ‘‘Providence.’’ In order to cope with an entirely Other form of land than that to which he is accustomed, he introduces an ideological apparatus to overcode the earth. In this fashion, he can ‘‘quiet’’ his mind, relieve his anxiety, and resist the nightmare of actually ‘‘being there’’ on the island: the terror of inhabiting an Other space as Other. This ‘‘being in the tree,’’ a resistance to ‘‘being there’’ until the land is enclosed and transformed, is the structure of what I call the Crusoe syndrome.<br />
<br />
<strong>B) Imperialism shines true – the plan is the next novel of unexplored space attempting to redefine “the commons of space” as dangerous but controllable. this allows us to not only colonize it, but also to deem any part of space that is not economically up to “par” with other parts as savage, unknown and dangerous—that’s an independent link to imperialism and ongoing genocide</strong><br />
<strong>Marzec 2002</strong> (Robert P. Associate Professor at the State University of New York at Fredonia, “A Genealogy of Land in a Global Context,” boundary 2, Volume 29, Number 2, Summer 2002, pp. 129-156 (Article), MUSE, JR2)<br />
<br />
Defoe’s handling of the land in his Tour and in Robinson Crusoe indicates, I claim, a more global structure of feeling coming into existence during this preimperial historical occasion. It is a structure that stands as a formal diagram for future colonial developments: Before England began to colonize open, wild, and uncultivated land and subjects abroad, it created an apparatus for colonizing its open land and subjects at home—an apparatus that could readily be transplanted to distant territories.5Enabling the British subject to establish a sovereign sense of identity, enclosures precipitate and prepare the way for England’s relocation in the expanding circle of the colonial world map. It was in the enclosure act that the ideology of imperialism became a material reality, with enclosures creating a new problematic that formed a nexus between the growing colonial cultural order, the domestication of foreign lands and peoples, monopoly capital, and the novel. English novels from the eighteenth to the twentieth century contain a surprising number of significant references to enclosures and to the chaotic nature of unenclosed savage common lands. These references indicate the extent to which the English novel itself is inscribed in the midst of a new imperial formation of land. Throughout Henry Fielding’s Tom Jones, for example, Jones receives repeated warnings and punishments for transgress5. The British colonization of America certainly predates Defoe’s novel. However, the enclosure movement itself (before the specifically ‘‘parliamentary’’ enclosure waves of the eighteenth century) was well under way by the beginning of the seventeenth century, and the first enclosures date from the dissolution of the monasteries. transgressing enclosed borders.6Before the truth of Jones’s blood relation to Allworthy is discovered, Jones cannot claim a legal and moral connection to the land. He lives as a vagabond, without any right to English soil and, consequently, any legitimized form of identity. Escaping his label as a vagabond to eventually become a legal landowner is synecdochic of a narrative imperative that buttresses the classical novel form: The novel’s hero reaches his or her maturation by domesticating itinerant (false) tendencies. By connecting identity maturation to gaining a legal and moral right to the land, Fielding replicates Defoe’s narrative and the development of Crusoe from a wayward traveler who has no identity to a landowning governor. This relation between identity and the land appears repeatedly in the form of an anxiety that overwhelms the (pre)imperial subject, an impatience marked by a certain nonfoundational nomadic movement that must eventually be tamed and managed by being inserted into a colonial system of utility. Robinson Crusoe, in the early stages of his identity formation, feels compelled time and again to escape from national borders by going to sea, even at the risk of his own death. What becomes transparent is a nonsubjective ontological flow of desire, an irreducible and founding concomitant of the act of constituting an imperial subjectivity. The colonialist/imperial opposition between a self who is governed by an unruly nomadic impulse and one who has domesticated this impulse by becoming an agriculturalist (settler) is a structural imperative of Western teleological narratives of identity formation: The movement of nomadic desire must come under control through the commodification of that desire in a colonialist apparatus. The specific form of that commodification is the enclosure act—the grounding of a previously open subjectivity in a fabricated (colonized) land. Symptoms of this fear of uncolonized desire/land surface in other novels. Samuel Richardson’s Pamela states at one point that she would go so far as to suffer the terrors of being stranded on some ‘‘wild common’’ rather than stay in confinement with Mr. B. Yet when a chance to escape arises, she recoils from crossing this anarchic territory. In Tobias Smollet’s Humphrey Clinker, Matthew Bramble travels extensively through England, Assiduously tallying the financial success and the‘‘civility’’of those who have cultivated enclosures out of ‘‘uninhabitable’’ fields ‘‘lying [in] waste.’’ At the end of the novel, Bramble proudly proclaims that everything within his field of vision has reached the point of being regulated to his satisfaction: The fields have been ‘‘improved,’’ the economy of the farms are being ‘‘superintended,’’ and the general cultivation of enclosed country life gradually finds the characters ‘‘perfectly at ease in both . . . mind and body.’’7In Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, the unenclosed commons appear as a region of delinquency, an influence leading to a lack of mental discipline, to a ‘‘loitering’’ and wild mind.8E.P.Thompson has shown that signifiers such as wild, barbarian, and wicked came to be part of one’s daily vocabulary when referencing those who lived on the commons.9George Eliot deploys a similar metaphorics of enclosure in her novels. In Adam Bede, the wealthy landowner Arthur Donnithorne dreams of applying the enclosing techniques of the famous agriculturalist Arthur Young. In this manner, he can discipline himself and tame the ‘‘wild country’’ but also discipline his farmers to ‘‘a better management of the land,’’ whereby he may ‘‘overlook’’ them from atop his horse.10In Charlotte Brontë’s Shirley, Robert Moore triumphs as the hero at the end of the novel, in part because of his promise to reterritorialize the landscape by securing an act to enclose the open space of Nunnely Common. With an act of enclosure, the tensions of the novel disappear; everything finds its ‘‘proper’’ place at the conclusion: Moore doubles the value of his mill property, expands his manufacture and holdings, turns ‘‘wild ravines’’ into ‘‘smooth descents,’’ remakes the ‘‘rough pebbled track’’ into an ‘‘even, firm, broad, black, sooty road,’’ and parcels out the entire parish between himself and his brother.<br />
<br />
<strong>C) The alternative is to re-imagine space as a place of utter chaos without any sense of dictation that allows us to truly realize the imperial ontology that creates the unknown as an adversary for freedom and an enemy of the Rhizome</strong><br />
<strong>Spanos in 2009</strong> (Willam V. Distinguished Professor of English and comparative literature at Binghamton University, “Disclosing Enclosure,” symploke, Volume 17, Numbers 1-2, 2009, pp. 307-315 (Review), MUSE, JR2)<br />
Following his genealogical examination of these early, canon-forming British novels that focus primarily on the way the enclosure of the open land of the Commons inaugurates the self as “free” individual and the nation as a unified space of privatized of property, Marzec goes on to analyze a number of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century British novels that in increasing degree point both 1) to the fulfillment of the logical economy of land enclosure in the establishment of the global enclosure movement that has come to be called imperialism and 2) to its demise: the dis-closure in the very moment of arriving at its logical end (its closure) of that ineffable (unrepresentable) force of being that this disciplinary logic of enclosure, which see it as “lack,” cannot finally contain. In so doing, they also announce 3) an alternative—an-archic, non-representational—understanding of the land, that is, the positive onto-eco-political possibilities inhering in precisely what the truth discourse of enclosure demonized: the nothing, the earth, openness, agonic relationality (between human beings and the land), instability, singularity, errancy, nomadic flow, the commons, and so forth. In the process, not incidentally, Marzec shows how blinded to the crucial ontological register the canonical and even avant-garde commentators on these modernist novels have been by their unexamined adherence to the very visualist/disciplinary perspective (the view from above—what Althuser would call their capitalist “problematic”—that compartmentalizes being into (spatial) tables (and disciplines) that constructed—and naturalized—the individual self, the nation as space of private property, and the imperial world view. “The conclusions drawn from these liberal humanist approaches…to the question of finding a ‘truer’ relation to one’s territory,’’ Marzec writes, “all fail to break free from the economy of agricentrism, which can be seen at play in the very terms deployed by these critics in the struggle to gain freedom: ‘middle ground,’ ‘unity,’ ‘organic essence,’ ‘landscape,’ ‘order,’ ‘balance,’ ‘equilibrium,’ and so on.” As a result, this “search for a ‘truer’ relation based on an organically inherent equilibrium occludes the resistant character of the land, and passes by the possibility of thinking humanity’s proximity to the land from the dynamic of an exchange-limit structure” that wards off the apparatuses of capture (126). Once this regulative logic of enclosure has been thematized, in other words, Marzec’s book goes on to infer an alternative postcolonial strategy that thinks the alienation of the subject produced by the dynamics of enclosure primarily in terms Heidegger’s essays on the relation between earth and world (the essays “The Question Concerning Technology,” “The Origins of the Work of Art,” “Building Dwelling, Thinking,” for example ) and, above 312 all, Deleuze and Guattari’s “Treatise on Nomadology,” in their great book Milles plateaux (1980). This “nomadology,” Marzec claims in the process of a lucid and illuminating earlier reading of this difficult text, enables a return to the (non)foundational imperatives that endows human being with an identityless self that relates to the resistant earth in the form of the rhizomatic inhabitancy that the individuating and alienating logic of enclosure has disabled. Marzec inaugurates this turn toward the question of a people’s integral/rhizomatic relation to the land and to the potential resistance to acts of enclosure and colonization by way of extremely original deconstructive readings of Thomas Hardy’s Return of the Native (1878), D. H. Lawrence’s The Rainbow (1915), and, above all, E. M. Forster’s Howard’s End (1910) and A Passage to India (1924): the fiction that the fulfillment of the “benign” logic of both domestic and global enclosure has compelled it to address by way of disclosing at this end its predatory essence. All of these novels published in the interregnum between the colonial and postcolonial ages, each in their own degree and way, disclose what the dominant and polyvalent discourse of enclosure represent as “lack” (negatively) to be a positive “warding off”: the finally unaccommodatable spectral force that haunts the structuralist discourse of enclosure that would transform “it” into “meaning.” I cite, for economy, an exemplary passage from Marzec’s originary reading of E. M. Forster’s Howard’s End and A Passage to India, in which Forster pits the Hindu professor, Godbole’s non-presentational language, attuned to the earth’s resistance to classified and fixed, against his English interrogators’ anxious will, grounded ultimately in the logic of enclosure, to name the ineffable Marabar caves: As the conversation unfolds, each of the characters attempts to nail down the correct description of the caves. They each attempt to name the precise nature of the caves, to unearth their meaning. Godbole, however, is carrying on a different kind of communicatory act, which the others do not hear. The caves appear in a tendential emergence that cannot be traced. They are not an object to be given over to mastery, but an opening that the characters cannot assail. And they cannot assail it for the very reason that they all take the approach of “discovery.” It is, in fact, exactly the imperial logic of discovery that the novel travesties in this passage. The conversation begins to exert pressure on the characters’ need to know, their need to explore, and stake a claim for understanding. It is this same kind of withholding of positive knowledge that we see performed as well in the character of Ruth Wilcox [in Howard’s End],who, when she is coerced by Margaret into giving a precise answer [in an earlier conversation], move’s “with<br />
uneasiness beneath the clothes.” (147)<br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">94. By &quot;freedom&quot; we mean the opportunity to go through the power process, with real goals not the artificial goals of surrogate activities, and without interference, manipulation or supervision from anyone, especially from any large organization. Freedom means being in control (either as an individual or as a member of a SMALL group) of the life-and-death issues of one's existence; food, clothing, shelter and defense against whatever threats there may be in one's environment. Freedom means having power; not the power to control other people but the power to control the circumstances of one's own life. One does not have freedom if anyone else (especially a large organization) has power over one, no matter how benevolently, tolerantly and permissively that power may be exercised. It is important not to confuse freedom with mere permissiveness (see paragraph 72). 95. It is said that we live in a free society because we have a certain number of constitutionally guaranteed rights. But these are not as important as they seem. The degree of personal freedom that exists in a society is determined more by the economic and technological structure of the society than by its laws or its form of government. [16] Most of the Indian nations of New England were monarchies, and many of the cities of the Italian Renaissance were controlled by dictators. But in reading about these societies one gets the impression that they allowed far more personal freedom than our society does. In part this was because they lacked efficient mechanisms for enforcing the ruler's will: There were no modern, well-organized police forces, no rapid long-distance communications, no surveillance cameras, no dossiers of information about the lives of average citizens. Hence it was relatively easy to evade control. 96. As for our constitutional rights, consider for example that of freedom of the press. We certainly don't mean to knock that right: it is very important tool for limiting concentration of political power and for keeping those who do have political power in line by publicly exposing any misbehavior on their part. But freedom of the press is of very little use to the average citizen as an individual. The mass media are mostly under the control of large organizations that are integrated into the system. Anyone who has a little money can have something printed, or can distribute it on the Internet or in some such way, but what he has to say will be swamped by the vast volume of material put out by the media, hence it will have no practical effect. To make an impression on society with words is therefore almost impossible for most individuals and small groups. Take us (FC) for example. If we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present writings to a publisher, they probably would not have been accepted. If they had been accepted and published, they probably would not have attracted many readers, because it's more fun to watch the entertainment put out by the media than to read a sober essay. Even if these writings had had many readers, most of these readers would soon have forgotten what they had read as their minds were flooded by the mass of material to which the media expose them. In order to get our message before the public with some chance of making a lasting impression, we've had to kill people. 97. Constitutional rights are useful up to a point, but they do not serve to guarantee much more than what could be called the bourgeois conception of freedom. According to the bourgeois conception, a &quot;free&quot; man is essentially an element of a social machine and has only a certain set of prescribed and delimited freedoms; freedoms that are designed to serve the needs of the social machine more than those of the individual. Thus the bourgeois's &quot;free&quot; man has economic freedom because that promotes growth and progress; he has freedom of the press because public criticism restrains misbehavior by political leaders; he has a right to a fair trial because imprisonment at the whim of the powerful would be bad for the system. This was clearly the attitude of Simon Bolivar. To him, people deserved liberty only if they used it to promote progress (progress as conceived by the bourgeois). Other bourgeois thinkers have taken a similar view of freedom as a mere means to collective ends. Chester C. Tan, &quot;Chinese Political Thought in the Twentieth Century,&quot; page 202, explains the philosophy of the Kuomintang leader Hu Han-min: &quot;An individual is granted rights because he is a member of society and his community life requires such rights. By community Hu meant the whole society of the nation.&quot; And on page 259 Tan states that according to Carsum Chang (Chang Chun-mai, head of the State Socialist Party in China) freedom had to be used in the interest of the state and of the people as a whole. But what kind of freedom does one have if one can use it only as someone else prescribes? FC's conception of freedom is not that of Bolivar, Hu, Chang or other bourgeois theorists. The trouble with such theorists is that they have made the development and application of social theories their surrogate activity. Consequently the theories are designed to serve the needs of the theorists more than the needs of any people who may be unlucky enough to live in a society on which the theories are imposed. 98. One more point to be made in this section: It should not be assumed that a person has enough freedom just because he SAYS he has enough. Freedom is restricted in part by psychological control of which people are unconscious, and moreover many people's ideas of what constitutes freedom are governed more by social convention than by their real needs. For example, it's likely that many leftists of the oversocialized type would say that most people, including themselves are socialized too little rather than too much, yet the oversocialized leftist pays a heavy psychological price for his high level of socialization.</span><br />

<strong>That causes the enslavement of everything and eventual extinction</strong><br />

171. But suppose now that industrial society does survive the next several decade and that the bugs do eventually get worked out of the system, so that it functions smoothly. What kind of system will it be? We will consider several possibilities. 172. First let us postulate that the computer scientists succeed in developing intelligent machines that can do all things better that human beings can do them. In that case presumably all work will be done by vast, highly organized systems of machines and no human effort will be necessary. Either of two cases might occur. The machines might be permitted to make all of their own decisions without human oversight, or else human control over the machines might be retained. 173. If the machines are permitted to make all their own decisions, we can't make any conjectures as to the results, because it is impossible to guess how such machines might behave. We only point out that the fate of the human race would be at the mercy of the machines. It might be argued that the human race would never be foolish enough to hand over all the power to the machines. But we are suggesting neither that the human race would voluntarily turn power over to the machines nor that the machines would willfully seize power. What we do suggest is that the human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines' decisions. As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more of their decision for them, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made ones. Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently. At that stage the machines will be in effective control. People won't be able to just turn the machines off, because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would amount to suicide. 174. On the other hand it is possible that human control over the machines may be retained. In that case the average man may have control over certain private machines of his own, such as his car or his personal computer, but control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a tiny elite -- just as it is today, but with two difference. Due to improved techniques the elite will have greater control over the masses; and because human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous, a useless burden on the system. If the elite is ruthless the may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity. If they are humane they may use propaganda or other psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity becomes extinct, leaving the world to the elite. Or, if the elite consists of soft-hearted liberals, they may decide to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the human race. They will see to it that everyone's physical needs are satisfied, that all children are raised under psychologically hygienic conditions, that everyone has a wholesome hobby to keep him busy, and that anyone who may become dissatisfied undergoes &quot;treatment&quot; to cure his &quot;problem.&quot; Of course, life will be so purposeless that people will have to be biologically or psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the power process or to make them &quot;sublimate&quot; their drive for power into some harmless hobby. These engineered human beings may be happy in such a society, but they most certainly will not be free. They will have been reduced to the status of domestic animals. 175. But suppose now that the computer scientists do not succeed in developing artificial intelligence, so that human work remains necessary. Even so, machines will take care of more and more of the simpler tasks so that there will be an increasing surplus of human workers at the lower levels of ability. (We see this happening already. There are many people who find it difficult or impossible to get work, because for intellectual or psychological reasons they cannot acquire the level of training necessary to make themselves useful in the present system.) On those who are employed, ever-increasing demands will be placed; They will need more and more training, more and more ability, and will have to be ever more reliable, conforming and docile, because they will be more and more like cells of a giant organism. Their tasks will be increasingly specialized so that their work will be, in a sense, out of touch with the real world, being concentrated on one tiny slice of reality. The system will have to use any means that it can, whether psychological or biological, to engineer people to be docile, to have the abilities that the system requires and to &quot;sublimate&quot; their drive for power into some specialized task. But the statement that the people of such a society will have to be docile may require qualification. The society may find competitiveness useful, provided that ways are found of directing competitiveness into channels that serve that needs of the system. We can imagine a future society in which there is endless competition for positions of prestige and power. But no more than a very few people will ever reach the top, where the only real power is (see end of paragraph 163). Very repellent is a society in which a person can satisfy his needs for power only by pushing large numbers of other people out of the way and depriving them of THEIR opportunity for power. 176. Once can envision scenarios that incorporate aspects of more than one of the possibilities that we have just discussed. For instance, it may be that machines will take over most of the work that is of real, practical importance, but that human beings will be kept busy by being given relatively unimportant work. It has been suggested, for example, that a great development of the service of industries might provide work for human beings. Thus people will would spend their time shinning each others shoes, driving each other around in taxicabs, making handicrafts for one another, waiting on each other's tables, etc. This seems to us a thoroughly contemptible way for the human race to end up, and we doubt that many people would find fulfilling lives in such pointless busy-work. They would seek other, dangerous outlets (drugs, crime, &quot;cults,&quot; hate groups) unless they were biological or psychologically engineered to adapt them to such a way of life. 177. Needless to say, the scenarios outlined above do not exhaust all the possibilities. They only indicate the kinds of outcomes that seem to us most likely. But we can envision no plausible scenarios that are any more palatable that the ones we've just described. It is overwhelmingly probable that if the industrial-technological system survives the next 40 to 100 years, it will by that time have developed certain general characteristics: Individuals (at least those of the &quot;bourgeois&quot; type, who are integrated into the system and make it run, and who therefore have all the power) will be more dependent than ever on large organizations; they will be more &quot;socialized&quot; that ever and their physical and mental qualities to a significant extent (possibly to a very great extent ) will be those that are engineered into them rather than being the results of chance (or of God's will, or whatever); and whatever may be left of wild nature will be reduced to remnants preserved for scientific study and kept under the supervision and management of scientists (hence it will no longer be truly wild). In the long run (say a few centuries from now) it is likely that neither the human race nor any other important organisms will exist as we know them today, because once you start modifying organisms through genetic engineering there is no reason to stop at any particular point, so that the modifications will probably continue until man and other organisms have been utterly transformed. 178. Whatever else may be the case, it is certain that technology is creating for human begins a new physical and social environment radically different from the spectrum of environments to which natural selection has adapted the human race physically and psychological. If man is not adjusted to this new environment by being artificially re-engineered, then he will be adapted to it through a long and painful process of natural selection. The former is far more likely that the latter. 179. It would be better to dump the whole stinking system and take the consequences.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our first priority is to destroy the industrial-technological system. Use your ballot to recruit a brigade of revolutionaries to challenge and eliminate the system.</strong><br />
<br />

180. The technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the unknown. Many people understand something of what technological progress is doing to us yet take a passive attitude toward it because they think it is inevitable. But we (FC) don't think it is inevitable. We think it can be stopped, and we will give here some indications of how to go about stopping it. 181. As we stated in paragraph 166, the two main tasks for the present are to promote social stress and instability in industrial society and to develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the industrial system. When the system becomes sufficiently stressed and unstable, a revolution against technology may be possible. The pattern would be similar to that of the French and Russian Revolutions. French society and Russian society, for several decades prior to their respective revolutions, showed increasing signs of stress and weakness. Meanwhile, ideologies were being developed that offered a new world view that was quite different from the old one. In the Russian case, revolutionaries were actively working to undermine the old order. Then, when the old system was put under sufficient additional stress (by financial crisis in France, by military defeat in Russia) it was swept away by revolution. What we propose in something along the same lines. 182. It will be objected that the French and Russian Revolutions were failures. But most revolutions have two goals. One is to destroy an old form of society and the other is to set up the new form of society envisioned by the revolutionaries. The French and Russian revolutionaries failed (fortunately!) to create the new kind of society of which they dreamed, but they were quite successful in destroying the existing form of society. 183. But an ideology, in order to gain enthusiastic support, must have a positive ideals well as a negative one; it must be FOR something as well as AGAINST something. The positive ideal that we propose is Nature. That is, WILD nature; those aspects of the functioning of the Earth and its living things that are independent of human management and free of human interference and control. And with wild nature we include human nature, by which we mean those aspects of the functioning of the human individual that are not subject to regulation by organized society but are products of chance, or free will, or God (depending on your religious or philosophical opinions). 184. Nature makes a perfect counter-ideal to technology for several reasons. Nature (that which is outside the power of the system) is the opposite of technology (which seeks to expand indefinitely the power of the system). Most people will agree that nature is beautiful; certainly it has tremendous popular appeal. The radical environmentalists ALREADY hold an ideology that exalts nature and opposes technology. [30] It is not necessary for the sake of nature to set up some chimerical utopia or any new kind of social order. Nature takes care of itself: It was a spontaneous creation that existed long before any human society, and for countless centuries many different kinds of human societies coexisted with nature without doing it an excessive amount of damage. Only with the Industrial Revolution did the effect of human society on nature become really devastating. To relieve the pressure on nature it is not necessary to create a special kind of social system, it is only necessary to get rid of industrial society. Granted, this will not solve all problems. Industrial society has already done tremendous damage to nature and it will take a very long time for the scars to heal. Besides, even pre-industrial societies can do significant damage to nature. Nevertheless, getting rid of industrial society will accomplish a great deal. It will relieve the worst of the pressure on nature so that the scars can begin to heal. It will remove the capacity of organized society to keep increasing its control over nature (including human nature). Whatever kind of society may exist after the demise of the industrial system, it is certain that most people will live close to nature, because in the absence of advanced technology there is no other way that people CAN live. To feed themselves they must be peasants or herdsmen or fishermen or hunter, etc., And, generally speaking, local autonomy should tend to increase, because lack of advanced technology and rapid communications will limit the capacity of governments or other large organizations to control local communities. 185. As for the negative consequences of eliminating industrial society -- well, you can't eat your cake and have it too. To gain one thing you have to sacrifice another.186. Most people hate psychological conflict. For this reason they avoid doing any serious thinking about difficult social issues, and they like to have such issues presented to them in simple, black-and-white terms: THIS is all good and THAT is all bad. The revolutionary ideology should therefore be developed on two levels. 187. On the more sophisticated level the ideology should address itself to people who are intelligent, thoughtful and rational. The object should be to create a core of people who will be opposed to the industrial system on a rational, thought-out basis, with full appreciation of the problems and ambiguities involved, and of the price that has to be paid for getting rid of the system. It is particularly important to attract people of this type, as they are capable people and will be instrumental in influencing others. These people should be addressed on as rational a level as possible. Facts should never intentionally be distorted and intemperate language should be avoided. This does not mean that no appeal can be made to the emotions, but in making such appeal care should be taken to avoid misrepresenting the truth or doing anything else that would destroy the intellectual respectability of the ideology. 188. On a second level, the ideology should be propagated in a simplified form that will enable the unthinking majority to see the conflict of technology vs. nature in unambiguous terms. But even on this second level the ideology should not be expressed in language that is so cheap, intemperate or irrational that it alienates people of the thoughtful and rational type. Cheap, intemperate propaganda sometimes achieves impressive short-term gains, but it will be more advantageous in the long run to keep the loyalty of a small number of intelligently committed people than to arouse the passions of an unthinking, fickle mob who will change their attitude as soon as someone comes along with a better propaganda gimmick. However, propaganda of the rabble-rousing type may be necessary when the system is nearing the point of collapse and there is a final struggle between rival ideologies to determine which will become dominant when the old world-view goes under. 189. Prior to that final struggle, the revolutionaries should not expect to have a majority of people on their side. History is made by active, determined minorities, not by the majority, which seldom has a clear and consistent idea of what it really wants. Until the time comes for the final push toward revolution [31], the task of revolutionaries will be less to win the shallow support of the majority than to build a small core of deeply committed people. As for the majority, it will be enough to make them aware of the existence of the new ideology and remind them of it frequently; though of course it will be desirable to get majority support to the extent that this can be done without weakening the core of seriously committed people. 190. Any kind of social conflict helps to destabilize the system, but one should be careful about what kind of conflict one encourages. The line of conflict should be drawn between the mass of the people and the power-holding elite of industrial society (politicians, scientists, upper-level business executives, government officials, etc..). It should NOT be drawn between the revolutionaries and the mass of the people. For example, it would be bad strategy for the revolutionaries to condemn Americans for their habits of consumption. Instead, the average American should be portrayed as a victim of the advertising and marketing industry, which has suckered him into buying a lot of junk that he doesn't need and that is very poor compensation for his lost freedom. Either approach is consistent with the facts. It is merely a matter of attitude whether you blame the advertising industry for manipulating the public or blame the public for allowing itself to be manipulated. As a matter of strategy one should generally avoid blaming the public. 191. One should think twice before encouraging any other social conflict than that between the power-holding elite (which wields technology) and the general public (over which technology exerts its power). For one thing, other conflicts tend to distract attention from the important conflicts (between power-elite and ordinary people, between technology and nature); for another thing, other conflicts may actually tend to encourage technologization, because each side in such a conflict wants to use technological power to gain advantages over its adversary. This is clearly seen in rivalries between nations. It also appears in ethnic conflicts within nations. For example, in America many black leaders are anxious to gain power for African Americans by placing back individuals in the technological power-elite. They want there to be many black government officials, scientists, corporation executives and so forth. In this way they are helping to absorb the African American subculture into the technological system. Generally speaking, one should encourage only those social conflicts that can be fitted into the framework of the conflicts of power--elite vs. ordinary people, technology vs. nature. 192. But the way to discourage ethnic conflict is NOT through militant advocacy of minority rights (see paragraphs 21, 29). Instead, the revolutionaries should emphasize that although minorities do suffer more or less disadvantage, this disadvantage is of peripheral significance. Our real enemy is the industrial-technological system, and in the struggle against the system, ethnic distinctions are of no importance. 193. The kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve an armed uprising against any government. It may or may not involve physical violence, but it will not be a POLITICAL revolution. Its focus will be on technology and economics, not politics. [32] 194. Probably the revolutionaries should even AVOID assuming political power, whether by legal or illegal means, until the industrial system is stressed to the danger point and has proved itself to be a failure in the eyes of most people. Suppose for example that some &quot;green&quot; party should win control of the United States Congress in an election. In order to avoid betraying or watering down their own ideology they would have to take vigorous measures to turn economic growth into economic shrinkage. To the average man the results would appear disastrous: There would be massive unemployment, shortages of commodities, etc. Even if the grosser ill effects could be avoided through superhumanly skillful management, still people would have to begin giving up the luxuries to which they have become addicted. Dissatisfaction would grow, the &quot;green&quot; party would be voted out of office and the revolutionaries would have suffered a severe setback. For this reason the revolutionaries should not try to acquire political power until the system has gotten itself into such a mess that any hardships will be seen as resulting from the failures of the industrial system itself and not from the policies of the revolutionaries. The revolution against technology will probably have to be a revolution by outsiders, a revolution from below and not from above. 195. The revolution must be international and worldwide. It cannot be carried out on a nation-by-nation basis. Whenever it is suggested that the United States, for example, should cut back on technological progress or economic growth, people get hysterical and start screaming that if we fall behind in technology the Japanese will get ahead of us. Holy robots! The world will fly off its orbit if the Japanese ever sell more cars than we do! (Nationalism is a great promoter of technology.) More reasonably, it is argued that if the relatively democratic nations of the world fall behind in technology while nasty, dictatorial nations like China, Vietnam and North Korea continue to progress, eventually the dictators may come to dominate the world. That is why the industrial system should be attacked in all nations simultaneously, to the extent that this may be possible. True, there is no assurance that the industrial system can be destroyed at approximately the same time all over the world, and it is even conceivable that the attempt to overthrow the system could lead instead to the domination of the system by dictators. That is a risk that has to be taken. And it is worth taking, since the difference between a &quot;democratic&quot; industrial system and one controlled by dictators is small compared with the difference between an industrial system and a non-industrial one. [33] It might even be argued that an industrial system controlled by dictators would be preferable, because dictator-controlled systems usually have proved inefficient, hence they are presumably more likely to break down. Look at Cuba. 196. Revolutionaries might consider favoring measures that tend to bind the world economy into a unified whole. Free trade agreements like NAFTA and GATT are probably harmful to the environment in the short run, but in the long run they may perhaps be advantageous because they foster economic interdependence between nations. It will be easier to destroy the industrial system on a worldwide basis if the world economy is so unified that its breakdown in any one major nation will lead to its breakdown in all industrialized nations. 197. Some people take the line that modern man has too much power, too much control over nature; they argue for a more passive attitude on the part of the human race. At best these people are expressing themselves unclearly, because they fail to distinguish between power for LARGE ORGANIZATIONS and power for INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS. It is a mistake to argue for powerlessness and passivity, because people NEED power. Modern man as a collective entity--that is, the industrial system--has immense power over nature, and we (FC) regard this as evil. But modern INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS have far less power than primitive man ever did. Generally speaking, the vast power of &quot;modern man&quot; over nature is exercised not by individuals or small groups but by large organizations. To the extent that the average modern INDIVIDUAL can wield the power of technology, he is permitted to do so only within narrow limits and only under the supervision and control of the system. (You need a license for everything and with the license come rules and regulations). The individual has only those technological powers with which the system chooses to provide him. His PERSONAL power over nature is slight. 198. Primitive INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS actually had considerable power over nature; or maybe it would be better to say power WITHIN nature. When primitive man needed food he knew how to find and prepare edible roots, how to track game and take it with homemade weapons. He knew how to protect himself from heat, cold, rain, dangerous animals, etc. But primitive man did relatively little damage to nature because the COLLECTIVE power of primitive society was negligible compared to the COLLECTIVE power of industrial society. 199. Instead of arguing for powerlessness and passivity, one should argue that the power of the INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM should be broken, and that this will greatly INCREASE the power and freedom of INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS. 200. Until the industrial system has been thoroughly wrecked, the destruction of that system must be the revolutionaries' ONLY goal. Other goals would distract attention and energy from the main goal. More importantly, if the revolutionaries permit themselves to have any other goal than the destruction of technology, they will be tempted to use technology as a tool for reaching that other goal. If they give in to that temptation, they will fall right back into the technological trap, because modern technology is a unified, tightly organized system, so that, in order to retain SOME technology, one finds oneself obliged to retain MOST technology, hence one ends up sacrificing only token amounts of technology. 201. Suppose for example that the revolutionaries took &quot;social justice&quot; as a goal. Human nature being what it is, social justice would not come about spontaneously; it would have to be enforced. In order to enforce it the revolutionaries would have to retain central organization and control. For that they would need rapid long-distance transportation and communication, and therefore all the technology needed to support the transportation and communication systems. To feed and clothe poor people they would have to use agricultural and manufacturing technology. And so forth. So that the attempt to insure social justice would force them to retain most parts of the technological system. Not that we have anything against social justice, but it must not be allowed to interfere with the effort to get rid of the technological system. 202. It would be hopeless for revolutionaries to try to attack the system without using SOME modern technology. If nothing else they must use the communications media to spread their message. But they should use modern technology for only ONE purpose: to attack the technological system. 203. Imagine an alcoholic sitting with a barrel of wine in front of him. Suppose he starts saying to himself, &quot;Wine isn't bad for you if used in moderation. Why, they say small amounts of wine are even good for you! It won't do me any harm if I take just one little drink...&quot; Well you know what is going to happen. Never forget that the human race with technology is just like an alcoholic with a barrel of wine. 204. Revolutionaries should have as many children as they can. There is strong scientific evidence that social attitudes are to a significant extent inherited. No one suggests that a social attitude is a direct outcome of a person's genetic constitution, but it appears that personality traits tend, within the context of our society, to make a person more likely to hold this or that social attitude. Objections to these findings have been raised, but objections are feeble and seem to be ideologically motivated. In any event, no one denies that children tend on the average to hold social attitudes similar to those of their parents. From our point of view it doesn't matter all that much whether the attitudes are passed on genetically or through childhood training. In either case they ARE passed on. 205. The trouble is that many of the people who are inclined to rebel against the industrial system are also concerned about the population problems, hence they are apt to have few or no children. In this way they may be handing the world over to the sort of people who support or at least accept the industrial system. To insure the strength of the next generation of revolutionaries the present generation must reproduce itself abundantly. In doing so they will be worsening the population problem only slightly. And the most important problem is to get rid of the industrial system, because once the industrial system is gone the world's population necessarily will decrease (see paragraph 167); whereas, if the industrial system survives, it will continue developing new techniques of food production that may enable the world's population to keep increasing almost indefinitely. 206. With regard to revolutionary strategy, the only points on which we absolutely insist are that the single overriding goal must be the elimination of modern technology, and that no other goal can be allowed to compete with this one. For the rest, revolutionaries should take an empirical approach. If experience indicates that some of the recommendations made in the foregoing paragraphs are not going to give good results, then those recommendations should be discarded.<br />
