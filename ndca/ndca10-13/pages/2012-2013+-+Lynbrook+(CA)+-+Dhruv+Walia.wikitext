<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 16px;">Util AC</span>

<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 16px;">I affirm. The value is morality. Presume affirmative to counter balance the empirically proven time skew because I have 4 minutes to respond to 7 minutes and 3 minutes to respond to 6 minutes. Additionally, the negative gets to adapt their strategy against the affirmative debater and this allows them to have the perfect counterstrategy giving the negative a huge advantage . Thus, absence any offense you presume affirmative because it is harder to affirm</span>

Because of determinism, our moral praise and blame should be directed in such a way that only seeks to minimize harms. Consequentialism does this since it provides forward looking solutions that will alter antecedent conditions that influence future decisions.

**Newell**

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 6.66667px;">In order to remain in line with our moral intuitions, it seems that our justice system must give up on the retributive justification for punishment. However, as long as the consequentialist argument for punishment can hold up... </span>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8px;">Taking away his rights will ensure that he will not cause any further harm, and his incarceration will serve as a disincentive to others who, without the threat of punishment, may have acted similarly in the future.</span>

Studies show that the number of medical students choosing training in internal medicine, family medicine and geriatrics is down, and many physicians now in practice are leaving the field. Reasons cited include long working hours, the complexity of dealing with chronically ill patients, paperwork, insurance issues and reduced reimbursement by insurers and Medicare. A total of 56 million Americans - roughly 1 in 5 - lack adequate primary care coverage because of a shortage of physicians in their communities, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers. When large numbers of people cannot get basic preventive care or early treatment for conditions before they become serious, costs go up, and everybody ends up paying higher insurance premiums and suffering reduced access to care. Conservative estimates by the University of Missouri and the federal Health Resources and Services Administration suggest that Obama's health plan</span>**__will increase the workload of existing primary care physicians by 29 percent__**<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">between now and the next 15 years. By the same period, the supply of primary care physicians will rise by only 7 percent, </span>**__leading to a shortfall of 35,000 to 44,000 primary care physicians__**<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> who treat adults. Overall population growth and a growing elderly population are driving the projected shortfall.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Entire African countries are being left with less than 500 doctors each because of the ongoing "brain drain" of healthcare staff to the developed world.</span> **__Developed countries find it cheaper to recruit from abroad than to train enough of their own citizens__**__,__ <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">delegates were told at a BMA conference last week. The meeting of delegates from the United States, Canada, Africa, the Commonwealth, and the United Kingdom was convened to discuss the growing crisis in developing countries caused by the escalating migration of doctors and nurses. James Johnson, chairman of BMA council, criticised developed nations for failing to make adequate provision for their own needs: "The number of healthcare workers in many African countries is actually shrinking.</span> **__The effect of this brain drain on the health of those in developing countries is incalculable and catastrophic__**__.__ <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">There is literally in some parts of these countries no health care of any sort</span>."

Ought is defined as a moral obligation

Guarantee is defined by **Oxford Dictionaries as[[home#_ftn1|[1]]]:**

<span class="definition">**__Promise with certainty__**</span>

This establishes that the affirmative has the burden of proving that we are capable of providing universal health care.

Universal health care is defined by **Health Pac[[home#_ftn2|[2]]] as:**

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Universal health care ... insurance program.</span>

There is no such thing as general social good and the concept of the redistribution of wealth is wrong **Nozick[[home#_ftn3|[3]]] 1**

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Why not similarly, ... its citizens.</span>

**__Taxation of earnings__** ...<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> he can realize?</span>

The standard is limiting property rights violations

Thus the negative advocacy is that the government is limited to only exercising the use of legitimate force.

My thesis and sole contention is that universalized health care seizes property involuntarily through taxes.

The government requires tax collection and re-administers it to health care at large. Rice[[home#_ftn5|[5]]] writes:

=<span style="font-family: Times;">France CP </span>= 


<span style="font-family: Times;">Observation 1) The affirmative defines what is topical and untopical based on the advocacy. They exclude other offensive opportunities when they decide to parametricize and forfeit that as untopical. I.E. when they read single payer healthcare is the plan, they cannot have access to advantages based on a tax credits system.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">A is the text of the Counterplan – I advocate we use compulsory insurance. A system that is used in France **Sandier[[home#_ftn1|[1]]] et al** describes the plan</span>

<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10.6667px;">Every year since ... an anti-smoking campaign.</span>




<span style="font-family: Times;">Also, health care isn’t entirely free in this system **Shapiro[[home#_ftn2|[2]]]**</span>

**__<span style="font-size: 16px;">In France, the national ... </span>__**<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">There are no deductibles."</span>


<span style="font-family: Times;">And the French system would be plausible for the US **Bloomberg[[home#_ftn3|[3]]]**</span>

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">To grasp how</span> **__the French s ...__** <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">eyeglasses, and dental care.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">B is the competition –WITH SINGLE PAYER!!!! <-------</span>


<span style="font-family: Times;">1) France’s healthcare system allows private contractors to coexist with an overarching entity of single payer healthcare. I don’t force every doctor to be a part of one care provider.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">2) I specifically say that the government must coexist with private insurance companies. Single payer health care is defined as care that is paid for by one entity. My counterplan says that we should have more than one group paying for healthcare.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">3) All single payer health systems define what treatments are available to the population; France’s system is distinct because they produce a certain amount of treatments based on demand so the theory of supply and demand remains intact **Elkan[[home#_ftn4|[4]]]**</span>
**__<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 15.3333px;">The French health care system is very different from the ...</span>__**<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.6667px;">, there is much greater choice in the French than in the UK health care systems. </span>

C is the Net Benefits –
**Advantage 1**<span style="color: #000000; font-family: serif;">is quality of care</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: serif;">A) The single payer system cannot keep up with demand leading to the forced death of its patience **Tennant[[home#_ftn5|[5]]]**</span>

**__The__** <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">British National Health Service </span>**__(NHS)__**<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> — ...you’re rationing healthcare, the most vulnerable patients are going to suffer the most</span>.

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: serif;">This is specific to single payer healthcare because it says that RATIONING of care is what destroys the quality of care whereas the French system there is an extent to accountability because (a) patients still have to pay a sum of money and (b) people are reimbursed at a later date so there is only a certain amount of care they can get at a given point in time.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: serif;">The French system solves since the healthcare isn’t entirely free **Schabloski[[home#_ftn6|[6]]]**</span>

**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">French residents ... </span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">below a certain amount per year</span>__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10.6667px;">(**€**8774 for 2008-09)</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> are entitled to free coverage</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10.6667px;">30 For a list </span>



**<span style="color: #000000; font-family: serif;">Advantage 2: </span>**<span style="color: #000000; font-family: serif;">Maintenance of Competition</span>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: serif;">France’s system still promotes competition between care providers **Brown[[home#_ftn7|[7]]]**</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10.6667px;">Not only have </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">France </span>__**... <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10.6667px;">care than we enjoy here</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: serif;">Competition is key to solving all benefits the affirmative claims **Kemble[[home#_ftn8|[8]]]**</span>

**__<span style="font-size: 16px;">No competition means ... </span>__**<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">and to ensure sustainability.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 13.3333px;">Education comes first in all debate rounds.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 13.3333px;">1. Education is the primary skill set evaluated by debate because the nature of argumentation is such that superior arguments are evaluated. This requires intellect and research, which are educational skills at their most basic level. This argument **outweighs on strength of link** because it directly appealsto the purpose of debate. This also **outweighs on time frame** because in 10 years, whether or not we won a specific round will not matter, but what we learned will. </span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">2. Focusing on fairness will lead to paralysis, because we will then account for each debater’s pre-round advantages and disadvantages before adjudicating the round. For example, we will need to give poor kids an advantage. Because it is impossible to do so, we can not legitimize the pursuit of fairness. </span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">3. Only a certain threshold is necessary for a fair round. It’s absurd to say a round cannot continue because of a minor infringement on fairness.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">Observation 4) The resolution asks debaters, which criminal justice system is comparatively better because it questions the values of both forms of justice. This means both debaters have the burden of providing a proactive reason to prefer their form of criminal justice. I.E. there must be a reason to prefer retribution for the negative to active the ballot, proving rehabilitation is bad isn’t sufficient.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">Observation 5) Counterplans that are not rooted in retributive theory are not ground for the negative. Proving counterplan x is better than rehabilitation doesn't necessitate that rehabilitation isn’t better than retribution; it just means that counterplan x is better than rehabilitation.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">Observation 6) **Bacik**[[home#_ftn4|[4]]]defines rehabilitation and retribution together</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">3) Any form of oppression is always bad because all individuals are fundamentally morally equal. Legal systems that arbitrarily treat certain groups as having more value than others embody a mindset that leads to the worst sorts of atrocities and genocides. </span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times;">You have an apriori academic and ethical obligation to historically interrogate whiteness – it poisons all social relations, solidifying a permanent system of oppression and rendering problems increasingly invisible to political analysis. Arnesen[[home#_ftn14|[14]]] 01</span>
<span style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times;">Whiteness is not merely one more avenue ... </span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;">as to cast doubt on its utility</span></span>


===Democracy AC=== 
**<span style="font-family: Times;">Bacik[[home#_ftn1|**[1]**]] </span>**<span style="font-family: Times;">defines rehabilitation and retribution together</span>
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10.6667px;">Apart from ... sentences should be tailored to the needs of individual offenders.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Presume affirmative because:</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">1) Time skew. Affirmative debaters are at a technical disadvantage in rebuttals because I have 4 minutes to respond to 7 minutes and 3 minutes to respond to 6 minutes. This means harder to affirm and so if it's a tie at the end of the round you vote aff because the aff did the better debating.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">2) The affirmative has to read the AC blind whereas the negative can choose the perfect counter advocacy. This means it is easier to negate because the negative always has the better ground in the round. Thus if it is a draw at the end of the round the aff did the better debating.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">3) We assume statements are true unless told otherwise. I.E. if I said my name is Dhruv, you have no reason to think otherwise and assume it is true. So presume the truth of the statement until told otherwise.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Observation One) The resolution is a comparative statement between two public policies. This means both debaters have the proactive duty of proving their policy is good because saying the alternative is bad isn’t sufficient to prove their policy is good. Thus, both the affirmative and the negative must show that their policies are somehow preferable.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Ought implies an obligation</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Observation Two) The resolution is a statement that gives the affirmative the ground of proving that rehabilitation is preferable in the eyes of the US federal government because they are the ones that own and maintain the criminal justice system.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Thus the value is governmental obligations</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Next, the most important obligation of the US government is to listen to the will of it's people. The US government is a democracy takes input from its people and decides policies. We elect certain politicians because they believe in the same policies that we do. It is the basic idea of democracy that underlies the authority of the US federal government that states we must listen to the will of the majority; this is precisely what the constitution promotes. Therefore, the US government must look towards a policy that supports the will of the majority.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Thus the standard is acting in accordance with the will of the majority.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Further prefer this standard for seven reasons:</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">1) We must act upon the will of the majority because this prevents corruption, as actors are held accountable for actions Keping<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 16px;">[[home#_ftn2|[2]]]</span></span>
**__<span style="font-family: Times;">Democracy ...</span>__**<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10.6667px;"> dislike it</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">2) The only way we can be certain of our beliefs is through agreement. **Murphy[[home#_ftn3|**[3]**]]**</span>

<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;">In //An ...// convergence,produce justified beliefs.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">3) Moral relativism is true – there can be no objective moral goods</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">a) </span><span style="color: #141413; font-family: Times;">Theories of morality must be subjective to the community to have any value **Haste[[home#_ftn4|**[4]**]]**</span>
**__<span style="font-family: Times;">The 'meaning' ... </span>__**<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;"> pollution which are not shared (Shweder et al, 1987).</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Majority rules does not run into this problem because it takes into account the views of the citizens of specific communities. In this case the US.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">b) Everything that we claim is objectively good always is from my subjective viewpoint. If I claim that action x is moral based on some objective conception of morality, my claim is from a subjective view that is skewed. This means I can never have an objective determination of morality.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Majority rules specifically solves for this issue because it prescribes action based on every subjective view. Objectivity asks us to look at decisions from an impartial perspective and majority rules takes everyone subjective viewpoint into account and creates an end decision based on that. Thus, democracy is impartial because it takes into account the views of everyone.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">4) Majority rules has the highest probability producing the best decision **Christiano[[home#_ftn5|**[5]**]] 1** provides two warrants</span>
**__<span style="font-family: Times;">[First,] democracy </span>__**... <span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;"> of citizens and the causal mechanisms necessary to advance those interests</span>**__<span style="font-family: Times;">.</span>__**
<span style="font-family: Times;">5) Majority rules is also preferable because it encourages citizens to think rationally and thus produces better policies **Christiano[[home#_ftn6|**[6]**]] 2**</span>
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;">Furthermore,</span>**__<span style="font-family: Times;">[First]</span>__**<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;">the broad based .... unreflective subjects.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">The only way we can actually have a perfect moral order is if individuals are rational beings. A democratic decision making process uniquely does this and thus provides the necessary base for any overarching moral rule. Thus, majority rules **comes logically prior** to any prescriptive, universal moral theory.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">6) In the context of a government organization, democracy is the only theory that respects the equality of people **Christiano[[home#_ftn7|**[7]**]] 3**</span>
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;">Many democratic ... , chap. 5).</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">7) A democratic society is inherently valuable **Christiano[[home#_ftn8|**[8]**]] 4**</span>
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;">Some argue that the b**__....__** </span>**__<span style="font-family: Times;">[their] activities </span>__**<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;">they share.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">The thesis and sole contention of the affirmative case is that the majority wills that we ought to use rehabilitation over retribution in the criminal justice system.</span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">A) By an overwhelming majority, the American public supports rehabilitation over retribution **Krisberg[[home#_ftn9|**[9]**]]**</span>

**__<span style="font-family: Times;">By</span>__**<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;">**__...__** </span><span style="font-family: Times;"> **__criminality is inherent.__**</span>


<span style="font-family: Times;">B) Polls from the **Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics[[home#_ftn10|**[10]**]]** further warrant this</span>

===Promises NC=== 
<span style="font-family: Times;">I negate.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">The value is morality because ought implies a moral obligation. The value criterion is supporting and keeping promises that the US Federal Government has made. Prefer this value criterion because</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">1) Preventing inconsistencies is necessary because inconsistency renders morality incoherent **Velasquez[[home#_ftn1|**[1]**]] 1**</span>

<span style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8px;">Consistency—</span>**__<span style="font-size: 16px;">the absence ...</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8px;"> moral development.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">And, not following up on a promise is definitionally an inconsistency because you say you will do something but then you don't do it.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">2) Not guaranteeing rights, which are promises, and looking to the common good only leads to the collapse of society **Velasquez[[home#_ftn2|**[2]**]] 2**</span>
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;">A second problem**__...__** </span><span style="font-family: Times;">**__their virtual collapse.__** </span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">The implication of this is that promise keeping is a prerequisite to the notion of common good supported by ethics. Deontology, utilitarianism, and the like all prescribe actions that promote the most “goodness.” I.E. deontology suggests we ought to treat people as ends in themselves because that is what we believe is the best or as a three year old would put it “goodest.” This card says that we can’t support common good if we don’t all agree to pursue it together making it logically prior to any morally obligatory system of ethics.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">I contend that the USFG is obligated to provide a proportional punishment that is retribution</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">First, the constitution is the most important obligation and promise of the United States Federal Government **Rappaport[[home#_ftn3|**[3]**]]** provides two warrants</span>
<span style="font-size: 8px;">In my view, however, ... be the best one.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">Next, the Supreme Court interpreted the constitution and stated every punishment must be proportional **Cornell[[home#_ftn4|**[4]**]]**</span>

**__<span style="font-size: 16px;">The U.S. Supreme...</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8px;"> cases as disproportionate.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">Moreover, past Supreme Court decisions further warrant this **Scaros[[home#_ftn5|**[5]**]]**</span>

<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 8px;">In 977, the c... seven-to-two decision.</span>

And, this comes first because Supreme Court decisions interpret the Constitution and trump all other law **Silverman[[home#_ftn6|**[6]**]]**

===Punishment NC=== 
<span style="font-family: Times;">I negate and value morality, defined as giving each their due.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">The value criterion is imposing fair punishment. </span>
<span style="font-family: Times;">This is because:</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">It is unfair to expect victims of criminal aggression to bear the cost of their victimization. Bedau and Kelly:</span>
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Bedau, Hugo Adam and Kelly, Erin, "Punishment", //The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2010 Edition)//, Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/punishment/>.</span>
<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.6667px;">We can begin with an empirical ... is the penal sanction attached to the law that defines certain harmful acts as crimes.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times;">Punishment is necessary to enforce the law-the alternative is to allow citizens to be randomly mugged and ax-murdered. Bedau and Kelly 2:</span>
**__<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px;">Even in a just society, </span>__**<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px;">...</span>**__<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px;"> for certain law violations.</span>__**

**<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times;">This effect is empirically proved. Fehr and Fischbacher describe a study that looked at:</span>**
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: 10.6667px;">Ernest Fehr and Urs Fischbacher (University of Zurich, Institute for Empirical Research in Economics) “Social norms and human cooperation,” Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Vol 8 No 4 April 2004, accessed via Elsevier</span>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: 10.6667px;">Fehr and Gachterstudied</span>**__<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times;"> the impact </span>__**<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times;">... **__attained.__** </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: 10.6667px;">Redrawn from </span><span style="color: #030066; font-family: Times; font-size: 10.6667px;">[23] </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: 10.6667px;">with permission.</span>


**<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times;">My sole contention is retribution ought to be valued over rehabilitation in the criminal justice system to provide just punishment.</span>**

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times;">First, t</span><span style="font-family: Times;">he only criterion for eligibility to be punished is breaking the law- exceptions are unfair. Bedau and Kelly 3:</span>
<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.6667px;">The argument for imposing deserved ... where eligibility conditions are met, is justified.</span>
