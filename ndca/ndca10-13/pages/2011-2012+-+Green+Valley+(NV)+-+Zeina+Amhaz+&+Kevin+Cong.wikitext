==<span style="font-size: 12pt;">PLAN</span>== 
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">PLAN: THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SHOULD DEMONSTRATE AND DEPLOY SPACE-BASED SOLAR POWER IN TERMS OF SPACE BASED MISSILE DEFENSE.</span>**

==<span style="font-size: 12pt;">ADVANTAGE ONE</span>== 
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">There are three specific scenarios of rogue proliferation that are on the brink in the status quo – missile defense is key to deter all three:</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">First, North Korea – current missile defense systems are not enough</span>**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Klinger 11 – senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation (Bruce, “North Korea's Imminent Threat”,1/12/11/http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2011/01/north-koreas-imminent-threat)</span>


**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Second, Iran is itching to use cruise missiles – breaking that bubble risks global nuclear instability</span>**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Burgess 10 – Lieutenant General and General of the DIA (Ronald L., “IRAN’S MILITARY POWER”,4/14/10, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/100414_FINAL%20DIA_SFR_to_SASC_Iran_Hearing_20100413.pdf, Date accessed 9/10/11,)</span>


**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Finally, China – nationalism is creating a multipolar power vaccum in East Asia – this is the biggest internal link to war</span>**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kaplan 11 - is senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security</span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">(Robert, The South China Sea Is the Future of Conflict, Sept/Oct 2011, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/08/15/the_south_china_sea_is_the_future_of_conflict?page=0,3, DateAccessed:9/10/11, )</span>


**<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 13pt;">Ballistic missiles are in this season – they boost power projection capabilities and make distance attacks possible</span>**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Missile Defense Agency 11</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(“THE THREAT”, 4/19/11, http://www.mda.mil/system/threat.html)</span>


**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">And we can’t defend against them now – current cuts to space systems mean we can’t intercept attacks</span>**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Holmes, Carafano, and Spring 9 (Kim, PhD - is Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy Studies and Director of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for International Studies, James, PhD - is Assistant Director of the Davis Institute and Senior Research Fellow for National Security and Homeland Security in its Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies, Baker, is a F.

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ballistic missile threats from North Korea and Iran risk global nuclear war – terrestrial interceptors are inefficient and take forever to build</span>**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Obering 7 - Director of the United States Missile Defense Agency</span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">(Lt. Gen. Henry A., “European Missile Defense: The View From The Pentagon”,October 2007, http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2007_10/Obering.asp%2523bio, Date accessed,9/10/11,)</span>


**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">And, China will definitely take advantage of that weakness</span>**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Blumenthal et al 11 - Resident Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (Dan, “ASIAN ALLIANCES IN THE 21st CENTURY”,Summer 2011, http://project2049.net/documents/Asian_Alliances_21st_Century.pdf,Date Accessed:9/10/11,)</span>


**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">US defense failure in that scenario causes China to bombard Taiwan</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">SBSP is key to anti-ballistic missile lasers – solves international security, proliferation, and any risk of wars</span>**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dietzler 7 – Former contributor for National Space Society (David, “WHY SPACE?”,2007, http://www.moonminer.com/WHY_SPACE.html,)</span>

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">And, it powers itself</span>**

**SBSP creates a global bistatic radar system**

Neil, “Space-based Solar Power: Possible Defense Applications and Opportunities for NRL Contributions”,10/23/09, http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA513123)

==<span style="font-size: 12pt;">ADVANTAGE TWO</span>== 

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">China’s current anti-space agenda destroys US pacific deterrence.</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">And without a credible US deterrence in the region it risks collapse of global hegemony, rapid Japan remilitarization, Taiwan conflict and instability in India-Pakistan and Korea</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">SSP allows the U.S. to maintain space control – it can harden satellites, make them more survivable and reconstitute lost assets rapidly</span>**

==<span style="font-size: 12pt;">ADVANTAGE THREE</span>== 
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">NASA is committing us into a nuclear-only deflection system</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nuclear deflection fails – guarantees a bigger asteroid impact</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Asteroid impacts are inevitable - it’s the only scenario for extinction. You have a moral obligation to prevent asteroids – without it it’s just like playing Russian roulette.</span>**
