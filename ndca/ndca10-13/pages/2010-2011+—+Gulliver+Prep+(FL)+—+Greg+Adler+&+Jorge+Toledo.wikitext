<span style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.5in;">Dr. Brown,</span>

<span style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.5in;">My name is Stephen Pipkin and I coach the Gulliver Prep debate team in Miami, Florida. You recently received a question from Kush Patel, a debater at Greenhill, about an argument we make. Kush published his e-mail to you and your response, apparently without your consent or knowledge, on a public website used for debate arguments and plans on using it in a round. I think he misconstrues what our argument is, and I wanted to know if you had a problem with me posting your e-mail in response. If you do, I can let him know, but if you don't, I would like to clarify our argument, get your response, and post it on the website and use it in a round.</span>

<span style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.5in;">Our argument is that counter-narcotics mainly hurts small scale producers because large scale producers are able to afford protection from the government and the Taliban. This is bad because to the extent that counter-narcotics does decrease production in Afghanistan, it only hurts small farmers, not the Taliban who use the protection money to fund the insurgency. The second half of our argument is that to the extent production decreases in Afghanistan, production must increase elsewhere because demand is inelastic, so the price will increase to the point where it becomes attractive for some other potential producer to meet that demand. We identify three possible replacements; Burma, Central Asia, and Pakistan. A shift to Central Asia would be bad because it increases the risk of conflict in an important oil-producing region and a shift to Pakistan would be bad because it destabilizes Pakistan. Is this argument in line with what you write in "The Drug-Conflict Nexus in South Asia: Beyond Taliban Profits and Afghanistan"?</span>

<span style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.5in;">I know it's a little silly to involve you in a dispute between two high school debate teams, but high school debaters are almost uniformly the best of the best, graduating at the top of their classes at some of the best schools in the country. I found the publishing of what you believed to be a private e-mail exchange somewhat troubling and thought this would be a perfect learning opportunity. These are two of the upper tier debate teams in the nation and rounds between them can be influential on debates across the country. Thank you for your time.</span>

<span style="color: #1f497d; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0px;">Dear Mr. Pipkin:</span>
<span style="color: #1f497d; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0px;">The argument you make is essential in line with the argument I make in the chapter. Yes, I don’t believe that eradication can substantially reduce the financial flows to the Taliban, not simply because they also tax drug traffickers, but also because eradication/bans are hard to implement and maintain and there are always opportunities for continually taxing the farmers, and most importantly, because the Taliban makes a lot of money from taxing other legal and illegal economies in Afghanistan and fundraising in Pakistan and the larger Middle East.</span>
<span style="color: #1f497d; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0px;">Regarding your displacement argument: Yes, that’s essentially what I argue, except that I would not necessarily posit that a cultivation shift to Central Asia will fuel violent conflict (it can, in places like Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan), but more broadly that it would be destabilizing politically and hamper international cooperation in that area. I do believe that it would fuel militancy in Pakistan, if it shifted there.</span>
<span style="color: #1f497d; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0px;">No, I wasn’t aware that Kush posted my reply on the web – he certainly didn’t have my permission. But you can post or use my comments above in rebuttal.</span>
<span style="color: #1f497d; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0px;">Best of luck with the debate,</span>

Their mission was to conduct a detailed assessment using a multi-page checklist of indicators and to provide remedial training where required. PTTs have visited 574 of Iraq's approximately 1,000 police stations. For security reasons, PTTs reside on U.S. military bases and make unscheduled visits to Iraqi police facilities for short periods. Although the assessment mission is incomplete, planning has begun for transferring the police assistance program back to the State Department at the end of FY 07. This transition is not driven by conditions in Iraq, but by Washington-based interagency considerations and the budget cycle, which requires submissions for FY 08 in the near future. Given current uncertainties, planners admit that the FY 08 budget submissions will be based on their 'best guess" about the future of the program.</span> </span>
