Plan: The United States Department of Defense should launch microsatellite Anti-Satellite weapons above the Earth’s mesosphere. The program will be deemed the highest level of special access.<br />
Contention 1 is solvency-<br />
Special access means secret- the plan will be done on DOD’s secret budget.<br />
Maroni 89(Alice, freign affairs and national defense division at the congressional research service, “Special Access Programs and the Defense Budget: Understanding the &quot;Black Budget&quot; <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:779:http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/IB87201.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/IB87201.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/IB87201.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:779 -->)<br />
Executive and legislative oversight of highly classified defense programs is of increasing interest to Congress. Members of Congress frequently ask (1) How large is the Department of Defense (DOD) ''black budget?&quot; (2) Does DOD deny Congress information on ''black&quot; programs? (3) How well managed are DOD &quot;black&quot; programs? This interest has grown from concern about (a) the adequacy of legislative oversight, (b) the quality of executive branch program management, (c) the perception that an increasing number of DOD programs, by virtue of their classification, are allowed to circumvent acquisition requirements and avoid proper oversight, (d) the relatively large increase in funding for so-called &quot;black&quot; programs between 1981 and 1988 (e) the perception that the security surrounding ''black&quot; programs prevents .full and effective congressional debate of pertinent program issues. This issue brief describes aspects of the budget process for some of the more highly classified elements of the defense budget and addresses questions frequently asked about so-called &quot;black&quot; programs. The issue for Congress is how to secure sufficient information on &quot;black&quot; programs for sound decisionmaking and effective oversight without unacceptable risk of damaging disclosure or theft of national security secrets. This issue brief does not reveal the &quot;keys&quot; necessary to disaggregate the defense budget into its intelligence components or to identify highly classified programs purposefully disguised in the defense budget. Further, no attempt has been made to verify independently the size of the &quot;black&quot; budget or review any particular special access program. BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS Overview There are different kinds of officially secret Federal Government programs. While access to all classified programs (those programs classified in accordance with classification arrangements prescribed by executive order) requires the &quot;need-to-know&quot; (see glossary for definition) and the proper security clearance, special access controls are often used by various Federal agencies to limit further the distribution of classified information. For example, in the intelligence community, access to information and material denominated as &quot;Sensitive Compartmented Information&quot; or SCI is limited by special access controls. At the Department of Defense (DOD), in accordance with Executive Order 12356, some classified programs are called &quot;special access programs,&quot; i.e., programs for which CRS-2 IB87201 10-24-89 access controls have been established &quot;beyond those normally required for access to Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret information... While not all classified Federal Government programs for which additional security controls are used are formally designated as &quot;special access programs,&quot; most DOD programs designated specifically under DOD Directive 5205.7 and its implementing regulation 5200.1R for special handling procedures are called 11Special Access Programs ... The most highly classified elements of the DOD budget may be organized into three categories: (1) the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP); (2) Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA); and (3) other DOD special access programs. The first two categories are comprised of U.S. intelligence program resources and are reviewed briefly in the following sections (see also Intelligence Budgets: Contents and Releasability, CRS Report 89-465 F). The third, which consists exclusively of DOD programs, has been the focus of legislative proposals to enhance congressional information access and is the main subject of this issue brief.<br />
Can be stealthy-even advanced US couldn’t systems can’t detect.<br />

The last concern is that small satellites may be difficult to detect. The small size of micro- or smaller satellites may pose a serious problem for U.S. space tracking capabilities. The ability to avoid detection or tracking could significantly increase the effectiveness of a co-orbital ASAT or a space mine. Although the United States has a missile launch detection capability that would almost certainly detect the launch of any rocket United States Space Systems: Vulnerabilities and Threats | 17 capable of placing a satellite in orbit, its capability to detect and track a small satellite released from such a rocket is less robust. The United States currently employs a range of optical and radar sensors for tracking objects in space. Although the U.S. space surveillance system currently tracks over 8,000 objects in orbit, the lower limit on the size of objects it can detect is frequently described as being about 10 centimeters and it is &quot;currently limited in its ability to detect and track objects smaller than 30 centimeters.&quot; 24 Thus some small satellites may be able to avoid detection and tracking-particularly if they have been intentionally designed to have reduced radar and optical signatures.<br />
Microsats have no counter-they give US dominating capability to quickly disable enemy satellite systems.<br />

An adversary microsatellite could use two quite different modes to destroy a quarry satellite. The first means is direct impact: placed in an orbit that nearly intersects with its quarry’s, the microsatellite could leisurely fire its rocket to convert a normal and nonthreatening 100-km miss into a direct collision. Accelerating just 0.1 km/s (an expenditure of 3 percent of the satellite mass as rocket fuel) will net a 100-km displacement in 1000 seconds—about one-fifth of an orbit period in LEO, and far too little time for the quarry satellite’s operators to take effective countermeasures. As the microsat approached the quarry, it might deploy a “lethality enhancement device,” such as a weighted net, to improve its chances of success. No short-range defense seems possible against such a high-speed intercept, unless the quarry satellite were capable of rapidly maneuvering out of harm’s way, or unless it deployed confusion devices, such as balloon reflectors, to prevent the microsatellite from homing in on it. Current satellite systems do not have these protective capabilities. Microsatellites could also launch an explosive or projectile. For instance, a quarry would be unable to elude a space mine hovering just tens of meters away and equipped with an explosively driven pellet weapon or shaped-charge projectile. The microsat could also be programmed to fire if blinded or disturbed. Various defenses to microsats can be imagined. A quarry satellite could be outfitted with sensors capable of detecting small, lowspeed satellites, or it might be equipped with specialized defensive vehicles (perhaps even a fleet of bodyguard microsatellites of its own) to repel approaching space mines without harming the quarry. How easy would it be to detect and track such space mines, and thereby thwart their attack? The U.S. Air Force Space Command, headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, indicates that it “is responsible for tracking objects larger than 10 centimeters orbiting Earth,” and currently tracks some 9000 such objects. But even perfect tracking would reveal only after the fact which satellite or launch was responsible for destroying the quarry. A real defense would require additional measures, such as those described above. And it is unclear, at least to us, how proposed U.S. space weapons would protect themselves against such threats.<br />
Microsats feasible now and can effect all earth orbits.<br />

Microsatellites, of all the space weaponry now being developed, are the closest to operational use. Microsatellite “mines” that would blow up or collide with other satellites could be ready to deploy within a few years of a decision to do so. That decision might already have been made, so that deployment could occur within days of a triggering event. These small, maneuverable satellites would be launched into space on rockets or from larger satellites. Once in orbit, they would be self-powered and -guided. Microsatellites are being developed today for surveillance, inspection, and other nonoffensive tasks, but they could also be used as weapons—for example, to attack a far larger and more valuable satellite by blowing up or simply colliding with it at high speed. With compact communications, guidance, control, sensing, and propulsion systems, a microsatellite might weigh only tens or at most hundreds of kilograms, compared to its full-sized cousins weighing thousands of kilograms or more [see illustration, “Mobile Mine”]. Drawing a line between peaceful and hostile microsatellites may be impossible. In January 2003, the U.S. Air Force demonstrated its XSS-10 microsatellite, which repeatedly maneuvered to within 35 meters of a target to take photographs. Had it been equipped with a gun instead of a camera, it could have destroyed the target. Within a few months, the Air Force is due to launch the follow-up XSS-11, designed for “rendezvous and proximity operations”—that is, meeting up with other satellites to perform inspections, maintenance, and the like. However, as an unnamed U.S. defense official candidly acknowledged in an interview with Inside The Pentagon in December 2003, the XSS-11 could also be used as an antisatellite weapon. The United States is not unique in its microsatellite capability. Over the last decade, for instance, researchers at the University of Surrey, in Guildford, England, have successfully launched a range of nonmilitary microsatellites, often in partnership with teams from other countries, and have orbited and tested a “nanosatellite” weighing less than 10 kg. In a sense, microsatellites are as old as space exploration itself. Sputnik-I, weighing in at 84 kg, was technically a microsat, and many of the spacecraft that followed in those early years were similarly small. In the five decades since then, researchers worldwide have steadily refined microsat components, helped tremendously by the general shrinking in sensors and circuitry for computers and communications. At present, a microsat’s guidance and control systems can be miniaturized to considerably less than 1 kg, and can derive both propulsion and power from solar cells, thus reducing weight and launch costs. Although microsatellites are perceived primarily as a threat to satellites in LEO, they could be adapted to attack assets in geosynchronous orbit as well. A space mine would be effective only if it were orbiting very close to its quarry, in almost identical orbit.<br />
Microsats can’t be defended against and can stop enemy ASAT attacks.<br />

Decoys that credibly simulate the radar and optical signatures of the satellite are effective, potentially low-cost methods for diverting an ASAT attack from the actual satellite. The decoy would be located on or inside the host satellite and released at the precise moment for the most effective deployment. Decoys could also include lightweight optical or RF jamming systems to nullify or confuse an ASAT's homing system. Analysts estimate that employment of a decoy system would increase the total system cost by between one and ten percent of the total satellite cost.(91) J. Self-Defense or Escort Defense Capability The ability for a satellite to defend itself against an ASAT attack is a reasonable way to increase the survivability of a high-value space system. One method of self-defense would be to design a suite of optical or radar sensors and small, lightweight missiles into the satellite. Analysts estimate that employment of an on-board self-defense system would increase the total system cost by between ten and twenty percent of the total satellite cost.(92) Alternatively, a small escort satellite carrying the same capabilities might be a more capable system, especially if the goal was to detect, track and intercept the ASAT while the primary satellite continued its mission. Analysts currently estimate that employment of an escort defense system would increase the total system cost by between twenty and forty percent of the total satellite cost.(93) However, with continued advances in technologies for capable microsatellites the cost of deploying such a system will decrease. In the more distant future, self-defense missiles might be replaced by a high-energy lasers or high-power microwave systems.<br />
Space mines feasible and can be done secretly.<br />

Space mines are another space-based weapon that could be used to destroy satellites in orbit through kinetic-energy kill mechanisms. Unlike an SBI ASAT, which would make use of a high-velocity direct ascent interceptor to reach and kill its target, a space mine would be lofted into its own orbit. Space mines could be launched into orbit during a crisis, or perhaps years in advance of a possible future conflict. These weapons, like SBI kill vehicles, could be designed either to collide directly with the target satellite or to produce a pellet cloud that 60 would destroy the satellite. Such a weapon could be stationed in space in a number of ways.146 It could be placed in the same orbit as its intended victim, trailing nearby, a fixed distance away, and detonated on command. Or, it could be placed in the same orbit, but much further way. In that case, the space mine would have to be maneuvered to approach and attack the target. Alternatively, a space mine could be placed in a crossing orbit that would, periodically, place it within striking distance of its intended target. Space mines could be made quite small and lightweight. Using current or near-term technology it would probably be possible to create space mines that fall into the “microsatellite” class (roughly 10 to 100 kilograms). Even smaller space mines could be constructed in the future. The United States and a wide variety of other countries are researching and developing microsatellites, and even smaller satellites (such as oneto- ten kilogram nanosatellites, and picosatellites that weigh under one kilogram), for a wide variety of roles.147 Small size is a potentially important characteristic for a space mine, since it might make covert deployment possible in some cases. Most satellites are launched from a small number of sites, with the launches announced in advance. However, it might be possible to conceal launches of small payloads, from some observers, by using aircraft and smaller ground- and sea-based sites.148 Alternatively, an attempt could be made to deploy a small space mine, unnoticed, from the same launcher used to deploy another, larger commercial or military satellite.149 Because of its extensive, and unmatched, global network of early warning satellites, optical sensors and space tracking radars, it is unlikely that, at present, such surreptitious deployments would go undetected by the United States.150 In any case, even if their launch could be successfully concealed, such satellites might well be detected once in orbit, especially if they engaged in any maneuvering.151 While it would be difficult, at least in the near term, for any other country to place a space mine into orbit without the United States detecting it, it might be possible for the United States to secretly place such a satellite in orbit. And, at least at some point in the future, it may be possible for another country, such as China, that has developed microsatellite technology, to place small space mines in orbit covertly.152 The cost of developing and procuring space mines is difficult to estimate. Among other things, this is because the space mines could vary substantially in terms of size and sophistication. Based on historical cost relationships between satellite weight and costs, however, and assuming average system complexity, a reasonable estimate is that space mines in the 10-100 kilogram class would cost an average of some $5–25 million to acquire.153 Assuming, consistent with the above discussion of SBI ASAT requirements, that the US military would want to be capable of targeting 10-100 enemy satellites, total acquisition costs for such a system would be projected to range from some $100–500 million for 10 space mines, to perhaps $500 million to $2 billion for 100 space mines.154 Development costs might account for as much as half of total acquisition costs in the case of a 10-satellite purchase, and 15 percent of those costs in the case of a 100-satellite buy.155 This represents only a very rough estimate of possible costs. If it were assumed that these space mines would be of relatively complex design (rather than average complexity), their acquisition costs could more than double.156 Costs could also vary dramatically depending on whether the US military planned to deploy the satellites just prior to a potential conflict, or in peacetime so that each potential target satellite would be continuously trailed.157 In the latter case, a substantial number of replenishment satellites would also need to be acquired, since each space mine might have a service life of only 7–10 years. As such, the 20-year lifecycle costs of a force of space mines could be more than three times greater than suggested in the illustration above. Satellite hardening could be an effective countermeasure against space mines armed with pellet cloud warheads if they were located far enough away when fired.158 However, it would be difficult to harden satellites to withstand the destructive effect of such a space mine if its warhead was fired in close proximity to the satellite, or if it was, like an SBI, armed with some type of homing interceptor.159 On the other hand, as with SBIs and any other ASATs that rely on kinetic-energy kill mechanisms, the successful destruction of a satellite with such a space mine would create some amount of space debris. This might not deter a country with relatively little dependence on commercial or military satellites, such as North Korea or Iran, from acquiring and using this type of ASAT. It might even be perceived to be an advantage. But the space-debris problem may make this type of ASAT a relatively unattractive option for the United States. As with an SBI ASAT system, and most other types of ASATs, the use of various other countermeasures, such as decoys and replenishment spares, could substantially reduce the effectiveness of space mines—but much would depend on the specific technologies and techniques employed.<br />

Another space-based concern is micro-satellite-based ASAT weapons. These small satellites would closely approach another satellite, perhaps at a leisurely pace, and then use a simple measure to interfere with it at close range. The micro-satellite could also be in an orbit different from the target but which crosses the target’s orbit, and could make a last-minute diversion to approach. Micro-satellite and close approach technology is certainly dual 72 use, and technology limits are unlikely to be useful in this case. To monitor the behaviour of micro-satellites, one needs the ability to track all objects of a given size; the size of a functional micro-satellite will get smaller as technology improves. One would have to monitor it closely, perhaps in real time, to prevent an attack by last-minute diversion, but for a slow approach, the requirements are much more lax. However, real-time tracking of even the most important orbiting objects is out of reach currently and it is still a technical challenge to find small objects that manoeuvre. There are not sufficient surveillance assets currently in use to monitor a “keep out” zone around even the most important satellites. The establishment and verification of keep out zones do not themselves protect satellites from attack, but it does set norms and assigns responsibility for violations. Long-term security will require the ability to monitor all space launches. Currently there are some two dozen fixed launch sites, from which launches are announced in advance. An unannounced launch from one of these sites would not escape notice for very long. As technology advances, however, it will become more complicated to monitor all space launches. The ability to launch satellites into orbit from mobile platforms exists: the Russian Federation has launched satellites from a submarine and is currently developing airplane-based satellite launch (as is the United States, reportedly), and there is no great technical barrier to using ground-based mobile launchers for satellite launch. To be assured of detecting all launches in a timely manner, one would need early warning-type capability.<br />

Contention 2 is China-<br />
Battle’s between “Postmodernism” and “Realism” are old hat- good US foreign policy towards Asia must take into account multiple standpoints.<br />
Kang 3(David C, Associate Professor of Government and Adjunct Associate Professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. Spring 2003, Vol. 27, No. 4, Pages 57-85 Posted Online March 30, 2006. (doi:10.1162/016228803321951090) © 2003 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Getting Asia Wrong: The Need for New Analytical Frameworks) The paradigm wars have grown stale: Pitting realism, constructivism, and liberalism against one another and then attempting to prove one right while dismissing the others has created a body of soul-crushingly boring research. More useful approaches would include moving within the paradigms and examining the interaction between the unit level and the system. In this vein, recognition that Northeast, Southeast, and South Asia may offer new insights to international relations theorists should be welcome. Examining the possibility that these regions may pose new empirical and theoretical challenges could lead to a fruitful research agenda. Moving the ªeld of international relations in this direction, however, will not be easy. The debate over area studies versus political science theorizing has been healthy for the ªeld of comparative politics, focusing as it has on important issues of research methodology and evidentiary standards.88 Indeed scholars in the ªeld of comparative politics take for granted questions that international relations specialists have only begun to address. These include whether politics in other regions operate differently from the standard European model based on theWestphalian state system, and if so, how and why. In comparative politics, it is accepted that in different countries formal institutions such as “democracy” may not operate in the same way, that authoritarianism has many disparate causes and consequences, and that economic policymaking may differ.89 While much of comparative politics involves applying models and theories originally developed to explain political institutions in the United States to other countries, there is also a consistent stream of research that ºows from area specialists that informs and furthers scholars’ theories.90 There is no one answer: At times general models explain problems better than do case studies; at other times evidence from the cases forces adjustments in the models. Comparative politics is more than a passive recipient of political economy theories developed in the United States and Europe. It involves spirited dialogue between theory and evidence. The international relations discipline could follow this example, but it will require openness to this possibility. In that way, despite the internecine battles in the study of comparative politics, that ªeld has done more than the international relations ªeld to embrace a healthy tension and dialogue between theory and area studies, as well as between U.S. and European models and how they are applied in the rest of the world. One can note difference without it becoming caricature, and that is the goal to which the ªeld of international relations should aspire. There are two general ways in which Asian international relations might prove different. The ªrst concerns the nature of the state. Although countries in Asia are superªcially “Westphalian,” they do not share the same process of development as countries in the West, nor are they designed to address the same pressures and issues that drove the development of the European nationstate system.91 Asia has different historical traditions, different geographic and political realities, and different cultural traditions. Thus it should not be surprising if nation-states in Asia do not necessarily function like states in the West or if they are preoccupied with issues that European nations for the most part resolved long ago, such as internal conºict or questions of legitimacy. On the one hand, many countries in Northeast Asia (e.g., China, Japan, and Korea) have centuries of experience as formal political units, and their histories as sovereign political entities often predate those in the West. Not only does this mean that their national identities may have deeper roots; it also means that Asian perspectives on nationalism and identity may be different, and that issues of legitimacy or nationalism may not be the most important issues for governments in Northeast Asia. On the other hand, many countries in Southeast and South Asia (e.g., Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines) were not as formally organized—even by the mid-twentieth century. For these countries, the creation of modern nation-states has been a different process than it was in Europe, as they have had to establish their political and economic institutions while interacting with states that already have those institutions. These nationstates have been concerned with crafting legitimacy, incorporating ethnic factions, and forging a sense of national identity.<br />
However, war is the more likely scenario- Economics and Liberalization are more likely to be overrun by other institutional influences in the U.S. and China.<br />

Liberal Pessimists Just as there can be optimistic realists, so also it is possible to be pessimistic on what are essentially liberal grounds—that is, with reference primarily to the internal structures and domestic political dynamics of the United States and China—and to the interactions between them that may arise as a result of their very different regimes.57 china: an authoritarian regime in transition? Whatever it may eventually become, most observers would agree that China today is neither a totalitarian state nor a democracy, but rather an authoritarian regime of dubious legitimacy with an uncertain grip on power. Its leaders are the inheritors of an ideology that has lost most of its appeal and, far from being able to rely on the freely given support of their people, they are heavily dependent on the military and domestic security services for the preservation of domestic order. The Beijing government now bases its claim to rule less on communist principles than on the promise of continued increases in prosperity (and the avoidance of social chaos), combined with appeals to nationalism. This is a dangerous and unstable mixture. If economic progress falters, the present government will have little choice but to lean even more heavily on nationalist appeals as its sole remaining source of support. It may also be inclined to resort to assertive external policies as a way of rallying the Chinese people and turning their energies and frustrations outward, most likely toward Taiwan or Japan or the United States, rather than inward, toward Beijing. Indeed, many analysts believe that China’s rulers have already shown an increased inclination to behave in this way over the course of the past decade.58 These tendencies toward hypernationalist rhetoric and action may actually be made worse by movement toward a more open and competitive political system. Based on a statistical analysis of historical cases, Edward Mansªeld and Jack Snyder have concluded that it is precisely when nations are in transition from authoritarianism toward democracy that they are most likely to initiate conºict with their neighbors. Both stable autocracies and stable democracies are generally less war-prone.59 The reasons for this pattern appear to lie in the internal processes of societies in which the pressures for political participation are increasing, but in which effective democratic institutions have yet to emerge. Elites in such societies often use militant nationalist appeals in an attempt to mobilize and channel mass support without surrendering their grip on power. In Snyder’s words, the resort to nationalism has often been accompanied by militarism and by “the scapegoating of enemies of the nation at home and abroad.”60 If past patterns hold, and if China is indeed in the early stages of democratization, the road ahead may well be bumpy. Ironically, the prospects for a worsening in U.S.-China relations may actually be greater than they would be if China were to remain a stable autocracy. Suppose that China does come to more closely resemble a fully functioning democracy, with elections, competing political parties, and an open press. Will this lead to a transformation in relations between it and the United States? Liberal pessimists might agree that, in the long run, this will probably be the case. But they would also point out that even a much more democratic China may still be prone to behave in ways that could bring it into conºict with the United States. Democracies are not always placid or peaceful, especially in the early stages of their political development. Some observers have suggested that, at least for a time, a democratic government in Beijing could well be more nationalistic and assertive than the present regime. According to one scholar, such a regime “free from the debilitating concerns for its own survival but likely driven by popular emotions, could make the rising Chinese power a much more assertive, impatient, belligerent, even aggressive force, at least during the unstable period of fast ascendance to the ranks of a world-class power.”61 the united states: a crusading liberal democracy? Changes in Chinese political institutions may increase the likelihood that China will collide with the United States. If China does not change, however, certain persistent features of America’s domestic regime appear likely to incline the United States toward conºict with the PRC. This conclusion follows ªrst of all from the obverse of the “democratic peace” argument. Democracies may be less likely to come into conºict with other democracies, but they have historically been more prone to be suspicious of, and hostile toward, what they perceive to be nondemocratic regimes. As Michael Doyle has pointed out, “The very constitutional restraint, shared commercial interests, and international respect for individual rights that promote peace among liberal societies can exacerbate conºicts in relations between liberal and nonliberal societies.” Relations between liberal and nonliberal states are always conducted in an “atmosphere of suspicion” in part because of “the perception by liberal states that nonliberal states are in a permanent state of aggression against their own people.”62 Whatever it may ultimately become, China is not now a liberal democracy. It should therefore come as no surprise that many Americans regard it with suspicion and a measure of hostility. Seen in this light, disputes between the United States and China over human rights (for example) are not just a minor irritant in the relationship. They are instead symptomatic of a deeper difªculty that cannot easily be smoothed over. From the U.S. perspective, human rights violations are not only intrinsically wrong; they are also a sure sign that a regime is evil and illegitimate, and therefore cannot be trusted. The possibility of a stable relationship with such a regime is remote, at best. If the United States is more likely to be hostile toward China because it is not a democracy, it is also more inclined to assist polities that it perceives to be democratic if they are threatened by China, even if this is not what a pure realpolitik calculation of its interests might seem to demand. Thus it was one thing for Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon to distance the United States from Taiwan when it was widely perceived by Americans to have a corrupt, authoritarian government. It will be considerably more difªcult for future U.S. leaders to do so to the extent that the American people come to regard Taiwan as a functioning fellow democracy—even if U.S. support for Taiwan risks a worsening in relations with the PRC and perhaps even if it threatens to lead to war. For better or worse, the United States is a profoundly ideological country, and its foreign policy has always been shaped by its ideals, even when those might appear to conºict with its material interests.63 interactive effects Liberal pessimists worry that the disparate character of the U.S. and Chinese regimes could produce a vicious cycle of mutually reinforcing suspicions and fears. As has already been suggested, many Americans regard China as a repressive, authoritarian country. Actions that the present Chinese regime has taken in the past and may take in the future to retain its grip on power—such as cracking down on dissidents, persecuting religious groups, restricting access to the internet, or issuing blood-curdling threats against Taiwan—are merely going to bolster this view. For its part, no matter what the U.S. government says, the present Chinese leadership is likely to remain convinced that the ultimate goal of the American policy of “engagement” is to undermine their legitimacy and to overthrow them through a process of “peaceful evolution.” 64 Actions that the U.S. government (or simply the Congress or even private American citizens) have taken and are likely to take to express disapproval of Chinese behavior—such as criticizing Beijing on human rights, funding Radio Free Asia, issuing statements of support for Taiwan, or displaying sympathy for the Dali Lama—will inevitably conªrm some Chinese leaders’ darkest view of U.S. intentions. Ideological differences, and ideologically rooted animosities, may thus tend to reinforce the dynamics of mutual insecurity at work in the U.S.-China relationship in ways that an exclusively realist analysis would tend to downplay or ignore. Even though the domestic structures of the Chinese and U.S. regimes are obviously profoundly different, their internal workings may be similar in certain respects. Some liberal pessimists would argue that, just as there are groups in China whose narrow political or bureaucratic interests may be served by a competitive relationship with the United States, so also there may be groups in the United States whose members believe they will gain from U.S.-China tension. Such groups will naturally be inclined to favor more confrontational policies, and they will point to each other’s utterances as evidence of the need for such policies. In short, there may exist a tacit, mutually reinforcing alliance of “hawks” that will make it much harder to achieve better, more stable relations. Assessments that overlook the existence of such factors will overstate the prospects for harmony between the United States and the PRC.65<br />

Nuclear escalation will happen in event of war.<br />

China and the US might engage in a conventional conflict because of Taiwan, the Diaoyu Island, and the South China Sea. If so, undoubtedly both sides would want to avoid nuclear escalation. But because America’s military build-up and doctrine are provocative from China’s perspective, China might feel pressure to escalate. Questions naturally arise: how could China-US inadvertent nuclear escalations occur? How to avoid them? This research will be done through document analysis, interviews and technical calculation. In a conflict, the US might attack China’s nuclear forces with conventional weapons intentionally for damage-limiting purpose, or do it unintentionally because of the difficulty of discriminating between China’s conventional and nuclear weapons. Given America’s counterforce capability and its commitment to counterforce/damage-limiting strategy, this situation would put a huge pressure on China to escalate. The greater the counterforce capabilities in American strategic nuclear/conventional forces and the greater its commitment to counterforce/damage-limiting strategies, the greater the pressure on China for escalation. The influencing factors include: China’s nuclear strategy and nuclear weapons, American nuclear strategy and counterforce capability, American missile defense system, China’s military strategy and American countermeasure. China’s nuclear strategy consists of two pillars: “no-first-use” and “first strike uncertainty.” China’s no-first-use policy has been a real constraint on China's training, equipment and nuclear posture. But no-first-use does not mean that the US can feel free to attack China’s nuclear weapons with conventional weapons. Once China’s retaliatory capability is threatened, China would feel pressure to escalate. The basis of China’s deterrence capability is the so-called “first strike uncertainty”, which means letting the other side remain uncertain of complete success. China considers that such “first strike uncertainty” should be enough to deter the other side from attacking China with nuclear weapons. China operates both nuclear and conventional ballistic missiles. According to China’s Military Power Report released by the US Department of Defense, China’s missile family includes: nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles (DF-31A, DF-31, DF-5), nuclear submarine-launched ballistic missiles (JL-1, JL-2), conventional short-range ballistic missiles (DF-11, DF-15) and conventional and nuclear medium-range ballistic missiles (DF-21). It is reported that China deploys mixed units of conventional and nuclear missiles. America’s declared nuclear strategy is that US nuclear weapons are intended to deter not only nuclear attacks but also large-scale conventional attacks against the US and its allies. “No-first-use” is considered as destabilizing and rejected because it weakens deterrence of major conventional war. Although the US does not have an explicit counterforce strategy, it does have large counterforce capability, which is presented as a tool to control and limit damage in a conflict. Conventional options in the US strategic war plan are another concern of China. The conventional prompt global strike (PGS) concept provides the US president an alternative that appears to be less dangerous than nuclear options. In the latest strategic war plan, OPLAN 8010, issued in 2009, conventional options are included: Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles and precision-guided munitions on B-2 bombers. Unmanned aerial vehicles carrying Hellfire missiles have also been considered for use against Chinese mobile nuclear missile launchers. The US ballistic missile defense (BMD) will pose a huge challenge on China’s deterrent capability. Although the number of China’s nuclear warheads that can survive a first strike from the United States is very small, without BMD, the uncertainty that some might survive is enough to deter the US. However, once the US possesses an operational BMD system, the situation will become problematic. Even a small scale BMD system could have enough interceptors to engage the very small number of the warheads that survive a first strike from the US. China’s “first strike uncertainty” would be reduced greatly, if not www.posse.gatech.edu 2 Program on Strategic Stability Evaluation eliminated. From China’s perspective, even with an untested BMD system, US policymakers may try to transform it into a forceful diplomatic tool against China. The Obama administration’s new BMD plan emphasizes the SM-3 system. Originally, SM-3 Block IA/B was designed as a theater missile defense system, but the upgraded version SM-3 Block IIA/B is capable of engaging China’s strategic missiles according to my calculation. Given that the MK41 vertical launch system of the Aegis BMD ship is a widely deployed standard component, America may be able to deploy a large number of SM-3 Block IIA/B interceptors. In any future Sino-US conflict, China would probably use an “anti-access/area denial” strategy. According to The National Military Strategy 2011 of America, “Anti-access strategies seek to prevent our Nation’s ability to project and sustain combat power into a region, while area denial strategies seek to constrain our Nation’s freedom of action within the region.” The most effective weapons China might use for “anti-access/area denial” include conventional ballistic missiles and attack submarines. According to a RAND report, “Examples of antiaccess measures include attacks on airfields, which could force aircraft to operate from more-remote airfields or could prevent additional forces from being flown into the theater; ...attacks on aircraft carriers, which could prevent naval aviation from operating within the theater or force the carriers to withdraw to more-distant locations from which their aircraft would be less effective.” China’s nuclear attack submarines would be used to close the key geographic choke points to prevent American ships from entering into the theater, while China’s diesel-electric submarines patrol in the theater to delay American naval operations. America is developing a new concept to counter it: “AirSea battle.” The basic idea is that the American military attacks China’s missile bases preemptively. At the same time, the US would close the first island chain and send attack submarines into it to find and sink China’s submarines. Given China’s mix-deployment of conventional and nuclear missiles and the difficulty of discriminating between attack submarines and ballistic missile submarines, the US might attack China’s nuclear ballistic missiles and ballistic missile submarines unintentionally. There is also a possibility that the US could attack China’s nuclear forces intentionally. All these attacks would be perceived by China as deliberate actions to destroy its retaliatory forces gradually. China would then feel a huge pressure toward escalation.<br />
China will become dependent on the BEIDOU satellite system for controlling nuclear weapons.<br />

While the Chinese Beidou navigation system does not appear to be capable of the precision needed for terrestrial military uses, it does have a potential to assist with the navigation of China’s intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). We examined two possible uses of the system for aiding ICBM navigation. First, we looked at possibly using velocity information from Doppler measurements of the Beidou signals to determine more accurately ICBM thrust termination. Second, we considered using the three dimensional position determination of a post-boost vehicle provided by the Beidou system to accurately determine the Keplerian trajectory. This trajectory determination would be followed by orbital corrections. It turns out that the first possibility is impractical since the time required for accurate velocity measurements is far too long. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the second method provides China with a real possibility of improving ICBM navigation to the point where it could MIRV its ICBM warheads. Both analyses will be discussed below in the context of China’s existing fleet of ICBMs. According to published sources, China has only a small arsenal of seven DF-5A nuclear-tipped ICBMs capable of reaching the United States.24 While it is possible that these missiles have already been MIRVed, many analysts believe they carry a single, large (3-megaton) nuclear warhead.25 Estimates for the missile system’s CEP range from 500 to 3,500 meters.26 Many factors contribute to the missile’s impact point uncertainty including, thrust termination timing, gravitational anomalies near the launch site, and reentry uncertainties such as local weather conditions and small warhead irregularities.27 The effects present in the boost portion of the trajectory contribute the most uncertainty to China’s Satellite-Based Navigation System 237 the impact point and can, to a large extent, be characterized by the uncertainty in the vehicle’s three-dimensional velocity at burnout. To quantify these powered-flight uncertainties, a computer simulation was performed using a rotating, round Earth, which included realistic atmosphere effects. While relatively unimportant for this analysis, details of the DF-5A characteristics—such as mass ratios, engine burn times, etc.—were obtained from the civilian version28 of this missile, the Chinese space-launch vehicle, the Long March 2C.29 After adjusting the various launch parameters, such as launch azimuth, loft angle, and loft angle rate of change so that the missiles travel from their launch site at Xuanhua, China (40.36◦N, 115.03◦E)30 to Washington D.C., the velocity at burnout was varied both longitudinally and in both transverse directions by small amounts. The unperturbed trajectory is shown in Figure 10. Note that the trajectory passes very close to the North Pole. Trajectories from the other DF-5A launch site, Luoning, China (at 34.23◦N and 111.39◦E) also pass very close to the North Pole. This is important given the geometry of the Beidou constellation. The distribution for impact points for the various small velocity perturbations is shown in Figure 11. Clearly, the largest changes in the impact point are caused by perturbations in the missile’s velocity along its direction of flight at burnout. These are quantified in Figure 12, which shows the miss distances as a function of change in velocity for perturbations along and transverse to the nominal trajectory. Thus, a change of 1 m/s parallel to the missile’s nominal velocity (which has a magnitude of 7.2 km/s) produces a miss distance of 9.7 km while a similar transverse velocity perturbation produces a miss distance of 1.2 km. Stated another way, the longitudinal velocity must be controlled to better than ±0.05 m/s to produce a miss distance of 500 m or less. If the lowest estimate for the DF-5A’s CEP is correct, then China must control the missile’s burnout velocity to this accuracy. Assuming an integrating accelerometer for the DF-5A, this corresponds to an accuracy of seven parts in a million. However, when thinking about using Doppler measurements from the Beidou satellites to determine engine shutoff, it is helpful to recast this in terms of a timing accuracy. After all, Doppler measurements, as will be discussed, take a certain minimum amount of time that depends solely on the desired accuracy and the carrier wave’s frequency. Other than increasing the carrier frequency, electronics cannot speed up the measurement process. In that sense, the timing requirements can be estimated from the computer model’s acceleration profile, shown in Figure 13, assuming that the DF-5A does not throttle back its thrust in the last few seconds of flight. Since the DF-5A reaches peak acceleration just before shutdown, again assuming no throttling, of 70.9 m/s2 this corresponds to shutting the engine down in ±0.0007 seconds of nominal burnout. Smaller miss distances would require proportionately greater timing and accelerometer precision. Of course, this timing requirement can be made somewhat less onerous by throttling down the DF-5A’s liquid propellant engine. However, that method would be less workable for the solid-propellant replacement China is reportedly working on in its modernization program.31 The three satellites in the Beidou constellation are positioned to make a fairly accurate velocity measurement of a missile flying the Xuanhua (or Luoning) to Washington D.C. trajectory. Furthermore, because of the long moment arm produced by the geostationary orbit, precise knowledge of the missile’s position is not required for the angular determinations that go into determining the missile vector velocity from the scalar Doppler measurements. (For instance, knowledge of the missile’s position to ±1 km, which is certainly possible given what is known about China’s inertial navigation technology, will produce angular errors on the order of 30 microradians.) We will therefore assume that the Doppler measurement of speed along the three lines of sight to the three satellites dominates the error. It only remains to obtain an estimate of frequency at which the Beidou satellites broadcast. These can be estimated from reports32 that the Beidou navigation satellites are based on the same bus—the physical structure that contains the infrastructure of power, communications, attitude control, etc.—as China’s DFH-3 communications satellite, which broadcasts on frequencies between four and six gigahertz. (These reports also give the DFH-3 satellite’s mass at 2200 kg, which includes the apogee insertion/station-keeping engine.<br />
Guidance of nuclear missiles is what the BEIDOU is best suited for- itsclear evidence of what the system is for. Also, it’s key to bypassing U.S. missile defenses.<br />

This article has tried to determine the military capabilities of China’s Beidou constellation of satellites. However, theoretical capabilities do not automatically imply actual motivations. It is possible that China has launched this system of satellites as part of a civilian research and development program and does not really care that its terrestrial applications are so restricted. Nevertheless, the system’s utility is limited because of the iterative nature of its two-satellite mode of operation or its accuracy is limited for terrestrial uses in the three-satellite mode. Because of this and the fact that the system, like any space-based system, is very expensive, we are naturally led to speculating about those applications for which it does seem to be well suited, in this case its strategic uses. Many analysts have concluded that China has long had a nuclear doctrine based around a delayed second strike.37 This policy relied on having a few survivable missiles carrying large-yield nuclear warheads aimed at population centers. As such, China did not need excessive accuracy for its warheads. For instance, the reported 3-megaton warhead currently on the DF-5A would produce a 2 psi overpressure—enough to shatter38 concrete or cinderblock walls as well as produce large numbers of fatalities—at a radius of 19 km,39 far greater than even the largest CEP estimates of 3,500 meters for the DF-5A. Even if China modernizes its nuclear forces, as some Western analysts expect, to include MIRVed warheads and consequently has to reduce their yield to save weight, it is doubtful that China would need to improve its missile accuracy. For instance, if China replaced its large, multimegaton warhead with warheads in the 150 to 350 kiloton40 range, the equivalent blast range would only shrink to 7 km. This is still twice the largest CEP estimate for the existing missiles. Therefore, it seems doubtful that China would need this expensive space-based navigation system for its nuclear modernization program if it were going to retain its current counter-value system of deterrence unless it was responding to some other change in the strategic environment. It is even more unlikely that China is switching to a counter-force strategy or a command and control decapitation strike. The United States’ nuclear forces are essentially sized to survive a nuclear first strike from the former Soviet Union, which had many more nuclear weapons than China can hope to produce in the foreseeable future. A much more likely explanation is that China would use a MIRVed system to threaten additional U.S. cities. A limited space-based navigation system with the accuracies currently deliverable from the Beidou constellation could contribute significantly to such a modernization program. Furthermore, the system could be viewed as a response to the proposed U.S. ground-based missile defense system since it is geared to maneuvering the bus near the mid-point of the trajectory, after aU.S. interceptor has been launched.<br />

BEIJING--China took a further step on Dec. 27 toward ending its dependence on U.S. satellites to provide navigation and positioning services with the start of trial operations of its homegrown Beidou system. China started a drive to end its reliance on the U.S. global positioning system in 2000, when it sent an experimental pair of positioning satellites into orbit. Ran Chengqi, spokesman for the new system, told reporters that Beidou, or &quot;Big Dipper,&quot; would cover most parts of the Asia Pacific by next year and then the world by 2020. China has already launched 10 satellites to support Beidou and would launch another six next year, he said. State media have said the system will eventually comprise 35 satellites, which will be used for a variety of sectors including fisheries, meteorology and telecommunications. China has ambitious plans for space, including a space station and a manned trip to the moon. While China has vowed never to militarize space, experts say it is ramping up the military use of space with new satellites. The successful missile &quot;kill&quot; of an old satellite in early 2007 represented a new level of ability for the Chinese military, and last year China successfully tested emerging technology aimed at destroying missiles in mid-air.<br />

An adversary microsatellite could use two quite different modes to destroy a quarry satellite. The first means is direct impact: placed in an orbit that nearly intersects with its quarry’s, the microsatellite could leisurely fire its rocket to convert a normal and nonthreatening 100-km miss into a direct collision. Accelerating just 0.1 km/s (an expenditure of 3 percent of the satellite mass as rocket fuel) will net a 100-km displacement in 1000 seconds—about one-fifth of an orbit period in LEO, and far too little time for the quarry satellite’s operators to take effective countermeasures. As the microsat approached the quarry, it might deploy a “lethality enhancement device,” such as a weighted net, to improve its chances of success. No short-range defense seems possible against such a high-speed intercept, unless the quarry satellite were capable of rapidly maneuvering out of harm’s way, or unless it deployed confusion devices, such as balloon reflectors, to prevent the microsatellite from homing in on it. Current satellite systems do not have these protective capabilities. Microsatellites could also launch an explosive or projectile. For instance, a quarry would be unable to elude a space mine hovering just tens of meters away and equipped with an explosively driven pellet weapon or shaped-charge projectile. The microsat could also be programmed to fire if blinded or disturbed. Various defenses to microsats can be imagined. A quarry satellite could be outfitted with sensors capable of detecting small, lowspeed satellites, or it might be equipped with specialized defensive vehicles (perhaps even a fleet of bodyguard microsatellites of its own) to repel approaching space mines without harming the quarry. How easy would it be to detect and track such space mines, and thereby thwart their attack? The U.S. Air Force Space Command, headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, indicates that it “is responsible for tracking objects larger than 10 centimeters orbiting Earth,” and currently tracks some 9000 such objects. But even perfect tracking would reveal only after the fact which satellite or launch was responsible for destroying the quarry. A real defense would require additional measures, such as those described above. And it is unclear, at least to us, how proposed U.S. space weapons would protect themselves against such threats.<br />

THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO -THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -horror of horrors -raise the possibilityof a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase: Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilization. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Annaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.<br />
The possibility of nuclear extinction outweighs all other impacts-even if the risk of extinction is small, its magnitude requires evaluation before all else<br />

<br />
&lt;To say that human extinction is a certainty would, of course, be a misrepresentation—just as it would be a misrepresentation to say that extinction can be ruled out. To begin with, we know that a holocaust may not occur at all. If one does occur, the adversaries may not use all their weapons. If they do use all their weapons, the global effects, in the ozone and elsewhere, may be moderate. And if the effects are not moderate but extreme, the ecosphere may prove resilient enough to withstand them without breaking down catastrophically. These are all substantial reasons for supposing that mankind will not be extinguished in a nuclear holocaust, or even that extinction in a holocaust is unlikely, and they tend to calm our fear and to reduce our sense of urgency. Yet at the same time we are compelled to admit that there may be a holocaust, that the adversaries may use all their weapons, that the global effects, including effects of which we are as yet unaware, may be severe, that the ecosphere may suffer catastrophic breakdown, and that our species may be extinguished. We are left with uncertainty, and are forced to make our decisions in a state of uncertainty. If we wish to act to save our species, we have to muster our resolve in spite of our awareness that the life of the species may not now in fact be jeopardized. On the other hand, if we wish to ignore the peril, we have to admit that we do so in the knowledge that the species may be in danger of imminent self-destruction. When the existence of nuclear weapons was made known, thoughtful people everywhere in the world realized that if the great powers entered into a nuclear-arms race the human species would sooner or later face the possibility of extinction. They also realized that in the absence of international agreements preventing it an arms race would probably occur. They knew that the path of nuclear armament was a dead end for mankind. The discovery of the energy in mass—of &quot;the basic power of the universe&quot;—and of a means by which man could release that energy altered the relationship between man and the source of his life, the earth. In the shadow of this power, the earth became small and the life of the human species doubtful. In that sense, the question of human extinction has been on the political agenda of the world ever since the first nuclear weapon was detonated, and there was no need for the world to build up its present tremendous arsenals before starting to worry about it. At just what point the species crossed, or will have crossed, the boundary between merely having the technical knowledge to destroy itself and actually having the arsenals at hand, ready to be used at any second, is not precisely knowable. But it is clear that at present, with some twenty thousand megatons of nuclear explosive power in existence, and with more being added every day, we have entered into the zone of uncertainty, which is to say the zone of risk of extinction. But the mere risk of extinction has a significance that is categorically different from, and immeasurably greater than, that of any other risk, and as we make our decisions we have to take that significance into account. Up to now, every risk has been contained within the frame of life; extinction would shatter the frame. It represents not the defeat of some purpose but an abyss in which all human purposes would be drowned for all time. We have no right to place the possibility of this limitless, eternal defeat on the same footing as risks that we run in the ordinary conduct of our affairs in our particular transient moment of human history. To employ a mathematical analogy, we can say that although the risk of extinction may be fractional, the stake is, humanly speaking, infinite, and a fraction of infinity is still infinity. In other words, once we learn that a holocaust might lead to extinction we have no right to gamble, because if we lose, the game will be over, and neither we nor anyone else will ever get another chance. Therefore, although, scientifically speaking, there is all the difference in the world between the mere possibility that a holocaust will bring about extinction and the certainty of it, morally they are the same, and we have no choice but to address the issue of nuclear weapons as though we knew for a certainty that their use would put an end to our species. In weighing the fate of the earth and, with it, our own fate, we stand before a mystery, and in tampering with the earth we tamper with a mystery. We are in deep ignorance. Our ignorance should dispose us to wonder, our wonder should make us humble, our humility should inspire us to reverence and caution, and our reverence and caution should lead us to act without delay to withdraw the threat we now pose to the earth and to ourselves.<br />
In trying to describe possible consequences of a nuclear holocaust, I have mentioned the limitless complexity of its effects on human society and on the ecosphere—a complexity that sometimes seems to be as great as that of life itself. But if these effects should lead to human extinction, then all the complexity will give way to the utmost simplicity—the simplicity of nothingness. We—the human race—shall cease to be.&gt;<br />

A world nuclear war is one that involves most or all nuclear powers releasing a large proportion of their nuclear weapons at targets in nuclear, and perhaps non-nuclear, states. Such a war could be initiated accidentally, aggressively or pre-emptively and could continue and spread through these means or by retaliation by a party attacked by nuclear weapons. While some speak of &quot;limited nuclear war,&quot; it is likely that any nuclear war will quickly escalate and spiral out of control because of the &quot;use them or loose them&quot; strategy. If you don't use all your nuclear weapons you are likely to have them destroyed by the enemy's nuclear weapons.<br />
Such a war could start through a reaction to terrorist attacks, or through the need to protect against overwhelming military opposition, or through the use of small battle field tactical nuclear weapons meant to destroy hardened targets. It might quickly move on to the use of strategic nuclear weapons delivered by short-range or inter-continental missile or long-range bomber. These could deliver high altitude bursts whose electromagnetic pulse knocks out electrical circuits for hundreds of square miles. Or they could deliver nuclear bombs to destroys nuclear and/or non-nuclear military facilities, nuclear power plants, important industrial sites and cities. Or it could skip all those steps and start through the accidental or reckless use of strategic weapons.<br />

The U.S. intelligence community believes China will use a sea-denial strategy aimed at U.S. aircraft carriers and other naval forces approaching Taiwan.108 Thus, a key component of a Chinese campaign against Taiwan would be to keep the U.S. aircraft carriers out of striking 19 range of Taiwan with a critical task of finding and sinking carriers. ELINT systems, like those demonstrated on the Shenzhou, could track U.S. carriers operating in the western Pacific or Indian Oceans.109 In addition, some of their anti-naval weapons could use space-based information. Specifically, one of China’s primary weapons to strike U.S. naval assets will be the supersonic, sea-skimming SS-N-26 missile. In recent years, China has purchased the Russian SS-N-26 anti-ship cruise missiles; however, without space-based ELINT data which can locate and track naval assets, the Chinese ability to effectively use the SS-N-26 is undermined.110 Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institute senior analyst, states, “To attack a U.S. carrier, one needs not only periodic localization of the carrier, but real-time tracking and dissemination of that information to a missile that is capable of reaching the carrier and defeating its defenses.”111 Space systems are only one of the means to locate and track U.S. carriers, and it is unclear if China’s current reconnaissance satellites have the capability to locate and target U.S. aircraft carriers.112 However, as shown in the previous chapter, China has launched and operated ELINT systems in the past. If they did acquire a space-based ELINT system, how would they use it and the rest of their suite of space capability against U.S. naval forces? Chinese discussions envision using space systems to track American naval forces, and ELINT systems enable this.113 Space-based ELINT systems can be used to acquire maritime target location for Chinese naval forces.114 China’s improvements in satellite communication and space-based reconnaissance allow them to identify, target and track U.S. military activities deep into the Western Pacific providing maritime target locations directly to their forces.115 In addition, ELINT systems can be used to provide general location of U.S. naval assets which the Chinese could then use to cue searches for U.S. naval forces using the Canadian RADARSAT and ESA’s ERS-2 and ENVISAT synthetic aperture radar systems with their wake detection 20 capability.116 Using these systems, the Chinese could more precisely locate and determine heading and velocity of carrier battle groups. Once found, China could keep the carrier’s location current using its full imagery suite: ZY-2, RADARSAT, ENVISAT, ERS, JERS, Israeli and Russian commercial sources and any microsatellite experiments on orbit (e.g. the Beijing-1). Of course, the indigenous imagery sources would not have the time delay which can occur with commercial systems.117 However, the Chinese have ENVISAT, RADARSAT and ERS receiving stations in country for near real-time receipt of imagery thus minimizing the time delay between when the satellites obtain the imagery and when an analyst can process the data.118 Thus, this suite of space-based capability – ELINT systems used in conjunction with imagery systems with satellite communications disseminating the data – could provide excellent target information for Chinese anti-naval weapon systems. Ultimately, some analysts believe the U.S. could lose a carrier or two during a Taiwan conflict.119 If this were to happen, Chinese space systems would have played a role, and this would be a clear example of the “prohibitive interference” required by the definition of space superiority. Thus, this scenario provides one example of the impact of one instance of Chinese space superiority.<br />
The idea of a world without the benefit of preponderant American seapower may sound alarmist and farfetched. Unfortunately, those who follow military cutbacks and world affairs know that it isn’t. Indeed, the following scenario is all too plausible. .  .  .<br />

In 2020, several major European nations default on their debt. Contagion in the financial markets plunges the world economy into global depression. From 2020 to 2025, the U.S. economy contracts from $20 trillion to $12 trillion. During this time, two successive U.S. presidents seek and obtain deep cuts in the size of the U.S. armed forces. Homeland security becomes the main focus of the Department of Defense, with policy-makers concentrating on port and border security, land-based strategic nuclear forces, antiterrorism, and managing civil unrest. The global implications of this retrenchment are stark. China’s claims on the South China Sea—previously disputed by virtually all nations in the region and routinely contested by U.S. and partner naval forces—are accepted as a fait accompli, effectively putting the entire expanse under Chinese hegemony. Korea, unified in 2017 after the implosion of the North, signs a mutual defense treaty with China. Japan is increasingly isolated and executes long-rumored plans to create a nuclear weapons capability. India, recognizing that its previous role as a balancer to China has lost relevance with the pullback of the Americans, agrees to supplement Chinese naval power in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf to protect the flow of oil to Southeast Asia. China agrees to exercise increased influence over Pakistan. Iran dominates the Persian Gulf and is a nuclear power. Its navy aggressively patrols the Gulf while the Revolutionary Guard Navy harasses shipping and oil infrastructure to force the Gulf Cooperation Council countries into Tehran’s orbit. Russia supplies Iran with a steady flow of military technology and nuclear industry expertise. In Egypt, a decade-long experiment in participatory democracy ends with a violent seizure of power by Islamists. The United States is identified closely with the previous coalition government, and riots break out outside the U.S. embassy. Americans in Egypt hunker down and hope for the best, as there are no U.S. forces in the Mediterranean to evacuate them. The NATO alliance falls apart. For its energy security, Europe depends on Russia and Iran, which control the main supply lines and sources of oil and gas to Western Europe. Major European nations stand down their militaries and make only limited contributions to a new EU constabulary force. No European nation maintains the ability to conduct significant out-of-area operations, and Europe as a whole maintains little airlift capacity. The impact of the world fiscal and political crisis is devastating to the U.S. Navy, which has been in decline since the latter part of the Obama administration, when Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta chose to maintain proportional resourcing of the Navy, Air Force, and Army rather than make difficult choices among competing priorities. World trade goes into steep decline. In addition, shippers avoid U.S. ports as a result of the onerous container inspection regime. As a result, American consumers face a diminished selection of goods and a lower standard of living. By 2025, the Navy is down to 70 deployable ships (from 286 in 2011). All aircraft carriers and all but six attack submarines are sidelined, as the Navy dramatically cuts back on expensive nuclear engineers and pilots. Additionally, the Navy de-emphasizes projecting power and sea control beyond U.S. territorial waters. A fleet of four ballistic missile submarines is retained for nuclear deterrence. With the Navy no longer seeking to project power, the carrier force is decimated; the amphibious force is cut less severely because of the flexibility of these platforms and because they are highly valued for their usefulness in defense support to civil authority missions, such as disaster relief. All forward-deployed naval forces pull back to the bases in Norfolk and San Diego. A greatly diminished Coast Guard maintains a presence in Hawaii. All other naval bases are closed. The fleet of 70 ships consists of 6 attack submarines, 4 ballistic missile submarines, 8 aviation-capable amphibious ships, 8 other amphibious ships, 15 destroyers, and 29 small combatants. The Navy also operates 2 hospital ships, which are in heavy domestic demand. It does not operate a logistics force because all fueling, provisioning, and arming is done in port. The Navy’s operational mandate is homeland defense, and its activities have become largely indistinguishable from those of the Coast Guard. Some members of Congress call for combining the two services. There is one remaining private shipyard suitable for building both conventional and nuclear combatants. Specialized shipbuilding trades are in fatal decline. The ship repair business has disappeared, and all depot-level maintenance is conducted in two heavily subsidized public shipyards .  .  . Back to 2011: How might we arrive at this same abysmal state of naval readiness absent a crippling world financial crisis? By continuing down the path that we are on now. Changes in world naval power tend to play out over decades, and by the time action is taken to arrest decline, it could easily be too late. Some steps that might be taken to preclude this fate include: Recapturing innovation and a sound industrial base. Congress can still prevent the loss of innovation in defense-related research and development. Members should already be alarmed that the U.S. military has no manned aircraft under development, a first in the history of aviation. Similarly, no surface ships or attack submarines are in the design phase. With development cycles lasting 20 years or longer, elected leaders need to ensure the Defense Department is not losing access to critical skills that will be needed to imagine and build the next generation of ships, aircraft, sensors, and weapons for the U.S. Navy. Developing a long-term research and development plan. After numerous studies and a half-dozen shipbuilding plans, Navy leaders have correctly concluded that the United States needs a larger fleet—not simply in numbers of ships and aircraft, but also in terms of increased network capability, longer range, and increased persistence. Navy leaders recognize that the United States is quickly losing its monopolies on guided weapons and the ability to project power. Precision munitions (guided rockets, artillery, mortars, and missiles) and battle networks are proliferating, while advances in radar and electro-optical technology are increasingly rendering stealth capabilities less effective. Congress should demand long-range technology road maps, including a science and technology plan and a research and development plan for the U.S. Navy. These plans should broadly outline future investments, capabilities, and requirements. Getting the fleet size right. Congress should direct the Navy to provide a “resource unconstrained” fleet composition appropriate to meeting the requirements of A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower, the Navy’s 2007 maritime strategy. The study should include an analysis of the capabilities and missions called for in the strategy and identify which are at risk, given current and planned fleet size and resources. This study should include options for additional forward stationing of U.S. Navy vessels and proposals for new classes of ships designed specifically for low-end naval presence missions. Without this type of strategy-driven analysis by Navy leaders, Congress will continue to struggle to determine where to apply diminishing resources within the defense budget and how to justify the additional investments needed in higher-priority areas. America is a maritime nation, and our Navy is the most visible and effective symbol of our national power and strength overseas. Washington decision-makers should recognize the impact and influence of forces that are as useful in peacetime in deterring conflict as they are in wartime while pursuing it. And they need to recognize it before it’s too late.<br />

Anti-air Access Impacts Space systems can also help with a Chinese anti-air access campaign, especially in the area of delaying or disrupting air assets in theater. Potential launch points for in-theater aircraft are bases on Japan, the Philippines, Singapore or Guam.120 While access to these bases would depend on allied governments granting use, for analysis purposes, this paper will look at those fields as potential launch points. Focusing on airfields in these countries, China could develop detailed target sets from space-based imagery prior to a conflict and if hostilities seemed closer at hand, use its satellite imagery to monitor defense developments in Taiwan and other 21 supporting countries.121 With this satellite imagery, Chinese planners can determine very accurate locations of airfields, taxiways, and fuel and weapons storage facilities which would be very lucrative targets for long range attack.122 As Figure 2 shows, the CSS-2 and CSS-5 have the range to reach many potential airfields. The Chinese have recently equipped the CSS-5 with a conventional warhead, and its reentry velocity makes it very difficult to intercept for current ground-based missile defense systems.123 Thus, it would be well suited for attacks on airfields U.S. forces might use. Figure 2. Chinese Short, Medium and Intermediate Range Missile Ranges124 Chinese ballistic and cruise missile attacks on airfields would not look to destroy the U.S. facilities, but suppress their ability to provide air and missile defense. Rear Admiral Eric A. McVadon (USN, Ret.), former Defense Attaché at the American Embassy in Beijing and expert on China’s military, stated that once the Chinese suppressed U.S. air and missile defenses, it would conceptually “permit follow-on attacks, in relative safety, by the several new types of 22 Chinese aircraft using very modern cruise missiles.”125 This scenario is a great concern for the Asia-Pacific region. As one wing commander at Guam said, “[Chinese planes and missiles] would keep coming … I fear them numbers-wise,” and one analyst predicts, “We can’t expect that we can completely protect a carrier battle group when it got into theater.”126 Not only would these forces be looking to target carriers, they would look to target items which enable U.S. air power, and this targeting would be assisted by imagery derived from space systems. A former high-ranking Chinese official once said to be victorious in future combat, “We will have to gain air and sea superiority, but win information superiority first.”127 Gaining this information superiority, on the way to winning air and sea superiority, would be enabled by Chinese space systems.<br />

During the past academic year, he was a Transatlantic Fellow of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. International Security, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Summer 2003), pp. 5–46. “command of the commons”)<br />
The U.S. military currently possesses command of the global commons. Command of the commons is analogous to command of the sea, or in Paul Kennedy’s words, it is analogous to “naval mastery.”10 The “commons,” in the case of the sea and space, are areas that belong to no one state and that provide access to much of the globe.11 Airspace does technically belong to the countries below it, but there are few countries that can deny their airspace above 15,000 feet to U.S. warplanes. Command does not mean that other states cannot use the commons in peacetime. Nor does it mean that others cannot acquire military assets that can move through or even exploit them when unhindered by the United States. Command means that the United States gets vastly more military use out of the sea, space, and air than do others; that it can credibly threaten to deny their use to others; and that others would lose a military contest for the commons if they attempted to deny them to the United States. Having lost such a contest, they could not mount another effort for a very long time, and the United States would preserve, restore, and consolidate its hold after such a ªght.12 Command of the commons is the key military enabler of the U.S. global power position. It allows the United States to exploit more fully other sources of power, including its own economic and military might as well as the economic and military might of its allies. Command of the commons also helps the United States to weaken its adversaries, by restricting their access to economic, military, and political assistance. Command of the commons has permitted the United States to wage war on short notice even where it has had little permanent military presence. This was true of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the 1993 intervention in Somalia, and the 2001 action in Afghanistan. Command of the commons provides the United States with more useful military potential for a hegemonic foreign policy than any other offshore power has ever had. When nineteenth-century Britain had command of the sea, its timely power projection capability ended at the maximum range of the Royal Navy’s shipboard guns. The Royal Navy could deliver an army many places around the globe, but the army’s journey inland was usually difªcult and slow; without such a journey, Britain’s ability to inºuence events was limited. As the nineteenth century unfolded, the industrialization of the continental powers, improvements in land transportation, and the development of coastal warfare technologies such as the torpedo and mine reduced the strategic leverage provided by command of the sea.13 The United States enjoys the same command of the sea that Britain once did, and it can also move large and heavy forces around the globe. But command of space allows the United States to see across the surface of the world’s landmasses and to gather vast amounts of information. At least on the matter of medium-to-large-scale military developments, the United States can locate and identify military targets with considerable ªdelity and communicate this information to offensive forces in a timely fashion. Air power, ashore and aºoat, can reach targets deep inland; and with modern precision-guided weaponry, it can often hit and destroy those targets. U.S. forces can even more easily do great damage to a state’s transportation and communications networks as well as economic infrastructure. When U.S. ground forces do venture inland, they do so against a weakened adversary; they also have decent intelligence, good maps, and remarkable knowledge of their own position from moment to moment. Moreover, they can call on a great reserve of responsive, accurate, airdelivered ªrepower, which permits the ground forces considerable freedom of action. Political, economic, and technological changes since the 1980s have thus partially reversed the rise of land power relative to sea power that occurred in the late nineteenth century and helped to erode Britain’s formal and informal empire.<br />

Chinese space systems enhance their targeting capability.<br />

Current Chinese navigation capability will have mixed impacts to their warfighting capability. As discussed in Chapter 2, for the Beidou system to improve the accuracy of their missiles while in flight, they would need to travel at least 4200 km. As Figure 2 shows, the Chinese short, medium and intermediate range ballistic missile systems are not capable of the threshold 4200 km range. Thus, the current satellite navigation system is not capable of helping improve the accuracy of these warheads in flight. However, the Chinese indigenous satellite navigation system is capable of helping their military in two regards. First, for a mobile missile launcher or any missile launcher to accurately develop a solution to strike a target, you need to know the exact latitude, longitude and altitude of the launcher. Even today’s Beidou system is capable of providing this; however, the system requires the users to transmit to a local receiving station, and military forces prefer to not transmit during hostilities to avoid being located by enemy ELINT systems. Therefore, the current system would not provide much utility to the mobile missile force or any user wishing to remain undetected during combat. However, the Chinese could use this system or GPS prior to a conflict to pre-survey launch locations for their mobile launchers. This would help provide the required accuracy for launch point location. Secondly, the current Beidou system could also help during a conflict by acting as a timing source. Modern satellite communication networks use GPS to establish system time for the users of the network. China might question the reliability of the GPS signals they receive during a conflict; however, the Chinese could rely on their Beidou system to provide accurate timing for their networks. In the future, the Chinese have ambitions to create their own navigation satellite system to free them from dependence on other nations. The Chinese have seen the need for a satellite navigation system as urgent and have studied constellations of five to seven navigation satellites.128 Therefore, a second generation Chinese satellite navigation system could be used to correct warhead trajectories in flight and make their long-range, standoff systems even more accurate. Depending on the degree of accuracy improvement, this improvement in space capability could constitute “prohibitive interference” in the future; however, the current state of the Chinese satellite navigation system is not a challenge to space superiority.<br />

China has demonstrated an impressive array of space capabilities in the fields of imagery, electronics intelligence, communication, navigation, meteorology, and remote sensing. They possess a robust satellite command and control architecture, and their space situational awareness allows them to keep their systems healthy and to remain aware of foreign space systems. In addition, their advances in small satellites and microsatellites clearly demonstrate their technological advancement as well as their intent to continue to improve their space systems. However, is all this space capability sufficient to provide them space superiority, especially as it relates to a conflict with the U.S. over Taiwan? Using the JP 1-02 definition of space superiority, specifically that space capabilities allow the forces of one side to exert “prohibitive interference” over another side, China’s current space systems would not provide space superiority for its armed forces in a conflict with the U.S. over Taiwan. This analysis has shown today’s Chinese space systems are insufficient to provide a meaningful edge in executing an anti-sea or anti-air access campaign. In addition, the current state of the Chinese satellite navigation system does not permit a sufficient level of force enhancement to constitute space superiority for China. Finally, the contributions from their remote sensing and meteorological satellite programs do not markedly increase the ability of their armed forces to provide “prohibitive interference” to U.S. forces. However, if China were to field an operational ELINT satellite system, the space superiority equation could change 26 dramatically. The combination of ELINT detection and location, the ability of synthetic aperture radar to find ships at sea, Chinese satellite imaging systems’ capability to precisely locate U.S. Navy ships and the ability of their satellite communications systems to provide the data to shooters at sea would potentially provide a deadly targeting solution for China’s long-range anti-ship missile systems. Together, these space systems could provide China with space superiority sufficient to allow the PLA, PLAAF and PLAN to successfully engage and potentially sink U.S. Navy vessels, even a U.S. aircraft carrier. Thus, at the outset of a future Taiwan conflict, the U.S. could face a situation with which it has never before had to contend – the lack of space superiority. The consequences of this situation could be severe. Therefore, an objective in the early phase of any future combat operations must be to gain space superiority by denying an adversary access to space information. As space capabilities become increasingly important to the U.S. military and armed forces around the world, the requirement for establishing space superiority likewise increases and the impact of the lack of space superiority becomes correspondingly more somber. 27<br />

Is the United States in decline, as so many seem to believe these days? Or are Americans in danger of committing pre-emptive superpower suicide out of a misplaced fear of their own declining power? A great deal depends on the answer to these questions. The present world order—characterized by an unprecedented number of democratic nations; a greater global prosperity, even with the current crisis, than the world has ever known; and a long peace among great powers—reflects American principles and preferences, and was built and preserved by American power in all its political, economic, and military dimensions. If American power declines, this world order will decline with it. It will be replaced by some other kind of order, reflecting the desires and the qualities of other world powers. Or perhaps it will simply collapse, as the European world order collapsed in the first half of the twentieth century. The belief, held by many, that even with diminished American power “the underlying foundations of the liberal international order will survive and thrive,” as the political scientist G. John Ikenberry has argued, is a pleasant illusion. American decline, if it is real, will mean a different world for everyone. But how real is it? Much of the commentary on American decline these days rests on rather loose analysis, on impressions that the United States has lost its way, that it has abandoned the virtues that made it successful in the past, that it lacks the will to address the problems it faces. Americans look at other nations whose economies are now in better shape than their own, and seem to have the dynamism that America once had, and they lament, as in the title of Thomas Friedman’s latest book, that “that used to be us.” The perception of decline today is certainly understandable, given the dismal economic situation since 2008 and the nation’s large fiscal deficits, which, combined with the continuing growth of the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, and other economies, seem to portend a significant and irreversible shift in global economic power. Some of the pessimism is also due to the belief that the United States has lost favor, and therefore influence, in much of the world, because of its various responses to the attacks of September 11. The detainment facilities at Guantánamo, the use of torture against suspected terrorists, and the widely condemned invasion of Iraq in 2003 have all tarnished the American “brand” and put a dent in America’s “soft power”—its ability to attract others to its point of view. There have been the difficult wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which many argue proved the limits of military power, stretched the United States beyond its capacities, and weakened the nation at its core. Some compare the United States to the British Empire at the end of the nineteenth century, with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars serving as the equivalent of Britain’s difficult and demoralizing Boer War. With this broad perception of decline as the backdrop, every failure of the United States to get its way in the world tends to reinforce the impression. Arabs and Israelis refuse to make peace, despite American entreaties. Iran and North Korea defy American demands that they cease their nuclear weapons programs. China refuses to let its currency rise. Ferment in the Arab world spins out of America’s control. Every day, it seems, brings more evidence that the time has passed when the United States could lead the world and get others to do its bidding. Powerful as this sense of decline may be, however, it deserves a more rigorous examination. Measuring changes in a nation’s relative power is a tricky business, but there are some basic indicators: the size and the influence of its economy relative to that of other powers; the magnitude of military power compared with that of potential adversaries; the degree of political influence it wields in the international system—all of which make up what the Chinese call “comprehensive national power.” And there is the matter of time. Judgments based on only a few years’ evidence are problematic. A great power’s decline is the product of fundamental changes in the international distribution of various forms of power that usually occur over longer stretches of time. Great powers rarely decline suddenly. A war may bring them down, but even that is usually a symptom, and a culmination, of a longer process. The decline of the British Empire, for instance, occurred over several decades. In 1870, the British share of global manufacturing was over 30 percent. In 1900, it was 20 percent. By 1910, it was under 15 percent—well below the rising United States, which had climbed over the same period from more than 20 percent to more than 25 percent; and also less than Germany, which had lagged far behind Britain throughout the nineteenth century but had caught and surpassed it in the first decade of the twentieth century. Over the course of that period, the British navy went from unchallenged master of the seas to sharing control of the oceans with rising naval powers. In 1883, Britain possessed more battleships than all the other powers combined. By 1897, its dominance had been eclipsed. British officials considered their navy “completely outclassed” in the Western hemisphere by the United States, in East Asia by Japan, and even close to home by the combined navies of Russia and France—and that was before the threatening growth of the German navy. These were clear-cut, measurable, steady declines in two of the most important measures of power over the course of a half-century. Some of the arguments for America’s relative decline these days would be more potent if they had not appeared only in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008. Just as one swallow does not make a spring, one recession, or even a severe economic crisis, need not mean the beginning of the end of a great power. The United States suffered deep and prolonged economic crises in the 1890s, the 1930s, and the 1970s. In each case, it rebounded in the following decade and actually ended up in a stronger position relative to other powers than before the crisis. The 1910s, the 1940s, and the 1980s were all high points of American global power and influence. Less than a decade ago, most observers spoke not of America’s decline but of its enduring primacy. In 2002, the historian Paul Kennedy, who in the late 1980s had written a much-discussed book on “the rise and fall of the great powers,” America included, declared that never in history had there been such a great “disparity of power” as between the United States and the rest of the world. Ikenberry agreed that “no other great power” had held “such formidable advantages in military, economic, technological, cultural, or political capabilities.... The preeminence of American power” was “unprecedented.” In 2004, the pundit Fareed Zakaria described the United States as enjoying a “comprehensive uni-polarity” unlike anything seen since Rome. But a mere four years later Zakaria was writing about the “post-American world” and “the rise of the rest,” and Kennedy was discoursing again upon the inevitability of American decline. Did the fundamentals of America’s relative power shift so dramatically in just a few short years? The answer is no. Let’s start with the basic indicators. In economic terms, and even despite the current years of recession and slow growth, America’s position in the world has not changed. Its share of the world’s GDP has held remarkably steady, not only over the past decade but over the past four decades. In 1969, the United States produced roughly a quarter of the world’s economic output. Today it still produces roughly a quarter, and it remains not only the largest but also the richest economy in the world. People are rightly mesmerized by the rise of China, India, and other Asian nations whose share of the global economy has been climbing steadily, but this has so far come almost entirely at the expense of Europe and Japan, which have had a declining share of the global economy. Optimists about China’s development predict that it will overtake the United States as the largest economy in the world sometime in the next two decades. This could mean that the United States will face an increasing challenge to its economic position in the future. But the sheer size of an economy is not by itself a good measure of overall power within the international system. If it were, then early nineteenth-century China, with what was then the world’s largest economy, would have been the predominant power instead of the prostrate victim of smaller European nations. Even if China does reach this pinnacle again—and Chinese leaders face significant obstacles to sustaining the country’s growth indefinitely—it will still remain far behind both the United States and Europe in terms of per capita GDP. Military capacity matters, too, as early nineteenth-century China learned and Chinese leaders know today. As Yan Xuetong recently noted, “military strength underpins hegemony.” Here the United States remains unmatched. It is far and away the most powerful nation the world has ever known, and there has been no decline in America’s relative military capacity—at least not yet. Americans currently spend less than $600 billion a year on defense, more than the rest of the other great powers combined. (This figure does not include the deployment in Iraq, which is ending, or the combat forces in Afghanistan, which are likely to diminish steadily over the next couple of years.) They do so, moreover, while consuming a little less than 4 percent of GDP annually—a higher percentage than the other great powers, but in historical terms lower than the 10 percent of GDP that the United States spent on defense in the mid-1950s and the 7 percent it spent in the late 1980s. The superior expenditures underestimate America’s actual superiority in military capability. American land and air forces are equipped with the most advanced weaponry, and are the most experienced in actual combat. They would defeat any competitor in a head-to-head battle. American naval power remains predominant in every region of the world. By these military and economic measures, at least, the United States today is not remotely like Britain circa 1900, when that empire’s relative decline began to become apparent. It is more like Britain circa 1870, when the empire was at the height of its power. It is possible to imagine a time when this might no longer be the case, but that moment has not yet arrived. But what about the “rise of the rest”—the increasing economic clout of nations like China, India, Brazil, and Turkey? Doesn’t that cut into American power and influence? The answer is, it depends. The fact that other nations in the world are enjoying periods of high growth does not mean that America’s position as the predominant power is declining, or even that “the rest” are catching up in terms of overall power and influence. Brazil’s share of global GDP was a little over 2 percent in 1990 and remains a little over 2 percent today. Turkey’s share was under 1 percent in 1990 and is still under 1 percent today. People, and especially businesspeople, are naturally excited about these emerging markets, but just because a nation is an attractive investment opportunity does not mean it is a rising great power. Wealth matters in international politics, but there is no simple correlation between economic growth and international influence. It is not clear that a richer India today wields greater influence on the global stage than a poorer India did in the 1950s under Nehru, when it was the leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, or that Turkey, for all the independence and flash of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, really wields more influence than it did a decade ago. As for the effect of these growing economies on the position of the United States, it all depends on who is doing the growing. The problem for the British Empire at the beginning of the twentieth century was not its substantial decline relative to the United States, a generally friendly power whose interests did not fundamentally conflict with Britain’s. Even in the Western hemisphere, British trade increased as it ceded dominance to the United States. The problem was Britain’s decline relative to Germany, which aimed for supremacy on the European continent, and sought to compete with Britain on the high seas, and in both respects posed a threat to Britain’s core security. In the case of the United States, the dramatic and rapid rise of the German and Japanese economies during the Cold War reduced American primacy in the world much more than the more recent “rise of the rest.” America’s share of the world’s GDP, nearly 50 percent after World War II, fell to roughly 25 percent by the early 1970s, where it has remained ever since. But that “rise of the rest” did not weaken the United States. If anything, it strengthened it. Germany and Japan were and are close democratic allies, key pillars of the American world order. The growth of their economies actually shifted the balance irretrievably against the Soviet bloc and helped bring about its demise. When gauging the impact of the growing economies of other countries today, one has to make the same kinds of calculations. Does the growth of the Brazilian economy, or of the Indian economy, diminish American global power? Both nations are friendly, and India is increasingly a strategic partner of the United States. If America’s future competitor in the world is likely to be China, then a richer and more powerful India will be an asset, not a liability, to the United States. Overall, the fact that Brazil, India, Turkey, and South Africa are enjoying a period of economic growth—which may or may not last indefinitely—is either irrelevant to America’s strategic position or of benefit to it. At present, only the growth of China’s economy can be said to have implications for American power in the future, and only insofar as the Chinese translate enough of their growing economic strength into military strength.<br />

If the United States is not suffering decline in these basic measures of power, isn’t it true that its influence has diminished, that it is having a harder time getting its way in the world? The almost universal assumption is that the United States has indeed lost influence. Whatever the explanation may be—American decline, the “rise of the rest,” the apparent failure of the American capitalist model, the dysfunctional nature of American politics, the increasing complexity of the international system—it is broadly accepted that the United States can no longer shape the world to suit its interests and ideals as it once did. Every day seems to bring more proof, as things happen in the world that seem both contrary to American interests and beyond American control. And of course it is true that the United States is not able to get what it wants much of the time. But then it never could. Much of today’s impressions about declining American influence are based on a nostalgic fallacy: that there was once a time when the United States could shape the whole world to suit its desires, and could get other nations to do what it wanted them to do, and, as the political scientist Stephen M. Walt put it, “manage the politics, economics and security arrangements for nearly the entire globe.” If we are to gauge America’s relative position today, it is important to recognize that this image of the past is an illusion. There never was such a time. We tend to think back on the early years of the Cold War as a moment of complete American global dominance. They were nothing of the sort. The United States did accomplish extraordinary things in that era: the Marshall Plan, the NATO alliance, the United Nations, and the Bretton Woods economic system all shaped the world we know today. Yet for every great achievement in the early Cold War, there was at least one equally monumental setback. During the Truman years, there was the triumph of the Communist Revolution in China in 1949, which American officials regarded as a disaster for American interests in the region and which did indeed prove costly; if nothing else, it was a major factor in spurring North Korea to attack the South in 1950. But as Dean Acheson concluded, “the ominous result of the civil war in China” had proved “beyond the control of the ... United States,” the product of “forces which this country tried to influence but could not.” A year later came the unanticipated and unprepared-for North Korean attack on South Korea, and America’s intervention, which, after more than 35,000 American dead and almost 100,000 wounded, left the situation almost exactly as it had been before the war. In 1949, there came perhaps the worst news of all: the Soviet acquisition of the atomic bomb and the end of the nuclear monopoly on which American military strategy and defense budgeting had been predicated. A year later, NSC-68, the famous strategy document, warned of the growing gap between America’s military strength and its global strategic commitments. If current trends continued, it declared, the result would be “a serious decline in the strength of the free world relative to the Soviet Union and its satellites.” The “integrity and vitality of our system,” the document stated, was “in greater jeopardy than ever before in our history.” Douglas MacArthur, giving the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in 1952, lamented the “alarming change in the balance of world power,” “the rising burden of our fiscal commitments,” the ascendant power of the Soviet Union, “and our own relative decline.” In 1957, the Gaither Commission reported that the Russian economy was growing at a much faster pace than that of the United States and that by 1959 Russia would be able to hit American soil with one hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles, prompting Sam Rayburn, the speaker of the House, to ask, “What good are a sound economy and a balanced budget if we lose our national lives and Russian rubles become the coin of the land?” Nor was the United States always able to persuade others, even its closest allies, to do what it wanted, or to refrain from doing what it did not want. In 1949, Acheson tried and failed to prevent European allies, including the British, from recognizing Communist China. In 1954, the Eisenhower administration failed to get its way at the Geneva Conference on Vietnam and refused to sign the final accords. Two years later it tried to prevent the British, the French, and the Israelis from invading Egypt over the closure of the Suez Canal, only to see them launch an invasion without so much as a heads-up to Washington. When the United States confronted China over the islands of Quemoy and Matsu, the Eisenhower administration tried and failed to get a show of support from European allies, prompting John Foster Dulles to fear that NATO was “beginning to fall apart.” By the late 1950s, Mao believed the United States was a superpower in decline, “afraid of taking on new involvements in the Third World and increasingly incapable of maintaining its hegemony over the capitalist countries.” But what about “soft power”? Wasn’t it true, as the political scientist Joseph S. Nye Jr. has argued, that the United States used to be able to “get what it wanted in the world” because of the “values expressed” by American culture as reflected through television, movies, and music, and because of the attractiveness of America’s domestic and foreign policies? These elements of soft power made other peoples around the world want to follow the United States, “admiring its values, emulating its example, aspiring to its level of prosperity and openness.” Again, the historical truth is more complicated. During the first three decades after World War II, great portions of the world neither admired the United States nor sought to emulate it, and were not especially pleased at the way it conducted itself in international affairs. Yes, American media were spreading American culture, but they were spreading images that were not always flattering. In the 1950s the world could watch televised images of Joseph McCarthy and the hunt for Communists in the State Department and Hollywood. American movies depicted the suffocating capitalist conformism of the new American corporate culture. Best-selling novels such as The Ugly American painted a picture of American bullying and boorishness. There were the battles over segregation in the 1950s and 1960s, the globally transmitted images of whites spitting at black schoolchildren and police setting their dogs on black demonstrators. (That “used to be us,” too.) The racism of America was practically “ruining” the American global image, Dulles feared, especially in the so-called Third World. In the late 1960s and early 1970s came the Watts riots, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, the shootings at Kent State, and then the government-shaking scandal of Watergate. These were not the kinds of images likely to endear the United States to the world, no matter how many Jerry Lewis and Woody Allen movies were playing in Parisian cinemas. Nor did much of the world find American foreign policy especially attractive during these years. Eisenhower yearned “to get some of the people in these down-trodden countries to like us instead of hating us,” but the CIA-orchestrated overthrows of Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran and Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala did not help. In 1957, demonstrators attacked the vice president’s motorcade in Venezuela, shouting, “Go away, Nixon!” “Out, dog!” “We won’t forget Guatemala!” In 1960, Khrushchev humiliated Eisenhower by canceling a summit when an American spy plane was shot down over Russia. Later that year, on his way to a “goodwill” visit in Tokyo, Eisenhower had to turn back in mid-flight when the Japanese government warned it could not guarantee his security against students protesting American “imperialism.” Eisenhower’s Democratic successors fared little better. John F. Kennedy and his wife were beloved for a time, but America’s glow faded after his assassination. Lyndon Johnson’s invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965 was widely condemned not only in Latin America but also by European allies. De Gaulle warned American officials that the United States, like “all countries that had overwhelming power,” had come “to believe that force would solve everything” and would soon learn this was “not the case.” And then, of course, came Vietnam—the destruction, the scenes of napalm, the My Lai massacre, the secret incursion into Cambodia, the bombing of Hanoi, and the general perception of a Western colonialist superpower pounding a small but defiant Third World country into submission. When Johnson’s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, visited West Berlin in 1967, the American cultural center was attacked, thousands of students protested American policies, and rumors swirled of assassination attempts. In 1968, when millions of Europe’s youth took to the streets, they were not expressing their admiration for American culture. Nor were the great majority of nations around the world trying to emulate the American system. In the first decades of the Cold War, many were attracted to the state-controlled economies of the Soviet Union and China, which seemed to promise growth without the messy problems of democracy. The economies of the Soviet bloc had growth rates as high as those in the West throughout much of this period, largely due to a state-directed surge in heavy industry. According to Allen Dulles, the CIA director, many leaders in the Third World believed that the Soviet system “might have more to offer in the way of quick results than the U.S. system.” Dictators such as Egypt’s Nasser and Indonesia’s Sukarno found the state-dominated model especially attractive, but so did India’s Nehru. Leaders of the emerging Non-Aligned Movement—Nehru, Nasser, Tito, Sukarno, Nkrumah—expressed little admiration for American ways. After the death of Stalin, moreover, both the Soviet Union and China engaged in hot competition to win over the Third World, taking “goodwill tours” and providing aid programs of their own. Eisenhower reflected that “the new Communist line of sweetness and light was perhaps more dangerous than their propaganda in Stalin’s time.” The Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson administrations worried constantly about the leftward tilt of all these nations, and lavished development aid on them in the hope of winning hearts and minds. They found that the aid, while eagerly accepted, guaranteed neither allegiance nor appreciation. One result of Third World animosity was that the United States steadily lost influence at the United Nations after 1960. Once the place where the American war in Korea was legitimized, from the 1960s until the end of the Cold War the U.N. General Assembly became a forum for constant expressions of anti-Americanism. In the late 1960s, Henry Kissinger despaired of the future. The “increased fragmentation of power, the greater diffusion of political activity, and the more complicated patterns of international conflict and alignment,” he wrote to Nixon, had sharply reduced the capacity of both superpowers to influence “the actions of other governments.” And things only seemed to get more difficult as the 1970s unfolded. The United States withdrew from Vietnam in defeat, and the world watched the first-ever resignation of an American president mired in scandal. And then, perhaps as significant as all the rest, world oil prices went through the roof. The last problem pointed to a significant new difficulty: the inability of the United States to wield influence effectively in the Middle East. Today people point to America’s failure to bring Israelis and Palestinians to a negotiated settlement, or to manage the tumultuous Arab Awakening, as a sign of weakness and decline. But in 1973 the United States could not even prevent the major powers in the Middle East from engaging in all-out war. When Egypt and Syria launched their surprise attack on Israel, it was a surprise to Washington as well. The United States eventually had to go on nuclear alert to deter Soviet intervention in the conflict. The war led to the oil embargo, the establishment of OPEC as a major force in world affairs, and the sudden revelation that, as historian Daniel Yergin put it, “the United States itself was now, finally, vulnerable.” The “world’s foremost superpower” had been “thrown on the defensive, humiliated, by a handful of small nations.” Many Americans “feared that the end of an era was at hand.” In the 1970s, the dramatic rise in oil prices, coupled with American economic policies during the Vietnam War, led the American economy into a severe crisis. Gross national product fell by 6 percent between 1973 and 1975. Unemployment doubled from 4.5 percent to 9 percent. The American people suffered through gas lines and the new economic phenomenon of stagflation, combining a stagnant economy with high inflation. The American economy went through three recessions between 1973 and 1982. The “energy crisis” was to Americans then what the “fiscal crisis” is today. In his first televised address to the nation, Jimmy Carter called it “the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetimes.” It was especially humiliating that the crisis was driven in part by two close American allies, the Saudi royal family and the Shah of Iran. As Carter recalled in his memoirs, the American people “deeply resented that the greatest nation on earth was being jerked around by a few desert states.” The low point came in 1979, when the Shah was overthrown, the radical Islamic revolution led by Ayatollah Khomeini came to power, and fifty-two Americans were taken hostage and held for more than a year. The hostage crisis, as Yergin has observed, “transmitted a powerful message: that the shift of power in the world oil market in the 1970s was only part of a larger drama that was taking place in global politics. The United States and the West, it seemed to say, were truly in decline, on the defensive, and, it appeared, unable to do anything to protect their interests, whether economic or political.” If one wanted to make a case for American decline, the 1970s would have been the time to do it; and many did. The United States, Kissinger believed, had evidently “passed its historic high point like so many earlier civilizations.... Every civilization that has ever existed has ultimately collapsed. History is a tale of efforts that failed.” It was in the 1970s that the American economy lost its overwhelming primacy, when the American trade surplus began to turn into a trade deficit, when spending on entitlements and social welfare programs ballooned, when American gold and monetary reserves were depleted. With economic difficulties came political and strategic insecurity. First came the belief that the tide of history was with the Soviet Union. Soviet leaders themselves believed the “correlation of forces” favored communism; the American defeat and withdrawal from Vietnam led Soviet officials, for the first time, to believe they might actually “win” in the long Cold War struggle. A decade later, in 1987, Paul Kennedy depicted both superpowers as suffering from “imperial overstretch,” but suggested that it was entirely possible that the United States would be the first to collapse, following a long historical tradition of exhausted and bankrupt empires. It had crippled itself by spending too much on defense and taking on too many far-flung global responsibilities. But within two years the Berlin Wall fell, and two years after that the Soviet Union collapsed. The decline turned out to be taking place elsewhere. Then there was the miracle economy of Japan. A “rise of the rest” began in the late 1970s and continued over the next decade and a half, as Japan, along with the other “Asian tigers,” South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, seemed about to eclipse the United States economically. In 1989, the journalist James Fallows argued that the Japanese state-directed economy was plainly superior to the more laissez-faire capitalism of the United States and was destined to surpass it. Japan was to be the next superpower. While the United States had bankrupted itself fighting the Cold War, the Japanese had been busy taking all the marbles. As the analyst Chalmers Johnson put it in 1995, “The Cold War is over, and Japan won.” Even as Johnson typed those words, the Japanese economy was spiraling downward into a period of stagnation from which it has still not recovered. With the Soviet Union gone and China yet to demonstrate the staying power of its economic boom, the United States suddenly appeared to be the world’s “sole superpower.” Yet even then it was remarkable how unsuccessful the United States was in dealing with many serious global problems. The Americans won the Gulf War, expanded NATO eastward, eventually brought peace to the Balkans, after much bloodshed, and, through most of the 1990s, led much of the world to embrace the “Washington consensus” on economics—but some of these successes began to unravel, and were matched by equally significant failures. The Washington consensus began to collapse with the Asian financial crisis of 1997, where American prescriptions were widely regarded as mistaken and damaging. The United States failed to stop or even significantly to retard the nuclear weapons programs of North Korea and Iran, despite repeatedly declaring its intention to do so. The sanctions regime imposed against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq was both futile and, by the end of the decade, collapsing. The United States, and the world, did nothing to prevent the genocide in Rwanda, partly because a year earlier the United States had been driven out of Somalia after a failed military intervention. One of the most important endeavors of the United States in the 1990s was the effort to support a transition in post-Soviet Russia to democracy and free-market capitalism. But despite providing billions of dollars and endless amounts of advice and expertise, the United States found events in Russia once again to be beyond its control. Nor were American leaders, even in the supposed heyday of global predominance, any more successful in solving the Israeli-Palestinian problem than they are today. Even with a booming economy and a well-liked president earnestly working to achieve a settlement, the Clinton administration came up empty-handed. As the former Middle East peace negotiator Aaron David Miller recounts, Bill Clinton “cared more about and invested more time and energy in Arab-Israeli peace over a longer period of time than any of his predecessors,” and was admired and appreciated by both Israelis and Palestinians—and yet he held “three summits within six months and fail[ed] at every one.” Clinton’s term ended with the collapse of peace talks and the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada. Even popularity was elusive in the 1990s. In 1999, Samuel P. Huntington labeled America the “lonely superpower,” widely hated across the globe for its “intrusive, interventionist, exploitative, unilateralist, hegemonic, hypocritical” behavior. The French foreign minister decried the “hyperpower” and openly yearned for a “multipolar” world in which the United States would no longer be dominant. A British diplomat told Huntington: “One reads about the world’s desire for American leadership only in the United States. Everywhere else one reads about American arrogance and unilateralism.” This was nonsense, of course. Contrary to the British diplomat’s claim, many other countries did look to the United States for leadership, and for protection and support, in the 1990s and throughout the Cold War. The point is not that America always lacked global influence. From World War II onward, the United States was indeed the predominant power in the world. It wielded enormous influence, more than any great power since Rome, and it accomplished much. But it was not omnipotent—far from it. If we are to gauge accurately whether the United States is currently in decline, we need to have a reasonable baseline from which to measure. To compare American influence today with a mythical past of overwhelming dominance can only mislead us. Today the United States lacks the ability to have its way on many issues, but this has not prevented it from enjoying just as much success, and suffering just as much failure, as in the past. For all the controversy, the United States has been more successful in Iraq than it was in Vietnam. It has been just as incapable of containing Iranian nuclear ambitions as it was in the 1990s, but it has, through the efforts of two administrations, established a more effective global counter-proliferation network. Its efforts to root out and destroy Al Qaeda have been remarkably successful, especially when compared with the failures to destroy terrorist networks and stop terrorist attacks in the 1990s—failures that culminated in the attacks of September 11. The ability to employ drones is an advance over the types of weaponry—cruise missiles and air strikes—that were used to target terrorists and facilities in previous decades. Meanwhile America’s alliances in Europe remain healthy; it is certainly not America’s fault that Europe itself seems weaker than it once was. American alliances in Asia have arguably grown stronger over the past few years, and the United States has been able to strengthen relations with India that had previously been strained. So the record is mixed, but it has always been mixed. There have been moments when the United States was more influential than today and moments when it was less influential. The exertion of influence has always been a struggle, which may explain why, in every single decade since the end of World War II, Americans have worried about their declining influence and looked nervously as other powers seemed to be rising at their expense. The difficulties in shaping the international environment in any era are immense. Few powers even attempt it, and even the strongest rarely achieve all or even most of their goals. Foreign policy is like hitting a baseball: if you fail 70 percent of the time, you go to the Hall of Fame.<br />
<br />
The challenges today are great, and the rise of China is the most obvious of them. But they are not greater than the challenges the United States faced during the Cold War. Only in retrospect can the Cold War seem easy. Americans at the end of World War II faced a major strategic crisis. The Soviet Union, if only by virtue of its size and location, seemed to threaten vital strategic centers in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia. In all these regions, it confronted nations devastated and prostrate from the war. To meet this challenge, the United States had to project its own power, which was great but limited, into each of those regions. It had to form alliances with local powers, some of them former enemies, and provide them with economic, political, and military assistance to help them stand on their own feet and resist Soviet pressure. In the Cold War, the Soviets wielded influence and put pressure on American interests merely by standing still, while the United States had to scramble. It is worth recalling that this strategy of “containment,” now hallowed by its apparent success, struck some influential observers at the time as entirely unworkable. Walter Lippmann attacked it as “misconceived,” based on “hope,” conceding the “strategic initiative” to the Soviets while the United States exhausted its resources trying to establish “satellite states, puppet governments” that were weak, ineffective, and unreliable. Today, in the case of China, the situation is reversed. Although China is and will be much richer, and will wield greater economic influence in the world than the Soviet Union ever did, its geostrategic position is more difficult. World War II left China in a comparatively weak position from which it has been working hard to recover ever since. Several of its neighbors are strong nations with close ties to the United States. It will have a hard time becoming a regional hegemon so long as Taiwan remains independent and strategically tied to the United States, and so long as strong regional powers such as Japan, Korea, and Australia continue to host American troops and bases. China would need at least a few allies to have any chance of pushing the United States out of its strongholds in the western Pacific, but right now it is the United States that has the allies. It is the United States that has its troops deployed in forward bases. It is the United States that currently enjoys naval predominance in the key waters and waterways through which China must trade. Altogether, China’s task as a rising great power, which is to push the United States out of its present position, is much harder than America’s task, which is only to hold on to what it has. Can the United States do that? In their pessimistic mood today, some Americans doubt that it can. Indeed, they doubt whether the United States can afford to continue playing in any part of the world the predominant role that it has played in the past. Some argue that while Paul Kennedy’s warning of imperial overstretch may not have been correct in 1987, it accurately describes America’s current predicament. The fiscal crisis, the deadlocked political system, the various maladies of American society (including wage stagnation and income inequality), the weaknesses of the educational system, the deteriorating infrastructure—all of these are cited these days as reasons why the United States needs to retrench internationally, to pull back from some overseas commitments, to focus on “nation building at home” rather than try to keep shaping the world as it has in the past. Again, these common assumptions require some examination. For one thing, how “overstretched” is the United States? The answer, in historical terms, is not nearly as much as people imagine. Consider the straightforward matter of the number of troops that the United States deploys overseas. To listen to the debate today, one might imagine there were more American troops committed abroad than ever before. But that is not remotely the case. In 1953, the United States had almost one million troops deployed overseas—325,000 in combat in Korea and more than 600,000 stationed in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. In 1968, it had over one million troops on foreign soil—537,000 in Vietnam and another half million stationed elsewhere. By contrast, in the summer of 2011, at the height of America’s deployments in its two wars, there were about 200,000 troops deployed in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan combined, and another roughly 160,000 troops stationed in Europe and East Asia. Altogether, and including other forces stationed around the world, there were about 500,000 troops deployed overseas. This was lower even than the peacetime deployments of the Cold War. In 1957, for instance, there were over 750,000 troops deployed overseas. Only in the decade between the breakup of the Soviet empire and the attacks of September 11 was the number of deployed forces overseas lower than it is today. The comparison is even more striking if one takes into account the growth of the American population. When the United States had one million troops deployed overseas in 1953, the total American population was only 160 million. Today, when there are half a million troops deployed overseas, the American population is 313 million. The country is twice as large, with half as many troops deployed as fifty years ago. What about the financial expense? Many seem to believe that the cost of these deployments, and of the armed forces generally, is a major contributor to the soaring fiscal deficits that threaten the solvency of the national economy. But this is not the case, either. As the former budget czar Alice Rivlin has observed, the scary projections of future deficits are not “caused by rising defense spending,” much less by spending on foreign assistance. The runaway deficits projected for the coming years are mostly the result of ballooning entitlement spending. Even the most draconian cuts in the defense budget would produce annual savings of only $50 billion to $100 billion, a small fraction—between 4 and 8 percent—of the $1.5 trillion in annual deficits the United States is facing. In 2002, when Paul Kennedy was marveling at America’s ability to remain “the world’s single superpower on the cheap,” the United States was spending about 3.4 percent of GDP on defense. Today it is spending a little under 4 percent, and in years to come, that is likely to head lower again—still “cheap” by historical standards. The cost of remaining the world’s predominant power is not prohibitive. If we are serious about this exercise in accounting, moreover, the costs of maintaining this position cannot be measured without considering the costs of losing it. Some of the costs of reducing the American role in the world are, of course, unquantifiable. What is it worth to Americans to live in a world dominated by democracies rather than by autocracies? But some of the potential costs could be measured, if anyone cared to try. If the decline of American military power produced an unraveling of the international economic order that American power has helped sustain; if trade routes and waterways ceased to be as secure, because the U.S. Navy was no longer able to defend them; if regional wars broke out among great powers because they were no longer constrained by the American superpower; if American allies were attacked because the United States appeared unable to come to their defense; if the generally free and open nature of the international system became less so—if all this came to pass, there would be measurable costs. And it is not too far-fetched to imagine that these costs would be far greater than the savings gained by cutting the defense and foreign aid budgets by $100 billion a year. You can save money by buying a used car without a warranty and without certain safety features, but what happens when you get into an accident? American military strength reduces the risk of accidents by deterring conflict, and lowers the price of the accidents that occur by reducing the chance of losing. These savings need to be part of the calculation, too. As a simple matter of dollars and cents, it may be a lot cheaper to preserve the current level of American involvement in the world than to reduce it. Perhaps the greatest concern underlying the declinist mood at large in the country today is not really whether the United States can afford to continue playing its role in the world. It is whether the Americans are capable of solving any of their most pressing economic and social problems. As many statesmen and commentators have asked, can Americans do what needs to be done to compete effectively in the twenty-first-century world? The only honest answer is, who knows? If American history is any guide, however, there is at least some reason to be hopeful. Americans have experienced this unease before, and many previous generations have also felt this sense of lost vigor and lost virtue: as long ago as 1788, Patrick Henry lamented the nation’s fall from past glory, “when the American spirit was in its youth.” There have been many times over the past two centuries when the political system was dysfunctional, hopelessly gridlocked, and seemingly unable to find solutions to crushing national problems—from slavery and then Reconstruction, to the dislocations of industrialization at the end of the nineteenth century and the crisis of social welfare during the Great Depression, to the confusions and paranoia of the early Cold War years. Anyone who honestly recalls the 1970s, with Watergate, Vietnam, stagflation, and the energy crisis, cannot really believe that our present difficulties are unrivaled. Success in the past does not guarantee success in the future. But one thing does seem clear from the historical evidence: the American system, for all its often stultifying qualities, has also shown a greater capacity to adapt and recover from difficulties than many other nations, including its geopolitical competitors. This undoubtedly has something to do with the relative freedom of American society, which rewards innovators, often outside the existing power structure, for producing new ways of doing things; and with the relatively open political system of America, which allows movements to gain steam and to influence the behavior of the political establishment. The American system is slow and clunky in part because the Founders designed it that way, with a federal structure, checks and balances, and a written Constitution and Bill of Rights—but the system also possesses a remarkable ability to undertake changes just when the steam kettle looks about to blow its lid. There are occasional “critical elections” that allow transformations to occur, providing new political solutions to old and apparently insoluble problems. Of course, there are no guarantees: the political system could not resolve the problem of slavery without war. But on many big issues throughout their history, Americans have found a way of achieving and implementing a national consensus. When Paul Kennedy was marveling at the continuing success of the American superpower back in 2002, he noted that one of the main reasons had been the ability of Americans to overcome what had appeared to him in 1987 as an insoluble long-term economic crisis. American businessmen and politicians “reacted strongly to the debate about ‘decline’ by taking action: cutting costs, making companies leaner and meaner, investing in newer technologies, promoting a communications revolution, trimming government deficits, all of which helped to produce significant year-on-year advances in productivity.” It is possible to imagine that Americans may rise to this latest economic challenge as well. It is also reasonable to expect that other nations will, as in the past, run into difficulties of their own. None of the nations currently enjoying economic miracles is without problems. Brazil, India, Turkey, and Russia all have bumpy histories that suggest the route ahead will not be one of simple and smooth ascent. There is a real question whether the autocratic model of China, which can be so effective in making some strategic decisions about the economy in the short term, can over the long run be flexible enough to permit adaptation to a changing international economic, political, and strategic environment. In sum: it may be more than good fortune that has allowed the United States in the past to come through crises and emerge stronger and healthier than other nations while its various competitors have faltered. And it may be more than just wishful thinking to believe that it may do so again. But there is a danger. It is that in the meantime, while the nation continues to struggle, Americans may convince themselves that decline is indeed inevitable, or that the United States can take a time-out from its global responsibilities while it gets its own house in order. To many Americans, accepting decline may provide a welcome escape from the moral and material burdens that have weighed on them since World War II. Many may unconsciously yearn to return to the way things were in 1900, when the United States was rich, powerful, and not responsible for world order. The underlying assumption of such a course is that the present world order will more or less persist without American power, or at least with much less of it; or that others can pick up the slack; or simply that the benefits of the world order are permanent and require no special exertion by anyone. Unfortunately, the present world order—with its widespread freedoms, its general prosperity, and its absence of great power conflict—is as fragile as it is unique. Preserving it has been a struggle in every decade, and will remain a struggle in the decades to come. Preserving the present world order requires constant American leadership and constant American commitment. In the end, the decision is in the hands of Americans. Decline, as Charles Krauthammer has observed, is a choice. It is not an inevitable fate—at least not yet. Empires and great powers rise and fall, and the only question is when. But the when does matter. Whether the United States begins to decline over the next two decades or not for<br />

<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">For the foreseeable future, </span><span class="underline">the U.S. military will most likely be involved in protecting access to oil suppliesâ€”including the political independence of oil producersâ€”and the global movements of using oil to help sustain the smooth functioning of the world economy</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. The security challenges associated with preserving access to oil are complicated by geographical “chokepoints,” through which oil flows or is transported, but which are vulnerable to piracy or closure.[75] “</span><span class="underline">Flashpoints” also exist as a result of politicalâ€”and sometimes militaryâ€”competition to secure commercial or sovereign access to oil in the face of disputed maritime and land claims </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">that are associated with oil and gas deposits. Together, these challenges have necessitated that the United States and its allies maintain costly navies and air forces to protect sea lanes, ocean access, and maintain a presence to deter military competition in disputed regions. A selection of today’s chokepoints and flashpoints follow. </span><span class="underline">The Strait of Hormuz. This strait is the narrow waterway that allows access from the Indian Ocean into the Persian Gulf. Two-thirds of the world’s oil is transported by ocean, and a very large percentage of that trade moves through Hormuz. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The northern tip of Oman forms the southern shoreline of the strait.[76] Hormuz is protected by the constant transits of the U.S. Navy and its allies. Even though the strait has not been closed, the Persian Gulf has been the scene of extensive military conflict.[77] </span><span class="underline">On September 22, 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, initiating an eight-year war between the two countries that featured the “War of the Tankers,” in which 543 ships, including the USS Stark, were attacked, while the U.S. Navy provided escort services to protect tankers that were transiting the Persian Gulf.[78] There have been past threats by Iran to militarily close the strait</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">.[79] Additionally, there are ongoing territorial disputes between the United Arab Emirates and Iran over ownership of three islands that are located in approaches to the strait.[80] Closure of the strait would cause severe disruption in the movements of the world’s oil supplies and, at a minimum, cause significant price increases and perhaps supply shortages in many regions for the duration of the closure.[81] During the War of the Tankers, oil prices increased from $13 per barrel to $31 a barrel due to supply disruptions and other “fear” factors.[82] </span><span class="underline">Bab el-Mandeb. The strait separates Africa</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (Djibouti and Eritrea) </span><span class="underline">and Asia</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (Yemen), </span><span class="underline">and it connects the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean via the Gulf of Aden. The strait is an oil transit chokepoint since most of Europe’s crude oil from the Middle East </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">passes north through Bab el-Mandeb into the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal.[83] Closure of the strait due to terrorist activities or for political/military reasons, could keep tankers from the Persian Gulf from reaching the Suez Canal and Sumed Pipeline complex, diverting them around the southern tip of Africa (the Cape of Good Hope).[84] This </span><span class="underline">would add greatly to transit time and cost, and would effectively tie-up spare tanker capacity. Closure of the Bab el-Mandeb would effectively block non-oil shipping from using the Suez Canal</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">.[85] In October 2002 the French-flagged tanker Limburg was attacked off the coast of Yemen by terrorists.[86] During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Egypt closed the strait as a means of blockading the southern Israeli port of Eilat.[87] </span><span class="underline">The Turkish Straits and Caspian Oil. The term “Turkish Straits” refers to the two narrow straits in northwestern Turkey, the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, which connect the Sea of Marmara with the Black Sea on one side and the Aegean arm of the Mediterranean Sea on the other. Turkey and Russia have been locked in a longstanding dispute over passage issues involving the Turkish Straits</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">.[88] The 1936 Montreux Convention puts Turkey in charge of regulating traffic through the straits;[89] yet Turkey has been hard pressed to stop an onslaught of Russian, Ukrainian, and Cypriot tankers, which transport Caspian Sea oil to markets in Western Europe.[90] Because of the very heavy shipping traffic and very challenging geography, there have been many collisions and groundings in the past, creating terrible pollution incidents and death.[91] Thus far, none of these incidents have been attributed to state-on-state-conflict or terrorism;[92] however, the confined waterway is an especially attractive target because of the grave economic and environmental damage that would result from a well-timed and well-placed attack on a loaded tanker. The issues surrounding the straits are also a subset of larger problems associated with the exploitation of Caspian oil, including severe pollution of the Caspian Sea as a result of imprudent extraction techniques, as well as the ever-present potential for conflict among the various claimants to the Caspian’s hydrocarbon resources due to an inability of the various Caspian littoral states to agree on their maritime boundariesâ€”and their legal areas in which to drill.[93] Any one of these problems could become a major flashpoint in the future. </span><span class="underline">China vs. Japan. The Daiyu/Senkaku islands located in the East China Sea have become an increasingly contentious dispute because both claimants have, in the past, used modern military platforms to patrol the areas of their claims in which there are suspected oil and gas deposits in the seabed</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">.[94] In September 2005, for example, China dispatched five warships to disputed waters surrounding its oil and gas platforms, which were spotted by a Japanese maritime patrol aircraft.[95] </span><span class="underline">There have been other similar military-to-military encounters.[96] Given the fact that both countries have modern armed forces and are comparatively energy starved, it is not difficult to envision serious conflict erupting over these disputed areas. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> The Arctic Super Highway. </span><span class="underline">Traditionalists would probably not include the Arctic as a security chokepoint. The oil connection is reasonably well known: “22 percent of the world’s undiscovered energy reserves are projected to be in the region (</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">including 13 percent of the world’s petroleum and 30 percent of natural gas).”[97] However, given the very small margins that transporters earn transporting oil from point A to B,[98] </span><span class="underline">shipping companies are always in search of shorter routes to transport oil to market. As the thawing of the Arctic Ocean continues as a result of climate change,[99] this may create new shipping routes that transporters of oil and other goods will use to maximize their profits and minimize their transit times</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. As supplies of readily exploitable crude oil are reduced, the probability increases that some of this trade will result from exploitation activities in the land and littoral areas adjacent to the Arctic Sea. This development is concerning for a number of reasons: (1) the area is very remote and could provide a safe haven to pirates seeking to hijack cargoes; (2) the environmental sensitivity of the area, and the concomitant difficulty of mounting a cleanup effort, means that an oil spill in that marine environment will be much more persistent than an oil spill in temperate waters;[100] (3) the Arctic presents unique navigational difficulties due to the lack of good charts, navigational aids, and communications towers, as well as the impacts of extreme cold on the operational effectiveness of systems;[101] (4) the unsettled nature of claims by various countries, including the United States, to the seabed continental shelf resources in the littoral areas off their coastlines creates the potential for military competition and conflict over these claims.[102] The International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) is now circulating draft guidelines for ships operating in Arctic areas to promoteâ€”but not requireâ€”ship hardening against an iceberg strike, better crew training, and environmental protection measures.[103] These guidelines are merely advisory and can only be implemented via the flag states.[104] Also, </span><span class="underline">neither IMO nor any of the UN Law of the Sea Institutions have mandatory jurisdiction over any of the flashpoint issues relating to competing continental shelf claims in the Arctic,[105] meaning that any disputes will remain unresolved for a long time. The above is only a selected list of potential flashpoints in which oil is the main culprit. Disputes between China and six other nations of the Spratly Islands, and other territories in the South China Sea, remain unresolved.[</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">106] The Spratly Islands could become a flashpoint in the future, involving the United States or its allies, because of the proximity of those areas to the major sea routes to Japan and Korea.[107] </span><span class="underline">The strategic straits of Malacca, Lombok, and Sunda in Southeast Asia are absolutely essential to the movement of raw materials to Japan, Korea, and China</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">.[108] Because of Lombok’s depth and strategic location, it is a major transit route for very large crude carriers that move between the Middle East and Asia.[109] Lombok is an undefended waterway that is only eighteen kilometers in width at its southern opening, making it an attractive chokepoint for hijacking or eco-terrorism in which the waters of the environmentally sensitive Indonesian archipelago would be held hostage.[110] </span><br />

<span class="underline">The United States has paid dearly in fighting major conflicts in the Persian Gulf region that are linked to assuring continued access to oil and keeping oil markets stable</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">.[111] One would have thought that the United States had learned its lesson: “Despite the global economic downturn that began in the fall of 2008, U.S. and worldwide energy demand is expected to increase dramatically in the coming decade.”[112] The United States has made strides in increasing the fuel efficiency of motor vehicles and effected other changes that will, in the coming years, lower per capita energy consumption.[113] However, these positive changes in behavior have not been sufficient to change the basic fact that </span><span class="underline">the United States is far too dependent on imported foreign oil, and such overdependence “tethers America to unstable and hostile regimes, subverts foreign policy goals, and requires the U.S. to stretch its military presence across the globe”</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> to preserve its influence and its access to foreign oil supplies.[114] Over time, U.S. sources of imported oil have become more diversified and probably will, in time, lessen U.S. dependence on oil from the Middle East.[115] However, the same cannot be said about U.S. allies and trading partners.[116] Also, the United States has an enduring interest in protecting all of these markets to ensure price stability of the product and to prevent shortages. </span><span class="underline">Because the D</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">epartment </span><span class="underline">o</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">f </span><span class="underline">D</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">efense (“DOD”) </span><span class="underline">is the largest fuel user in the country,[117] it is moving aggressively to integrate alternative fuels on its bases, ships, and aircraft</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, and it has been provided $7.4 billion in “stimulus” appropriations by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) to, among other things, modernize DOD’s energy infrastructure and conduct targeted energy efficiency research and development projects.[118] DOD also maintains an Environmental Security Technology Certification Program to demonstrate and validate innovative technologies targeting its most urgent environmental needs.[119] </span><span class="underline">Despite positive investments that will eventually lead to more energy efficient systems, the increased “electrification” of combat has chained field commanders in Afghanistan to military fuel lines</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">.[120] Further, </span><span class="underline">a myriad of generators, refrigeration units, and other electrified combat systems need oil or gas to power them.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">[121] </span><span class="underline">This “tethering” effect creates additional risks because field commanders have to be cognizant of the constant threat of ambush or roadside bombs to convoys of fuel trucks and supply forces in the field.[122] Conventionally powered naval vessels are, of course, dependent upon a costly and exposed network of supply ships, and DOD foreign bases exist to provide refueling support for U.S. ships and warplanes</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">.[123] Finally, </span><span class="underline">fluctuations in oil prices greatly complicate DOD’s ability to finance its operations</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">.[124] </span><span class="underline">An increase of just $10 per barrel in the cost of oil translates into $1.3 billion in increased costs of operations.[125] These types of price spikes have clear impacts on readiness since funds have to be shifted from training and maintenance accounts to pay for fuel.[</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">126] </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Print Share Facebook Twitter Email More The idea of a world without the benefit of preponderant American seapower may sound alarmist and farfetched. Unfortunately, those who follow military cutbacks and world affairs know that it isn’t. Indeed, the following scenario is all too plausible. .  .  . In 2020, several major European nations default on their debt. Contagion in the financial markets plunges the world economy into global depression. From 2020 to 2025, the U.S. economy contracts from $20 trillion to $12 trillion</span><span class="underline">. During this time, two successive U.S. presidents seek and obtain deep cuts in the size of the U.S. armed forces</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. Homeland security becomes the main focus of the Department of Defense, with policy-makers concentrating on port and border security, land-based strategic nuclear forces, antiterrorism, and managing civil unrest. </span><span class="underline">The global implications of this retrenchment are stark. China’s claims on the S</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">outh </span><span class="underline">C</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">hina </span><span class="underline">S</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">ea—previously disputed by virtually all nations in the region and routinely contested by U.S. and partner naval forces—</span><span class="underline">are accepted as a fait accompli, effectively putting the entire expanse under Chinese hegemony. Korea</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, unified in 2017 after the implosion of the North, </span><span class="underline">signs a mutual defense treaty with China. Japan is increasingly isolated and executes long-rumored plans to create a nuclear weapons capability. India, recognizing that its previous role as a balancer to China has lost relevance with the pullback of the Americans, agrees to supplement Chinese naval power in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf to protect the flow of oil</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> to Southeast Asia. China agrees to exercise increased influence over Pakistan. </span><span class="underline">Iran dominates the Persian Gulf and is a nuclear power. Its navy aggressively patrols the Gulf while the Revolutionary Guard Navy harasses shipping and oil infrastructure to force the Gulf Cooperation Council countries into Tehran’s orbit. Russia supplies Iran with a steady flow of military technology</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> and nuclear industry expertise. In Egypt, a decade-long experiment in participatory democracy ends with a violent seizure of power by Islamists. The United States is identified closely with the previous coalition government, and riots break out outside the U.S. embassy. Americans in Egypt hunker down and hope for the best, as there are no U.S. forces in the Mediterranean to evacuate them. </span><span class="underline">The NATO alliance falls apart. For its energy security, Europe depends on Russia and Iran, which control the main supply lines and sources of oil and gas to Western Europe.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> Major European nations stand down their militaries and make only limited contributions to a new EU constabulary force. No European nation maintains the ability to conduct significant out-of-area operations, and Europe as a whole maintains little airlift capacity. The impact of the world fiscal and political crisis is devastating to the U.S. Navy, which has been in decline since the latter part of the Obama administration, when Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta chose to maintain proportional resourcing of the Navy, Air Force, and Army rather than make difficult choices among competing priorities. </span><span class="underline">World trade goes into steep decline. In addition, shippers avoid U.S. ports as a result of the onerous container inspection regime. As a result, American consumers face a diminished selection of goods and a lower standard of living. By 2025, the Navy is down to 70 deployable ships</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (from 286 in 2011). All aircraft carriers and all but six attack submarines are sidelined, as the Navy dramatically cuts back on expensive nuclear engineers and pilots. Additionally, the Navy de-emphasizes projecting power and sea control beyond U.S. territorial waters. A fleet of four ballistic missile submarines is retained for nuclear deterrence. With the Navy no longer seeking to project power, the carrier force is decimated; the amphibious force is cut less severely because of the flexibility of these platforms and because they are highly valued for their usefulness in defense support to civil authority missions, such as disaster relief. All forward-deployed naval forces pull back to the bases in Norfolk and San Diego. A greatly diminished Coast Guard maintains a presence in Hawaii. All other naval bases are closed. The fleet of 70 ships consists of 6 attack submarines, 4 ballistic missile submarines, 8 aviation-capable amphibious ships, 8 other amphibious ships, 15 destroyers, and 29 small combatants. The Navy also operates 2 hospital ships, which are in heavy domestic demand. It does not operate a logistics force because all fueling, provisioning, and arming is done in port. The Navy’s operational mandate is homeland defense, and its activities have become largely indistinguishable from those of the Coast Guard. Some members of Congress call for combining the two services. There is one remaining private shipyard suitable for building both conventional and nuclear combatants. Specialized shipbuilding trades are in fatal decline. The ship repair business has disappeared, and all depot-level maintenance is conducted in two heavily subsidized public shipyards .  .  . . </span><br />

Navy Support Facility Diego Garcia Diego Garcia BIOT, Chagos Archipelago: <span class="underline"> Background: This joint U.S. and U.K. operation is situated on a tiny atoll about 1000 miles from India and tasked with providing logistical support to forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. How It's Unique: &quot;There's a certain amount of logistical difficulty&quot; with ultra-remote facilities like Diego Garcia, Schulz says, and shipping materials can be costly. Diego Garcia's remoteness, though, allows it to be a key hub for tracking satellites, and it is one of five monitoring stations for GPS. Additionally, the island is one of only a handful of locations equipped with a Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance system for tracking objects in deep space. </span>As an atoll, the land itself is rather oddly shaped, too. From end to end, Diego Garcia is 34 miles long, but its total area is only 11 square miles.<br />

<span class="underline">The United States Navy currently possesses four guided missile submarines (SSGNs), Ohio-class Trident</span> ballistic missile submarines refitted to carry conventional Tomahawk cruise missiles. <span class="underline">The platform exploits the nuclear submarine’s ability to remain undetected</span> off of a hostile coastline for <span class="underline">long periods of time and provides two unique capabilities</span> in addition to covert intelligence collection: (1) With a “<span class="underline">maximum strike” complement of 154 Tomahawk missiles, a single SSGN has the cruise missile striking power of a typical carrier battle group.</span> 85 With an SSGN in theater, other Tomahawk-equipped submarines and surface ships are free to undertake tasks such as surveillance or interdiction missions. (2) <span class="underline">With the ability to accommodate over sixty special operations (SOF) personnel and equipment, the SSGN can also be configured to support strike and SOF missions simultaneously</span>. As a result, the <span class="underline">submarine can covertly insert up to four platoons of Navy SEALs</span> on land while retaining the ability to strike targets with up to 140 operational Tomahawks. In the future, the SSGNs may also employ Unmanned Underwater Vehicles for special operations. <span class="underline">The SSGN is well-suited to the security environment of the Indian Ocean littoral.</span> In addition to undertaking strike missions in the region, <span class="underline">the SSGN can capitalize on its natural stealth advantage. It will be able to operate near various hotbeds of Islamic extremism around the Horn of Africa and within the Persian Gulf without being detected</span>. This would allow the United States to bring targets into range of the submarine’s Tomahawk missiles without ever alerting the opponent to the threat. In addition, the SSGN will be available for SOF activity in the region. Combined Joint Task forces off the coasts of Somalia and Yemen, for example, could insert Special Forces covertly and extract them upon completion of a mission, all while submerged. <span class="underline">For reasons of security and stability, Diego Garcia is the natural choice to host a guided-missile submarine in the Indian Ocean. In terms of security, the SSGN will not need to transit a dangerous chokepoint to arrive at the atoll. Bringing the SSGN into regional ports</span>, such as Bahrain and Dubai, by contrast, <span class="underline">would require the SSGN to conduct a tricky transit through the busy, shallow Strait of Hormuz. In addition, a fully- loaded submarine would make an attractive and highly visible target for terrorists who might seek to attack the new platform. The SSGN could also face potential harassment by a regional aggressor such as Iran. The isolated pier at Diego Garcia, therefore, represents a safer alternative to many closer ports</span>. The island also provides stability: <span class="underline">SSGNs require unique—and therefore expensive—support facilities to load and maintain the Tomahawk launch system, special operations forces module, and associated equipment</span>. By contrast, a flexible and short-term basing structure (with facilities at multiple locations throughout the theater) could not provide suitable support for the complex platform. Finally, <span class="underline">Diego Garcia contains adequate military housing and shore facilities to conduct an in-theater crew swap while the submarine undergoes a three-week refit between missions. That significantly enhances the amount of time that a given SSGN can remain deployed to the Indian Ocean. </span><br />

SSGNs </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the &quot;Strike/SOF&quot; configurations (with 66 SOF personnel and as many as 140 TLAMs) </span><span class="underline">could operate covertly in close proximity to an enemy coast to perform multiple surveillance and intelligence-gathering missions for 90 days or more. Such a SOF campaign capability would provide the Commander Joint Task Force (CJTF) an improved picture of the enemy's activities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In its &quot;Maximum Strike&quot; configuration with 1</span><span class="underline">54 TLAM missiles, a single SSGN provides striking power almost equal to the 120 to 180 TLAM s normally carried by all the ships in the typical carrier battle group</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (CVBG) deployed to the Arabian Gulf. I</span><span class="underline">n crisis and transition to war, when air dominance and surface superiority are not assured, an SSGN can serve as a stealthy strike platform that could operate independently in denied areas, no matter who dominates the air or surface battle space. Additionally, during crises, the covert nature of the SSGN will provide the National Command Authorities and the CINC a non-provocative presence option without sacrificing striking power</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. With the SSGN, the CJTF gains a platform that will complement and leverage the rest of the force. </span><span class="underline">The SSGN can thus be used as a: Joint Enabler - facilitating combat operations that permit earlier introduction of other forces into the theater.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Its ability to suppress an enemy air defense campaign from positions near the enemy coast will allow less stealthy assets (e.g., tactical air) to be deployed sooner. SOF and Strike Platform - combining a unique SOF campaign capability with an ample load-out of land-attack missiles in a self-sustaining platform that could deploy to an assigned station rapidly and remain there covertly for long periods with very low risk. SOF and the ASDS could also be used to extend the SSGN intelligence/surveillance horizon and increase the range of strike options. The SSGN does not require an escort or other assets to provide force protection because of its inherent stealth, nor does it create in-theater logistics requirements. Non-Provocative Intelligence-Collector - providing surveillance and indications and warning (I&amp;W) against enemy naval and land-based threats. A</span></span><span class="underline"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Black',Gadget,sans-serif;"> Powerful Deterrent - combining large-scale firepower, on-station time, and stealth to increase the spectrum of deterrent options. The presence, implied or actual, of the aggregate firepower of one or more SSGNs could well be sufficient to deter hostile actions by a potential adversary</span>. </span></span><br />

 No space race now – China’s space program not developed enough<br />
Global Times, 10-13-10 [accessed 6-27-11, China has no desire for new space race, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:817:http://opinion.globaltimes.cn/commentary/2010-10/581744.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://opinion.globaltimes.cn/commentary/2010-10/581744.html" rel="nofollow">http://opinion.globaltimes.cn/commentary/2010-10/581744.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:817 -->]<br />
In the 21st century, the eyes of the world are turning to space again. New programs to explore space's resources are being launched in many countries, including China. Is there a new space race? Why are so many countries keen on lunar exploration? What benefits can the quest for space bring? Global Times reporter Yu Jincui (GT) talked to Ouyang Ziyuan (Ouyang), a senior consultant at China's lunar exploration program, on these issues. GT: Why did China initiate its lunar exploration program? What influence will the program have on China's devel-opment? Ouyang: Strictly speaking, China is a developing country. Some people argue that rather than explore the moon, we should concentrate on dealing with problems on Earth. It is understandable. However, from a broader development perspective, we should not only be engaged in lunar exploration, but also step up our pace. The lunar exploration program covers many high-tech fields. It is very scientifically demanding, which stimulates the technological upgrades and innovations. Lunar exploration is a threshold for exploring deep space and remote space, and it could provide the basic experience for eventually exploring other planets. There are unimaginable abundant natural resources on the moon, such as rare earths, or uranium and titanium ores. The titanium ore reserve on the moon is the same size as the whole of China. Although we are not able to exploit these resources due to the extremely high cost and technological limitations, as scientists, we have the responsibility to prove the existence of these resources and inform the people. The moon has a very huge energy reserve. Japanese scientists recently came up with a design idea that if humanity could build a moon belt for solar power generation and transmitting energy back to the earth, human energy needs could be permanently satisfied. Since the 1990s, a total of nine lunar probes have been launched into space, two from China (including the newly launched Chang'e-2 satellite), three from the US, one from Europe, two from Japan, and one from India. The world is witnessing the climax of the second round of lunar exploration. All the countries involved are expecting to discover more comprehensive and concrete knowledge about the moon. If China doesn't explore the moon, we will have no say in international lunar exploration and can't safeguard our proper rights and interests. The contribution of the Apollo project of the US is amazing. According to one calculation, the input-output ratio is 1:14. It drove the development of high-tech worldwide and made the US a leader in the high-tech field for almost 20 years. China's lunar exploration program is nowhere near as big as Apollo project in size, but it could also make great contributions in promoting technological improvements, scientific progress and talents cultivation. China should not stay in the cradle of the Earth forever. The Chinese people should make contributions to the human development in the field of space exploration. GT: Is there a new space race? Ouyang: I am strongly against seeing lunar exploration as a race. The second round of lunar exploration is quite different from the first one conducted by the US and the former Soviet Union, which was a struggle for hegemony in space. Every competent country will certainly take part in space exploration out of self-development and for technological and scientific progress. These countries are working together to contribute to the sum of human knowledge and development. Those who highlight China's alleged ambitions for control may have different agendas and motivations. GT: How is China's space program by international standards? Ouyang: Different countries have different advantages and disadvantages. Japan has better equipment and India has the advantage over China in computer software. In the final round of a marathon, several groups form. We could use this analogy to describe the current situation in the field of lunar exploration. The US and Russia belong to the leading group with the strongest strength. Although China is the only other country to have performed a spacewalk, we still lag far behind these two countries. The second group refers to those that have launched lunar probes, such as India, Europe, and Japan. That's where China is. Of course, there is a third group covering all the countries that are preparing to get involved in the field. Out of the needs for their own national development, more countries are expected to join the team in the future.<br />

All space technology would be perceived as a threat to China – dual-use technology<br />
Shixiu 2007 - senior fellow of military theory studies and international relations at the Institute for Military Thought Studies, Academy of Military Sciences of the PLA [Bao, Winter 2007, China Security, “Emerging Threat,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:818:http://www.wsichina.org/cs5_1.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wsichina.org/cs5_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsichina.org/cs5_1.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:818 -->, accessed June 21, 2011]<br />
The U.S. position makes another faulty assumption that national space programs and space assets can be effectively dissected into commercial and civilian uses versus military uses and capabilities. This is out of tune with technological developments and military inevitabilities. China’s space program is not transparent in many respects, but neither is that of the United States. The reality is that many space technologies are inherently dual-use and it is therefore very difficult to distinguish sufficiently and effectively the intentions and capabilities in space. Without some kind of mutual understanding on controlling arms in space, suspicion will dominate relations between China and the United States.<br />

US space weaponization will lead to additional Chinese ASAT and nuclear weapons<br />
Blazejewski, 2008 – JD/MPA degree in NYU School of Law, previous work in American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton LLP, and the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee.

First, if the United States proceeds with space weaponization China will respond by bolstering its own military capabilities. China’s response will seek to preserve the asymmetric threat it poses to US space assets and maintain its nuclear deterrent. Under each of the interpretations considered, China is not willing to allow the United States to build up its space weapons program unchallenged. In the least, China would develop additional ASAT weapons to which the United States would seek to develop effective countermeasures. Alternatively or in addition, China could invest in more ICBMs and nuclear warheads acquiring the capacity to overwhelm a BMD shield. An option less likely in the near future, China could counter US space weaponization by deploying its own space weapons. Other potential Chinese responses include adopting a “launch on warning” policy or abandoning its no-first-use pledge. Each of these strategies would seek to counter the effectiveness of US space weapons. The United States, of course, could always respond to China’s response, but such tit-for-tat policy making risks devolving into an arms race. Chinese officials claim that an arms race would “likely emerge” unless a negotiated solution can be reached on PAROS. It is noteworthy, however, that under at least two interpretations, this is not China’s preferred outcome. Under the first and second interpretations, China will only proceed with further developing ASAT technology and acquiring additional weapons if it cannot be assured that the United States does not plan to weaponize outer space.<br />
