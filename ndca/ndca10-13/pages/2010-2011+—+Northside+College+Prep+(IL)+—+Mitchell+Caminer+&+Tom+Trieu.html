<strong>U.S. military expansionism, international bases, global security policies, is mere euphemism for colonial exploitation. Our attempt to secure the world, isolate and eliminate chaos, protect the innocent from the ruthless, are mere representational signifiers used to justify our interventionism on populations we desire to monitor, align with or against through democratization, or expand our imperial influence through coercive and exploitative economic relationships. As policy makers we have internalized our role as globocop-justified our calls to action based on realist international politics that position the U.S. as global sovereign. Even when these truth claims begin from a standpoint of criticizing failed U.S. policy, they sustain the securitizing logic which justifies global monitoring and interventionism. They maintain the empire by concealing critique with realist desires of peace, coercive diplomacy, and maintaining the possibility for interventionism. We refuse to become the status quo’s policy makers- we embrace this debate as a vehicle for critical reflection against the history of U.S. colonialism</strong><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Because of this fact, contemporary </span><span class="underline0">imperialism has had to drape itself in new ideological clothes; its defenders invade public debates speaking seemingly neutral languages of democracy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and human </span><span class="underline0">rights</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; of freedom and dignity; of </span><span class="underline0">inclusiveness</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and respect for difference; of gender </span><span class="underline0">equality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the alleviation of poverty; of good governance </span><span class="underline0">and sustainable development</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Alongside these decidedly modernist tropes, </span><span class="underline0">others have appealed to</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the timeless verities of human nature or </span><span class="underline0">culture to justify the inevitability of war and empire.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Still others have touted the supposedly beneficent legacy of older imperialisms. Such juxtapositions are in keeping with “a deep and perplexing doubleness” of the new imperialism: a primal military atavism reminiscent of older forms of empire combined with the “spectacular” deployment of up-to-the-minute technologies of mass deception and distraction.4 Taken as a whole, the </span><span class="underline0">new ideologies of empire express the same contradictory combination of</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the retrogressive and the modern: of civilizational clashes and democratic ideals; of virulent </span><span class="underline0">racism and postmodern multiculturalism</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; of gender equality and religious oppression; </span><span class="underline0">of old-fashioned propaganda and newfangled forms of “soft power</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”; of torture and human rights. Against this backdrop, it </span><span class="underline0">would be easy to lose sight of the difference between ideologies and lies.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> However, ideologies are different from lies even if they are sometimes (as in the case of Iraq) bolstered by lies. For ideologies to work, they must speak to some genuine longing on the part of those who believe in them, however distorted these desires have become by the realities of exploitation and domination. Hence the talk of democracy and freedom. But, </span><span class="underline0">like lies, ideologies often involve a good deal of self-delusion</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on the part of those who traffic in them – how else to explain the debacle of post-invasion Iraq? The systematic character of imperial self-delusion is perhaps best captured in U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld’s tortured explication of military ignorance: As we know, there are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns. That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also the unknown unknowns, the ones we don’t know we don’t know.5 As Slavoj Zizek observes, the one category that Rumsfeld failed to mention were the “unknown knowns”: </span><span class="underline0">beliefs or practices</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – like the horrors of Abu Ghraib – </span><span class="underline0">which must be quickly repressed since their knowledge is too much for consciousness to bear.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Zizek contends </span><span class="underline0">that the real danger for the American empire lies</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not in the threats which lie undiscovered, but “</span><span class="underline0">in the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> disavowed </span><span class="underline0">beliefs</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, suppositions and obscene practices </span><span class="underline0">we pretend not to know about</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”6 Be that as it may, </span><span class="underline0">a good deal of conscious effort has been expended to justify and normalize the “new imperialism.” Policymakers mask their neo-imperial agendas under the guise of realist conceptions of threats and international chaos. These representational signifiers often reproduce coincidentally imperialist interventionism that wage military warfare against, black, brown, and oriental bodies, in the name of their own welfare. And although these threats are sometimes commonly known to be false, we subconsciously accept them as truth to enjoy the promise of security and stability. Even when these dangers are not calculable we sit back while the state panoptically monitors and voyeuristically travels the globe in hopes of finding new borders on which we can establishes bases which often represent the beginnings of new political and economic control.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is a mark of the times in which we live that </span><span class="underline0">the discourse of empire and imperialism</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – not so long ago considered an antique preoccupation of the Left – </span><span class="underline0">has been embraced</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by mainstream intellectuals from across the political spectrum. But, before examining these apologias in detail in the essays that follow, we need to ask: what has prompted this sudden desire to reclaim the language of empire? What changes in the global balance of forces can change this ideological shift? </span><strong><u>We must reformulate international relations theory and hegemonic security philosophy by drafting a new discursive project aimed at historically analyzing the material conditions which have produced and sustained the U.S. as a global imperial entity. We must invade public debates and academic spaces where bodies of knowledge are normatively produced in ways that exclude marginal voices and counter-hegemonic narratives of U.S. colonialism. We must embrace antagonism as a legitimate political strategy armed with the possibility of producing genuine public policies aimed at resolving the residuals of colonial domination; for policies that fail to center the history of colonialism will ultimately be unsuccessful as the empire intensifies its imperial rule when it convinces the masses to forget. I understand fully that a complete re-intellectualization of international relations theory is a daunting task, but unless we commit to transitioning away from dominate realist/imperialist security logic, we wont be able to de-legitimate the normative foundations of imperialism that justify conquest and domination.</u></strong> </span><br />

<strong>We begin our critical reflection on U.S. imperialism by analyzing its current role in Okinawa. U.S. presence in Okinawa is justified under the auspices of U.S. Japan Security arrangements; this device has instrumented violence against Okinawans, subjected them to environ-pollution, and pushed them to the brink of statelessness. This manifestation not only displays the consequences of our imperial interests but also the diverse ways in which we extend colonialism.</strong><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Gavan McCormack describes Okinawa as ‘Japan’s virtual colony’; ‘a dual colony in effect to the U.S. and Japan, a status unchanged in thirty years since reversion’ (McCormack, 2003: 93). <span class="DebateUnderline"><u><span style="color: white;">Okinawa</span></u><u>, which has 0.6% of Japan’s total landmass, houses 75% of the acreage of American bases. Thirty-eight military facilities cover 20% of Okinawa Island</u></span><u>.</u> Not only does Okinawa bear the overwhelming majority of U.S. military bases within Japan, but <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>the bases are of a different type to the rest of Japan. Nearly all</u></span> of the U.S. military bases <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>on the mainland are for ‘administration, communications, transport, logistics support, repairs and recreation</u></span> (Gabe, 2003: 63), <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>while the bases in Okinawa are for marines and special-forces. The effects are different</u></span>, too. As Gabe states, ‘<span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Because</u></span> [end page 96] <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>these forces are next to 1.3 million residences, accidents and incidents are bound to occur’</u></span> (Gabe: 2003, 64). <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Accidents, ‘incidents’ (a euphemism used officially for crimes, such as rape</u></span><u>)</u> and examples of environmental pollution abound in Okinawa. Eight areas within the islands are sites for conducting live ammunition exercises. On Torishima, an unpopulated island, <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>U.S. soldiers mistakenly used depleted uranium bullets in 1995. Washington did not notify Tokyo of the accident until a year later and then the central government failed to inform the prefectural government and public of Okinawa until a month after that</u></span><u>; ‘</u> This reveals how marginalized Okinawa is by both the U.S. and the Japanese governments</span>’ (Asato, 2003: 233). However, the rape of a twelve-year-old girl by three U.S. servicemen in 1995 could not be covered up or ignored and created a surge of anger and resentment resulting in the largest mass demonstration in Okinawan history. The 1996 U.S. – Japan agreement to close Futenma airbase in the middle of the heavily-populated Ginowan City and relocate to the sparsely-populated Henoko area was a direct consequence of the protests. But the ‘incidents’ do not go away. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>In</u></span> August <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>2004, a</u></span> U.S. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Marine</u></span> Corps CH-53D heavy-lift <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>helicopter crashed into Okinawa International University injuring the three crew members, an accident that received little press coverage nationally</u></span> (Simpson, 2004) <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>leading to ‘allegations that editorial decisions ... reflected a view that events in faraway Okinawa were of little importance to the nation as a whole’</u></span> (Simpson, 1995). How is <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>this vastly unfair situation</u></span>, a state of affairs that <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>would not be tolerated on the mainland</u></span>, maintained? <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Politically,</u> <u>Okinawa has little voice and economically Okinawa has become both victim to and dependent on a base- construction economy</u> <u>that is difficult to give up or be weaned from. Of the 452 members of the Japanese Diet only five represent Okinawa. A</u></span> NIMP (<span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Not In My Prefecture</u></span><u>)</u> attitude prevails. Since other prefectures are unwilling to have U.S. bases in their own areas, and since it is accepted that if the military bases were not in Okinawa they would have to be relocated somewhere else in Japan, any<span class="DebateUnderline"> <u>Okinawan formal protests are ignored or overruled. To question the ‘need’ for American bases in Okinawa would be to question the entire framework of Japanese defence policy, and whenever there is criticism of such a policy the government takes out the trump card of ‘national security’</u></span><u>.</u> [end page 97] Okinawa is, of course, more than the sum of its military bases. The U.S. bases have had a profound and prolonged effect on the economy – during the U.S. occupation Okinawa was ‘in effect a provider of support services for U.S. bases’ (Hein &amp; Selden, 2003: 6) – but this direct dependence on the bases in terms of finding employment and providing services has decreased markedly. Base-related revenue has dropped from 25.6% of the local Gross Domestic Product in 1970 to 5.7% in 1996 (Hook &amp; Siddle, 2003: 5), while employment on the U.S. bases decreased from 40,000 to 8,000 over the same time period (McCormack, 2003: 93). The principal effect of the U.S. bases on Okinawa today is through the rental payments given to local landowners for the lease of their land. In contrast to the mainland where U.S. bases had usually been built on land previously owned by the government, in Okinawa 33% of the land occupied by U.S. military is privately-owned (Tanji, 2003: 169). For McCormack the lease of landowners’ land ‘fosters a passive culture of rental dependence, which blocks locally generated initiatives towards self-reliant, non-military dependent development’ (McCormack, 2003: 94). Opposition to the appropriation and lease of local land has been an expression of protest against the prevailing conceptions of development and security. The post- war confiscation of private land by ‘bulldozers and bayonets’ was a source of great local bitterness (Tanji, 2003: 169). The strength of feeling was exacerbated rather than alleviated by the eventual U.S. offer of small lump-sum payments to landowners. Following island-wide protests in 1956, the islanders finally got the right to annual rentals in return for their ‘agreement’ to the land leases (Tanji, 2003: 169). After the reversion of Okinawa to Japan in 1972 the U.S. bases remained and the rental payments continued, this time from the Japanese government at a rate six times that of previously (Tanji, 2003: 169). As an anti-war pro-Okinawa protest a minority of landowners refused to sign leases for their property, the numbers rising to 3,000 as a result of the 1982 hitotsuba (1 tsubo = 3.3 square metres) movement (Tanji, 2003: 170). Nonetheless, 30,000 landowners agree to their land being leased by the U.S. military. Although relatively few in number, the anti-military landowners’ struggle has been played out most importantly in the law courts whereb, unsuccessfully, they tried to prove that the compulsory use of non-contract landowners’ private property by the U.S. military was unconstitutional (Tanji, [end page 98] 2003: 171; George-Mulgan, 2000). In 1995, Okinawa governor Masahide Ota refused to sign on behalf of those landowners who objected to the renewal of their land leases. Ota was sued by the Japanese government, and the Supreme Court ruled against Ota. In 1999, the U.S. Military Special Measures Law was amended by the Japanese government to make it the Prime Minister’s responsibility to sign on behalf of landowners and to avoid Okinawan rebellion in the future (Tanji, 2003: 171<u>).</u> In the formal political realm – the courts, committees and legislative – the Japanese state has repeatedly manipulated the system to maintain the status quo; ‘The primary requirements of the U.S. – Japan Mutual Security Treaty<u>,</u> that U.S. troops be stationed in Japan, <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>has constantly taken precedence over the constitutional rights of Okinawa citizens’</u></span> (Tanji, 2003: 172). Though the legal battle ultimately failed, the Prefectural Land Expropriation Committee public hearings gave anti-war landowners a space to voice their harrowing experiences of the Battle of Okinawa and the subsequent occupation by the U.S. military, and their passionate commitment to the ideals of peace and democracy enshrined in the Japanese constitution (Tanji, 2003: 172). <u>Thus, it is the citizens of Japan who are struggling to protect the constitution against a central government which should protect it (and them) but instead rides roughshod over the rights and interests of its people in the name of protecting Japan’s ‘national security’ <strong>defined in military terms</strong> (Tanji, 2003: 172-3). Without legal protection, the people themselves are treated like refugees in their own country;</u> <strong><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext;">they are virtually stateless</span></u></strong> <u>since both the U.S. and Japan continue to redefine their existence based on what is best for national security</u><u><span style="text-underline: thick;">.</span></u> Next to the base economy, <span class="DebateUnderline">‘<u>development’ is the other sharp stake that keeps Okinawan dependence in place.

Furthermore, <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>the application of modern Japanese style development has resulted in the decimation of Okinawa’s important and fragile environment; ‘riverways, beaches and land have been bulldozed and concreted</u></span>.

<strong>And this is rooted in the very history of colonialism we criticize. Japan colonized Okinawa in 1879 and has treated the area as property to be sold and traded to meet its own security interest after losing World War 2.

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="DebateUnderline"><u>The reason for deployment</u></span> of US forces <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>in Okinawa</u></span> for the past 60 odd years <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>is Japanese-US security relations</u></span>, or alliance. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Policy-makers and commentators have explained the rationales for this alliance mostly from realist and neo-realist perspectives.</u> <u>Anarchical outlook and basic lack of trust prevail</u></span> in relevant discussions of the East Asian security environment. Balance of power and alliance politics are crucial means to survive in such an environment. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>In the post-war period, the Japan-US alliance has been justified in precisely these realist terms</u></span>. Realists consider that relations among states are naturally anarchical because there is no authority above states. Although it has long history reaching back to Hobbes or even Thucydides, this outlook became dominant in the aftermath of the Second World War as a critique of idealism and liberal institutionalism based on universal values (especially Carr 1946; Morgenthau 2005). Two world wars, a holocaust and nuclear warfare put an end to these dreams. Balance of power, especially military power, is considered a more reliable avenue for order in international relations. Given the anarchical character of the international [end page 3] system, individual states, should always behave in a way that maximises national interest defined in terms of securing safety and survival by increasing its relevant capabilities. According to realists, order-building should be the primary concern of diplomacy and foreign policy. Alliances and war preparation are among the most important instruments for states to achieve order in international relations that is inherently unstable. Neorealist theory radicalises the realist argument. It assumes a state’s behaviour to be structurally – and completely – determined by the anarchic international system. The state necessarily behaves so as to maximise its chance of survival. Imperatives within states are different. International politics, according to an influential neo-realist theorist Kenneth Waltz, needs to be considered separately from domestic politics. Affairs within the state related to society, history and even economics need to be understood in different structural constraints from those in international system (Waltz 1979: 79-80, 91-92, 100-101). Classical realism on the other hand, makes room for consideration of domestic affairs such as history, while neorealists are able to filter them out as ‘domestic affairs’. The neo-realist logic permits a more exclusive focus on power and maximizing of state safety; unconstrained by internal complications, especially where these might involve consideration of ethics and morality. For foreign policy-making, this neorealist thinking was particularly influential during the Cold War. In the <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Okinawan</u></span> context, US <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>bases have created dilemmas at historical, moral as well as economic levels</u></span>. The first military bases in Okinawa were those constructed by the Japanese military during World War II. They were lost to the Americans in the bloody Battle of Okinawa and extended in the course of the US occupation. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>The Okinawans</u> <u>lost</u></span> 160,000 or <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>one-third of their residents’ lives in the Battle of Okinawa. This experience is different from that of mainland Japanese experience of war</u></span> – reified in Nagasaki and Hiroshima – <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>because of Okinawa’s identity. For over four centuries</u></span>, from 1429 onwards, <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Okinawa was a sovereign</u> <u>nation</u></span> – the Ryukyu Kingdom – <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>until it was annexed by Japan</u></span> in 1<u>879,</u> only 70 years before WWII. During that time<span class="DebateUnderline">, <u>Okinawan citizens were subjected to discrimination and described as ‘backward’ second-class citizens</u></span>, who had to learn the Japanese language, and were pressured to assimilate. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Japanese military’s aggression towards the local residents</u> <u>during the Battle of Okinawa continues to be a source of conflict between the residents and the Japanese government</u></span> whose official position involves denial of all wrong doing.2 <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>It is important that</u></span></span><span class="DebateUnderline"> <u>today’s US military presence is understood as an extension of the history of Okinawa’s abuse and marginalization by Japan.</u> <u>The experience of war as a colonial appendage and</u></span><u>,</u> quite [end page 4] literally, <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>as a battlefield</u></span><u>,</u> gave rise to an absolute pacifism that constitutes what being ‘Okinawan’ means today. It also informs the collective identity of diverse anti-base social movements and energises their activism (Tanji 2006, Chapter 4). <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Continuing complicity in war by hosting US forces</u></span> – and the Japanese Self Defence Forces for that matter – thus <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>poses an acute moral dilemma for the</u> <u>Okinawans</u></span>. In addition to that, <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>the US military presence has contributed to Okinawa being the most impoverished, crowded, and polluted prefecture in Japan. Its economy continues to be dependent on the military presence in a variety of ways including the fostering of a large and abusive sex industry.</u> <u>Autonomous city planning is impossibly restricted by the space occupied by the US forces. Okinawa remains a service industry economy and servicing the bases is its main business. It is a “base economy”</u></span> and is reliant on direct revenues from the US military and, even more so, on Japanese government’s special budgets paid to the communities as compensation for hosting military bases. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>These historical, economic and moral complications</u></span>, however, <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>are not permitted to enter the sphere of foreign policy concern</u></span>. They are dealt with between elected local political representatives and the Japanese government officials. The negotiation between the central government and the local representatives in the margin are of course influenced by power imbalance between Tokyo and Okinawa. But <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>the opinions of Okinawan citizens that might, for cultural and moral reasons, be hostile to a continuing US presence and its projects of renewal</u></span> (e.g. the construction of Futenma Air Base) <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>are often manipulated at election time by economic insecurity and priorities</u></span> (Miyagi and Tanji 2007; Yoshikawa 2007). In any case, <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>issues are typically discussed and resolved domestically in this limiting way</u></span>. This does not mean that the US bases in Okinawa are irrelevant to Japan’s foreign policy. However, the established views prevent the issue from being brought together and debated in this way. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>The neo-realist perspective and the radical independence and priority it assigns to foreign policy making is helpful</u></span> here<u>.</u> Foreign policy about the survival of Japan and maintaining the security alliance with the US is priority not to be disturbed by less important domestic concerns. In order<span class="DebateUnderline"> <u>to maintain the status quo of the alliance, the government of Japan chooses to allow[s] the US forces to keep using the base facilities in Okinawa</u></span><u>.</u> Apart from that, Okinawa hosts 75% of all exclusively US facilities stationed in Japan. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>If Okinawa’s cultural sensibilities or priorities are sometimes ignored, and its democracy or economy are a little damaged in the process,</u> <u>then these are a small price to pay for a national security that cannot be compromised. Any way the proper place for these questions is away from the main game with a little money and media manipulation to ease the way</u></span>. This approach also has the further advantage of minimising the offense of a foreign military presence that might be [end page 5] experienced by Japanese nationals outside Okinawa (out of sight, out of mind), thus shielding the alliance from wider Japanese resentment. <br />

This is how it was in the period of imperialist struggles, which caused millions of deaths in two world wars and many other colonial wars. This is how it was in Stalinism, with the Gulag and in Nazism, with the holocaust. And now today, this is how it is in neoliberalism, with the collective sacrifice of the periphery and even the semiperiphery of the world system. With the war against Iraq</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">, <span class="Style1Char">it is fitting to ask whether what is in progress is a new genocidal and sacrificial illusion, and what its scope might be</span>. </span><span class="UNDERLINEChar0">It is above all appropriate to ask if the new illusion will not herald the radicalization and the ultimate perversion of the western illusion: destroying all of humanity in the illusion of saving it</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">.</span></span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Sacrificial genocide arises from a totalitarian illusion that is manifested in the belief that there are no alternatives to the present-day reality and that the problems and difficulties confronting it arise from failing to take its logic of development to its ultimate consequences. If there is unemployment, hunger and death in the Third World, this is not the result of market failures; instead, it is the outcome of the market laws not having been fully applied. If there is terrorism, this is not due to the violence of the conditions that generate it; it is due, rather, to the fact that total violence has not been employed to physically eradicate all terrorists and potential terrorists.This political logic is based on the supposition of total power and knowledge, and on the radical rejection of alternatives; it is ultra‑ conservative in that it aims to infinitely reproduce the status quo. Inherent to it is the notion of the end of history. </span></span><span class="UNDERLINEChar0">During the last hundred years, the West has experienced three versions of this logic</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">, <span class="Style1Char">and, therefore, seen three versions of the end of history:</span> </span><span class="UNDERLINEChar0">Stalinism</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">,</span></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> <span class="Style1Char">with its logic of insuperable efficiency of the plan;</span> </span><span class="UNDERLINEChar0">Nazism</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">, <span class="Style1Char">with its logic of racial superiority</span>; </span><span class="UNDERLINEChar0">and neoliberalism</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">, <span class="Style1Char">with its logic of insuperable efficiency of the market. </span></span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The first two periods involved the destruction of democracy. The last one trivializes democracy, disarming it in the face of social actors sufficiently powerful to be able to privatize the State and international institutions in their favour. I have described this situation as a combination of political democracy and social fascism. One current manifestation of this combination resides in the fact that intensely strong public opinion, worldwide, against the war is found to he incapable of halting the war machine set in motion by supposedly democratic rulers.</span></span> <span class="UNDERLINEChar0">At all these moments, a death drive, a catastrophic heroism, predominates, the idea of a looming collective suicide, only preventable by the massive destruction of the other.

<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">While bio politics in Foucault and Hardt and Negri addresses the relations between politics and death, bio politics in their views is less concerned with the primacy of death than with the production of life both as an individual and a social category. In Giorgio Agamben's formulation, <strong><u>the new bio-politics is the deadly administration of what he calls &quot;bare life,&quot; and its ultimate incarnation is the Holocaust with its ominous specter of the concentration camp. In this formulation, the</u></strong> Nazi death camps become the primary exemplar of control, the new space of contemporary politics in which <strong><u>individuals are no longer viewed as citizens but are now seen as inmates, stripped of everything, including their right to live. T</u></strong>he uniting of power and bare life, the reduction of the individual to homo sacer the sacred man who under certain states of exception &quot;may be killed and yet not sacrificed “no [End Page 179] longer represents the far end of political life (1998, 8). That is, in this updated version of the ancient category of homo sacer is the human who stands beyond the confines of both human and divine law&quot;a human who can be killed without fear of punishment&quot; (Bauman 2003, 133). According to Agamben, <strong><u>as modern states increasingly suspend their democratic structures, laws, and principles, the very nature of governance changes as &quot;the rule of law is routinely displaced by the state of exception, or emergency, and people are increasingly subject to extra-judicial state violence</u></strong>&quot; (Bull 2004, 3). The life unfit for life, unworthy of being lived, as the central category of homo sacer, is no longer marginal to sovereign power but is now central to its form of governance. State violence and totalitarian power, which, in the past, either were generally short-lived or existed on the fringe of politics and history, have now become the rule, rather than the exception, as <strong><u>life is more ruthlessly regulated and placed in the hands of military and state power.</u></strong></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">As discussed in this paper, <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>the Okinawan problem has been predominantly understood as a domestic political issue that stands apart from foreign policy and national/international security questions. This view has been supported and strengthened by the realist and neo- realist perspectives in international relations that have dominated the making and the understanding of alliance politics</u></span> in northeast Asia even after the Cold War. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>The insecurity of</u></span> [end page 11] <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Okinawan residents and abuse of their minority status and rights within Japan have thus been considered ‘outside the scope of analyses’ as far as the Japan-US security alliance is concerned</u></span><u>.</u> After the Cold War, <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>alternative international relations perspectives</u></span> expanded theoretical horizons. It became possible to <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>open national security issues up to questions of national history, identity and culture. Constructivism is useful in addressing the oversights of realist and</u></span> neo-realist, as well as <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>liberal institutionalist theory</u></span><u>.</u> Within these expanded horizons Okinawa becomes an opportunity for Japan to begin reconstructing its identity in the international realm as well as vis-à-vis the US as an ally. The absolute closure of Futenma</span> (i.e. without relocation within Okinawa) <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>is</u></span> also <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>a demand consistent with the international norms such as human security</u><u>, repudiation</u> <u>of militarism and gender violence, as well as arms reduction. Adhering to such norms would enable Japan to \transform its image among nations in northeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific. Taking a more assertive position would also create breathing space in its currently exclusive relations with the US. Japan would become a sovereign rather than a ‘client state’. This would certainly contribute positively towards the building of a multilateral security regime in the region that is not controlled by the dominant US interests</u></span><u>.</u> Historically speaking, Japan stands at a crossroad in a changing international landscape. Japan can choose a diplomatic path that either extends or begins to deviate from the basic trajectory established during the Cold War. It can remain a US client state<u>, a junior ally,</u> seeking to avoid offending the superior partner at any cost. This will involve a greater military contribution to the US global mission and Japan is on course to considerably upgrade (as well as legalise) its own military capability of overseas military offense. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>The opportunity costs of this course of action are high</u></span>. So, one might argue, are the costs of change: it might cost the US alliance. But is this a real fear? Today, alliance with Japan is clearly indispensable for the US too. Of all US allies, Japan is the most generous host nation. The 7th Pacific Fleet permanently stationed in Yokosuka is more important than any other overseas US facility. These factors alone make Japan one of the most important allies to the US. What does this mean? It means, finally, that <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>after the kicking and screaming, a Japanese refusal to allow the relocation of Futenma Air Base within Okinawa is unlikely to permanently damage the alliance with the US. This is not a credible excuse for the Japanese government not to be brave and grown up</u></span> either.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">‘The twentieth century has not been kind to Okinawa. In many ways its geography determined its fate’ (McCormack, 2003: 109) <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Okinawa’s situation</u></span> <u>or ‘problem’</u> is often explained away in terms of geography<u>. A curve of stepping-stones between larger neighbouring countries, Okinawa was fated to be dominated; or was it?</u> This argument downplays the active policy of the Japanese government in first expropriating, and then marginalizing Okinawa economically and politically</span><u>.</u> Okinawa is now considered a ‘war prefecture’ within a peace state <u>(Hook &amp; Siddle, 2003b: 243).</u> However, it was once a state at peace. As a united and independent kingdom that had chosen not to have a military force, the Ryukyu Islands were a centre for trade from the fifteenth century onwards<u>. ‘Given’ to the daimyo (lord) of Satsuma province from 1609 by the shogun (military leader) Tokugawa Ieyasu,</u> the Ryukyu kingdom retained a semi-independent status until its forced incorporation into the modern state of Japan in 1879 <u>8.</u> Representatives from the new prefecture of Okinawa requested that the islands should not be sites of military garrisons, but without success <u>(Kerr, 1958: 370). A strict top-down assimilation policy was introduced while the newly-named Okinawans debated the benefits and drawbacks of being ‘Japanese’ (Rabson, 1996). Although heavily taxed,</u> it took twenty-two years before the people of Okinawa were represented in the ‘democratic’ government of the state<u>.</u> After decades of Japanese rule, Okinawa was still perceived as marginal, backward and vulnerable because of questionable loyalties to the Japanese state<u>. Rabson describes it as a cruel irony that</u> in 1945 the Battle of Okinawa was thus seen ‘as an opportunity to prove, once and for all, their loyalty to Japan and full assimilation as Japanese’ <u>(Rabson, 1996).</u> Over 200,000 Okinawan people were killed in the Battle of Okinawa – a quarter of the population. Thousands died at the hands of Japanese soldiers, killed directly or indirectly through mass forced ‘suicides’ <u>(Hein &amp; Selden, 2003: 14).</u> The Battle of Okinawa has since been <u>[end page 95]</u> described as a reckless and unnecessary sacrifice of lives; ‘Okinawans died simply to put off the inevitable surrender just a little longer’ <u>(Hein &amp; Selden, 2003: 14). National security at this time did not cover the security of all Japan; ‘the wartime state was oppressor far more that it was protector of Okinawans’ (Hein &amp; Selden, 2003: 14).</u> The idea of Okinawa as ‘expendable’ to a callous central government<u>, a recurring theme in anti-Tokyo critiques,</u> had its foundations laid in the graves of Okinawa’s too many dead<u>. At the end of the Second World War, Okinawa could still not rely on the protection of its national government.</u> The U.S. took and retained control of Okinawa until its reversion to Japan in 1972<u>. At first Japan had little choice but to accept the situation, and later, in exchange for allowing U.S. bases on its territory (Tokyo had ‘residual sovereignty’ over Okinawa) it gained economic benefits including ‘preferential access to the American market’ while the U.S. would ‘tolerate [Japan’s] protectionism and mercantilism’ (Johnson, 2002).</u> Unfortunately for Okinawa it was deemed a strategic military post within Asia and so the U.S. policymakers insisted that they ‘must retain administrative control over most of the Ryukyu Islands which entailed forcible land seizures, denials of legal rights, and numerous inconveniences and indignities’ <u>(Rabson, 1996). Japanese writers have commented acidly that</u> while Okinawans lost their families, their land and their livelihoods, Tokyo did nothing<u>;</u> ‘<strong><u>Both the U.S. government and Japan have a colonial lineage of oppressive political, economic, and military practices over Okinawa, ranging from forced renaming of the area, to military expansionism., and racist sexual exploitation. Unfortunately, these histories are washed away by a realist security logic that separates “domestic” and international issues and prioritizes threat prevention over human rights. Confronting this securitization requires a remembering of colonial histories and a constructivist critique of knowledge production which exposes the political incentive to forget centuries of colonial take over. This issue is not only a Japan issue, as U.S. policymakers we have to remember our support of and complicity in Okinawa’s history of genocide and domination. We have an obligation to acknowledge and address our genocidal behaviors and militaristic agendas. We have an obligation to stand up in the face of ugly colonial past and refuse to let it live another day. Our ignorance to our own artifacts of colonialism will only become a self-fulfilling prophecy that reproduces the reliving of histories worst genocides.</u></strong><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Theory that does not</u> <u>investigate</u> <u>or even notice the</u> <u>omnipresence of militarism cannot represent</u> <u>or address the depth and specificity of the</u> <u>everyday effects of militarism on women</u><u>, on people living in occupied territories, on members of military institutions, and on the environment</u></span>. These effects are relevant to feminists in a number of ways because <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>m</u><u>ilitary practices and institutions help</u> <u>construct gendered and national identity, and because they justify</u> <u>the destruction of natural nonhuman entities</u> </span>and communities <span class="DebateUnderline"><strong><u>during</u></strong> <strong><u>peacetime</u></strong>  <u>Lack of attention to these aspects</u> </span><span class="apple-style-span">of</span> the business of making or preventing <span class="apple-style-span">military violence</span> in an extremely technologized world <span class="apple-style-span">results </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><u>in theory that cannot accommodate the connections among</u></span> the constant pres- ence of <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>militarism, declared wars, and</u> <u>other</u> <u>closely related social phenomena</u></span>, such as nationalistic glorifications of motherhood, media violence, and current ideological gravitations to military solutions for social problems. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>Ethical</u> <u>approaches that do not attend to the ways in which warfare and military practices are woven into the very fabric of life in twenty-first century technological states lead to crisis-based politics and analyses. For any feminism that aims to resist oppression and create alternative social and political options,</u> <u>crisis-based ethics and politics are</u> <u>problematic because they distract attention from the need for sustained resistance</u> <u>to the enmeshed, omnipresent systems of domination and oppression that so often function as givens in most people's lives. Neglecting the omnipresence of militarism</u> <u>allows the false belief that the absence of declared armed conflicts is peace,</u> <u>t</u></span>he polar opposite of war. It is particularly easy for those whose lives are shaped by the safety of privilege, and who do not regularly encounter the realities of militarism, to maintain this false belief<span class="apple-style-span">. </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><u>The belief that militarism is an ethical, political concern only regarding armed conflict, creates forms of resistance to militarism that are merely exercises in crisis control. Antiwar resistance is then mobilized when the &quot;real&quot; violence finally occurs, or when the stability of privilege is directly threatened, and at that point it is difficult not to respond in ways that make resisters drop all other political priorities. Crisis-driven attention to declarations of war might actually keep resisters complacent about and complicitous in the general presence of global militarism. Seeing war as necessarily embedded in constant military presence draws attention to the fact that horrific, state-sponsored violence is happening nearly all over, all of the time, and that it is perpetrated by military institutions and other militaristic agents of the state. Moving away from crisis-driven politics</u></span> and ontologies concerning war and military violence also <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>enables consideration of relationships among seemingly disparate phenomena, and therefore can shape more nuanced theoretical and practical forms of resistance.</u></span> <u>For example,</u> investigating the ways in which war is part of a presence allows consideration of the relationships among the events of war and</span> <u>the following:</u> how militarism is a foundational trope in the social and political imagination; how the pervasive presence and symbolism of soldiers/warriors/patriots shape meanings of gender; the ways in which threats of state-sponsored violence are a sometimes invisible/sometimes bold agent of racism, nationalism, and corporate interests<span class="DebateUnderline">;</span> the fact that vast numbers of communities, cities, and nations are currently in the midst of excruciatingly violent circumstances. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>It also provides a lens for considering the relationships among the various kinds of violence that get labeled &quot;war.</u></span><span class="apple-style-span">&quot;</span> Given current American obsessions with nationalism, guns, and militias, and growing hunger for the death penalty, prisons, and a more powerful police state, one cannot underestimate the need for philosophical and political attention to connec- tions among phenomena like the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; the &quot;war on crime,&quot; and other state-funded militaristic campaigns. I propose that the constancy of militarism and its effects on social reality be reintroduced as a crucial locus of contemporary feminist attentions, and that feminists emphasize how wars are eruptions and manifestations of omnipresent militarism that is a product and tool of multiply oppressive, corporate, tech- nocratic states.2 Feminists should be particularly interested in making <span class="apple-style-span">this shift</span> because it better allows consideration of the effects of war and militarism on women, subjugated peoples, and environments. While giving attention to the constancy of militarism in contemporary life we need not neglect the impor- tance of addressing the specific qualities of direct, large-scale, declared military conflicts. <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>But the dramatic nature of declared, large-scale conflicts should not obfuscate the ways in which military violence pervades most societies in increasingly technologically sophisticated ways</u></span> and the significance of mili- tary institutions and everyday practices in shaping reality. Philosophical <span class="DebateUnderline"><u>discussions that focus only on the ethics of declaring and fighting wars miss these connections, and also miss the ways in which even declared military conflicts are often experienced as omnipresent horrors.</u></span> These approaches also leave unquestioned tendencies to suspend or distort moral judgement in the face of what appears to be the inevitability of war and militarism <br />

 <strong><u>Thus, Mitchell and I demand, The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence in Japan by withdrawing all troops and closing all bases in Okinawa.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="tab-stops: 202.5pt;"><strong>We defend that military presence in Okinawa is bad and that withdrawal is better. We also defend the consequences of that withdrawal. However, our argument is that our justifications for withdrawing are just as important as the withdrawal itself. A congressman does not stand up and read a policy and neither should we. Our entire 1ac is a reason why the current normative practices of debates on international relations refuse to acknowledge critical epistemologies that challenge U.S. realism, and why such practices lead to flawed policy. Thus your framework of evaluation cannot view our withdrawal in a vacuum the role is to view our withdrawal through the lenses of our representations.</strong></span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Their framework arguments lay the foundational claims which allow imperial domination- epistemologically excluding certain forms of knowledge and advocacy, maintains the myth of neutrality and intellectual superiority which allows U.S. colonialism.

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In this context, it is important to note that </span><strong><u>we understand</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">a </span><strong><u>social theory as a</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">map or a </span><strong><u>guide to the social sphere</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In a research context, </span><strong><u>it</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">does not determine how we see the world but </span><strong><u>helps us devise</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">questions and </span><strong><u>strategies for exploring it</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u>A critical</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">social </span><strong><u>theory is concerned</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in particular </span><strong><u>with issues of power and justice and the ways</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">that the economy; matters of race, class, and gender; </span><strong><u>ideologies; discourses</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; education; religion </span><strong><u>and other</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">social </span><strong><u>institutions</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; and cultural dynamics </span><strong><u>interact to construct a social system</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Beck-Gernsheim, Butler, &amp; Puigvert, 2003; Flccha, Gomez, &amp; Puigvert, 2003). Thus, in this context we seek to provide a view of an evolving criticality or a reconceptualized critical theory. </span><span class="underline0">Critical theory is never static</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; it is always evolving, changing in light of both new theoretical insights and new problems and social circumstances. The list of concepts elucidating our articulation of critical theory indicates a criticality informed by a variety of discourses emerging after the work of the Frankfurt School Indeed, some of the theoretical discourses, while referring to themselves as critical, directly call into question some of the work of Horkheimer, Adorno, and Marcuse. Thus, diverse theoretical traditions have informed our understanding of criticality and have demanded understanding of diverse forms of oppression including class, race, gender, sexual, cultural, religious, colonial, and ability-related concerns. The evolving notion of criticality we present is informed by, while critiquing, the post-discourses—for example, postmodernism, poststructuralism, and postcolonialism. In this context, </span><strong><u>critical political</u></strong> <span class="underline0">theorists become detectives of new theoretical insights, perpetually searching for new and interconnected ways of understanding power and oppression and the ways they shape everyday life</span> <strong><u>and policy. In this context</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline0">criticality and the research it supports are always</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> evolving, always </span><span class="underline0">encountering new ways to irritate dominant forms of power, to provide more evocative and compelling insights.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Operating in this way, an evolving criticality is always vulnerable to exclusion from the domain of approved modes of research. </span><span class="underline0">The forms of social change it supports always position it in some places as an outsider, an awkward detective always interested in uncovering social structures, discourses, ideologies, and epistemologies that prop up both the status quo and a variety of forms of privilege. In the epistemological domain</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, white, male, class elitist, heterosexist</span><span class="underline0">, imperial, and colonial privilege often operates by asserting the power to claim objectivity and neutrality.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Indeed</span><span class="underline0">, the owners of such privilege often own the &quot;franchise&quot; on reason and rationality. Proponents of an evolving criticality possess a variety of tools to expose such oppressive power politics.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Such proponents assert that critical theory is well-served by drawing upon numerous liberatory discourses and including diverse groups of marginalized peoples and their allies in the nonhierarchical aggregation of critical analysts {Bello, 2003; Clark, 2002; Humphries, 1997). </span><span class="underline0">In the present era, emerging forms of neocolonialism and neo-imperialism in the United States move critical theorists to examine the wavs American power operates under the cover of establishing democracies all over the world. Advocates of an evolving criticality argue</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—as we do in more detail later in this chapter—</span><span class="underline0">that such neocolonial power must be exposed so it can be opposed in the United States and around the world. The American Empires justification in the name of freedom for undermining democratically elected governments</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from Iran (Kincheloe, 2004), Chile, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to Liberia (</span><span class="underline0">when its real purpose is to acquire geopolitical advantage for future military assaults, economic leverage in international markets, and access to natural resources) must be exposed by critical-ists for what it is—a rank imperialist sham</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (McLaren, 2003a, 2003b; McLaren &amp; Jaramillo, 2002; McLaren &amp; Martin, 2003). </span><span class="underline0">Critical researchers need to view their work in the context of living and working in a nation-state with the most powerful military-industrial complex in history</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that is shamefully using the terrorist attacks of September 11 to advance a ruthless imperialist agenda fueled by capitalist accumulation by means of the rule of force (McLaren &amp; Farahmandpur,2003). Chomsky (2003), for instance, has accused the U.S. government of the &quot;supreme crime&quot; of preventive war (in the case of its invasion of Iraq, the use of military force to destroy an invented or imagined threat) of the type that was condemned at Kuremburg. Others, like historian Arthur Schlesinger (cited in Chomsky, 2003), have likened the invasion of Iraq to Japan's &quot;day of infamy'' that is, to the policy that imperial Japan employed at the time of Pearl Harbor. David G. Smith (2003) argues </span><span class="underline0">that such imperial dynamics are supported by particular epistemological forms. The United States is an epistemological empire based on a notion of truth that undermines the knowledges produced by those outside the good graces and benevolent authority of the empire.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Thus, in the 21 st century, </span><span class="underline0">critical theoristsmust develop sophisticated ways to address not only the brute material relations of class rule linked to the mode and relations of capitalist production and imperialist conquest (whether through direct military intervention or indirectly through the creation of client states) but also the epistemological violence that helps discipline the world Smith refers to this violence as a form of &quot;information warfare&quot; that spreads deliberate falsehoods</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> about countries such as Iraq and Iran. </span><span class="underline0">U.S. corporate and governmental agents become more sophisticated in the use of such episto-weaponry with every day that passes.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Obviously, </span><span class="underline0">an evolving criticality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> does not promiscuously choose theoretical discourses to add to the bricolage of critical theories. It </span><span class="underline0">is highly suspicious</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—as we detail later—</span><span class="underline0">of theories that fail to understand the malevolent workings of power, that fail to critique the blinders of Eurocentrism, that cultivate an elitism of insiders and outsiders, and that fail to discern a global system of inequity supported by diverse forms of ideology and violence. It is uninterested in any theory</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—no matter how fashionable—</span><span class="underline0">that does not directly address the needs of victims of oppression and the suffering they must endure.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The following is an elastic, ever-evolving set of concepts included in our evolving notion of criticality. With theoretical innovations and shifting Zeitgeists, they evolve. The points that are deemed most important in one time period pale in relation to different points in a new era. &lt;P306-307&gt;</span></span><br />

<span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">Coherent arguments</span></span> <span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">are unlikely to take place unless</span></span><span style="color: black;"> and until </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">actors,</span></span><span style="color: black;"> at least on some level, </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">agree on what they are arguing about</span></span><span style="color: black;">. The at least temporary </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">resolution of meta-arguments- regarding</span></span><span style="color: black;"> the nature of the good (the content of </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">prescriptive norms);</span></span><span style="color: black;"> what is out there, </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">the way we know the world,</span></span><span style="color: black;"> how we decide between competing beliefs (</span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">ontology and epistemology); and</span></span><span style="color: black;"> the nature of the situation at hand( </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">the proper frame or representation)- </span></span><span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">must occur before specific arguments that could lead to decision and action may take place.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> Meta-arguments over epistemology and ontology, relatively rare, occur in instances where there is a fundamental clash between belief systems and not simply a debate within a belief system. Such </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">arguments over the nature of the world and how we come to know it are </span></span><span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">particularly rare in politics</span></span><span style="color: black;"> though they are more frequent in religion and science. Meta-arguments over the “good” are contests over what it is good and right to do, and even how we know the good and the right. They are about the nature of the good, specifically, defining the qualities of “good” so that we know good when we see it and do it. Ethical arguments are about how to do good in a particular situation. </span><span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">More common</span></span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;"> are meta-arguments over representations</span></span><span style="color: black;"> or frames- </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">about how we out to understand a particular situation.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> Sometimes actors agree on how they see a situation. More often there are different possible interpretations. Thomas Homer-Dixon and Roger karapin suggest, </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">“Argument and debate occur when people try to gain acceptance for their interpretation of the world”.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> For example, “is the war defensive or aggressive?”. </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">Defining and controlling representations and images</span></span><span style="color: black;">, or the frame, </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">affects whether one thinks there is an issue at stake and </span></span><span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">whether a particular argument applies</span></span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;"> to the case</span></span><span style="color: black;">. An actor fighting a defensive war is within international law; an aggressor may legitimately be subject to sanctions. Framing and reframing involve mimesis or putting forward representations of what is going on. In mimetic meta-arguments, </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">actors</span></span><span style="color: black;"> who are struggling to characterize or </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">frame the situation accomplish their ends by drawing vivid pictures of the “reality” through </span></span><span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">exaggeration</span></span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">, analogy, or differentiation</span></span><span style="color: black;">. </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">Representations of a situation </span></span><span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">do not re-produce accurately</span></span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;"> so much as they </span></span><span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">creatively re-present</span></span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;"> situations in a way that makes sense</span></span><span style="color: black;">. “mimesis is a metaphoric or ‘iconic argumentation of the real.’ </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">Imitating not the effectivity of events but their logical structure and meaning</span></span><span style="color: black;">.” </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">Certain features are emphasized and others de-emphasized </span></span><span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">or completely ignored</span></span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;"> as their situation is</span></span><span style="color: black;"> recharacterized or </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">reframed</span></span><span style="color: black;">. </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">Representation</span></span><span style="color: black;"> thus </span><span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">becomes a “constraint on reasoning in that it limits understanding to a specific organization of conceptual knowledge</span></span><span style="color: black;">.” </span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">The dominant representation delimits which arguments will be considered legitimate, framing how actors see possibities</span></span><span style="color: black;">. As Roxanne Doty argues, “</span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">the possibility of practices presupposes the ability of an agent to imagine certain courses of action</span></span><span style="color: black;">. Certain background meanings, kinds of social actors and relationships, must already be in place.” If, as Donald Sylvan and Stuart Thorson argue, “</span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;">politics involves the selective privileging of representations, “it </span></span><span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">may not matter whether one representation or another is true or not</span></span><span style="color: black;">.</span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;"> <strong>Emphasizing whether frames articulate accurate or inaccurate perceptions misses the rhetorical import</strong> of representation- how frames affect what is seen or not seen, and subsequent choices. </span></span><span class="Debate-EmphasizedText-F5Char"><span style="color: black;">Meta-arguments over representation are thus crucial elements of political argument</span></span><span class="Debate-CardTextUnderlined-F3Char"><span style="color: black;"> because an actor’s arguments about what to do will be more persuasive if their characterization or framing of the situation holds sway</span></span><span style="color: black;">. But, as Rodger Payne suggests, “No frame is an omnipotent persuasive tool that can be decisively wielded by norm entrepreneurs without serious political wrangling.” Hence framing is a meta-argument. </span><br />

<strong>The concept of security is a social construct. Claims of war and conflict create a false dichotomy between the evil “them” and the good “us” ignoring our role in provoking the aggression. The social context of realist security discourse outweighs affirmative advantage claims.</strong><br />
