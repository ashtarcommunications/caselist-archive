Be like the forces of nature: when it blows, there is only wind; when it rains, there is only rain; when the clouds pass, the sun shines through. If you open yourself to the Tao, you are at one with the Tao and you can embody it completely. If you open yourself to insight, you are at one with insight and you can use it completely. If you open yourself to loss, you are at one with loss and you can accept it completely.<span class="UnderlinedF9Char"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> Open yourself to the Tao</span></span>, then trust your natural responses; <span class="UnderlinedF9Char"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">and everything will fall into place</span></span>. (Chapter 23) The word "open" is repeated often in this poem. Most people think the only way to handle suffering is to withdraw and to close yourself. The poet is clearly saying in this poem that the opposite is true: <span class="UnderlinedF9Char"><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">If you open yourself to loss</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">, you are at one with loss and <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">you can accept it completely. This</span> openness, a willingness and <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">courage to face reality, is the only way to deal with</span> suffering, particularly <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">inescapable suffering</span></span></span>. But the openness the poet is describing is more than just facing reality. It is facing reality in total harmony with the Tao: If you open yourself to the Tao, you are at one with the Tao and you can embody it completely. It is only when you "embody" the Tao that you can face suffering with true equanimity. You will then have the openness that insight into your own nature and the natural way of Tao brings you. The right approach to suffering is only possible when you have reduced your ego to a minimum. The less ego you have, the less you suffer. <span class="UnderlinedF9Char"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Facing death with unresolved agendas is a terrible form of suffering.</span></span> You will have to let go of selfish interests and futile aims to concentrate on dealing with the moment<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">. </span><span class="UnderlinedF9Char"><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">It is the acceptance of the inevitable that makes suffering bearable</span></span><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">.</span> On his death bed, his family mourning, he is serene, for he knows Death, like Life, is an illusion: there is no beginning and no end. There is only the endless flow of Tao. The man of Tao has no fear, for he walks with Tao. (The Tao is Tao, 154) Agendas A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving. (Chapter 27) <span class="UnderlinedF9Char"><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">Plans</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">, aims, objectives and agendas <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">have become the routes of suffering</span></span></span> for so many people, and not only the ambitious. <span class="UnderlinedF9Char"><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">Agendas</span></span> often <span class="UnderlinedF9Char"><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">take</span></span> spontaneity and <span class="UnderlinedF9Char"><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">joy out of life</span></span><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">.</span> In the process, many people have become bad travelers, concentrating only on their objectives, and arriving at their destinations only to find that even their destinations are not really worth the trouble. Having no fixed plans? This does not sound like survival in a modern technological environment, does it? I mean, who but the extremely fortunate have the luxury of not having agendas running their lives? In most cases, one could justifiably point out, agendas are forced on you by your professional and familial obligations. You do not really have a choice, do you? How could one then become a good traveler through life in this modern world? I think the key lies in the second line of the quotation. One should not be "intent upon arriving". You should adopt an attitude of detachment. The moment your aims become egocentric, your suffering increases. The less your own ego is involved, the less seriously you will take life, and the more you will enjoy the journey. It is easier said than done, though, particularly when the job you are doing seems to be devoid of meaning, and the activities on your agenda tedious. They might even go against what you truly believe. It is clear. To become a good traveler in the modern world often entails more than just a change of attitude. It could also mean changing your life style, even your profession. It could mean taking risks in the process. But liberation has always been a risky undertaking, hasn’t it? People are willing to take risks for the most mundane things like profit and possession. Why not take a few risks when your spiritual progress is at stake? Truly good travelers often leave the beaten track and become masters of their own far more adventurous journeys. Tampering with the world Do you want to improve the world? I don't think it can be done. The world is sacred. It can't be improved. If you tamper with it, you'll ruin it. If you treat it like an object, you'll lose it. (Chapter 29) If anything, the Twentieth Century will be called the century of social engineering. Simplistic <span class="UnderlinedF9Char"><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">ideologies, like fascism, were used to try to change the world, with terrible consequences</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 11pt;"> inducing suffering on a scale never seen before </span></span>in the history of the human being.

It is the age of management, that euphemistic word for manipulating society. It is still happening. <span class="UnderlinedF9Char"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">What else are many political programs but tampering with the sacred and ruining it in the process? </span></span>It is the source of endless suffering. Forcing issues Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men doesn't try to force issues or defeat enemies by force of arms. For every force there is a counterforce. Violence, even well intentioned, always rebounds upon oneself. The Master does his job and then stops. He understands that the universe is forever out of control, and that trying to dominate events goes against the current of the Tao. (Chapter 30) Understanding that the universe is out of control is the key to wisdom and patience. No amount of tampering with the universe will change this. In fact, the more we tamper with it, the more damage we will do.//</span>

If, so to speak, </span>__planet Earth__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> is </span>__drifting__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> precariously </span>__in__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> the </span>__direction of__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">presumable</span> __disaster__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, what would be the action that Chuang Chou and his contemporaries would have us take? In other words, </span>__would__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> "</span>__Taoism__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">," in that sense, </span>__provide a solution__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> to the apparent moral dilemma that faces our planet in our own day and age, and if so, what form might that solution take? As some of the other presenters gathered here seem already to have suggested, it is commonly believed by some hopeful minds that Taoism provides a pretty solution to the presumed problems of the planet. But more careful thought suggests that Taoism might not offer happy solutions to the problems of the modern world. What if, for instance, the issue in the foregoing example was not a human baby floating in a river, but rather the species of the whooping crane, its continuance threatened by the encroachment of human civilization. If Chuang Chou were sitting by watching earth's species threatened with extinction, what would he really do, and why? </span>__The answer__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, I fear, </span>__is not certain to fill__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> our </span>__hearts with__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> sanguine </span>__certainty__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> of the future of the cranes, or with sanguine happiness that Chuang Chou shares our desire to preserve them. In fact<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">, </span></span>__<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">the only logical answer</span> to this latter-day challenge__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> to Taoist values </span>__<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">would</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> seem to </span>__<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">be</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> that Chuang Chou would, as it were, </span>__<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">watch the</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> whooping cranes float down the river on their way to apparent </span>__<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">extinction</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, and would </span>__<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">do nothing whatsoever</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> to interfere with the natural operations of the world. The only logical answer to this situation is that </span>__<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">the Taoist</span> sees no action to be required,__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> for </span>__he <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">trusts that the world is already operating as it is supposed to be</span> operating, <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">and all human activity</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> — no matter how well-intentioned — </span>__<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">can</span>__ __<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">add nothing of value</span> to such operation__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, and </span>__can logically only interfere with the course of nature__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> as it is already unfolding. Just as Chuang-tzu would not dive into a river to save a floating baby, he would not take deliberate action to save the world from apparent destruction. It is, in fact, on this basis that one can, in fact, distinguish classical Taoists from classical Confucians: like modern Westerners, the Confucians generally assume that the world inherently tends toward chaos and requires the redemptive activity of human society, individually and collectively. But Taoists, as a rule, do not share the Confucian (or Western) </span>//fear //of the natural processes of life, and consequently do not fear the extinction of the whooping cranes, nor do Taoists enjoin deliberate action to save the cranes, or even Earth as a whole, from extinction.
