==Taoism K==

**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif;">Living in accord with the Tao precludes taking action to prevent death. As mere humans, we are blind to the overarching meaning of the universe and thus any action we take is unproductive and immoral.</span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Once upon a time, several years ago, I had the opportunity to engage in a variety of teamteaching enterprises at Stanford University. At one time, my colleague Lee Yearley sought to impress upon students ... beyond the comprehension or control of human thought or activity, and that humans of the modern secular age need to beware the arrogant assumption that we are, in Western terms, the "God" of planet earth. The Taoist position, I shall argue, is that planet earth has no "God," and needs none, not even — or more correctly said, especially not — ourselves.</span>

**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif;">Their calls to save humanity are based on a flawed fear of death and a misunderstanding of the continuous nature of the universe.</span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But by this definition, </span>the natural order, <span class="Underline">which we are enjoined to respect and uphold </span>by <span class="Underline">means of conscientious </span>non-action, is <span class="Underline">a natural </span>order that includes death<span class="Underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In fact, </span><span class="Underline">it includes ...</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by a force that is like a caring mother. It nurtures and cares for all things, then at the end of their natural lives, they return to it. Treasuring tranquility, the conscientious Taoist observes that return, with awareness and due respect, and in due course he or she, too, follows the same course, returning without fuss to the immaterial state from which he or she originally emerged.</span>

**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif;">The alternative is to embrace the practice of Wu Wei, or “doing nothing” in order to appreciate the flow of the Tao – only through appreciating the natural order of life can we live according to Taoism.</span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The focus of the Daode jing is something called "the Tao (or Dao)," a term that cannot adequately be translated. The text says that the Tao is "vague and subtle," and it never provides definitions.... about anything. </span><span class="Underline">Actually,</span> such is the most that anyone can do, <span class="Underline">because</span> the Tao <span class="Underline">-- as imperceptible as it is -- </span>is the most powerful force in existence, <span class="Underline">and </span>nothing can thwart its unceasing operation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>



==Astropolitics K== 

===**1NC**=== 

**“Space” is a social construction. It is an empty canvas where we can project images of warfare or peaceful alternatives. Their representation of space as a battlefield is driven by a worldview where technology guides politics.**

A Virilian reading of Outer Space Weaponization</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To begin with, </span>__the concept of space does not lie //in// space;...__ __for the direction Space policies have taken__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (and will continue to take). </span>__The construction of a space of a certain kind is what precedes its weaponization____; it is what makes it common-sensical.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> If we assume the construction of space, as opposed to the exploration of space, then we need to ask: what has informed this process?</span>

**Their faith in the ability of technology to provide security reflects a logic of total domination over the planet that renders us all into disposable standing reserve, this risks extinction.**

__Bacon thought of the new scientific method not merely as way of achieving a purer access to truth and epistemological certainty, but as liberating a new power that would enable the creation of a new kind of Man__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

**Our alternative is to reject the affirmative and their representations of the technological need to securitize space.**

**Representations matter uniquely in the context of their affirmative: allowing discourses of technological inevitability to replace political dialogue creates conditions for a space war. Re-framing space politics requires challenging the rhetoric used to justify policies.**
