<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The //respect principle// passes a number of meta-ethical tests. </span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Regan, 83. </span>__**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tom Regan. __The Case for Animal Rights__. University of California Press: Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA. ISBN: 978-520-24386-6. Pp. 259-260</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">“One wants more…accepting any principle. “</span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">First, moral patients and moral agents both have equal inherent value:</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">“Some might concede …</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> come in degrees. “</span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Second, even if moral patients are less important than moral agents, this does not deny a direct duty to moral patients:</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">“In reply it … fails to recognize.”</span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Unlike moral agency, life, etc. the subject-of-a-life criterion provides a non-arbitrary standard for assigning moral worth:</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">“The subject-of-a-life criterion … intelligible and nonarbitrary.“</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">VC- Subjects-of-a-life</span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">My sole contention is that animals are subjects-of-a-life. </span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">First, evolutionary theory suggests that animals are subjects of a life because of their similarity to humans physiologically. </span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Regan, 83. </span>__**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tom Regan. __The Case for Animal Rights__. University of California Press: Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA. ISBN: 978-520-24386-6. Pp. 26</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">A third point …</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in principle</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> mysterious. </span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Second, Regan provides the Cumulative argument in favor of animal consciousness:</span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Regan, 83. </span>__**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tom Regan. __The Case for Animal Rights__. University of California Press: Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA. ISBN: 978-520-24386-6. Pp. 27-28</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">There is, then…</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> than human beings. </span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Finally, the burden of proof lies on those that deny animals are subjects-of-a-life.</span>

===**Contractualism NC**=== 
I negate the resolution and value justice as implied by the resolution.


**<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Contractualism is uniquely valuable as a theory of justice since it explains the reason we should care about fairness. Carruthers writes: </span>**
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Carruthers, Peter. //The Animals Issue: Moral Theory in Practice//. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992.

**__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Contractualism presents us ... relatively free societies</span>__**<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">. </span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">Thesis: Justice cannot recognize animal rights.</span>

First, representing animal interests would violate the conditions of the veil of ignorance. Carruthers 2:

**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">allowing representatives of ... what morality //is//.</span>__**


Second, representing animal interests behind the veil would destroy the theoretical coherence of ethics. Carruthers 3:

===Percival NC=== 

[I read different portions of the case depending on the aff]

The standard is Minimizing Suffering

[standards justifications vary between rounds, I just posted the common ones I read]

1. Inviolable constraints create irresolvable rights conflicts

2. Respect for people as ends-in-themselves mandates consequentalism.

Rights can only be recognized inside a moral community A right is a claim within a community of moral agents Cohen

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Rights require the rights holder to understand their right and protect it.
