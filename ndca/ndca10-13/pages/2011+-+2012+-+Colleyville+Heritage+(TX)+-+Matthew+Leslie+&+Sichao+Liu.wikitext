<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">__Last month, the International Space Station, an orbiting space laboratory as big as a football field, had to move__... __It is already becoming dangerous to even launch a rocket, with the chance of collision now around 1 percent by some estimates__</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Large pieces in the GEO are the root cause of the problem - they replenish smaller debris</span>**

===<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Contention Two is The Advantages</span>=== 

====**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Advantage One is The Cascade Effect</span>**==== 

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">A single collision will start a chain reaction - destroying all satellites</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dillow 10 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Clay, writer for Pop Sci magazine, 05-27-2010, “Pentagon: A Space Junk Collision Could Set Off Catastrophic Chain Reaction, Disable Earth Communications”, http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-05/dod-space-junk-tipping-point-collision-could-set-catastrophic-chain-reaction)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Every now and again someone raises a stern warning about the amount of space junk orbiting Earth... If a chain reaction got out of control up there, it could very quickly sever our communications, our GPS system (upon which the U.S. military heavily relies), and cripple the global economy (not to mention destroy the $250 billion space services industry),</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">__and whole orbits could be rendered unusable__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, potentially making some places on Earth technological dead zones.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Catastrophic collisions occur once every 5 years - the next collision will be in just 2 years</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">CNES 12 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Government Space Agency of France, like NASA for the US, Fernand Alby CNES Toulouse, “OVERVIEW ON 2011 SPACE DEBRIS ACTIVITIES IN FRANCE”, [[http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/pdf/pres/stsc2012/tech-23E.pdf]])</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The destruction of satellites leads to extinction through four independent scenarios</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Imburgia 11 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Joseph S., author in Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law; “Space Debris and Its Threat to National Security: A Proposal for a Binding International Agreement to Clean Up the Junk.” May 2011 [[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=6e7410a9-26b2-454c-a808-c656e99bad12%40sessionmgr15&vid=2&hid=15&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d]])</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Simply put,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">__the United States depends on space-based assets for national security, and those assets are vulnerable to space debris collisions__... __Due to the steep price tags attached to some of the national space security platforms, the economic loss of a satellite due to space debris would also be significant__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The first is through proliferation.</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Every new nuclear state greatly increases the risk of nuclear war</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">ICNND 09 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, chaired by Gareth Evans and Yoriko Kawaguchi, Eliminating Nuclear Threats, [[http://www.icnnd.org/reference/reports/ent/pdf/ICNND_Report-EliminatingNuclearThreats.pdf]])</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">3.1</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">__Ensuring that no new states join the ranks of those already nuclear armed must continue to be one of the world’s top__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> international security</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">__priorities__... __Where such countries are beset with internal stresses and fundamentalist groups with trans-national agendas, the risk of nuclear weapons or fissile material coming into possession of non‑state actors cannot be ignored__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The second is through economic collapse.</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Satellites key to the economy</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sterner 10 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(fellow at the George C. Marshall Institute. He was a senior professional staff member on the House Armed Services and Science Committees and served in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and as NASA's associate deputy administrator of policy and planning (Eric, World Politics Review, “Tending the Forge of American Space Power,” 6/15, [[http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/5793/tending-the-forge-of-american-space-power]])</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Ironically, even as space has moved away from the center of American culture, it has become ever more integrated with the international system... And as the world's most developed space power, the United States has led the way in integrating space into its economic foundations.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The best statistical support proves – economic decline causes war</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Royal 10 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Jedediah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction – U.S. Department of Defense, “Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises”, Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, Ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Less intuitive is how periods of</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">__economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">... This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention. </span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The third is through miscalculation.</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">A loss of space capabilities will lead to nuclear miscalculation of the U.S.</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Burke 06 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">– Lt Col, USAF, command space professional with operational experience in missile operations, space surveillance, space control, missile warning, and command and control (Alan, “SPACE THREAT WARNING: FOUNDATION FOR SPACE SUPERIORITY, AVOIDING A SPACE PEARL HARBOR,”[[https://www.afresearch.org/skins/RIMS/display.aspx?moduleid=be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153&mode=user&action=researchproject&objectid=07acf878-3a5f-4a2c-8259-4a34c0717e9b]])</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">__The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services; the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">... General Lord testified to Congress: </span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The fourth is through terrorism.</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Terrorism escalates to nuclear war with Russia and China</span>**

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">__But these two nuclear worlds__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—a non-state actor nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange—</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">__are not necessarily separable__... __In such a tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of reality, it is just possible that Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intentions to use force (and possibly nuclear force) against them__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>

====**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Advantage Two is Cosmopolitanism</span>**==== 

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Taking the lead in ODR will spur international collaboration</span>**

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">__Space debris removal systems could take decades to develop and deploy through international partnerships__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> due to the many interdisciplinary challenges they face... </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">__This would accelerate technology development and demonstration, which would__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in turn,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">__build-up trust andhasten international participation__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in space debris removal. </span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Cooperation over debris moves away from the current military space security and spills over to true cooperation</span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">What emerges from this review of the main conceptual roots of space policy analysis over the past fifty years is a mixed picture... </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">__The approach, focus, and skill set she invokes are very different from those traditionally applied to military-security problems, which to date have tended to emphasize national responses and have involved relatiyely limited cooperation__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with commercial actors. </span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Cooperation in space key to solve Cosmopolitanism</span>**

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">__Common heritage approaches represent the exclusion of a right of appropriation; the duty to use resources in the interest of the whole of humanity; and the duty to explore and exploit resources for peaceful purposes (Held 2002: 15). Transnational issues that challenge the state's ability to rule within its own borders further inspire the movement away from classical sovereignty__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Held 2002: 20)... It can be pointed out that the root of "cosmopolitanism" and "cosmology" are the same "cosmos", meaning "order" and "universe" .</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Only Cosmopolitanism solves existential threats - the negative’s impacts are inevitable in the status quo</span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is certainly important to oppose such evolutionary doctrines by all intellectually credible means... In the resulting political climate, it might become easier to construct the sorts of systems of interwoven democratic international, regional, state and local governments that theorists of "cos­mopolitan democracy," "liberal multicultural nationalism," and "differ­entiated democracy" like David Held, Will Kymlicka, Iris Young, William Connolly, and Jurgen Habermas all envision.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">__Cooperation can prevent conflict escalation, increase safety in the space environment, prevent hefty cost burdens on an already strained national/defense budget and make China’s opaque space program more transparent__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">...</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">__If agreements between China and the U.S. were made today before a potential “space race” begins, this would help both sides avoid miscalculation by tempering mistrust and uncertaintywith a degree of transparency and predictability, thus preventing potential crisis escalation__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
