====Contention 1- Closing the Gap==== 

**The logic of distance and time is a representation of technological thought. Shrinking the distances in all aspects of life to pure efficiency—Heidegger ‘50**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Martin </span>Heidegger<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, June </span>1950<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, “The Thing” pg. 1</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">All __distances in time &__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Nor is great distance remoteness.</span>

**The current pace of technological evolution is accelerating to a point where we will reach a rupture in the fabric of humanity representing the next technological paradigm shift—Kurzweil ‘01**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Ray Kurzweil, 2001, “The Law of Accelerating Returns,” <span style="color: blue;">[[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns]]</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __with technology to become even more intelligent &__ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">step in evolution, the next high level</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __paradigm shift.__</span>



**This rupture is the representation of humans moving from the will to power to what Heidegger calls the “Will to Will”. The “Will to Will” is an expression of power in the purest form and the height of Metaphysics creating a culture of “pure technicity”. This is the essence of technological destining that forces human and non-humans to be reduced to the functioning of the “standing reserve” were humans are set in place as a condition of technological development; the only way out is through a constant re-thinking of the technological essence—Kroker ‘02**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Arthur Kroker, 2002, “Hyper Heidegger” http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=348</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">__always in &__ __for the development of technology__</span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">,</span>__

**Our Technological thinking causes the brutalization of humanity and establishes a false sense of value to life- this outweighs any impact. Metaphysical approaches have been exhausted—Weinberger ‘92**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Jerry Weinberger, Professor of Political Science at Michigan State University, “Politics and the Problem of Technology: An Essay on Heidegger and the Tradition of Political Philosophy”, The American Political Science Review, Vol. 86, No. 1 (Mar. 1992), pp. 112-127, JSTOR) KR/JRC</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Recent thinking about technology & it will not be to recur to the contending elements of modern rationalism.</span>


**Technological understanding of being creates the mindset that people and the environment are a standing reserve for consumption. What doesn’t hold value to us is waste to be discarded. It was this type of technological thinking that allowed the extermination of Jewish people in the holocaust—Zimmerman ‘94**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Michael</span> Zimmerman<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, 1994, Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University “Contesting Earth's Future,” p.43</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nevertheless, in speaking of the Holocaust &</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __a resource to be produced and consumed, created and destroyed, at will.__</span>

**Humanity’s attempt at making calculations is a facet of our technological mindset. These calculations represent our reduction of the world to a subject/object dualism in order to assign value and deciding what is to be consumed or discarded. This results in the stripping of nature and a hollowing or our being—DeLuca ‘05**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Kevin Michael DeLuca, Associate Professor of Speech Communication and adjunct in the Institute of Ecology at the University of Georgia, “Thinking With Heidegger: Rethinking Environmental Theory and Practice”, Ethics & the Environment 10.1 (2005) 67-87, Project Muse)//JRC—no change</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">Machination is unconditional controllability,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __the domination of all beings, the world, and earth through calculation__,....... & ....... __Under the unrestrained domination of machination, humans suffer a "hollowing out"__ (</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">1999, 91, 348</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">) </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">and</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __Being__-</span>



**This loss of Being is worse than nuclear war—Zimmerman ‘94**
Michael Zimmerman, 1994,<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University, “Contesting Earth's Future,” p. 119-120)</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">Heidegger asserted that human self-assertion, combined with</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __the eclipse of being, threatens the relation between being and human..........__ &....... __we would exist in a state of ontological damnation: hell on earth, masquerading as material paradise.__ </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">Deep ecologists might agree that a world of material human comfort purchased at the price of everything wild would not be a world worth living in, for in killing wild nature, people would be as good as dead. But most of them could not agree that the loss of humanity's relation to being would be worse than nuclear omnicide, for it is wrong to suppose that the lives of millions of extinct and unknown species are somehow lessened because they were never "disclosed" by humanity.</span>

**Human engagement in technological thought creates the necessity to order nature to serve our needs creating a standing reserve culminating in stripping of the need/desire to help others and creates a strictly technological understanding of being—Dreyfus ‘93**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Charles B. Dreyfus, 1993, Professor of Philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley, “Heidegger on the connection between nihilism, art, technology, and politics” – chapter of “The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger,” ed. By Charles B. Guignon, p. 306)JRC</span>
__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">In this technological perspective.......... & .......</span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __the culmination of the technological understanding of being.__</span>

**Dooms Day scenarios are a lie used to ensure the power and control of the state—Coviello ‘00**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Peter Coviello, 2000 “Queer Frontiers: Apocalypse from Now On,” Ch. 2, pg. 40-41</span>
__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">apocalypse is defined now by the affliction it brings somewhere else</span>____<span style="font-size: 10pt;">,.......... &.......</span>__ __<span style="font-size: 10pt;">the threat of an apocalyptic demise, nuclear or otherwise, seems a civic initiative</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that can scarcely be done without.</span>
====Plan==== 

**Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase its investment in domestic transportation infrastructure.**

====Advocacy Statement==== 

**This is not a problem for which we must find a solution; rather it is an ontological condition that requires a transformation of our understanding of the culture of technology and what Being means in its capacity as a turning that reveals to us that the path of thinking takes humanity away from the essence of technology towards a revealing of Being. Thus we should reject the “will to will” inherent in the resolution and engage in a causal evaluation of our relationship to technological destining.**



====Contention 2- Making Space==== 

**Resolve is not to be found in a willful action, but as a steadfastness to allow the revelations of being. This allows for a new mode of political action outside the arbitrary whims of the sovereign ego—Pezze ‘06**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Barbara Pezze, <span style="color: blue;">[[debatecoaches/2011-2012 - Pembroke Hill (MO) - Cianan Lesley & Mihir Vedantam|PhD]]</span> Philosophy at Honk Kong U, “Heidegger on Gelassenheit”, Minerva, vol .10,<span style="color: blue;">[[http://www.ul.ie/~philos/vol10/Heidegger.html]]</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This “</span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">resolve</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” as Heidegger himself suggests, must be thought as the one that is spoken of in Being and Time, that is, it</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __is a “letting oneself be called forth”__ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(1996, p. 283</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">) __to one’s own most possibility of being.__ & __remained always the composure of releasement.__</span>


**Our Aff represents a radical break from the technological age through the examination of being- This break will reconnect humans with their nature and remove themselves and nature from standing reserve, now is the key time to act; We are fighting for our lives—Best and Nocella ‘06**
Best and Nocella, 2006,<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> –associate professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso (Igniting a Revolution: Voices in Defense of the Earth, p. 82-84, google books)//JRC//</span>
//<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yet,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __for__ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">both</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __Heidegger and revolutionary environmentalists, &__ __is done away with, but whether Enframing is surmounted__</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. It is in this sense of releasement Heidegger writes, </span>//



//**Our evidence is comparative- Loss of essence outweighs extinction and makes extinction inevitable- Recapturing the essence of being is a prerequisite to reestablishing a proper form of ethics and politics—De Beistegui ‘97**//
//<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Miguel</span> de Beistegui, 1997<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Warwick, “Heidegger and the Political,” ed. by K. Ansell-Pearson and S. Critchely, p.71, ASG</span>//JRC
__<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> in the absolute domination of space in the form of total and readily available presence</span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">. & __but are entirely summoned by the power of machination.__ </span>

**This movement of questioning does not spread through a linear process but through a resonance that takes us to a point where a return to the old order is no longer desirable or even possible—****The Invisible Committee ‘09**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Invisible Committee, 2009, “The Coming Insurrection” pg. 12</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Revolutionary </span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">movements do not spread by contamination but by resonance</span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">. & </span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> To the point that any return to normal is no longer desirable or even imaginable.</span>__




**Endpoints of the 1AC’s questioning doesn’t matter; what matters is that we actually think. The path to the endpoint is what gives rise to different perspectives and views—****Shanahan** **‘****93**

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">William Shanahan, 1993, “Kritik of Thinking” http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Shanahan1993HealthCare.htm</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __the basic feature of the way- &__ __what is important is not the end, but the way.__</span>

**Only questioning ontology accesses deeper questions of the structural “isms”—****Spanos ‘00**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">William V. Spanos, 2000, “America’s Shadow: An Anatomy of Empire”, pgs. 56-57 markoff</span>
__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The end of the pursuit of knowledge</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">, **&** </span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">but a deeply inscribed ideological state of mind produced by a “truth” endemic to a metaphysical ontology</span>__

**The aff’s examination of technology reveals its true essence to humans preventing the technological mindset from controlling us—****Beckman ‘00**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tad Beckman, 2000 “Martin Heidegger and Environmental Ethics,” <span style="color: blue;">[[http://www2.hmc.edu/~tbeckman/personal/Heidart.html]]</span> JRC</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In our present point of view,</span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">we see technology .....& ...</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">, </span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Heidegger discovered the very essence of causation in the Greek word 'aitia,' or "to occasion</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 5pt;">;.</span>
