NASA's ace detector wont solve now

Efforts to predict this space weather..................We simply cannot afford to let DSCOVR's launch funding be eliminated.


===[[#Affirmative-contention 1- Solar Storms]]Storms=== 
The sun is in the low end of its cycle; big solar storms are coming
Phillips, production editor of Science@NASA, 2011
(Dr. Tony, NASA “Getting Ready for the Next Big Solar Storm,” [[http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/22jun_swef2011/]] , June 21, accessed 7-22-11, ASR)

In Sept. 1859,............solar storm could have the economic impact of 20 hurricane Katrinas.


The storm will end civilization, killing more people than any war.

The effect would be global

Brooks, PhD in quantum physics, 3/23/09

[Michael, New Scientist, “Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe”, online, BJM]

Such nightmare scenarios are not restricted to North America.................... Most of the time it's alright, but occasionally it will get you."



The damage is comparable to nuclear war
Eccleston, Spring 2011
Chief Consultant for the Environmental Planning and NEPA Services Corporation and Stuyvenberg, Environmental Project Manager, US Nuclear Regulatory Comission, 2011 (Charles and Andrew, Environmental Quality Management, “The Perfect Electrical Storm? “ Volume 20, Issue 3, Article first published online: 14 MAR 2011, DOI 10.1002/tqem / Spring 2011 / 43 Published online in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com) [[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tqem.20288/pdf]] , accessed 7-2-11, ASR) 


According to Kappenman, power outages would ripple across the infrastructure..............their newly deprived neighbors



Collapse of power grids will cause nuclear meltdowns

Tabor, July 2011

[Damon, Popular Science, “SUN STROKE”, Lexis, BJM]



One of the biggest disasters.............for one to two years.


Extinction

Wasserman 2002 Harvey, Senior advisor to the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, “Nuclear Power and Terrorism,” Earth Island Journal, Spring, vol. 17]

As at Three Mile Island...............generations must be shut down.

Current early warning systems fail

Brooks, PhD in quantum physics, 3/23/09

[Michael, New Scientist, “Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe”, online, BJM]


However, observations of the sun.................. is rather foolish."



DSCOVR gives early solar storm warning



Scripps 2011Scripps 2011 [[http://www.sio.ucsd.edu/About/Research_Overview/The_Oceans_and_Global_Change/]]



Scripps is participating..................general public via the Internet.

Early warning saves the grid
OCIPEP, 4/25/02, “Geomagnetic Storms - Reducing the Threat to Critical Infrastructure in Canada”, [[http://www.solarstorms.org/CanadaPipelines.html]]



Preventative measures.........of a storm threat.
===Climate=== 
Warming is real & anthropogenic – consensus of scientists are on our side
Cook 10 (John, Solar Physics Scientist @ University of Queensland, Adjunct Fellow at the University of Queensland, “The human fingerprint in global warming”, 29 March 2010, [[http://www.skepticalscience.com/human-fingerprint-in-global-warming.html]])

In science, there's................ the atmosphere and global warming."

The status quo risks catastrophic failures in our Earth monitoring systems that are essential for managing climate change -- only US federal action solves.

Lewis et al., 2010

Zheng, Congressional Staffer - Salary Data, “Earth Observation for Climate Change,” June, [[http://csis.org/files/publication/100608_Lewis_EarthObservation_WEB.pdf]]]




Satellites provide globally.................can only be done from space.

DSCOVR solves warming, climate leadership, and international relations
Anderson, 07 (Mitchell, August 7, worked for eight years as a staff scientist at Sierra Legal Defence Fund and has written extensively on environmental and social policy issues for a variety of national and international publications, A DeSmogBlog exclusive investigation into NASA's DSCOVR climate station, [[http://desmogblog.com/mitchell_anderson]])


Somewhere in Maryland..............a top priority.



Information capabilities are a necessary condition for solving climate change -- the aff revitalizes US climate leadership, which is key

Zheng, Congressional Staffer - Salary Data, “Earth Observation for Climate Change,” June, [[http://csis.org/files/publication/100608_Lewis_EarthObservation_WEB.pdf]], BJM]


Climate change will..............shortfall is eliminated.


DSCOVR allows for tech innovations that solve warming
The National academies, 00 (does in depth research in problems of engineering medicine and science, march 3,)


The goals..............the technique



Satellites are key to predictive models —ground, sea, and airborne observation don’t give the complete picture

GAO 10(Government Accountability Office, “ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITES Strategy Needed to Sustain Critical Climate and Space Weather Measurements,” April 2010, [[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=gmail&attid=0.1&thid=13153eda6bd0cba7&mt=application/pdf&url=https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui%3D2%26ik%3D1d49613b60%26view%3Datt%26th%3D13153eda6bd0cba7%26attid%3D0.1%26disp%3Dsafe%26realattid%3Df_gqfpmsjd0%26zw&sig=AHIEtbTemLrr0aEGSwRmvZHYiRE3WOw2kg]])



Since the........................ozone coverage.

Predictions are necessary to create plans to combat warming—people can’t form effective strategies if they’re trying to fix the wrong problem
Hamre 10(John, President and CEO of the Center for Strategic & International Studies, “Earth Observation for Climate Change,” June 2010, [[http://csis.org/files/publication/100608_Lewis_EarthObservation_WEB.pdf]])



Slowly, painfully.....................into policy efforts.




Warming will cause extinction.

Oliver Tickell, Environmental Researcher, 8/11/’8

([[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange]]) [Quals Added]


We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming,....................hothouse Earth.


Thus the plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase it’s development of space by launching Deep Space Climate Observetory satellite beyond the earth’s mesosphere in the L1 section.

===[[#Affirmative-Contention 4: Solvency]]Solvency=== 

DSCOVR solves climate change- gives crucial data

Anderson 2007Mitchell Anderson staff scientist at Sierra Legal Defence Fund 8/29/2007 “A DeSmogBlog exclusive investigation into NASA's DSCOVR climate station”[[http://www.desmogblog.com/a-desmogblog-exclusive-investigation-into-nasas-dscovr-climate-station]]
NASA quietly cancelled.............launch vehicle in the world.



DSCOVR would replace ACE in time for the upcoming solar maximum and be able to provide advance warning for space weather
Foust, 11 – editor and publisher of The Space Review (2-21-2011, Jeff, The Space Review, “When the Sun Sneezes,” [[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1783/1]]) EB


Another key satellite for space weather..................a complete view of the Earth’s sunlit hemisphere.




DSCVR the only earth-monitoring satellite that is ready to be launched- others require a ground system to be built

Donahue, April 6 (Bill Donahue, reporter for Popular Science, April 6, 2011,[[http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-03/lost-satellite| Who Killed The Deep Space Climate Observatory?]]

Popular Science[[http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-03/lost-satellite?page=1| http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-03/lost-satellite?page=1]])


Instead, NOAAis interested in how the sun damages electronic.................DSCOVR's chances of one day completing its mission, it would be him.
