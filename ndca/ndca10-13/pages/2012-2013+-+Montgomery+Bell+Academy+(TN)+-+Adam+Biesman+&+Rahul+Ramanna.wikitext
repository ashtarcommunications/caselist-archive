Segregated systems ensure that people with disabilities will remain invisible and excluded from political and public spaces of interaction. This creates a central dependency of people with disability on charitable welfare services while ensuring that their voices are never heard.

Implement local Pedestrian… good bus stop design and access.


And – As students participating in policy debates we have an obligation to put disability at the center of our discussion because what we debate about here says a lot about human conduct on a larger scale – this is not a meta-theoretical quibble but central to change the way that disability is represented and conceived
Bérubé, 2003 (Michael, Paterno Family Professor in Literature at Pennsylvania State University, “Citizenship and Disability”, Spring, http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=506)
