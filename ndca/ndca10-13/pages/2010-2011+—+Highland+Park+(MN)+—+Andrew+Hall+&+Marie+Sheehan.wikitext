**Contention Three is The Thrown Project, and What It's Really All About**

**We’ve just presented qualified authors indicating military overstretch is killing hegemony and our hegemony isn’t in danger; soft power both preserves and destroys hegemony; hegemony prevents and creates war. To our contradictory and equally valid deterministic theories, we could add that nuclear war causes and prevents extinction; that human extinction is good and bad for life more broadly; that life is desirable and undesirable. This illustrates the subjectivity and fundamental unknowability of reality and value judgments—rather than hand-picking some deterministic theory in bad faith and pretending we chose the only logical action, we freely choose the plan because Andrew and I feel that removing our oppressive forces from the topically designated regions would enable others to be freer than they are now. Our action’s ultimate results can’t be predicted or objectively evaluated as good or bad; what matters is that it’s a deliberative and freely chosen act.**

**AND, we must make our choices alone. No abstract system of morality can guide us through the particulars of concrete situations, a priori values don't exist, and any sign of how to act is open to our subjective interpretation. In choosing which experts' advice we'll seek, we predetermine what kind of advice we want to get**
**Sartre 45** (Jean-Paul, philosopher, critic, playwright, novelist, Nobel laureate, "existentialism is a humanism," 10-29-1945; English translation by Yale University, 2007; pp.30-34)
"To give you an example...be. Such abandonment entails anguish."


**We freely choose what we are to be; we may have certain dispositions but it is our acts that define us—to deny this is to resign our entire essence to be some arbitrarily predetermined thing or another and reject our capacity for change**
**Sartre 45** (Jean-Paul, philosopher, critic, playwright, novelist, Nobel laureate, "existentialism is a humanism," 10-29-1945; English translation by Yale University, 2007; pp.38-39)
"In light of all this...one way or the other."

**Since we’re defined by our actions, our morality must be one of action and commitment. Our realization of ourselves is the only foundation for absolute truth; everything outside of self-awareness is merely what’s probable**
**Sartre 45** (Jean-Paul, philosopher, critic, playwright, novelist, Nobel laureate, "existentialism is a humanism," 10-29-1945; English translation by Yale University, 2007; pp.39-40)
"We have now, I think...need only seize it directly."

**The only thing we can judge is whether actions affirm freedom. Freedom is the foundation of all values—there are no a priori values and they are always too vague to apply to specific situations. To promote a deterministic theory of what might happen or claim our existence is necessary is bad faith, concealing ourselves from our freedom. We must reject bad faith above all else**
**Sartre 45** (Jean-Paul, philosopher, critic, playwright, novelist, Nobel laureate, "existentialism is a humanism," 10-29-1945; English translation by Yale University, 2007; pp.47-50)
"Nevertheless we can pass judgment...in the name of freedom." 

**We can't predict or control what others will do; we must act without hope and only concern ourselves with our own commitment to action**
**Sartre 45** (Jean-Paul, philosopher, critic, playwright, novelist, Nobel laureate, "existentialism is a humanism," 10-29-1945; English translation by Yale University, 2007; pp.34-36)
"As for "despair," it has...I cannot count on anything."


**Our personal choices imply prescriptive value judgments that concern everyone; therefore, each of our choices must be weighed as not just for us but all of humanity—Andrew and I embrace this by choosing a global action for the federal government**
**Sartre 45** (Jean-Paul, philosopher, critic, playwright, novelist, Nobel laureate, "existentialism is a humanism," 10-29-1945; English translation by Yale University, 2007; pp.23-25)
"The word "subjectivism" has two...attributing a universal value to lies."

==Nietzsche== 

**A. Link - The affirmative resembles the Socratic Will to Order positioning itself as the arbiter of stability and control over the world. It continuously searches to eliminate all suffering in the world to create perfection. This search for the “Real World” abandons the present reality creating ressentiment for life as they constantly act to heal the wound of existence.**

**B. Impacts**
**1. The desire for mastery and control the affirmative replicates only creates ressentiment for our current existence. Such hatred and search for a new life makes life laughable and makes extinction desirable.**

"225. Whether it be hedonism, pessimism...the elevations of humanity hitherto?"


**2. The Socratic delusion creates mastery, control, and violence as a justification for achieving the end goal of the “Real World”**

"The dichotomisation of the ideal...neither factual nor beyond critique."


**3. Attempts to secure our experience of existence produces paranoiac fear. This produces life as a project where we struggle to perfect it through security. This fuels a ressentiment that negates life.**
**Der Derian, 95** - Political Science Professor at the University of Massachusetts – 1995(James, “On Security” Page 29)

"The will to power, the...of being protected by a god.”


**C. Alternative – Take the risk of exposing yourself to violent impacts and abandon the desire for control. Refuse to engage the 1AC as way of embracing the unknowable aspects of life. This risks danger but your mortality is a certainty. The alternative is the only way to bring meaning to life by living life eventfully through a rolling of the dice.**
