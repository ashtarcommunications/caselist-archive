===AGENCY AC=== 

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Section 1: </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Debate must be founded on individual moral analysis rather than policy making about what the government should do. The traditional conception of fiat encourages increased distance from the political sphere and decreases our ability to engage ourselves in politics and activism.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">[1] Gordon Mitchell. 1998. [Associate Professor of Communication and Director of the Willian Pitt Debating Union at University of Pittsburgh.] “Reflexive Fiat: Incorporating the Outward Activist Turn into Contest Strategy.” The Rostrum 72. January 1998.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"Advocacy under this...academic debate process."</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Separating the debate forum from real life through a policymaking framework prevents debaters from experiencing real-world events. Mitchell [Cited Above]</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Section 2:</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Individual morality constrains action through self-sanctioning based on moral standards that must be internalized. In constructing morality we must avoid dissociation in order to ensure that the interalization of norms is a positive force. Rationalizing evil actions through justification, euphemism, and self-distancing from events and political actors enable this dissociation.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Zimbardo, Philip. The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil. Random House, 1st Edition. March 27, 2007. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"The model begins...fellow human beings."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">This dissociation is especially dangerous in the modern military context in which death and destruction are becoming progressively more and more faceless.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"It is easier...death and destruction."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">S: Preventing Dissociation</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Section 3:</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The presence of nuclear weapons causes persons to think about, react to, discuss, and understand the death and destruction of nuclear weapons in intolerable ways. When we believe that we can control nuclear weapons, we become comfortable with their presence. The more we are surrounded by them and the less we resist them, the more dissociated we become from their human impact. The domestication of nuclear weapons permeates nuclear discourse. In the inevitable attempt to tame nuclear weapons, we make it impossible to forge individual connections to them. </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Carol Cohn, Bulletin of Atomic Sciences, June 1987.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"Nuclear weapons are...has become god."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">This dissociation and mirage of nuclear mastery is empirically verified. </span>

===INDIA/PAKISTAN PRESCRIPTIVISM PLAN AC=== 

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">OBSERVATION ONE IS FRAMEWORK:</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">V: Morality</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Before we can adopt a moral framework, we must first determine the meta-ethical nature of morality itself. Without answering questions about where morality comes from, there is no way to ever determine what is moral and immoral. Meta-ethics literally determines what counts as a warrant for a normative theory. Morality is a social force that exists to guide decision-making. It is not a descriptive system of truth and falsity. As such, all moral statements prescribe action. Moral statements do not describe reality. Even if phrased as apparently truth functional statements, moral propositions are ultimately meaningful as action guiding prescriptions.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Richard M. Hare. [White’s Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford]. 1993. “Objective Prescriptions,” Philosophical Issues, Vol. 4, Naturalism and Normativity, pp. 15-32. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"The most common...with a prescription."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Thus, moral statements are only valid if they are prescriptive and universizable. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"The rule of...become an 'ought.'"</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">In constructing universal prescriptions, rationality mandates that one takes into account the desires of all persons.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Norman O. Dahl. A Prognosis For Universal Prescriptivism. Philosophical Studies 51 (1987) 383-424. 9 1987. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"Given that critical...an 'ought'-statement."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Preference satisfaction is the only system that is consistent with the need to universalize and create prescriptions. If one is to prescribe actions that would be endorsed from the perspectives of all persons then one must maximize preferences. The nature of the utilitarian framework is less important than the fact that it must be an ends-based caluculus.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Richard M. Hare 1963 [White’s Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford], Freedom and Reason (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1963), pp. 122-123.</span>

===<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">SECURITY DILEMMA NC</span>=== 

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Nuclear disarmament creates a security dilemma that fosters violence and warfare. Eliminating nuclear weapons does not eliminate anxiety, mis-trust, and competition between states. When a state declares that they will abandon their nuclear arsenal there is no reason for any other nation to believe them. The uncertainty of a nuclear free world is disastrous for global security.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"Some disarmament advocates...and years ahead."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">In a world of global zero, nations will have no way to ensure that other countries have actually abandoned nuclear weapons. The risk that even one nuclear weapon goes undetected is a massive danger. Fear and insecurity is inevitable.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">V: Morality</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Citizens surrender rights to government in exchange for protection. The state has an obligation to protect citizens from arbitrary harm.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Also, consequentialism is the only standard that meets the logical requirements for moral decision-making. Because moral rules are not empirically verifiable, free and rational moral agents are responsible for the maxims they employ when faced with a moral dilemma. Thus, moral rules must rationally guide our actions.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Richard M. Hare—1963 [White’s Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford], Freedom and Reason (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1963), pp. 1.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"I ask the...as a burden."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Any rational reason that an agent can construct for taking an action commits that actor to endorsing a universalizable maxim. If there is a reason for me to take an action, it must apply to all similar circumstances. Otherwise, it isn’t a reason at all.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"I mention these...to maximize satisfactions."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Even if people would will a deontological maxim, universalizability would require a consequentialism of rights.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">OBSERVATION ONE IS THE HARMS:</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">n the status quo paradigm of criminalization, injection drug users are cut off from clean and legal needles and injection equipment.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The CDC reports that in 2008, over 4,000 injection drug users were diagnosed with HIV and nearly 6,000 were diagnosed with AIDS. Since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, almost 300,000 injection drug users in the United States have been diagnosed with AIDS and over 100,000 have been killed. Since 2005, the CDC estimates that approximately 3,000 HIV/AIDS victims died as a result of unsafe injection drug practices. The CDC presented these findings in data-tables, but I have methodology for their studies available. Left unchecked, death rates will only increase.</span>

===SOCIAL MESSAGING NC===

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> THUS, THE PLAN:</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> The U.S. Supreme Court will overturn its decision in McKeiver v. Pennsylvaniaas as it applies to those tried with violent felonies on the grounds that the 6th and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution guarantee the right to trial by jury for those juveniles.</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> CONTENTION ONE: The 6th amendment requires that people charged with violent crimes be given the right to a jury trial.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> The McKeiver decision assigned constitutional rights based on arbitrary classifications of age, and the distinctino of juvenile trials as civil while adult trials as criminal is misguided because:</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> a. supreme court precedent indicates there is no legitimate distinction between juvenile courts and adult criminal courts.</span>

===RECIDIVISM NC=== 


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">V: Morality</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">S: Minimizing suffering</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Citizens surrender rights to government in exchange for protection. The state has an obligation to protect citizens from arbitrary harm.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Also, consequentialism is the only standard that meets the logical requirements for moral decision-making. Because moral rules are not empirically verifiable, free and rational moral agents are responsible for the maxims they employ when faced with a moral dilemma. Thus, moral rules must rationally guide our actions.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Any rational reason that an agent can construct for taking an action commits that actor to endorsing a universalizable maxim.

===KANTIAN MORAL SUBJECT KRITIK=== 


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">SECTION ONE IS THE FRAMEWORK: </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Employing discourse which permits the subject to construct ethical obligations is lexically prior to any particular system of moral rules.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Judith Butler [Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at University of California at Berkeley], Giving an Account of Oneself, New York: Fordham University Press (2005), p. 135-136.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"What perhaps emerges...at what cost."</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Debaters ought to be held responsible for the discourses they employ. </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Roland Bleiker [Professor of International Relations Harvard and Cambridge]. Popular Dissent, Human Agency and Global Politics, Cambridge University Press, 2000. p. 216.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"Language is one...of transversal dissent."</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">These concerns ought to precede traditional post-fiat debate. </span>

January 1998.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"Advocacy under this... academic debate process."</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">SECTION TWO IS THE LINK:</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Kantian deontology conceives of the subject as a purely rational being detached from any particular social location or identity. </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Michael J. Sandel [Professor of Political Philosophy, Harvard University], Liberalism and the Limits of Justice: Second Edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1998). P. 6-7.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"His answer is...any particular object."</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">SECTION THREE IS THE IMPACT:</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The liberal conception of the subject excludes marginalized voices and undermines the ability to employ meaningful moral discourses to combat domination. Kant’s construction of ‘rational man’ which is dominant in the western tradition justifies marginalizing those constructed as insufficiently rational. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"This point is...judgments are rendered."</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Such exclusive conceptions of rationality and moral personhood serve to justify domination and repress meaningful moral discourse.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"But here we...kinds of people."</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">SECTION FOUR IS THE ALTERNATIVE:</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Moral theories that construct agency intersubjectively solve by focusing on context, relationality, and politics. Acknowledging perspectival knowledges does not condemn us to relativism. Rather it opens up space for truly democratic discourses.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"I do not...norms and ideals."</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Rejecting the division of humans based on exclusive conceptions of reason and agency allows the reawakening of moral imagination in ways that seek not only truth but meaning.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 9px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Ethics of Care are centrally concerned with the moral claims of particular dependent others rather than universalized obligations to rational agents in the abstract. Rejecting universalized abstraction, the Ethics of Care is able to construct a human morality.</span></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 9px;"><span style="font-size: 8px; line-height: 12px;">Virginia Held [Prof. City University of New York Graduate School], The Ethics of Care: Personal, Political, and Global.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">I contend that maintaining a separate juvenile justice system for offenders charged with violent offenses best maintains an ethics of care. </span>
