==Affirmative== 
**LEVINAS AFF:**

**OBSERVATION ONE:** I will defend the resolution as a general principle, but I am open to alternate interpretations. If the NEG would like me to defend something else, they can ask me to do so in CX.

**OBSERVATION TWO IS FRAMEWORK:** <span style="color: #000000;">I value **justice.** T</span>he nature of our relationships with and obligations towards others form the basis of the requirements of justice.

<span style="color: #000000;">Previous philosophical theories try to distill justice into a single principle that is to be applied to all situations. For example, Kantian ethics establishes human dignity or reflective practical reason as the basis for all ethical reasoning. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Other agents cease to be unique entities that exist independently of ourselves because all knowledge is said to stem from //our// systemic procedures for ethics. </span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">However,</span>**<span style="color: #000000;"> a sound basis for ethics requires a coherent understanding of the other. Failure to recognize and identify with that which is not us prevents us from constructing ourselves as autonomous beings.</span>

//**<span style="color: #000000;">There the transcendental... possible at all.</span>**//

**<span style="color: #000000;">Thus</span>**<span style="color: #000000;">, our self-awareness can only arise through our encounter with the Other. Without the capacity to distinguish that which is in our control from that which is not, the external world would appear to be governed by our will so we could not distinguish our own autonomous action from the decisions of the other. This makes it impossible to concpetualize our autonomy. </span>

Thus we must respect the other.

//If the otherness... look at God.//


**<span style="color: #000000;">Therefore,</span>**<span style="color: #000000;"> the AFF **burden** is to prove that animals are an other worthy of ethical consideration.</span>


**<span style="color: #000000;">Further,</span>**<span style="color: #000000;"> prefer this framework for two additional reasons:</span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">First</span>**<span style="color: #000000;">, any coherent conception of ethics arises out of respect for the other. Discussion that precedes a response to the other is internally self-defeating because it tries to attribute characteristics to the other before encountering the other,s. This also allows us to exclude anything outside of our defined interpretation of what the other is. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">//If we can... on the environment//.</span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">Second</span>**<span style="color: #000000;">, ethics must accept others because we can never fully understand them. When we encounter the other, it has an independent perspective that eludes my understanding so we have no choice but to respect its otherness</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">My thesis and sole contention is that a proper understanding of the other requires the recognition of animal rights.</span>
**<span style="color: #000000;">A) </span>**<span style="color: #000000;">Animals constitute an other because we are unable to truly and fully understand them. </span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">Further</span>**<span style="color: #000000;">, differences between humans and animals are irrelevant. This dichotomy would thematize and totalize the other**<span style="color: #000000;">[[2011-2012 - Harvard-Westlake (CA) - Michelle Choi#_ftn7|.]]</span>**</span>

//Levinas's statements in... question of ethics.//

**<span style="color: #000000;">Thus,</span>**<span style="color: #000000;"> justice must recognize the rights of all agents that influence the interaction between ourselves and the other, not just those within the realm of the other. </span>

**Finally,** ethical obligations to others can only be conceptualized as rights.

**STANDING AFF**


<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">STANDING AFF</span>**</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">OBSERVATION ONE IS FRAMEWORK:</span>**</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">I affirm and value **Justice.**</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">Justice is the normative term we employ to describe the system of obligations and entitlements people have in relation to one another. Thus**,** justice and rights emerge as socially constructed tools.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">David Hume, __An Inquiry Considering the Principles of Morals__, in the version presented at www.earlymoderntexts.com (1758), p. 8 .</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">"Let's suppose that... list of virtues"</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Moreover, </span>**</span><span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">conceptions of justice are context-dependent.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">Jurgen Habermas [Former Chair of Philosophy and Sociology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main Institute for Social Research, Permanent Visiting Professor at Northwestern University, "Theodor Heuss Professor" at The New School, New York.], __The Inclusion of the Other: Studies in Political Theory__. Cambridge: MIT Press (1998), p. 36-37.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">"A sentence or... all future obligations"</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Second, </span>**</span><span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">any normative claim necessarily relies on an appeal to a higher order principle.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">Hans Kelsen—1978. [A</span><span style="color: #101010; display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">ustrian jurist and philosopher of law]. Pure Theory of Law. University of California Press, pp. 193.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">"A norm referring... the higher norm"</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus, </span>**</span><span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">the validity of any normative order is grounded in certain foundational, socially constructed norms. Constitutional and legal structures must form this basis.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">Hans Kelsen—1978. [A</span><span style="color: #101010; display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">ustrian jurist and philosopher of law]. Pure Theory of Law. University of California Press, pp. 193.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">"To understand the...a basic norm"</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">**Third,** justice can only be ensured through consistency with the law</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">"The greatest fear...to the law"</span>


<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Fourth, </span>**</span><span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">justice would //not// entail that gross violations of rights are permitted under justice simply because precedent for such practices exist. If certain norms are inconsistent with more fundamental legal norms, then they are antithetical to justice because they would violate other basic norms.</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus, </span>**</span><span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">the standard is **Maintaining Consistency With Legal Norms.**</span>


<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">OBSERVATION TWO IS INHERENCY:</span>**</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">//<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Status quo</span>//</span><span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">legal practice denies animals standing in civil court. Although the Endangered Species Act purports to establish broad procedures to protect animals, it’s extremely difficult to bring anything to court since the plaintiff has to demonstrate that he or she has suffered ‘injury in fact.</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">OBSERVATION THREE IS THE PLAN:</span>**</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS WILL CLARIFY AND ACCORDINGLY AMEND THE PROVISIONS OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT TO AFFORD PROTECTED ANIMALS LEGAL STANDING UNDER THE CITIZEN SUIT PROVISION. I reserve the right to clarify.</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">OBSERVATION FOUR IS SOLVENCY: </span>**</span><span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">Explicitly granting animals standing in civil court is the only way to align legal practice with legal norms.</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">First, </span>**</span><span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">denying an animal’s standing in civil court is inconsistent with the legislative intent of congress in the ESA.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">“Rejecting the possibility…the Act indicated”</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Second, </span>**</span><span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">a proper reading of the language used in the ESA clearly indicates that animals should have standing in civil court based on the fact that they exist within U.S. jurisdiction.</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Thus the standard</span>**<span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';"> is promoting dignified and flourishing life. Prefer it for two reasons:</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 16px;">First,</span>**<span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 16px;"> the capabilities approach is most consistent with reflective equilibrium. **Nussbaum 1**</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 16px;">And, </span>**<span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 16px;">showing we should respect animal entitlements to a flourishing and dignified life means that we should recognize their rights. **Nussbaum 3**</span>

This is a... unfair to them.

<span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">So, the affirmative burden is to show that the capabilities approach recognizes the moral interests of animals.</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 16px;">First,</span>**<span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 16px;"> animals are capable of living a dignified life, which humans often deny them. **Nussbaum 4**</span>

**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">For Hume, the …</span>__**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">all these extremes” [EPM 1881.) </span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">C1. Although we may be bound by rules of morality against harming animals, justice would not constrain our actions against them because humans easily control them.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">C2. The enforcement mechanism of justice over animals would literally be impossible and would thus not be useful to include them in such systems. </span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Systems of justice must be consistent with human psychology because</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">1. It is irrational to try to use reason to gauge thing which reason cannot control. **CS Lewis**</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Thus Hume’s concept of justice alone provides a plausible explanation of how justice can mesh with our understanding of human nature. **Churchill**</span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Enlightenment philosophy is a quagmire. Armchair reflections on the metaethical basis of moral rules often forget that underlying critical reflection remain people in search of a salient applied ethic to guide our choices in the face of modernity’s dislocating onslaught. </span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Bernard Williams [Prof. of Philosophy, University of Cambridge, University of California at Berkeley], __Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy__, Cambridge: Harvard University Press (1985), pp. 116-117</span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">The main consequences...</span>**__<span style="font-size: 16px;">as we can</span>__**</span>


<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Thus the purpose of ethics is not reflection for its own sake but the construction and cultivation of moral subjectivities which capture our salient ethical sensibilities. Ethics is preeminently a question of who we aspire to be rather than abstract ruminations on the metaphysical status of moral propositions. **Judith** **Butler** explains how failure to attend to this process can not only render our moral assertions meaningless but also make them a guise for ethical violence.</span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Indeed, inquiring about the nature of the good life for the moral subject is the only way to circumvent the is-ought fallacy that plagues rationalistic moral theory. </span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Alasdair MacIntyre [Emeritus Prof. of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame], __After Virtue, 3rd Edition__, Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press (2007), p. 56-59</span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Thus the resolution asks what principle is most salient to our moral identities – the supposed right to ignore the suffering of those in need, or the obligation to do something about it. The affirmative thesis is that the egoism entailed by a negation is deeply at odds with the fundamental basis of our moral subjectivity.</span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">**Section II is Links and Impacts**.</span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Regardless of the abstract hypotheticals constructed by moral theorists, we know well how the underlying principle of negation is operationalized in the real world. Liberal capitalism erects psychological and ideological barriers, which in turn effect alienation from those connections which are fundamental to our moral identities. **Mary Dietz**[[home#_ftn1|****[1]****]] explains that Liberalism employs a universalized conception of individuals as fully autonomous and unencumbered by social context.</span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 120%;">This is undoubtedly...our social arrangements.</span>


<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">That the needs of others could hold no salient moral claim upon us is a stunningly counter-intuitive conclusion, and yet the idea that we have no unchosen obligations flows naturally from liberalism’s view of the unencumbered subject. Liberals like Robert Nozick go so far as to suggest that an obligation to help the needy is akin to slavery. This kind of narcissism alienates us from morally salient ties to others. It would be difficult to make sense of our moral life without acknowledging obligations of solidarity derived from our particular identities. **Michael Sandel**</span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">On a more local level, theorists emphasizing the value of care in human relationships demonstrate that such situated moral identities innately acknowledge the obligation to assist those in need. **Virginia Held**</span>

====<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Genocide AC</span>==== 

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The value is **morality** as implied by the resolution.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Moral statements are simply an expression of a state of mind and cannot amount to any more than that</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">. </span>****<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Gibbard[[home#_ftn1|[1]]]</span>**



<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Such an analysis might be called "expressivistic." ….to accept permits.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">This means that the function of moral statements is not meant to express true or false claims, but instead serve the purpose of expressing our preferences and providing a medium through which to reconcile them. </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Blackburn</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">[[home#_ftn2|[2]]]</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7.5pt;">Obviously many …</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;"> propositional judgment is //for//.</span>


**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Prefer</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> this ethical interpretation for three reasons.</span>


**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">First,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> all other accounts of ethics are subject to infinitely regressive justification. I can always ask why is this system of ethics is good or why one metaethic should be preferred over another. Only characterizing our moral judgments in terms of expressing our beliefs can we escape it. </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Railton et al[[home#_ftn3|[3]]]</span>**

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Moore had discovered ….</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> R really is good.</span>__**

**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Railton et al.</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> continues on how characterizing morality in terms of simply an expression of attitude we can escape this issue because this system of ethics does not require this demand.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Wittgenstein, for one, …presence of conflicting interests.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Second</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">, there is no faculty which perceives moral facts in the physical world. **Mackie[[home#_ftn4|[4]]]**</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Even more important, however, …. objectivist is compelled to resort.</span>


**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Indeed,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> the idea that something could ‘exist’ in a non-physical sense is absurd. </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ayer</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">[[home#_ftn5|[5]]]</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">A similar mistake has been … exposed in the same way.</span>



**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">Third, </span>**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">we cannot rationally justify all of our beliefs. Asking us to do so is an impossible demand and asks the wrong question. **Keller[[home#_ftn6|[6]]]** explains that strong rationalism fails both because it undermines its own legitimacy and requires a “view from no-where” to objectively determine facts.</span>



<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Is there anything …</span>**__<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;"> would have to bow to.</span>__**



**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">Therefore,</span>**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;"> the affirmative advocacy is that </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">there are expressed norms that individuals ought to take action to prevent genocide and assist those in danger of genocide.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus,</span><span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;"> Genocide is recognized as an international evil that must prevented at all costs. </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Even the word genocide was created to signal a new evil that transcends all other forms of evil. **Power[[home#_ftn7|[7]]]**</span>

**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">In 1948 …</span>__****__<span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Calibri;"> "hierarchy of horribles.”</span>__**

**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">And,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> citizens of the United States uniquely have an obligation to prevent and fight genocide as there is cultural revulsion to genocide. **Power 2[[home#_ftn8|[8]]]**</span>

**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The United States </span>__**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">…</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Clinton said it.</span>__**

**<span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Calibri;">Indeed,</span>**<span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Calibri;"> we should not mistake inaction for compliancy with genocide. Most people would have preferred that America had taken action against Genocide. </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Power 3[[home#_ftn9|[9]]]</span>**

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">But this does not explain …</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">in both places.</span>__**

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The only place in which a moral obligation could actually be derived from is reason.

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">C1. Kantianism does not derive rights or moral laws because it relies on morality being self-legislating. This type of ethics relies on us giving reasons to ourselves for our moral rules. **However,** self-legislation cannot actually provide moral rules as there is no absolute authority in giving a law to oneself. **Ridely and Alvarez[[home#_ftn2|[2]]]**</span>

==Affirmative== 

===<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Hobbes AC</span>=== 

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">The value is **morality** </span>


**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Black’s law</span>****<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;"> dictionary[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn1|[1]]] </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">defines permissible as:</span>


**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Allowed; … may be done</span>__</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">. </span>




<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">The US Model Penal Code[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn2|[2]]] defines deadly force as:</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">"**__Force that the …serious bodily injury.__**" </span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Morality is characterized by the social contract. Moral uncertainty and moral disagreement lead to violence within the state of nature, which is irresolvable. </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Renzo[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn3|[3]]]</span>**



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">As Gregory Kavka has persuasively …</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">the state of nature.</span>__</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Thus, to escape this violence in the state of nature, we form a social contract to protect ourselves and everyone must give power to a centralized government. **Hobbes[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn4|[4]]]**</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #262626; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">Lastly**__,__**</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;"> the agreement …</span>__</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #262626; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">besides, his SUBJECT.</span>



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">However, </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">the agreed upon social norms cannot apply in all situations. The government does not have the ability to respond to all situations. Such imminent situations call for self-defense. **Gauthier[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn5|[5]]]**</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">Now I think Fletcher …</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">protection of the law.</span>__</span>**


**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Indeed,</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;"> an individual may never give up the means to self-preservation as it is the very foundation of the social contract in the first place. **Hobbes**</span>



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">Not All Rights …</span>__</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #262626; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">were to be interpreted.</span>



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Thus, </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">the affirmative burden is to prove that domestic violence is immanent while the negative must prove that it is not.</span>



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Further, prefer this ethical interpretation for two more reasons</span>**



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">First,</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;"> Only a system of ethics which correlates to the desires of actual people has legitimacy since having a reason necessarily entails that you have a concern or desire relating to that reason in the first place. **Goldman[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn6|[6]]]**</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">All internalists about</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">…</span>__</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">defense it can offer.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Second</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">, only a system in which actors come together and agree upon a social contract makes sense. Actors need to be motivated themselves to form maxims, they cannot just conform to the moral law that exists independent of the agreements they make. **Zupančič[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn7|[7]]]**</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">What is inadmissible is ….achieves its determination</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">. </span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">The my sole contention is that victims of domestic abuse have no other option than resorting to deadly force.</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">A) **Domestic Violence is not effectively prevented by the state**</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">The government is ineffective at protecting victims from their abusers. Even if the victim manages to secure a restraining order their safety is far from certain. **Burke**</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn8|**[8]**]]</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">:</span>**



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">Even if someone does …</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> no safe options.</span>__</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">249</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">This belief is supported empirically. Victims who try to leave their abusers are much more likely to be murdered. </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Buel</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn9|**[9]**]]</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">:</span>**



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The victim be- lieves …</span>__</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;"> ex- tensive safety planning.9</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">B) **Psychological barriers**</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">The psychological violence done against spouses creates an image of themselves in which they have nowhere to run. It seems violence could erupt again at any moment. **The Supreme Court of Kansas in State v. Hundley[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn10|[10]]]**</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">Wife beating is steeped …</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> from the torture.</span>__</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Victims often believe their abuser when they promise that they will change. This means they cannot act until the threat is about to occur. </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Buel</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn11|[11]]]</span>



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The batterer’s promises … an inconsequential incident.</span>__</span>**



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">C) </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Cultural Barriers</span>**



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Many victims don’t seek help from abuse because of real and perceived societal barriers in terms of race and culture. </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Buel</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn12|**[12]**]]</span>

Ethics is preeminently a question of who we aspire to be rather than abstract ruminations on the metaphysical status of moral propositions. **Judith Butler[[home#_ftn1|**[1]**]]**

What perhaps emerges… at what cost**__?”__**

To be meaningful ethical theory must attend to the particular contexts and personal attachments which shape our moral subjectivity. **Sandel**<span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 16px;">[[home#_ftn2|[2]]]</span>
If the deontological… what he knows.

Standard: protecting children
Children cannot assert their own rights, so they are dependent on parents

The basic ethical demand stemming from our relationship to dependent others is more compelling than those produced by rationalistic moral theories. **Held ‘06[[home#_ftn3|**[3]**]]**
First, **__the central…__** of universal principles.

**Furthermore**, it is incumbent on society to construct ethical norms that support parental care for children. The experience of caring for particular others can inform social practice. **Held 2 ‘06[[home#_ftn4|**[4]**]]**
**__Dominant moral theories… significance__**, **__of caring.__**

We should reject the prioritization of universal rules over particular caring relationships because only the latter derive from a process of reflective moral deliberation on our particular ethical identities. **Held 3 ‘06[[home#_ftn5|**[5]**]]:**
Third, the ethics… **__generality through abstraction.”__**

Therefore actions to fulfill this relationship are permissible otherwise we don’t take the relationship seriously or maintain it properly.

**I contend that permitting the killing of abusers by victims of repeated domestic violence is necessary to protect the welfare of children.**

**Sub-Point A:** Domestic violence poses a grave danger to the physical and emotional wellbeing of children.

Many children are direct or indirect victims of domestic abuse. **Wright ’09[[home#_ftn6|**[6]**]]:**
Every year, millions… infant death syndrome. 10

**And**, living in an abusive home has severe psychological consequences. **Wright 2 ’09[[home#_ftn7|**[7]**]]:**
**__If victims of…__** his religion class.95


**Sub-Point B:** Victims of domestic violence reasonably perceive that their only option to protect their children is to use deadly force against the abuser.

**First,** victims are often unable to escape abusive relationships because they fear their children will be held hostage. **Cohen[[home#_ftn8|**[8]**]]:**
The element of… **__afford to pay.__**

**Second**, victims cannot count on the court system because it values retribution over the protection of their children. **Kohn[[home#_ftn9|**[9]**]]:**
Further, **__the insistent…__** the victims' actions.55

**And,** victims can even be prosecuted for failing to take steps to protect their children from abuse. **Schneider[[home#_ftn10|**[10]**]]**
In this circumstance… to such minor.”24

**Third,** even if abuse victims can flee with their children, they fear financial hardship. **Martinez[[home#_ftn11|**[11]**]]:**

**Finally,** women who flee with their children risk parental kidnapping charges and loss of custody. **Curry ’09[[home#_ftn12|**[12]**]]:**
**__One of the… may occur again.__**

Custody challenges are a particular concern for victims of violence who may be found unfit to parent because of battered woman’s syndrome. **Schneider[[home#_ftn13|**[13]**]]**
Dimensions of victimization… **__to obtain custody.__**


(I usually don’t get to this card) Under these circumstances it is reasonable for many victims to conclude that the only way to save themselves and their children is to kill the abuser. **McColgan[[home#_ftn14|**[14]**]]**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">The resolution asks if the use of deadly force is morally permissible. This is a question about the legitimacy of an action not about the responsibility of the actor. </span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Thus we must maintain a consistency between our objective and subjective perspectives on the world in order to have a consistent and logically sound perspective.

===7 Layer Salad (Eat it and Weep)=== 
**PART 1 IS THE THESIS**

My thesis is that morality is a tool of oppression. This oppression occurs when people invoke moral language to describe issues that could be understood without there being a moral “high ground.” People use moralizing discourse to invent that higher ground so that they are always right. This means that either **A)** We should not ascribe moral statuses to actions because morality used in this way is self-defeating or **B)** The resolution descriptively negates because morality always works in favor of the oppressor meaning the resolution would not be permissible.

**PART 2 IS THE SOCIAL ROOTS OF MORALITY**
Morality has historically been used as a tool of oppression. Altruistic actions have no basis in morality but instead are defined by those in power to bend others to their will. **Nietzsche[[home#_ftn1|**[1]**]]**

<span style="color: #262626;">All honour, then… of equal value.</span>

**Nietzsche 2[[home#_ftn2|**[2]**]]** continues on the etymological roots of the word “good”
<span style="color: #262626;">The guidepost which… volcanoes have spoken.</span>

**And,** society always appeals to the elites to determine what constitutes morality, which they frame to benefit themselves while systematically ignoring the lower class. **Turiel[[home#_ftn3|**[3]**]]**
Martin Luther King’s… **__quenched dissenting voices’__** [p. 290].

This makes morality self-defeating

**PART 3 IS THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF MORALITY**

**<span style="color: #262626;">Keller[[home#_ftn4|**[4]**]] </span>**<span style="color: #262626;">explains that morality is necessarily based upon subjective beliefs because the view that there are arguments any rational person would believe undermines its own legitimacy and requires a “view from no-where” to objectively determine facts.</span>
<span style="color: #262626;">Is there anything…. **__to bow to.__**</span>


**Further,** the nature of language allows us to interpret moral rules in any way we wish. The way we learn what moral rules mean is based off of customs taught to us making it impossible for us to say that one interpretation is right or wrong. **Wittgenstein[[home#_ftn5|**[5]**]]**
It's as if…. **__one is right?__**
**PART 4 IS THE POLITICAL CONSTRUCTION OF MORALITY**

If morality bears this subjective element, then people interacting in society create an equilibrium that represents shared moral principles. It is these principles that determine how morality actually works. **Gaus[[home#_ftn6|**[6]**]]**
**__If__** reasonably goodwilled… **//__making__// __it true.__**

The morality that society has produced is primarily concerned with maintaining the power structures that exist between social groups. **Grimes[[home#_ftn7|**[7]**]]**
Party Time suggests… **__of__** established **__society.__**"2
This means that morality is set up to ensure that the oppressed stay oppressed. 

Moral obligations are used to justify the worst atrocities in history, even against personal revulsion. Nothing else but such a strong conviction could lead men to slaughter. **Johnson[[home#_ftn8|**[8]**]]** describes the Nazi slaughter of Jews and how it was based in moralizing discourse
Some **__Jews__** hid… **__of the Party’.__**
**If you find this argument repulsive and I win it, then it is just another reason we shouldn’t use moral evaluation to answer the question of domestic violence because morality as it functions in society is an awful thing.**
**PART 5 IS OBJECTIVE MORALITY**

Even if they win that morality is not subjective, objective morality is self-defeating.
We shouldn't just say that something is permissible and act on it because we stop examining what the content of so-called “moral actions” is. **Arendt[[home#_ftn9|**[9]**]]**
However, **__non-thinking__**, which… **__the same phenomenon.__**
This means you still negate if morality is objective because any moral action is ultimately self-defeating by the phasing out of what the content of that morality is.

**PART 6 IS MAN USES MORALITY TO SUBJUGATE WOMEN**
**Finally**, objective or subjective interpretations of morality would descriptively negate because morality is a tool used by men to subjugate women. Appeals to moralistic discourse invite oppression of women. **AWID[[home#_ftn10|**[10]**]]**
**__Discriminatory laws and…__** and biological reproduction.
Here are some examples of what I’m talking about:
Hardline conservatives have been using moral discourse to wage a war on women and the non-moral discourse that was used to construct their rights in the first place. **Martin[[home#_ftn11|**[11]**]]**
First, let me… since the mid-1960s.
Middle-eastern countries invoke moral and social norms to subjugate and oppress women**. Eltahawy[[home#_ftn12|**[12]**]]** provides the empirical example of Saudi Arabia
Enter that call… system writ large.


**Eltahawy 2[[home#_ftn13|**[13]**]] continues** giving the examples of Tunisia and Libya
This, however, is… **__took them back.__**
