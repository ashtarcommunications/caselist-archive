<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Concern about adaptation to climate change and, partcularly, to rising sea levels has grown among transportation executives and policy makers over the last few years,as it has becomeincreasingly evident that significant steps to mitigate these trends(aside from the implementation of more rigorous fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles) are unlikely to occur in the near future and would, in any event, come too late to alter the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions already in the atmosphere ... As is true in so much else in the area of infrastructure, we first need to reform the institutions at all levels of government by which we assess, analyze, and make investment decisions.</span>
