<strong>Lack of a global transparent maritime information network is collapsing maritime domain awareness – recent satellite launches set the stage for effective integration but no plans have been made.</strong> <br />

<u>With greater emphasis being placed on global situational awareness</u>, global asset monitoring, and environmental monitoring, <u>maritime</u> and terrestrial sensor and <u>data acquisition systems are</u> critical enabling capabilities that are <u>becoming more ubiquitous</u>. The need is driven by global security and safety initiatives responsive to the new face of conflict, which involves every sector of society and knows no geographic boundaries. Because <u>much of the Earth’s surface is “unwired” and governed loosely</u>, if at all, and because <u>illicit activity seems to flourish where transparency is lacking</u>, there may be important gains in collecting data and monitoring activity in just such places: the open seas, jungles, deserts, and the polar regions. We feel that <u>moving data out of these areas, which are not supported by electrical or communications grids, suggests the need for <strong>a global space-based data collection and distribution backbon</strong><strong>e</strong></u>.. Furthermore, we feel that <u>creating such a system should be undertaken as an international collaborative effort, with no significant barriers to entry</u>. A number of national space agencies, consortia, and commercial interests have been active in deploying AIS receivers and data extraction capabilities on satellites; however, <strong><u>there currently exists no global partnership to coordinate and organize all the disparate efforts</u></strong> – especially one that ensures the availability of these capabilities to otherwise underserved countries. To further develop the concept of an internationally shared data collection and distribution backbone in space, CANEUS is organizing a workshop to explore technical, policy, and financial issues, and to frame an implementation plan. The eventual goal is to establish a public/private partnership that would create a low-cost, internationally shared data collection and distribution backbone in space with exceptionally low barriers to entry for participating nations.<br />
<br />
<strong>The plan: The United States federal government should deploy a constellation of satellites equipped with synthetic aperture radar and integrated into automatic identification system networks.</strong> <br />

 <strong><u>Advantage one is Maritime Domain Awareness:</u></strong><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Maritime domain awareness just took a huge step backwards – just switched from information objectives to intelligence based – cooperative data sharing like the plan is key.</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Morales 2/1</strong> (Cesar Morales, Maritime Domain Awareness Expert, Feb 1 2012, “A Step Backwards for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA),” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://gcaptain.com/step-maritime-domain-awareness/?39062" rel="nofollow">http://gcaptain.com/step-maritime-domain-awareness/?39062</a>, <em>azp</em>)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">On Jan 29th Rear Admiral (Select) Robert V. Hoppa, Director, National Maritime Intelligence Center, announced the renaming of the National Maritime Intelligence Center (NMIC) to the National Maritime Intelligence-Integration Office (NMIO). More important, and troubling, than the name change, is the consolidation of responsibilities… </span>The new NMIO will assume the responsibilities of the National Maritime Domain Awareness Coordination Office<span class="Underline"> (NMCO), which is currently charged with maritime information exchange within the unclassified sphere – NMCO was formerly known as the Office for Global Maritime Situational Awareness (OGMSA). </span>This consolidation of efforts, both illogical and unwise, is a significant step backwards for national MDA<span class="Underline">. Maritime Domain Awareness (<strong>MDA) is built on information sharing, not on intelligence exchange or integration</strong>. If asked, most mariners will tell what they need is ‘information,’ not ‘intelligence’- noting the distinct differences between the two. Where as ‘</span>intelligence’, by definition, is available to a select few<span class="Underline">, information moves freely, without restriction, among those that need and want it. As a former Chief of Naval Operations once stated, unclassified information exchange, and effective MDA, allows “the right people, to have the right information, at the right time….”. Clearly, </span>the efficient movement of maritime domain information should be the goal of national MDA.<span class="Underline"> In an affront to unclassified information exchange however, NMIO will work to coordinate all interagency MDA and information sharing – formerly the responsibility of the OGMSA/NMCO – behind the secure walls of in the Office of Naval Intelligence building in Suitland, MD. The OGMSA/NMCO, despite its failure as an interagency experiment (primarily due to budgetary limitations and the absence of interagency commitment), claimed several successes in enhancing national MDA by identifying interagency MDA capability gaps through the Interagency Solutions Analysis (IASA) and advancing the Maritime Safety &amp; Security Information System (</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">MSSIS</span><span class="Underline">)program. The Maritime Safety &amp; Security Information System (</span>MSSIS) is a freely-shared, unclassified, near real-time data collection and distribution network<span class="Underline">. </span>These successes were a direct result of<span class="Underline"> OGMSA/</span>NMCO’s focus on information exchange<span class="Underline"> in the unclassified environment – thus enabling OGSMA/NMCO to build relationships and networks within the vast spectrum of maritime stakeholders ranging from interagency and commercial entities to international partners. Relationships and networks enable information exchange and are therefore proven necessities for effective MDA. It remains to be seen how an intelligence organization (NMIO) will be able to facilitate the exchange of information between the numerous and varied members of the mariner community when only a fraction of these stakeholders have the ability to operate in a secure environment. Anyone who has operated with, or within, the walls of Suitland, knows that getting information to move outside those walls is a monumental, if not impossible task. It begs the question- how will an intelligence organization expand and enhance the networks critical to national MDA, if most of those networks are outside the IC community? Ultimately, </span>this move to create and rename a new MDA office is representative of the absence of alignment by the senior interagency leaders tasked with enhancing<span class="Underline"> and coordination of national </span>MDA<span class="Underline"> efforts. From the restructuring of the OGMSA to be the NMCO, to the creation of the NMIO and subsequent dismantling of the NMCO, these national MDA coordination efforts have been characterized by good intentions rather than by focused efforts. However, these MDA endeavors have proven that although many obstacles exist to effective information exchange, information exchange is the essential foundation for enhancing both MDA and national security. Sadly, placing this new NMIO <strong>MDA office behind the walls of Suitland results in not just another potential obstacle to information exchange, but a significant step backwards for national MDA.</strong> </span><br />

Hence, the same objectives can be driven together in a more profound way in using maritime terrorism to shape its core ideological goals. Evidence gathered from Jemaah Islamiyah and supported by <u>Al Qaeda</u> shows prove that the militant religious extremist group in this region <u>is indeed set out to make the Southeast Asia region an Islamic hegemony based on extremeness ideological beliefs</u>.xxiv In keeping with its ideological beliefs, JI will continue to act on all approaches in respect to the call for “Jihadism” towards the “West” and nations that are allied to the “West” in particular to the United States. <u>Singapore authorities uncovered plans of an attack on US naval vessels transiting the Johore Straits in 2001</u>. <u>Seized documents included maps; operational planning and video footage had been made for a maritime suicide attack on US naval ships</u>.xxv Information gathered from intelligence sources, as reported in the media, states that such possible maritime attacks are possible than initially imagined. The Director of Indonesia’s State Intelligence Agency in 2004 confirmed that such <u>attacks on shipping in the Straits of Malacca had been planned by captured JI operatives in detention who had admitted to it.</u>xxvi <u>US intelligence a</u>lso reported the same time that they had <u>intercepted</u> JI’s <u>communication activities revealing a plot to seize a vessel using local pirates</u>. <u>The possibility of using the vessel and arming it with explosives to either direct it towards another vessel or just sinking it in the busy sea route of the Straits is something not to be overlooked</u>.xxvii <strong><u>This clearly determines a clear interest for these militant groups operating in the Southeast Asia region to pursue maritime targets with pirates operating in the Straits of Malacca or even around the SEA region</u></strong>. In light of <u>Singapore’s</u> view on <u>the nexus of piracy and terrorism</u>, it is convinced by its intelligence report that <strong><u>piracy and terrorist have joined forces to target the island republics’ port and shipping facilities</u></strong> and hence in December of 2003 warned that <strong><u>an attack in the Straits is real and imminent</u></strong>. In the same statement it concluded that due to the number of pirate attacks at the southern end of the Straits made it extremely difficult to distinguish criminal acts of piracy from potential acts of terrorism and that no distinction should therefore be made between piracy and terrorism.xxviii The discourse from Singapore did not warrant a course of concern to either Malaysia or Indonesia, which viewed the issues as not a worrisome threat. <u>In 2000 the ASG landed on the island of Sipadan and kidnapped twenty-one Malaysian and foreign tourist from the resort island and took them hostage</u>. The incident was a watershed for <u>Malaysia</u>, has it <u>seemed incapable of safeguarding its sovereign territory from foreign intrusion</u>s. Prior to the press release on the above kidnappings and hostage takings, the authorities reported that it was “pure act of piracy” and it should not be considered as a terrorist operation. Further to this, <u>what was seen as a “pirate” attack, turned out to be a terrorist “modus-operandi”</u> in full fledge camouflage outfits when they literally landed on the island, equipped with semi and automatic weapons. The fact also remained that they did not take food and other essentials was something to be concerned about, as usually pirates will take whatever they can get their hands on. <u>The reality of these attacks can very well justify the means of terrorist groups operating within the Southeast Asia region to be of a major threat to maritime operations and attacks along the coastal waterways of Southeast Asian waters</u> on the Sea-Lines of Communication (SLOC).<br />

THE TRUTH is China is neither particularly militarily strong nor particularly domestically stable. <u>Beijing’s combative diplomacy was not spurred by American economic weakness in the wake of the recession, and it was far from an indicator of growing Chinese confidence</u>. On the contrary, in recent years Beijing has not deployed and operationalized significant new advanced naval capabilities, and its domestic economic environment is worse today than at any time since the onset of the post-Mao economic reforms in 1978. Beyond its coastal waters, China’s naval capability remains dependent on its advanced diesel submarines, which were first deployed in the mid-1990s. By 2000, China’s submarine force had already begun to pose a formidable challenge to U.S. naval operations in the western Pacific Ocean. But since then it has not deployed any additional naval capabilities that pose consequential new challenges to the U.S. Navy or to America’s defense of its security partners. China still cannot independently manufacture advanced military aircraft, and it has yet to deploy a single Chinese-designed advanced aircraft. The J-15 and J-20 fighter planes are still in development. It has finally launched its first aircraft carrier, but it does not have aircraft for the carrier. Its antipiracy naval operations off the coast of Somalia are basic. Its protection of its claims in the South China Sea depends on coast-guard ships. China is developing potentially effective advanced-technology maritime access-denial capabilities, including an improved missile capability, but none of it has yet been adequately tested, much less deployed. Its antiship ballistic-missile program is not operational. China’s space program is making great progress, but the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) hasn’t developed the capacity to significantly challenge U.S. space-based communication capabilities or hasn’t built its own space-based war-fighting capability. The PLA is developing drones and air-based radar systems, but again these and other such defense projects remain relatively primitive or experimental. China will continue to modernize its military capabilities, and it will eventually deploy advanced systems that may challenge U.S. security and regional stability, but <u>Beijing’s new diplomacy cannot be explained by thirty years of defense spending and military modernization. Nor does the strident diplomacy reflect Chinese economic confidence</u>. At the height of the global financial crisis, the Chinese economy continued to grow at approximately 10 percent per year. But beneath this facade of prosperity, <u>China’s economy was weakening significantly. In October 2008, as the global recession deepened, Chinese leaders unleashed a massive but dysfunctional stimulus program.</u> <u>Not only did it fail to resolve most of the deep-seated problems in the system, it also managed to foster many new</u> ones. Despite the stimulus, unemployment in China remains high in rural areas and among urban college graduates. In 2010, Premier Wen Jiabao estimated that there were 200 million unemployed Chinese. Moreover, during the past two years, inequality—by international standards—has become extremely high. As a result of the stimulus, inflation has soared, affecting the price of food, housing and transportation. By last year<u>, China’s property bubble had significantly worsened, the condition of national banks had deteriorated more than at any time in the past ten years and local government debt had skyrocketed</u>. <u>Economic growth has increasingly relied on government-stimulated investment, not on consumption—which fuels even-greater inflation. More worrying still, the state-owned sector is expanding at the expense of the private sector, thus undermining innovation while politicizing economic policy making. These are all protracted problems which together suggest that social instability in China will grow and that the Chinese Communist Party’s economic-based legitimacy will <strong>significantly</strong> <strong>erode</strong>.</u> Beijing’s problems are only exacerbated by the fact that the tools of Chinese repression are deteriorating. In the past five years, the number of spontaneous small- and large-scale demonstrations has mushroomed. More recently, the Internet has undermined the government’s ability to control information—and to minimize nationwide hostility toward the party. It has become an effective device for people to communicate their ire over unemployment and inflation, as well as over political and economic corruption, police brutality, criminal cover-ups, environmental degradation and property seizures. In addition, peer-to-peer microblogging (via Twitter and its Chinese equivalents) can facilitate large-scale, independent and impromptu mass protests. China made its first arrest for a microblog post back in September 2010 during the rallies against Japan’s detention of the Chinese fisherman. <strong><u>Economic instability and the erosion of the Communist Party’s control over society are occurring simultaneously</u></strong>. <u>This domestic weakness has forced the government to rely more and more on nationalism for regime legitimacy</u>—and it explains Beijing’s diplomatic blundering. As the Chinese people witness their relative position in the world increasing (particularly in light of the decline of Japan), <u>the United States is seen as the obstacle to China’s international acceptance as a great power, so that Washington is gradually replacing Tokyo as the focus of nationalist resentment.</u> With its influence waning, the party is now more vulnerable to growing strident nationalist opposition. Since January 2010, on the web and in newspapers, nationalists have demanded Chinese international assertiveness before the government can even consider a policy, putting Chinese leaders on the defensive. Indeed, in recent years nationalism has become more widespread in urban areas, infecting not just the military and disaffected youth but also workers, intellectuals, civilian leaders and businesspeople. Moreover, Internet communication technologies enable Chinese nationalists to interact with each other and can facilitate popular protests against Chinese foreign policy, thus magnifying the importance of nationalism and the danger it poses to regime stability. China’s insecure rulers, preoccupied with domestic stability, are thus compelled to pay evermore attention to nationalist triumphalism as they formulate foreign policy. For the first time since the death of Mao Tse-tung, Chinese leaders have had to choose between using nationalism and strident diplomacy to accommodate their domestic audience and using China’s peaceful-rise strategy to accommodate the international community. Until recently, China opted for the latter. But since 2009 the party’s effort to appease <u>China’s nationalists has resulted in a bumbling foreign policy that has aroused global animosity and undermined China’s security.</u> THIS NATIONALIST diplomacy bred considerable anxiety among America’s allies in East Asia. Did Washington have the will to sustain its strategic presence and balance China’s rise? A robust U.S. diplomatic response was in order. But <u>the United States went too far, challenging China’s security on its continental periphery, creating the potential for protracted great-power security conflict and heightened regional instabil</u>ity. <u>Following the North Korean sinking of the South Korean naval ship Cheonan in March 2010 and China’s failure to publicly condemn Pyongyang for the attack, the United States developed a series of effective initiatives in maritime East Asia designed to reaffirm its resolve to contend with the rise of China</u>. Many of these initiatives were necessary and constructive. In late June, for the first time since the end of the Cold War, three U.S. nuclear-powered submarines surfaced simultaneously in Asian ports. In July 2010, during former secretary of defense Robert Gates’s visit to Jakarta, the United States agreed to expand military cooperation with Indonesia. In November, during Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s trip to New Zealand, the United States agreed to reestablish full military cooperation with the Pacific island nation, despite New Zealand’s ban on visits by nuclear-powered ships to its ports. The United States expanded military relations with the Philippines and strengthened its commitment to the protection of Japan. During Sino-Japanese tension over the fishing-boat-captain incident, Hillary Clinton stated that the U.S.-Japan defense treaty covered military contingencies involving the disputed Senkaku Islands administered by Japan but also claimed by China. Subsequent to the release of the captain, Washington and Tokyo carried out their largest-ever joint naval exercise. Here then was a strong <u>America reassuring its allies—</u>this may have <u>encroached on China’s grand ambitions, but it was an expected and appropriate response</u>. But then there was the overly assertive Washington that launched, in Hillary Clinton’s formulation, its “forward-deployed diplomacy.” It was a volte-face of years of American policy, and it was seen as a growing—and very different sort of—challenge by Beijing. During the George W. Bush administration, the United States reduced its troops in South Korea by 40 percent, removed its forces deployed between the demilitarized zone and Seoul, dramatically reduced the size of the annual U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises and stated in the Department of Defense’s Quadrennial Defense Review that in 2012 the United States would transfer to Seoul operational command (OPCOM) of South Korean forces. These steps, regardless of the administration’s intentions, created a China that was more secure on its periphery. Now, the Obama administration has reversed course. The transfer of OPCOM to South Korea has been deferred for at least three years. Throughout 2010 the United States conducted a series of high-profile, large-scale military exercises with Seoul, including maritime drills in waters west of South Korea. Later in the year, the United States and South Korea signed the new “Guidelines for U.S.-ROK Defense Cooperation,” which called for enhanced combined exercises and interoperability between the two armed forces. These developments all suggested a determined U.S. interest in reestablishing a significant conventional military presence on the peninsula. <u>The U.S. security initiative with South Korea has eroded Beijing’s confidence over its strategic relationship with Seoul; China is now increasingly dependent on North Korea as its only reliable ally on the peninsula, and it has become more resistant to Korean unification for fear that it could lead to an expanded U.S. military presence closer to China’s borde</u>r<u>. Chinese leaders now place ever-greater value on stability in North Korea</u>. Rather than use its economic leverage on Pyongyang in cooperation with U.S. nonproliferation objectives, Beijing has increased its support of North Korean economic and political stability. And in July 2010, as a U.S.-South Korean naval exercise took place in the Yellow Sea, Hillary Clinton launched a new U.S. strategic initiative for Southeast Asia at an Asian regional-security meeting in Hanoi. After Washington held extensive consultations and planning with all of the claimants of the Spratly Islands except China, Secretary Clinton announced America’s support for a “collaborative diplomatic process” to resolve the dispute. The move constituted a sharp rebuke to Beijing, which has long claimed sovereignty over the territory, and suggested U.S. intervention in support of the other claimants, which have advocated multilateral negotiations. In addition, <u>the United States had previously expressed support for stability in the South China Sea, but only in Washington, DC, at the assistant-secretary level, and never through prior discussion with any of the involved nations. The administration’s forward-deployed diplomacy also includes strategic cooperation with Vietnam.</u> For over twenty years Washington parried Vietnamese overtures, understanding that Indochina is not a vital interest. Yet, in August, after Clinton’s support in Hanoi for Vietnamese resistance to Chinese maritime claims, the U.S. Navy, including the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, held a joint training exercise with the Vietnamese navy for the first time. In October, Secretary Gates visited Hanoi, where he proclaimed the potential for expanded U.S.-Vietnamese defense cooperation and his hope that Vietnam would continue to participate in military exercises with the United States. Later that month, Clinton returned to Hanoi and declared U.S. interest in developing a “strategic partnership” with Vietnam and in cooperating with the country on “maritime security.” She then visited Phnom Penh and urged Cambodia to establish greater foreign-policy independence from China. In addition, for the first time the United States expressed support for the Indochinese countries’ efforts to constrain Chinese use of the headwaters of the Mekong River. <u>Beijing is now intent on punishing Vietnam for its hubris in cooperating with the United States. It wants to compel Hanoi to accommodate Chinese power</u>. <u>In 2011 it escalated the frequency and scale of its armed harassment of Vietnamese fishing ships operating in disputed waters</u>, causing increased bilateral tension and damage to the Vietnamese fishing industry. China also stepped up its naval harassment of Philippine economic activities in disputed waters. But <u>in response, the United States has only reinforced its commitment to the Southeast Asian countries</u>. In July 2011 it held another military exercise with Vietnam. Then it again sent an aircraft carrier to visit the country, and the Pentagon reached its first military agreement with the Vietnamese military. The Pentagon is also assisting the Philippines’ maritime intelligence capabilities in the South China Sea. <u>China’s deputy foreign minister</u> Cui Tiankai recently <u>warned that some Southeast Asian countries were “playing with fire” and expressed his “hope that the fire will not be drawn to the United States.”</u> <strong><u>Washington is thus engaged in an increasingly polarized conflict in Southeast Asi</u></strong>a. But more important, independent of the course of the South China Sea maritime disputes, U.S. collaboration with Vietnam’s effort to use America to oppose China is not only costly but also foolish. Vietnam’s common land border with China, its maritime vulnerability to the Chinese navy and its economic dependency on Beijing ensure that the United States will not be able to develop meaningful defense cooperation with Vietnam. But <u>having engaged China in this regional diplomatic tussle, any U.S. effort to disengage from the island conflict by encouraging moderation on the part of its Southeast Asian partners would risk being viewed as a strategic retreat.</u> The Obama administration’s greater security cooperation with countries on the mainland’s perimeter is a disproportionate reaction to Chinese nationalism. It is not reflective of any recent improvements in Chinese naval capabilities that could challenge U.S. maritime dominance. Nor does it reflect an increased strategic importance of the Korean Peninsula or Indochina for U.S. security. Since 1997, the United States deployed increasing quantities of its most advanced weaponry to East Asia and consolidated security cooperation with its maritime security partners, all the while maintaining significant U.S.-China cooperation. That was a productive policy. But now Chinese leaders are reevaluating U.S. intentions. They have concluded that the United States is developing a forward-leaning policy of encirclement and containment. Regardless of Washington’s intent, recent American actions have provided ample evidence to support China’s claims. <u>BEIJING’S NATIONALIST diplomacy is dangerous. America’s ill-conceived response makes it even more so. China is militarily vulnerable to the United States, and the regime is vulnerable to internal instability</u>. At this point, Washington is embroiled in territorial disputes over worthless islands in the South China Sea and is expanding its strategic presence on China’s periphery. And <u>in an era when Chinese cooperation is increasingly important, Washington is needlessly challenging Chinese security.</u> Just as America expects China to restrain its security partners in the Middle East and Asia from exacerbating conflict with the United States, America has the responsibility to rein in its security partners as well. <u>The balance of power in East Asia is a vital national-security interest, and the United States must reassure its strategic partners that it will provide for their security, despite the rise of China.</u> <u>The United States military must continue to focus its weapons acquisitions and deployments on maintaining U.S. security in the region. The task at hand for American policy is to realize these objectives while maintaining U.S.-China cooperation</u>. Chinese nationalism will continue to challenge U.S. foreign policy for a long time to come. Thi<u>s will require the administration to acknowledge both America’s maritime superiority and China’s domestic and international vulnerabilities, and thus exercise confident restraint and resist overreaction to Beijing’s insecure leadership.</u> <br />

<strong>Waterways are a hair-trigger, lack of awareness makes conflict with China over energy inevitable.</strong> <br />

Fifth, <u>Asia’s growing energy demand is increasing the pressure on the sea lines of communication.</u> Nearly 50 mbpd of oil is shipped by tanker. <u>The growing number of oil tankers and LNG carriers coming from the Arabian Gulf will increase pressure on already congested strategic chokepoints</u>; specifically the Strait of Hormuz, the Indian Ove rview of Globa l and Asian Energy Trends 9 Ocean, the Malacca Strait, and the South China Sea. The Malacca Strait, in particular, is a crucial chokepoint for the dangerously high number of energy-related tankers transiting it. It is projected that <u>tanker traffic will at least double from 10 mbpd in 2004 to over 20 mbpd in 2020.</u> To ease pressure on the Malacca Strait, future tanker traffic could be partially routed through the Sunda or Lombok straits; or to avoid a destabilised Indonesia, they can be bypassed by sailing around Australia. However, natural gas transport cannot avoid the Indonesian archipelago, as the majority of LNG resources being exploited are centred in or around Indonesia, and the LNG carriers must also pass through the archipelago to reach the gas consumers: Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and, in the future, China. Sixth, <u>given Asia’s voracious demand for energy, countries will be faced with multiple energy fronts, as opposed to the one or two they faced in the past few years. For example, in a decade India could import gas from three or four direction</u>s - from the Middle East, Central Asia, Bangladesh, and Southeast Asia. Or in the case of <u>China, its energy is already coming from all directions - the Middle East, Central Asia, the Russian Far East, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Seventh, these multiple energy fronts will engender <strong>significant security</strong> <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> that present a wide range of military challenges</u>. <u>The growing dependence on long-haul sea lanes and offshore energy resources will ensure that energy strategies increasingly have a defensive military component, particularly with a naval focus</u>. <u>A growing pressure to protect energy transport routes will intensify if Indonesia destabilises or if incidents of maritime terrorism in the region increase</u>, which is also a growing concerns among the Asian states. Plans for ambitious pipelines projects, which are viewed as an alternative to dependence on the sea lanes, also present security challenges. The proposed pipelines are projected to cross rugged terrain, harsh climates, and politically unstable or remote areas. Pipelines linking the Russian Far East to China or Japan; Central Asia to China; the Caspian and Iran to India; or a complex gas pipeline network criss-crossing Southeast Asia could be targets for terrorist attacks or military competitors. This infrastructure will require protection and contingency plans for responding to disruptions. Even more vulnerable will be the expanding energy infrastructure across the region, such as refineries, LNG terminals, and sophisticated offshore exploration and production facilities throughout Southeast Asia, the South and East China seas, and the Bay of Bengal. These facilities cost millions, even billions of dollars, and in some cases, are located in remote locations, making them difficult to protect. American energy analysts argue that an attack on an LNG terminal, refinery, or offshore installation could take months to repair and bring back online and could cause severe environmental damage. In this context, <u>most regional militaries in Asia will face a growing energy security component to their missions. Such missions might include monitoring and protecting sea lanes from enhanced naval and missile threats as well as non-traditional threats, and defending energy infrastructures as a way to forestall threats or blackmail. If competition for energy resources increases, states may begin to develop an offensive component to their energy strategies, <strong>with the intent of targeting another’s energy security.</strong></u> <br />

<strong>War over the South China Sea escalates and causes extinction – cooperation solves.</strong> <br />
<strong>Wittner 11/30/11</strong> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">(Lawrence, Professor of History emeritus at SUNY/Albany, Is a Nuclear War With China Possible?, Huffington Post, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-wittner/nuclear-war-china_b_1116556.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-wittner/nuclear-war-china_b_1116556.html</a>, <em>azp</em>)</span><br />
<br />
While nuclear weapons exist, there remains a danger that they will be used. After all, for centuries international conflicts have led to wars, with nations employing their deadliest weapons. <u>The current deterioration of U.S. relations with China might end up providing us with yet another example of this phenomenon. The gathering tension between the United States and China is clear enough. Disturbed by China's growing economic and military strength, the U.S. government recently challenged China's claims in the South China Sea</u>, increased the U.S. military presence in Australia, and deepened U.S. military ties with other nations in the Pacific region. According to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, <u>the United States was &quot;asserting our own position as a Pacific power.&quot;</u> But need this lead to nuclear war? Not necessarily. And yet, there are signs that it could. After all, both the United States and China possess large numbers of nuclear weapons. The U.S. government threatened to attack China with nuclear weapons during the Korean War and, later, during their conflict over the future of China's offshore islands, Quemoy and Matsu. In the midst of the latter confrontation, President Dwight Eisenhower declared publicly, and chillingly, that <u>U.S. nuclear weapons would &quot;be used just exactly as you would use a bullet or anything else.&quot; Of course, China didn't have nuclear weapons then. Now that it does, perhaps the behavior of national leaders will be more temperate</u>. But the loose nuclear threats of U.S. and Soviet government officials during the Cold War, when both nations had vast nuclear arsenals, should convince us that, even as the military ante is raised, nuclear saber-rattling persists. Some pundits argue that nuclear weapons prevent wars between nuclear-armed nations; and, admittedly, there haven't been very many -- at least not yet. But <u>the Kargil War of 1999, between nuclear-armed India and nuclear-armed Pakistan, should convince us that such wars can occur. Indeed, in that case, the conflict almost slipped into a nuclear war</u>. Pakistan's foreign secretary threatened that, if the war escalated, his country felt free to use &quot;any weapon&quot; in its arsenal. <u>During the conflict, Pakistan did move nuclear weapons toward its border</u>, while India, it is claimed, readied its own nuclear missiles for an attack on Pakistan. At the least, though, don't nuclear weapons deter a nuclear attack? Do they? Obviously, NATO leaders didn't feel deterred, for, throughout the Cold War, NATO's strategy was to respond to a Soviet conventional military attack on Western Europe by launching a Western nuclear attack on the nuclear-armed Soviet Union. Furthermore, if U.S. government officials really believed that nuclear deterrence worked, they would not have resorted to championing &quot;Star Wars&quot; and its modern variant, national missile defense. Why are these vastly expensive -- and probably unworkable -- military defense systems needed if other nuclear powers are deterred from attacking by U.S. nuclear might? Of course, the bottom line for those Americans convinced that nuclear weapons safeguard them from a Chinese nuclear attack might be that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is far greater than its Chinese counterpart. Today, it is estimated that <u>the U.S. government possesses over 5,000 nuclear warheads, while the Chinese government has a total inventory of roughly 300. Moreover, only about 40 of these Chinese nuclear weapons can reach the United States. Surely the United States would &quot;win&quot; any nuclear war with China. But what would that &quot;victory&quot; entail? An attack with these Chinese nuclear weapons would immediately slaughter at least 10 million Americans in a great storm of blast and fire, while leaving many more dying horribly of sickness and radiation poisoning</u>. The Chinese death toll in a nuclear war would be far higher. <u>Both nations would be reduced to smoldering, radioactive wastelands. Also, radioactive debris sent aloft by the nuclear explosions would blot out the sun and bring on a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; around the globe</u> -- <u>destroying agriculture, creating worldwide famine, and generating chaos and destruction</u>. Moreover<u>, in another decade the extent of this catastrophe would be far worse. The Chinese government is currently expanding its nuclear arsenal, and by the year 2020 it is expected to more than double its number of nuclear weapons that can hit the United States</u>. The U.S. government, in turn, has plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars &quot;modernizing&quot; its nuclear weapons and nuclear production facilities over the next decade. To avert the enormous disaster of a U.S.-China nuclear war, <u>there are two obvious actions that can be take</u>n. The first is to get rid of nuclear weapons, as the nuclear powers have agreed to do but thus far have resisted doing. <u>The second</u>, conducted while the nuclear disarmament process is occurring<strong><u>, is to improve U.S.-China relations. If the American and Chinese people are interested in ensuring their survival and that of the world, they should be working to encourage these policies</u></strong>.<br />

<strong>Scenario two is the economy,</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Port terror collapses the global economy – the timeframe is three weeks.</strong><br />
<strong>Flynn</strong> <strong>03</strong> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">(Stephen, Natl Sec Studies, “The Fragile state of container security,” testimony before the senate, March 20 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication.html?id=573" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication.html?id=573</a>, <em>azp</em>)</span><br />
<br />
Based on statements by the key officials at U.S. Customs, the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Transportation, should a container be used as a “poor man’s missile,” the shipment of all containerized cargo into our ports and across our borders would be halted. As a consequence<u>, a modest investment by a terrorist could yield billions of dollars in losses to the U.S. economy by shutting down—even temporarily—the system that moves “just-in-time” shipments of parts and goods</u>. Given the current state of container security, it is hard to imagine how a post-event lock-down on container shipments could be either prevented or short-lived. <u>One thing we should have learned from the 9-11 attacks involving passenger airliners, the follow-on anthrax attacks, and even last fall Washington sniper spree is that terrorist incidents pose a special challenge for public officials</u>. In the case of most disasters, <u>the reaction by the general public is almost always to assume the event is an isolated one</u>. Even if the post-mortem provides evidence of a systemic vulnerability, <u>it often takes a good deal of effort to mobilize a public policy response to redress</u> it. But <u>just the opposite happens in the event of a terrorist attack</u>—especially one involving catastrophic consequences<u>. When these attacks take place, the assumption by the general public is almost always to presume a general vulnerability unless there is proof to the contrary.</u> Government officials have to confront head-on this loss of public confidence by marshalling evidence that they have a credible means to manage the risk highlighted by the terrorist incident. In the interim as recent events have shown, people will refuse to fly, open their mail, or even leave their homes. If a terrorist were to use a container as a weapon-delivery devise, the easiest choice would be high-explosives such as those used in the attack on the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Some form of chemical weapon, perhaps even involving hazardous materials, is another likely scenario. A bio-weapon is a less attractive choice for a terrorist because of the challenge of dispersing the agent in a sufficiently concentrated form beyond the area where the explosive devise goes off. A “dirty bomb” is the more likely threat vs. a nuclear weapon, but all these scenarios are conceivable since the choice of a weapon would not be constrained by any security measures currently in place in our seaports or within the intermodal transportation industry. This is why <u>a terrorist attack involving a cargo container could cause such profound economic disruption. An incident triggered by even a conventional weapon going off in a box could result in a substantial loss of life. In the immediate aftermath, the general public will want reassurance that one of the many other thousands of containers arriving on any given day will not pose a similar</u> risk. The President of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other keys officials responsible for the security of the nation would have to stand before a traumatized and likely skeptical American people and outline the measures they have in place to prevent another such attack. In the absence of a convincing security framework to manage the risk of another incident, <u>the public would likely insist that all containerized cargo be stopped until adequate safeguards are in place.</u> Even with the most focused effort, constructing that framework from scratch could take months—even years. Yet, <strong><u>within three weeks, the entire worldwide intermodal transportation industry would effectively be brought to its knees—as would much of the freight movements that make up international trade.</u></strong><br />

Less intuitive is how <strong><u>periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict.</u></strong> Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson's (1996) <u>work on leadership cycle theory, finding that rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next.</u> As such, exogenous shocks such as <strong><u>economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power</u></strong> (see also Gilpin. 1981) <u>that leads to <strong>uncertain</strong><strong>ty</strong> about power balances, increasing the risk of <strong>miscalculation</strong></u> (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, <u>even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising <strong>power</strong> <strong>may seek to challenge a declining power</strong></u> (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland's (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests <u>that 'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states</u>. He argues <u>that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an <strong>optimistic view of future trade</strong> <strong>relations</strong></u>. However<u>, if the expectations of future trade decline</u>, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, <u>the likelihood for conflict increases,</u> as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. <u>Crises could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations</u> either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, <u>others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level</u>. Blomberg and Hess (2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write: The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. <strong><u>Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour.</u></strong> Moreover, the <u>presence of a recession tends to <strong>amplify</strong> the extent to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other.</u> (Blomberg &amp; Hess, 2002. p. 89) <u>Economic decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism</u> (Blomberg, Hess, &amp; Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. &quot;Diversionary theory&quot; suggests that, <u>when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect.</u> Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that <u>the tendency towards diversionary tactics are <strong>greater for democratic states</strong></u> than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that <u>periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an <strong>increase in the use of force</strong></u>. In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels.5 This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.<br />

Although it is a matter of debate whether ports present legitimate, high-value targets for terrorists, <u>the occurrence of various scenarios at ports could adversely affect the smooth flow of seaborne trade and therefore global trade</u>. <u>The toppling of structures</u> like super post-Panamax cranes due to sabotage <u>could halt quay operations and cause berthing delays for ships and processing delays for carg</u>o. <u>The discovery of a shipment of weapons</u> of mass destruction (WMD) materials such as uranium f<u>or the purpose of mounting terrorist attacks and even terrorist personnel inside container boxes can trigger the kind of panic and frantic response that can <strong>paralyse the global maritime supply chain</strong></u>.2 <u>A suicide attack on a</u> chemical <u>tanker</u> or crude oil tanker at the entrance channel of a busy port <u>could result in its closure and disrupt shipping traffic and cargo delivery</u>. <u>All these could lead to bottlenecks forming along the maritime supply chain whose efficiency depends on the efficient running of its various sub-chains and components along it. A breakdown anywhere along the chain – as can arise from a single incident or a combination of several incidents – could disrupt the flow of the goods.</u> <br />

Back in 1748, Baron de Montesquieu observed that &quot;. <strong><u>Peace is the natural effect of trade</u></strong> <u>Two nations who differ with each other become <strong>reciprocally dependent</strong></u>; for if one has an interest in buying, the other has an interest in selling; and thus <u>their union is founded on their mutual necessities</u>.&quot; If Mr. Montesquieu is correct that trade promotes peace, then <u>protectionism</u> – a retreat from open trade – <strong><u>raises the chances of war</u></strong>. Plenty of empirical evidence confirms the wisdom of Montesquieu's insight: <u>Trade does indeed promote peace</u>. During the past 30 years, Solomon <u>Polachek</u>, an economist at the State University of New York at Binghamton, <u>has researched the relationship between trade and peace.</u> In his most recent paper on the topic, he and co-author Carlos Seiglie of Rutgers University review the massive amount of research on trade, war, and peace. They find that &quot;<strong><u>the overwhelming evidence indicates that trade reduces conflict</u></strong>.&quot; Likewise for foreign investment. <u>The greater the amounts that foreigners invest in the United States, or the more that Americans invest abroad, the lower is the likelihood of war between America and those countries with which it has investment relationships</u>. Professors Polachek and Seiglie conclude that, &quot;The policy implication of our finding is that <strong><u>further international cooperation in reducing barriers to both trade and capital flows can promote a more peaceful world</u></strong>.&quot; Columbia University political scientist Erik Gartzke reaches a similar but more general conclusion: <u>Peace is fostered by economic freedom. Economic freedom certainly includes, but is broader than, the freedom of ordinary people to trade internationally</u>. It includes also low and transparent rates of taxation, the easy ability of entrepreneurs to start new businesses, the lightness of regulations on labor, product, and credit markets, ready access to sound money, and other factors that encourage the allocation of resources by markets rather than by government officials. Professor Gartzke ranks countries on an economic-freedom index from 1 to 10, with 1 being very unfree and 10 being very free. He then examines military conflicts from 1816 through 2000. His findings are powerful: <u>Countries that rank lowest on an economic-freedom index</u> – with scores of 2 or less – <u>are 14 times more likely to be involved in military conflicts than are countries whose people enjoy significant economic freedom</u> (that is, countries with scores of 8 or higher). Also important, the findings of Polachek and Gartzke improve our understanding of the long-recognized reluctance of democratic nations to wage war against one another. These scholars argue that the so-called democratic peace is really the capitalist peace. Democratic institutions are heavily concentrated in countries that also have strong protections for private property rights, openness to foreign commerce, and other features broadly consistent with capitalism. That's why the observation that any two democracies are quite unlikely to go to war against each other might reflect the consequences of capitalism more than democracy. And that's just what the data show. Polachek and Seiglie find that openness to trade is much more effective at encouraging peace than is democracy per se. Similarly, Gartzke discovered that, &quot;When measures of both economic freedom and democracy are included in a statistical study, economic freedom is about 50 times more effective than democracy in diminishing violent conflict.&quot; These findings make sense. By <u>promoting prosperity, economic freedom gives ordinary people a large stake in peace.</u> <u>This prosperity is threatened during wartime</u>. <u>War almost always gives government more control over resources and imposes the burdens of higher taxes, higher inflation</u>, <u>and other disruptions of the everyday commercial relationships that support prosperity</u>. When commerce reaches across political borders, the peace-promoting effects of economic freedom intensify. Why? It's bad for the bottom line to shoot your customers or your suppliers, so <strong><u>the more you trade with foreigners the less likely you are to seek, or even to tolerate, harm to these foreigners.</u></strong><br />

<span class="Underline">The result has been </span>growing chaos on the Liberian side of the border<span class="Underline">, where </span>the flow of refugees increased by 90 percent <span class="Underline">in February. In just the last two weeks, the number of people who have entered Liberia from the Ivory Coast has jumped from 30,000 to 100,000. In the Ivory Coast, at least 200,000 have fled their homes in Abidjan, bringing the total number of displaced in the country to around 370,000. In thecountry's interior, the United Nations has very limited access to them. Meanwhile, U.N. agencies in the Liberian capital of Monrovia say they have contingency plans for housing as many as 250,000 refugees. But civilians aren't the only ones crossing the border. The U.N.'s top envoy in Liberia, Ellen Margaret Loj, confirmed that armed Ivorian fighters from both sides of the emerging conflict have recently attempted to enter the country. &quot;</span>Some [were] trying apparently to use Liberia as a transit to re-enter into Cote d'Ivoire,others to come in and see if there were any defected fighter<span class="Underline">s among the refugees,&quot; she told me on March 9. The U.N. mission in Liberia, UNMIL, has so far turned those combatants away -- at least at formal border crossings. But along an unmanned, largely forested border that stretches across four Liberian counties, neither the United Nations nor the local military and police can be everywhere. Many fear that Liberia's hard-earned disarmament over the past several years may be put into jeopardy, Loj said. &quot;The worry both on my side but certainly even more so on the government side is that people will come in with weapons from Cote d'Ivoire.&quot; In recent days, the number of men and boys among the refugee flows, which were originally dominated by women and children, has skyrocketed in what U.</span>N. officials say is a sign of how intense the fighting has become<span class="Underline">. Sulaiman Momodu, the local spokesman for UNHCR, the U.N. relief agency, told me on March 9 that many of these young men left for fear of being conscripted into pro- or anti-Gbagbo forces. Others, Momodu said, had seen fighting directly or heard gunfire. For now, Ouattara's troops are controlling the Ivorian side of the border with Liberia, but refugees from both political affiliations are literally running for their lives. Meanwhile, some Liberians are said to be going in the other direction. According to local radio reports and secondhand accounts, former combatants and other jobless young men are heading across the border to fight, lured by the promise of cold, hard cash. UNMIL can't confirm those rumors, Loj told me, &quot;but I'm sure there's some truth to them.&quot; Certainly, money could lure plenty of recruits here in Liberia, where the vast majority are not formally employed, particularly in rural areas. During its disarmament program, the U.N. partnered with NGOs and the government to offer ex-combatants vocational training, but many are still without work. </span>Former soldiers are jobless, too<span class="Underline">, ever since the army -- tainted by the atrocities it committed during the decade and a half of fighting -- was disbanded after the war. The newly recruited and trained security forces that replaced them </span>are<span class="Underline"> still </span>struggling to maintain order<span class="Underline">. There are about 4,000 Liberian police, for example, but they don't yet operate independently, and their UNMIL trainers readily admit that outside Monrovia, police operations are even more remedial. In response to the violence and the refugee situation, UNMIL has redeployed some forces to the border, and four units of armed policemen (most police in Liberia are not armed) have been moved there as well. Relief workers seem overwhelmed by the burgeoning crisis. The U.N. refugee agency originally requested funds for the operation based on a maximum refugee population of 50,000 -- only half of the number present in Liberia's border region now. Of the nearly $19 million that the U.N. says it needs for the operation to function, only 10 percent of that -- $1.9 million -- is in hand. &quot;We are losing the battle on the CNN effect. [In Libya,] geopolitical interests are more acute,&quot; says Isabel Crowley, UNICEF country director in Liberia, who expressed frustration that the situation in the Ivory Coast has failed to capture headlines. &quot;If we don't get funds, people are going to start to die.&quot; </span>Supplies of food and water are running desperately low.<span class="Underline"> At the moment, the U.N. World Food program has enough provisions to feed some 72,000 people for 15 days at the rate of one meal per person per day; new supplies won't arrive until April 1. As for water, U.N. agencies and humanitarian organizations say they can meet the emergency needs of about 30,000 people and long-term needs of just 8,000. Worse yet, the rainy season will begin in a matter of months, making roads inaccessible and raising transportation costs. UNHCR has constructed one refugee camp, but only about 650 refugees have relocated there. Most of the refugees in Liberia are still close to the border, many camping outside or finding temporary shelter in schools or churches, says Crowley. Others are being taken into the homes of local Liberians, many of whom are the same ethnicity. The welcome wears out fast, however. &quot;</span>We already have reports of tension between the refugee community and the host community<span class="Underline">,&quot; Loj reports. &quot;You can be generous, but only so long when you have nothing to share, and then you start bickering and arguing, and we are watching that very carefully because it has the potential of threatening the security situation.&quot; Local radio stations are a mouthpiece for those fears, as talk shows feature local residents discussing their anxieties that incoming refugees will take scarce resources or jobs. In Liberia, all this is taking place against the backdrop of an upcoming presidential election in October. The incumbent, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female leader and a darling of international donors, has significant support, but her victory is far from a done deal. &quot;If you analyze this, the situation in Cote d'Ivoire is a result of elections, disputed elections,&quot; Momodu of UNHCR said. &quot;So as Liberia heads toward elections, there is a genuine fear in the population that what has happened in Cote d'Ivoire could also happen here.&quot; </span>Things in the Ivory Coast are likely to get worse before they get better<span class="Underline">. On March 10, Gbagbo rejected an African Union deal that would have created a unity government including both him and Ouattara, but with Ouattara as the official president. Other pressure on Gbagbo to resign has come to naught. Threats from the regional West African economic community, ECOWAS, to use force if necessary to remove Gbagbo have dimmed as regional giant Nigeria prepares for its own tricky elections in April. The one hope of the international community has been that economic sanctions could cripple Gbagbo's ability to pay his loyal military and civil service, come hell or high water. But he still seems to have cash. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Apandemic will kill off all humans</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.6667px;">. In the past, humans have indeed fallen victim to viruses. Perhaps the best-known case was the bubonic plague that killed up to one third of the European population in the mid-14th century (7). </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">While vaccines have been developed for the plague and some other infectious diseases, new viral strains are constantly emerging — a process that maintains the possibility of a pandemic-facilitated human extinction. Some</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.6667px;">surveyed students </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">mentioned AIDS as a potential pandemic-causing virus</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.6667px;">. It is true that scientists have been unable thus far to find a sustainable cure for AIDS, mainly due to HIV’s rapid and constant evolution. Specifically, two factors account for the virus’s abnormally high mutation rate: 1. HIV’s use of reverse transcriptase, which does not have a proof-reading mechanism, and 2. the lack of an error-correction mechanism in HIV DNA polymerase (8). Luckily, though, there are certain characteristics of HIV that make it a poor candidate for a large-scale global infection: HIV can lie dormant in the human body for years without manifesting itself, and AIDS itself does not kill directly, but rather through the weakening of the immune system. However, for more easily transmitted viruses such as influenza, the evolution of new strains could prove far more consequential.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The simultaneous occurrence of antigenic drift</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.6667px;">(point mutations that lead to new strains) </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">and antigenic shift</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.6667px;">(the inter-species transfer of disease) </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">in the</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.6667px;">influenza </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">virus could produce a new version of influenza for which scientists may not immediately find a cure</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.6667px;">.

The most recent scare of this variety came in 1918 when bird flu managed to kill over 50 million people around the world in what is sometimes referred to as the Spanish flu pandemic. Perhaps even more frightening is the fact that only 25 mutations were required to convert the original viral strain — which could only infect birds — into a human-viable strain (10).</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Only a few years ago, the waters off Nigeria were the deadliest in the world. Currently the Gulf of Guinea is second only to Somali waters in numbers of attacks at sea, with some 32 pirate strikes reported in the first nine months of 2009. In early 2010, J. Peter Pham, director of the Africa Project at the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, observed that, “The International Maritime Board reports any movement against ships on the Gulf of Aden, but you don’t have the same data from the Gulf of Guinea, there are fishing boats attacked at dockside or close to shore, which don’t meet the definition of piracy on the high seas, and if you add all that, the number of attacks certainly would be equal to those off Somalia.”48 Indeed, the International Maritime Organization believes that </span>piracy and robbery at sea is grossly under-reported. Piracy and other attacks at sea do not merely affect large foreign vessels transiting the area, it targets small local operators as well<span class="Underline">. In 2008, for example, the high number of armed robberies at sea and the lack of a law enforcement response capability spurred a refusal by Nigerian trawlers to leave dock. Many </span>raids at sea are intended tosteal cargo<span class="Underline"> or hold it for ransom, others are kidnappings for money, still, other incidents are reportedly political attacks on the Nigerian oil sector. The motives for piracy in West Africa are diverse, but some experts report that it is fostered by anger and the absence of opportunity as the result of poaching and encroachment. Moreover, it’s tolerated by local communities because illicit actors spread money around to win public support. A growing number of U.S., British, and French ships are patrolling the Gulf of Guinea and conduct joint exercises with the navies of Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Cameroon. But according to some experts, “the scale of the problem has become so vast, and the capabilities of local navies so small, even local officials admit that the pirates have the upper hand.”49 A task force from the Center for Strategic and International Studies reports that, Countries lack adequate surveillance or response capacity to counter piracy and other crimes at sea.50 </span>The ability of West African nations to counter piracy is also limited by insufficient domain awareness, inadequate early warning and intelligence, th<span class="Underline">e lack of a credible deterrent, deficient response capability, and the inability to sustain patrol operations with sufficient reach over extended periods of time. Moreover, a 2010 UNODC report states that, “West African countries currently do not have the adequate legislative framework and enforcement capacities to address such a complex crime where legal obstacles are plenty and action requires important logistics and specialized know how…”51 </span><br />

Maritime resourcesare<span class="Underline"> vital both to the ecology and economy of West African nations. Pollution and poaching impede regional development and deprive citizens of material and financial resources. Such deprivation intensifies public dissatisfaction with ruling regimes, further ripening conditions for regional instability, humanitarian crisis, insurgency, and terrorist exploitation. Poaching. Seafood is one of the region’s leading exports as well as job creators. The fisheries sector in West Africa accounts for more than 5,600,000 jobs and the total value of seafood exports is estimated to be more than $711 million.78 </span>Unregulated and illegal fishing poses a serious and growing threat to the region’s fishing industry and its food security<span class="Underline">. Illegal fishing accounts for a loss of revenue to sub-Saharan Africa of approximately $1 billion annually79 and enormous human costs, given that fish account for the majority of protein intake in West African nations.80 International environmental groups that have studied illegal fishing in the region call the practice in the Gulf of Guinea “the worst in Africa,” which makes it the worst in the world,81 and report that illegal trawlers fish off the coast of West Africa 24 hours a day.82 These trawlers not only steal fish but drag nets and chains along the seabed, damaging ocean habitats as well as fouling the nets of local fisherman. Incidents have been reported of illegal trawlers running over smaller boats and killing local fishermen.83 As many as 60 percent of the fishing trawlers off the coast of the Gulf of Guinea are unlicensed and include European and Asian fleets.84 A single trawler load of fish can net vast sums of money in world markets, a strong incentive particularly when poachers know that the risk of being caught and punished is slim. <strong>The ability to curb these practices is hampered by the severely limited awareness of activity in the maritime domain</strong></span>,<span class="Underline"> lack of capacity to interdict offenders, and inability to enforce the rule of law. Pollution. In addition to the harm caused by poaching, </span>significant environmental damage has been inflicted on the region by pollution<span class="Underline"> from oil development operations and the illicit dumping of solid, electronic, </span>and hazardous waste <span class="Underline">in West African waters. Oil. The Niger Delta, with its 606 oilfields is widely recognized as the world capital of oil pollution.85 The UN Development Program reports that between 1976 and 2001, more than 6,800 oil spills were recorded in Nigeria. The amount of oil spilled annually in Nigerian waters is equivalent to the amount of oil that leaked into the Gulf of Mexico from the British Petroleum Deepwater Horizon disaster.86 The majority of the spills are the result of leakage and illegal tampering with pipelines. Shell recently admitted to spilling 14,000 tons of oil in the Niger Delta in 2009. The company claims that 98 percent of its oil spills are the result of vandalism, theft, or sabotage with only a minimal amount attributable to deteriorating infrastructure. In some cases the spills are caused by locals seeking to create cleanup jobs. Shell reported that in 2009 one of the company’s pipelines was peppered with 300 illegal taps.87 Regardless of the cause, </span>oil pollution is a significant hazard to fish stocks and their habitat. Its effects can deplete the food supply,destroying subsistence fishing and other sea-based livelihoods<span class="Underline"> as well as contaminating the water supply of local populations. In a related issue, gas flaring in the Niger Delta, the practice of burning off natural gas brought to the surface when pumping oil, is a serious environmental hazard and poses a significant health risk to local populations. Moreover it has impaired soil fertility in surrounding farmlands diminishing agricultural output. Medical studies have shown that the gas burning in the Niger Delta region contributes to the low average life expectancy of its inhabitants—43 years.88 West Africa’s large proven reserves and enormous energy potential, in combination with growing global demand for oil, ensure that the pace of exploration and development will continue to quicken. <strong>These trends will increase the need to ensure that energy development activities are conducted with proper security and environmental oversight</strong>. Waste. As environmental laws in industrialized countries become stricter, </span>waste-generating industries are searching for a “path of least resistance<span class="Underline">” to dispose of hazardous waste.89 “This search has led industries and the governments of developed and industrialized nations to focus on exporting these wastes to developing countries— especially sub-Saharan African countries.”90 Traffickers in electronic and toxic waste are typically professional disposal companies from industrialized nations or contractors, typically with ethnic ties to the destination country, who dump significant amounts of waste at sea where detection is difficult and enforcement lax.91 Exporters commonly falsify customs papers and invoices and even when the destination country has agreed to the dumping the public it is not made aware and it will for the most part be denied if it ever becomes public knowledge. Frequently e-waste traffickers make money on both ends: they are paid to remove the waste from an industrialized nation and then profit from selling “salvageable” material in West Africa.92 According to the UNODC, approximately 95,000 tons of e-waste arrives in West Africa annually.93 Nigeria and Ghana are the primary importers of electronic waste, including used cell phones and computer parts. While electronic waste imports are usually purported to be for the purpose of refurbishing defunct equipment, only a small fraction of these materials is rehabbed and reused. The remainder enters the waste stream often at sea. The United Nations estimates that between 30 percent and 75 percent of electronic goods imported are in fact waste.94 This is a troubling statistic, given that an average computer can contain up to 1,000 toxins, including lead, cadmium, mercury, and other heavy metals hazardous to human health and the environment.95 The multinational oil-trading firm Trafigura is currently on trial for illegally exporting hazardous waste to Cote d’Ivoire.96 In a settlement reached out of court in 2009, the company agreed to pay $45 million to more than 30,000 people who had health problems related to the company’s illegal waste dumping. This settlement was in addition to a $200 million payment made to the government of Cote d’Ivoire by Trafigura in 2007.97 An additional judgment involving Trafigura is expected to be issued by Dutch courts in the near future. </span><br />

<br />
The potential for international collaboration in space to materially improve maritime security was recently articulated by Guy Thomas, Science and Technology Advisor for the US Coast Guard: “The maritime entities of the world, military, civil, and private alike looked at their situation in the new reality (after 9/11/2001) and quickly understood their vulnerabilities and the potential consequences. Since that terrible day a number of national and international organizations have addressed how to protect their maritime assets, both individually, and in growing numbers, collectively. Most saw increased maritime domain awareness (MDA) as of first importance to the smooth functioning of commerce on the world’s oceans, the crucial supporting frame of the world’s economy, and crucial to their national interests. The potential unique contributions of current and planned space systems, owned by a wide range of nations and available to many others, to international global maritime awareness is a subject of growing interest to many.” <u>1Knowing where ships are located is a necessary element of Maritime Domain Awareness, though not sufficient in itself to achieve an “effective understanding</u>” 2 of maritime activity and its impact on safety, security, the environment and the economy. <u>Current practice relies on a diverse set of sensors to garner the positions of ships; a fundamental contribution to the art and practice of ship tracking can be credited to the International Maritime Organization</u>, which in 2004 mandated the use of an Automatic Ship Identification System (AIS) for many commercially important ships. <u>AIS is a “self-reporting” system that broadcasts each participating ship’s identity and position</u> (among many data fields) over VHF channels; the original intent was to provide collision-avoidance information to nearby ships and shore stations. 3 Shortly after the IMO carriage requirements became effective, the US Navy in the Mediterranean began to collaborate with European and African governments to establish a network of shore stations, all of which contributed the AIS signals they received locally to a consolidated data stream, which was then shared among participating nations. This Maritime Safety and Security Information System (MSSIS) has since grown into a network of over 100 AIS base stations in over 60 participating nations around the world, providing current positions for over 15,000 ships. The major strengths of this innovative collaboration are the trust and interdependence it generates, and of course, an unprecedented picture of maritime activity. The major shortcomings are the limited set of ships broadcasting AIS, and the limited reception range for VHF signals; no data is received from non-cooperative vessels, or from the open oceans or areas near nonparticipating nations. Herein lies the key point made by Guy Thomas: the entire planet is “visible” from space, and many of the sensors (including AIS receivers) needed for a much more complete picture of maritime activity are already on orbit or planned. That <u>space will be the key enabler for truly global situational awareness is suggested by the exceptional composite image of the earth at night</u> (Figure 1). Lights which are clearly visible from space define the “wired” world, served by grid electricity and more recently, internet connectivity. This leaves the oceans, the polar regions, deserts and jungles “unwired” and often undergoverned. <u>Moving data out of these areas, which comprise roughly 84% of the Earth’s surface, is important: a key strategic principle in warfare is to deny the enemy sanctuary, and for illicit activities ranging from illegal trafficking to training terrorists, sanctuary is found in the unwired world</u>. Quite separate from the challenge of moving data out of unwired areas is the related question of generating that data in remote regions; this will be addressed with a review of the State of the Art in unattended sensors in the context of the business case for small satellite systems. <u>This article will focus on the “bent pipe” link that can connect the “unwired” and “wired” regions of the world via satellite, using AIS data as a convenient example of interesting data that is routinely generated by ships that are only in the “wired” world when they are pier-side or close to a shore-based AIS receive</u>r. <u>This will allow us to develop a concept for collaboration in space with a concrete use-case, that being to extend the current AIS picture from regional near-shore areas to the entire world</u>. Additional utility can be had if the data collection and transport backbone in space, which handles AIS data, would also handle data signals from maritime and terrestrial sensors that transmit short bursts of data.<br />
<br />
<strong>The technology exists but fails because it isn’t space based – synthesis of automatic identification systems with synthetic radar imagery solves.</strong> <br />

<br />
<u>AIS signals can easily be detected from space</u> by a standard AIS receiver for altitudes up to 1000 km. However, an <u>AIS sensor in space would cover a much larger area on the ground</u> than the AIS system was originally designed for. With many ships within the field of view, interference problems will occur and AIS messages from some of the ships may not be detected. Detailed analyses of the ship detection probability have been performed. Important parameters for the ship detection probability were found to be; the reporting interval ΔT, the observation time Tobs, and the number of ships within the field of view. <u>A single satellite at 1000 km altitude</u> (Tobs=15 min) <u>would be able to handle up to 900 ships</u> within the field of view with a ship <u>detection probability of better than 99%,</u> with a ship reporting interval of ΔT=6 s.75 Depending on traffic density, the <u>capability of the AIS-based satellite constellation</u> to handle a larger number of ships <u>can be increased</u> by increasing the number of satellites, lowering the height of the satellite, increasing the reporting interval and / or increasing the observation time. Aerial based AIS is capable of providing ship detection capability of more than 99% at 1000 km, if the number of ships does not exceed its maximum capacity of target handling. Therefore, <u>a constellation of 18 LEO satellites would be able to provide an update of every ship across the globe every 15 minutes, but would still not be able to provide continuous identification capability in time domain for establishing MST. However, if the same LEO satellites are fitted with both SAR and AIS, then these satellites can definitely provide near-real MST.</u> <br />

<br />
<u>A GLOBAL FOCUS IS NEEDED,</u> TOO <u>From the US perspective, relationships that have worked domestically also must be applied <strong>internationally</strong></u>. As former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead repeatedly emphasised: “Personal trust is indispensible to partnerships at home and abroad – trust cannot be surged.” The US MDA community of interests is based on tile understanding that <u>a global perspective based on trust is needed to ensure that we can detect and deal with threats that originate in or take advantage of the vastness of the oceans</u>. <u>Only through collaboration and cooperation will we be able to ensure that these global threats and challenges can be dealt with as far from our shores as possible</u>. To deal with these threats and challenges, <u>world Navies and Coast Guards require accurate and timely information on what is occurring in their maritime areas of operations</u>. In regional and global perspectives, a <u>shared awareness of activities within the maritime domain is key to mutual success.</u> <u>MDA thus is critical for success against all threats in maritime regions, anywhere</u>. Information sharing is thus a key focus of the USN’s efforts to build trust and strengthen MDA partnerships. “There are two aspects of these MDA partnerships”, Titley said. “First, we need partnerships to enable access and build on local knowledge of the maritime environment, to know what’s going on in coastal states’ EEZ and territorial seas, in ports and harbours, and in ships and cargoes. <u>The MDA supply chain has greater reach than the coastal/littoral environment and extends to internal waters and even landlocked states</u>, <u>where threats to our security, which use the seas as means of conveyance, can originate</u>.” “Second,” he noted, “<strong><u>these MDA partnerships serve as an entry point for broader relationships that can enhance security across the board</u></strong>. <u>We have common interests and we confront common threats and challenges. We can expand and improve shared capacity and capabilities to defeat common threats and challenges and safeguard common interests</u>.” “<u>Acquiring and sharing information and intelligence with a broad array of global maritime partners sustains cooperation and builds the trust required to ensure the safety, security and economic vitality of all who hold membership within global maritime community of interest</u>“, he said. “The trust is not built over night, but through sustained collaboration and security cooperation measures and processes, such as the Maritime Safety and Security Information System [MSSIS].” MSSIS is a freely shared, unclassified, near real-time data collection and distribution network. Its member countries share data from Automatic Identification Systems CAIS), coastal radar, and other maritime-related systems. <u>MSSIS promotes multilateral collaboration and data sharing among international participants, with a primary goal of increasing maritime security and safety</u> (see figure 3). “International efforts [also] include participation in exercises like TRIDENT WARRIOR’ II,” Titley added. “We partnered with the United Kingdom and France to successfully share maritime information using internationally agreed upon National Information Exchange Model-Maritime [NIEM-M] common data standards and models.” NIEM is a joint Department of Justice/Department of Homeland Security programme started in 2005, created to promote standardisation of information exchange for cross-jurisdictional inforn1ation sharing. NIEM provides the tools used across DRS for enabling interoperability at the data layer within and across systems supporting information sharing, while preserving investments in current technology and optimising new technology development. Another example is the Global Maritime Partnership Game held in October 2010 at the US Naval War College. Senior-level representatives from more than 40 nations attended, mostly from Navies and Coast Guards. But, other representatives were from agencies that are considered key contributors to MDA, e.g., customs and border security, port authorities, fisheries enforcement, and search and rescue organisations. “In fact”, Titley underscored, “<u>every nation with a coastline and a willingness to share information can play important roles in local, regional and global maritime security</u>. <u>Every coastal state comes to the table with assets that can make important contributions to security</u>. These don’t have to be aircraft carrier strike groups.” <u>The issue of classified or sensitive data continues to be a concern</u>. Within constraints, however, the <u>USN intends to share as widely as possible accurate and timely information to shape our and our partners’ ability to protect important interests in the maritime domai</u>n. <u>Most countries, including the United States, require additional assets to increase and sustain presence for maritime security. Increasingly, this means active and energetic engagement in regional and global partnerships</u>. <strong><u>Partnerships reduce requirements spread responsibilities</u></strong>, <u>and give small nations equal status</u>. <u>MDA is an organising principle for world Navies and coast guards.</u> <u>It brings us all to a common table</u>. And, there appears to be a growing need to link these and other partnerships together into regional and global systems, as illustrated figure 4. <strong><u>Effective MDA will be the keystone of cooperative US and international efforts to counter maritime threats through regional and global partnerships</u></strong>, according to Titley. “Because certain risks and interests are common, <u>facilitation of regional maritime partnerships occurs with full recognition and acceptance that our allies and partner nations may not share all of our goals, but we’ll find common purpose in countering transnational threats and securing peaceful use of the maritime commons.”</u><br />

<br />
With International Maritime Organization regulations now mandating that ships weighing more than 300 metric tons carry on-board terminals to beam ship identity, cargo, speed and heading data to the coast, satellite-based AIS requires no special technology added to ship fleets. Instead, it extends what coastal radars now do, permitting coastal authorities to review data on all ships in their region even when the vessels are in mid-ocean. The U.S. <u>Coast Guard gave Orbcomm an initial contract to test the</u> Orbcomm <u>AIS service, a contract that ended in late 2010 when the last of six AIS-equipped satellites failed in orbit</u>.<br />
