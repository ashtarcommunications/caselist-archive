Plan: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence in South Korea.<br />
<br />
Contention 1 – The Status Quo<br />
<br />
War Now – Provocations will continue and worsen throughout 2011<br />
The Chosunilbo, Editorial, 2/21/2011, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:426:http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/02/21/2011022101263.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/02/21/2011022101263.html" rel="nofollow">http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/02/21/2011022101263.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:426 --><br />
The latest developments in North Korea since the breakdown of cross-border military talks are anything but comforting. The North Korea has apparently dug a tunnel in Punggye-ri, North Hamgyong Province which was the site of two nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 to a depth of 800 m. Another 200 m is all that is needed to conduct a third nuclear test. North Korea has also completed a new missile launch pad in Tongchang-ri in North Pyongyan Province. And in Koampo, South Hwanghae Province, just 50 km to 60 km away from South Korea's five West Sea islands, the North is building a naval base to house around 70 hovercraft.  Until just two weeks ago, North Korea was frantically pushing South Korea to hold military talks, Red Cross meetings and even parliamentary talks. But once the military talks began, the North said it had no idea who or what sank the Navy corvette Cheonan and blamed the South for provoking the artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island. From the start, it had no intention to resolve tensions but merely sought a chance for direct talks with Washington.  North Korea has a bad habit of turning to the nuclear option if all dialogue channels are closed, and it has launched minor to major provocations every time the U.S. and South Korea hold the &quot;Key Resolve&quot; joint military exercises between February and March each year. It shut off land routes to the Kaesong Industrial Complex in March 2009, test-fired a long-range missile in April and conducted its second nuclear test in May. The Cheonan was attacked during last year's drill.  Pyongyang is probably surprised by the steadfast stance of the South Korean and U.S. governments since the launch of the Lee Myung-bak administration, despite its provocations. As a result, it may well be cooking up a scheme that it hopes will shock Seoul and Washington. In other words, the next provocation could be the worst one so far. Experts speculate North Korea could attempt multiple attacks simultaneously including a nuclear test, a terror attack on a South Korean city and property, and assassination of a South Korean official.  <br />

The most qualified source testified provocations and a US response are inevitable<br />
Reuters, April 6th 2011, <br />
<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:427:http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/06/us-korea-usa-idUSTRE73549W20110406 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/06/us-korea-usa-idUSTRE73549W20110406" rel="nofollow">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/06/us-korea-usa-idUSTRE73549W20110406</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:427 --><br />
WASHINGTON (Reuters) – North Korea may be considering additional attacks and provocations, a top U.S. general told Congress on Wednesday, adding Washington needed to be prepared to respond appropriately if necessary.  “I do worry that there are additional attacks and provocations that are being considered within North Korea,” said the commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, General Walter Sharp.  Tensions with North Korea rose to their highest since the 1950-53 Korean War after last year’s sinking of a South Korean warship and the bombarding a South Korean island in the sea off the peninsula’s west coast.  Those attacks killed more than 50 South Koreans.  Pyongyang denies any involvement in the sinking and accuses Seoul of goading it into launching the later artillery attack — claims dismissed by Seoul and the United States.  Sharp, testifying before the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, renewed U.S. concerns that last year’s attacks may be only a sign of things to come, especially as ailing North Korea leader Kim Jong-il prepares his son Kim Jong-un for succession.  “There are some real challenges from North Korea that we need to be prepared to deter, and if deterrence does not work, be prepared to respond to,” Sharp said, without predicting what kind of response might be necessary. <br />
<br />
This causes South retaliation <br />
Na Jeong-ju, Korea Times, December 3rd 2010, (Najor)<br />
The defense minister-nominee vowed Friday to use fighter jets to bomb North Korean targets in the event of an additional attack on South Korea, saying he considers the North Korean leadership and military as the country’s “main enemy.”  He also defended Seoul’s decision in June to postpone regaining wartime operational control from the United States by more than three years to December 2015, alleging the country’s military needs enough time to fully prepare for the transfer.  “Should the enemy attack our territory and people once again, we will fight back resolutely. I’ll order air strikes to completely remove the source of threats, if necessary,” Kim Kwan-jin said during a confirmation hearing at the National Assembly.  The nominee said he was considering defining the North Korean leadership and military, not its people, as the South’s main enemy in the defense white paper.  “What’s urgent now is to enhance combat readiness and build a strong military that is trusted by the people,” he said.  The 61-year-old former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was tapped by President Lee Myung-bak as the defense chief a week ago, just days after a South Korean border island in the West Sea was shelled by the North Korean military, the first attack on civilians since the 1950-53 Korean War. If approved by the National Assembly, he will succeed Kim Tae-young.  “Our military failed to carry out its basic duty of protecting the lives of the people and their properties,” Kim said, referring to the artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island and the North’s torpedoing in March of a South Korean naval ship that killed 46 sailors.  “We are now facing the most serious security crisis since the Korean War.”  The defense ministry confirmed that it was reviewing whether to use the term main enemy in describing the North’s military in the biennial defense paper, which will be published later this month.  Public criticism has been mounting here over the military’s alleged poor response to the shelling of Yeonpyeong, which killed two civilians and two marines as well as destroyed dozens of civilian homes.  The government has also come under fire for failing to take necessary measures even after the intelligence agency detected signs of a possible North Korean attack on one of the five western border islands in August.  President Lee vowed a firm response to further provocation by the Kim Jong-il regime, but his public support dipped sharply by more than 10 percentage points to about 30 percent following the attack, according to sources from the presidential office.  The minister-nominee said he will revise the rules of engagement to give more power to the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and to field commanders in determining the level of response to attacks by North Korea.<br />
<br />
And South Korea’s “shoot first ask questions later” policy ensures escalation is inevitable<br />
The Chosunilbo, Editorial, March 2nd 2011, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:428:http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/03/02/2011030201199.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/03/02/2011030201199.html" rel="nofollow">http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/03/02/2011030201199.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:428 --><br />
Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin inspected frontline troops on Tuesday and ordered soldiers with the 1st Infantry Command Corps to respond first to the North Korean provocations and report up the chain of command later. The corps is in charge of defending the Imjin River area, which is a key target of potential North Korean artillery attacks, the inter-Korean Gyeongui Railroad and entry road into the Kaesong Industrial Complex.  Kim's instructions were apparently meant as a warning to North Korea against provoking the South. No Dithering.  Top brass have ordered frontline commanders repeatedly not to hesitate and to act immediately if they are attacked by North Korea. But in every emergency the frontline commanders wasted valuable response time by customarily waiting for orders from higher-ups.  When North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island in November last year, it took 13 minutes for South Korean forces to return fire. Military officers said they responded immediately based on the decision of the commanding officer at the scene, but there was considerable controversy whether the &quot;respond first, report later&quot; policy was obeyed. Kim, who was appointed as the new defense minister after the attack on Yeonpyeong, has stressed the policy. Kim told troops on Tuesday to prepare a systematic response to North Korean attacks. The North has deployed 170 mm self-propelled howitzers and 240 mm multiple rocket launchers along the western part of the border. It takes between six to 14 minutes for our troops to return fire on the source of a North Korean artillery attack and immobilize it. Officers believe that is not enough time for frontline commanders to report the situation up the chain of command and wait for orders. Swift, Stern Response.  &quot;It requires both foresight and constant discussion to gauge all the different types of North Korean provocation,&quot; Kim said. He authorized troops to respond strongly if the North launches attacks against the South and let it suffer three to four times the damage it inflicted. A swift and stern response by frontline troops will determine whether further provocations are suppressed early on or will lead to an escalated conflict, he added.  Kim also visited a rocket launcher unit under the First Infantry Command Corps. Each multiple launch rocket system is armed with 12 rounds of 227 mm rockets that can hit targets 30 km away.

Prefer our uniqueness - Independent think tanks put the risk of war at unprecedented levels<br />
Camana Bay Times, “Korean Peninsula Most ‘Dangerous’ Since Korean War”, March 9th 2011, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:429:http://www.camanabaytimes.com/korean-peninsula-most-dangerous-since-korean-war/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.camanabaytimes.com/korean-peninsula-most-dangerous-since-korean-war/" rel="nofollow">http://www.camanabaytimes.com/korean-peninsula-most-dangerous-since-korean-war/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:429 -->, Najor<br />
The Korean Peninsula is experiencing its most “dangerous” period since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War in light of North Korean provocations last year, an international military report showed Wednesday, according to Qatar News Agency (QNA).  The 2011 edition of the annual Military Balance, published by the London-based think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said international tensions rose across the world in 2010 and pointed to North Korean provocations.  “In the context of an imminent and possibly unclear leadership succession in Pyongyang, North Korea’s apparent aggression towards the South seen in its alleged sinking of the Cheonan in March last year and its shelling last November of the island of Yeonpyeong mean that the Korean peninsula is now as dangerous a place it has been at any time since the end of the Korean War in 1953,” a press statement by the IISS read.  Pyongyang has yet to acknowledge responsibility for these actions, despite Seoul’s repeated demands. The two Koreas remain technically at war since the Korean War ended with an armistice, instead of a peace treaty.  “These developments have reinforced South Korea’s determination to strengthen its military capacity,” the IISS statement read. “Seoul has focused on procuring anti-submarine warfare capabilities and has accelerated the FX-III multirole fighter aircraft programme.” <br />
<br />
And any engagement efforts will fail and lead to more provocations<br />

While South Korea and its U.S. ally can take pride in staunching North Korean aggression, the calm may be short-lived. Like a crafty magician who draws attention to one hand while slipping the coin into his pocket with the other, Kim Jong-il may be planning other provocative acts in 2011, but away from the Northern Limit Line (NLL).  South Korea must therefore prepare for a range of possible North Korean attacks. And that’s a challenge. As the ancient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu noted, if your opponent “sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.”  North Korea, as always, wants to retain the initiative and control the pace of the game. By incrementally ratcheting up tensions, Kim forces the U.S. and others into a reactive posture. And by creating a parallel crisis to divert attention from a negotiating impasse brought on by its own intransigence, Pyongyang hopes to raise the stakes before striking an eventual deal. That way the regime is able to extract maximum benefits while providing minimal concessions.  Yet, despite its history of engaging in high-risk, belligerent rhetoric and actions, Pyongyang has always calibrated its tactics to avoid going beyond its opponents’ redlines. Historically, after escalating tensions, Pyongyang has made conciliatory gestures, offering a return to the status quo ante. North Korea then cynically presents its “restraint” in not fulfilling its threats as evidence of its reasonableness and its willingness to negotiate.  Even as the regime threatened war in December, its officials met with New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson. Pyongyang used Richardson’s visit to send a message that it was willing to allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to return to the Yongbyon nuclear facility. Doing so also diverted attention from Pyongyang’s disclosure of a uranium enrichment facility, yet another violation of U.N. resolutions.  By alternating provocations with diplomatic outreach, Pyongyang seeks to leverage Washington and Seoul away from their pressure policies, such as U.N. sanctions against North Korea.  Currently however, neither the Obama nor Lee administrations show any sign of easing the pressure. This will impel Pyongyang to undertake more escalatory behavior in 2011 in the hope of coercing Washington and Seoul to soften their approach. As a result, North Korea and its opponents remain locked in an endless loop of cyclical crises.  Pyongyang appears to have abandoned previously self-imposed constraints on its behavior, making the situation even more dangerous. Although this new brazenness could relate to the ongoing North Korean leadership succession, it may also reflect growing desperation brought on by deteriorating economic and political conditions.  North Korea’s willingness to engage in ever escalating provocative acts will keep the Korean Peninsula a tinderbox during the coming year. A miscalculation by either side could spark a destructive conflagration.  But that is not to say that inter-Korean or U.S.-North Korean dialogue may not resume in 2011. Even as North Korea prepares for the next round of provocations, we can also expect it to expand efforts toward engagement.  Perceptions that North Korea has turned the page on its belligerent behavior would increase pressure on the Lee Myung-bak and Obama administrations to return to negotiations with North Korea. Pyongyang’s New Year’s message calling for improved inter-Korean relations and a subsequent offer of unconditional meetings with Seoul were seized upon by some analysts as “evidence” of a shift in the regime’s policy.  Neither Seoul nor Washington ever ruled out engagement, but North Korea’s provocations during the past two years have dashed hopes that it would be successful. <br />

More frightening still are the recent statements by South Korea’s new, far-right defense secretary Kim Kwan-jin, who threatens to launch South Korean air-strikes at the slightest N. Korean provocation.[2] The appointment of the bellicose Kim represents a sudden and dramatic revolution in South Korean military strategy.[3] Korean policy has been hardening since the 2008 election of hawkish President Lee, who scrapped his predecessor’s President Roh’s conciliatory ‘Sunshine Policy’ (under which South Koreans were able to communicate with family members in the North for the first time in 60 years).  The South Korean electorate, haunted by memories of the bloody 1950-53 War, has long been anti-militarist, content to bask in their increasing prosperity and let the N. Koreans rattle their cage from time to time over the years. ‘North Korea has nothing to lose, while we have everything to lose’ explained a professor of politics at Seoul National University recently quoted in the N.Y. Times. Now, in a striking reversal, we have trigger-happy Defense Minister Kim, backed by Admiral Mike Mullen and his atomic fleet, publicly declaring his policy of giving ‘more authority to commanders in the field’ including to ‘shoot first’ (in the case of aerial dogfights). According to a senior South Korean military analyst quoted in the Times,‘the new rules of engagement would also allow pre-emptive strikes on the North if there are indications of a possible attack. . .’ Given the North’s superior ground power, the South Koreans will rely on “using the air force is a way of balancing the power in the region.”  Possible Consequences of Miscalculation  The slightest miscalculation on the part of trigger-happy South Korean officers or their paranoid-for-a-reason North Korean counterparts could re-ignite the still-unresolved 1950-1953 Korean conflict, involving South Korea and the U.S. in an Asian land-war of major proportions with a military power whose nuclear umbrella (and alliance with China) would preclude the use of U.S. nuclear might. Far from backing down in the face of U.S. posturing, the North Koreans, like the North Vietnamese forty years ago, know they are in a position reduce America to what a desperate Nixon called a ‘helpless giant.’ They are confident of prevailing and, like the North Vietnamese Communists before them, they are prepared to pay the price of such a ‘victory.’ <br />

The new drills appear calculated to provoke a conflict, and this time South Korea is intent on an asymmetrical response. The military is revising its rules of engagement so as to jettison concerns about starting a wider conflict. If former Defense Minister Kim Tae-young is to believed, if there is another North Korean strike, then warships and fighter jets of both South Korea and the U.S. will launch attacks on the North. (16)  Incoming Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin is if anything even more determined to fan the flames of conflict into a wider conflagration. The South Korean military will immediately launch &quot;psychological warfare,&quot; including, presumably, loudspeaker broadcasts across the border. The North has promised to target loudspeakers if they are put in operation,  and that would in turn provide the pretext for the South Korean military to launch combat operations. If there is another exchange of fire with the North, Kim announced, &quot;We will definitely air raid North Korea.&quot; All combat forces available would be mobilized, he promised.  The newly minted rules of engagement are also going to permit &quot;preemptive&quot; strikes on North Korea based on the presumption of a possible attack. In other words, if North Korea fails to provide a pretext for military action, the Lee Administration can attack the North without provocation, if it chooses to do so. (17)  Lee Myung-bak has already achieved his dream of demolishing the Sunshine Policy. Relations between the two Koreas are at their lowest point since the end of military dictatorship in South Korea. Now he aims to deliberately trigger armed conflict in order to demonstrate &quot;toughness,&quot; and not incidentally, drive the final nail into the coffin of the Sunshine Policy. Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin feels that the risk of war is low. &quot;It will be difficult for North Korea to conduct a full-scale war because there are some elements of insecurity in the country, such as the national economy and power transfer.&quot; (18) Those may be arguments against North Korea's ability to successfully sustain a long-term war over the course of a year or two, but it seriously misreads the ability and will of the North Korean military to put up a determined fight. The extent of possible South Korean air strikes on the North is not clear, but anything other than an extremely limited and localized action is likely to trigger total war. And that is a war that the U.S. will inevitably be drawn into.<br />

Seoul and Washington have agreed that the chairman of the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff will command support troops from the U.S. in case of a provocation from North Korea, a government source said Thursday.  &quot;The South Korean and U.S. militaries have recently agreed in principle that the chairman of the Korean JCS will command U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force personnel and equipment that support the South Korean military in case of various provocations from the North,&quot; the source said. The two countries are still hammering out the details.  So far the South Korean military has responded North Korean provocations without U.S. military support. The South Korean JCS chairman currently exercises peacetime operational control over the South Korean troops but not over the U.S. Forces Korea.  But a military source said since the North's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island in November last year, the South Korean JCS has persistently called for the option to mobilize USFK support, and the U.S. military agreed. It is an unprecedented measure since the U.S. military is characteristically reluctant to place troops under the command of other countries. <br />

This becomes US-Sino nuclear war – their defense doesn’t cut it – current constraints don’t solve<br />

So the real issue is the potential for escalation — or an accident that could precipitate escalation — that would be beyond the control of Pyongyang or Seoul. With both sides on high alert, both adhering to their own national (and contradictory) definitions of where disputed boundaries lie and with rules of engagement loosened, the potential for sudden and rapid escalation is quite real.  Indeed, North Korea’s navy, though sizable on paper, is largely a hollow shell of old, laid-up vessels. What remains are small fast attack craft and submarines — mostly Sang-O “Shark” class boats and midget submersibles. These vessels are best employed in the cluttered littoral environment to bring asymmetric tactics to bear — not unlike those Iran has prepared for use in the Strait of Hormuz. These kinds of vessels and tactics — including, especially, the deployment of naval mines — are poorly controlled when dispersed in a crisis and are often impossible to recall.  For nearly 40 years, tensions on the Korean Peninsula were managed within the context of the wider Cold War. During that time it was feared that a second Korean War could all too easily escalate into and a thermonuclear World War III, so both Pyongyang and Seoul were being heavily managed from their respective corners. In fact, USFK was long designed to ensure that South Korea could not independently provoke that war and drag the Americans into it, which for much of the Cold War period was of far greater concern to Washington than North Korea attacking southward.  Today, those constraints no longer exist. There are certainly still constraints — neither the United States nor China wants war on the peninsula. But current tensions are quickly escalating to a level unprecedented in the post-Cold War period, and the constraints that do exist have never been tested in the way they might be if the situation escalates much further. <br />

The Treaty of Friendship ensures China defends if the US is involved and they will take the opportunity to invade Taiwan <br />

My understanding of the PRC – DPRK treaty of friendship, etc. is that it makes security guarantees that specifically exclude those of the nuclear umbrella-type, but that it also states that the PRC is under no obligation to assist if the DPRK initiates the aggression.  How about this – the DPRK attacks South Korea (as we’ve seen them do twice this year so far), who then counterattacks into North Korea, and then the attacks escalate, from initial artillery and air strikes on mainly military facilities of both sides to more and more areas populated mainly by civilians, at which point U.S. forces become involved in a range of military operations, including troop movements (with the South Koreans) across the DMZ.  What now, China?  I think that in such a case, the PRC joins in – I don’t think they are going to sit idly by if U.S. forces are being actively involved, just as I think U.S. forces would be automatically committed if PRC forces were involved.  It’s like each side on the Korean peninsula has their “big brother” there waiting to jump in if the other side’s back-up decides to get feisty. And, if that all happens, then who knows if China would decide to try to capitalize on the opportunity to move on Taiwan?  It’s certainly a possibility I hope the planners at U.S. Pacific Command have taken into account…<br />
<br />
The impact is extinction<br />

China is another matter. No sane figure in the Pentagon wants a war with China, and all serious US militarists know that China’s minuscule nuclear capacity is not offensive but a deterrent against the overwhelming US power arrayed against it (twenty archaic Chinese warheads versus more than 7,000 US warheads). Taiwan, whose status constitutes the still incomplete last act of the Chinese civil war, remains the most dangerous place on earth. Much as the 1914 assassination of the Austrian crown prince in Sarajevo led to a war that no one wanted, a misstep in Taiwan by any side could bring the United States and China into a conflict that neither wants. Such a war would bankrupt the United States, deeply divide Japan and probably end in a Chinese victory, given that China is the world’s most populous country and would be defending itself against a foreign aggressor. More seriously, it could easily escalate into a nuclear holocaust. Since any Taiwanese attempt to declare its independence formally would be viewed as a challenge to China’s sovereignty, forward-deployed US forces on China’s borders have virtually no deterrent effect. <br />
<br />
And the US would lose the war and it leads to Russian expansion, shut down of the Strait of Hormuz, and collapse of hegemony <br />

Crossing the DMZ with the intention of toppling the DPRK and replacing it with a government allied with or integrated into South Korea will put a whole set of new dynamics into play. Though China has no intention of aiding North Korea in aggression, it views the establishment of an American bridgehead on its Manchurian border with trepidation and may intervene under extreme circumstances, such as an all-out American and South Korean drive for “regime change” in Pyongyang.  If this were to happen, all bets are off. China will probably be able to roll back the invasion forces to the DMZ. After all, it managed to do this in the 1950′s, when it was much more militarily backwards relative to the US. Now, it will have a big preponderance over land, while its new “carrier-killing” ballistic missiles, submarines, cruise missiles, and Flanker fighters are now, at some level, able to deny the seas off China to the US Navy, while its anti-satellite tests and cyberwar prowess means that the American dominance in space and information ought not be taken for granted either. Now I am not saying that the Chinese Army (it ceased by the People’s Liberation Army recently) comes anywhere close to matching the American military; however, it might well already have the ability to defeat it in a local war on China’s borders. If China is successful, it will re-establish North Korea as its own protectorate, although under someone more rational and reliable than Kim Jong-il (though needless to say this will also completely sever its economic relationship with the US and cause a severe, but temporary, economic contraction due to the collapse of its export sector).  There will be a cascade of consequences elsewhere. Taiwan may use the opportunity to declare independence, provoking a second war in the region. Though the US says that it will not come to Taiwan’s aid if it does this unilaterally, America will probably change its mind if it is simultaneously embroiled in an intense local war with China on the Korean peninsula! Other actors opposed to American hegemony may view this as a chance to undermine the overstretched superpower. For instance, Russia could orchestrate a new war against Georgia and China may even persuade Iran to mine the Strait of Hormuz in exchange for security guarantees and technology transfer. All these dominoes going down may even precipitate the collapse of the increasingly fragile Pax Americana.  <br />

Attempts to restore its empire will doom Russia's transition to a democracy and free-market economy. The ongoing war in Chechnya alone has cost Russia $6 billion to date (equal to Russia's IMF and World Bank loans for 1995). Moreover, it has extracted a tremendous price from Russian society. The wars which would be required to restore the Russian empire would prove much more costly not just for Russia and the region, but for peace, world stability, and security.  As the former Soviet arsenals are spread throughout the NIS, these conflicts may escalate to include the use of weapons of mass destruction. Scenarios including unauthorized missile launches are especially threatening. Moreover, if successful, a reconstituted Russian empire would become a major destabilizing influence both in Eurasia and throughout the world. It would endanger not only Russia's neighbors, but also the U.S. and its allies in Europe and the Middle East. And, of course, a neo-imperialist Russia could imperil the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf.15   Domination of the Caucasus would bring Russia closer to the Balkans, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Middle East. Russian imperialists, such as radical nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, have resurrected the old dream of obtaining a warm port on the Indian Ocean. If Russia succeeds in establishing its domination in the south, the threat to Ukraine, Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan will increase. <br />

Shut down of the Strait collapses the economy<br />

Two-thirds of the world's oil is transported by ocean; straits and canals are therefore vital in reducing the time and costs of transporting oil, as well as other goods, globally. Any political disturbances or upheavals can cause the “choking” of the few important straits for world oil transit and thus disrupt world oil prices.  The abundance of oil and the world’s dependence on imported oil from this region make the Strait of Hormuz one of the most important chokepoints to monitor. The strait has a width of 54 km (34 miles) and is consequently a relatively easy passageway to obstruct. Roughly 17 million billion barrels per day (bbl/d) or 40% of world’s oil passes through this strait daily.  The UAE and Iran, along with the rest of the Persian Gulf countries (Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia), produced 27% of the world’s oil in 2003 and collectively hold more than half of the world’s total oil reserves, as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries import the majority of their oil from the Persian Gulf; in 2003, 11.6 million barrels per day were exported to OECD countries. The majority of oil leaving this region passes through the Strait of Hormuz. Threats to Disrupt Passage through the Strait  Fortunately, the strait has never actually been shut down, yet the constant political, religious, ethnic, and territorial disputes between the Persian Gulf countries has made the world anxious in anticipation of obstruction.  On September 22, 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, initiating an eight-year war between the two countries. The Iran-Iraq war was the manifestation of deeply rooted religious and ethnic divisions, border conflicts, and political differences. Religious and ethnic divides between the Sunnis and the Shias, coupled with personal hostility between Saddam Hussein and Ayatollah Khomeini, then-leaders of Iraq and Iran respectively, added to the tension. In 1984, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz after repeated attacks by Iraq disrupted Iranian shipping. However, in order to continue exporting oil and maintain its economy, Iran needed to keep the strait open and ultimately backed down from this threat.  Another threat to the Strait of Hormuz involves the ongoing dispute between the UAE and Iran over three islands – Abu Musa, Greater Tunb Island, and Lesser Tunb Island – all located near the Strait of Hormuz. The island Abu Musa is of particular interest because it is thought to contain large deposits of oil. By 1992, Iran managed to informally secure the islands even though no official agreement had been made with the UAE.  The Gulf Cooperation Council and the UAE are reluctant to interfere for fear that Iran will retaliate by closing the strait. Claims to the islands are still being disputed, yet Iran has asserted dominance by developing military stations on these islands, particularly guarding Abu Musa. Such development on these strategic islands will only facilitate Iran’s capability to close off the straits and defend itself against US military attacks.  In 1997, Iran once again threatened to close the strait if the United States attempted to interfere with Iranian terrorism against other Persian Gulf countries.  Although Iran has yet to follow through on its threats to close the strait, if it were to happen, alternative routes would need to be utilized. This could add to transportation costs and forestall the global distribution of oil, causing oil prices to increase.  Petroleum is the single most important commodity in today’s world. Our dependence on this resource can be felt in the way society reacts to even minor shifts in oil markets. With demand and consumption increasing, mankind’s dependence on oil only continues to grow. Our dependence is such, that any minor interference in the production or distribution of oil has profound economic and political consequences. Because oil being exported through the Strait of Hormuz is projected to increase, ensuring the flow of oil through this hostile region will continue to be a crucial issue in the years to come. <br />

Could the current economic crisis affecting this country and the world lead to another world war? The answer may be found by looking back in history.  One of the causes of World War I was the economic rivalry that existed between the nations of Europe. In the 19th century France and Great Britain became wealthy through colonialism and the control of foreign resources. This forced other up-and-coming nations (such as Germany) to be more competitive in world trade which led to rivalries and ultimately, to war.  After the Great Depression ruined the economies of Europe in the 1930s, fascist movements arose to seek economic and social control. From there fanatics like Hitler and Mussolini took over Germany and Italy and led them both into World War II.  With most of North America and Western Europe currently experiencing a recession, will competition for resources and economic rivalries with the Middle East, Asia, or South American cause another world war? Add in nuclear weapons and Islamic fundamentalism and things look even worse.  Hopefully the economy gets better before it gets worse and the terrifying possibility of World War III is averted. However sometimes history repeats itself.<br />

MANAMA: Any Iranian move to blockade the Strait of Hormuz would be considered as an &quot;act of war&quot;, a top US military official said yesterday.  Iran would &quot;not be allowed&quot; to take control of the key oil route and an attempt to do so would provoke a &quot;vigorous&quot; international response, said outgoing Fifth Fleet Commander Vice-Admiral Kevin Cosgriff.  He was responding to Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander General Mohammed Ali Jafari's warning on Saturday that Iran would choke off the strait if the country was attacked.  A quarter of the world's oil supplies pass through the narrow stretch, between the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Gulf.  &quot;I cannot imagine, given the critical nature of that body of water, that the international community would not be outraged should Iran or any entity move to restrict the freedom of navigation,&quot; Vice-Adm Cosgriff told a Press conference at the US navy base in Juffair.  &quot;They are not going to be allowed to do so. It would be an act of war. &quot;In a tight oil market, the international community would respond vigorously to that.&quot; He would not specify what action the US would take. <br />

Michel Chossudovsky, Professor of Economics, University of Ottawa, May 2005, “Planned US-Israeli Attack on Iran,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:441:http://globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO505A.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO505A.html" rel="nofollow">http://globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO505A.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:441 --><br />
The Bush Administration has embarked upon a military adventure which threatens the future of humanity. Iran is the next military target. The planned military operation, which is by no means limited to punitive strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, is part of a project of World domination, a military roadmap, launched at the end of the Cold War. Military action against Iran would directly involve Israel's participation, which in turn is likely to trigger a broader war throughout the Middle East, not to mention an implosion in the Palestinian occupied territories. Turkey is closely associated with the proposed aerial attacks. Israel is a nuclear power with a sophisticated nuclear arsenal. (See text box below). The use of nuclear weapons by Israel or the US cannot be excluded, particularly in view of the fact that tactical nuclear weapons have now been reclassified  as a variant of the conventional bunker buster bombs and are authorized by the US Senate for use in conventional war theaters. (&quot;they are harmless to civilians because the explosion is underground&quot;) In this regard, Israel and the US rather than Iran constitute a nuclear threat. The planned attack on Iran must be understood in relation to the existing active war theaters in the Middle East, namely Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine. The conflict could easily spread from the Middle East to the Caspian sea basin. It could also involve the participation of Azerbaijan and Georgia, where US troops are stationed. An attack on Iran would have a direct impact on the resistance movement inside Iraq. It would also put pressure on America's overstretched military capabilities and resources in both the Iraqi and Afghan war theaters. (The 150,000 US troops in Iraq are already fully engaged and could not be redeployed in the case of a war with Iran.) In other words, the shaky geopolitics of the Central Asia- Middle East region, the three existing war theaters in which America is currently, involved, the direct participation of Israel and Turkey, the structure of US sponsored military alliances, etc. raises the specter of a broader conflict. Moreover, US military action on Iran not only threatens Russian and Chinese interests, which have geopolitical interests in the Caspian sea basin and which have bilateral agreements with Iran. It also backlashes on European oil interests in Iran and is likely to produce major divisions between Western allies, between the US and its European partners as well as within the European Union.<br />

The impact is existential <br />
Ivashov ‘7 [Leonid. Analyst at the Strategic Culture Foundation. “Iran: The Threat of Nuclear War” The AP, 21 April 07. Lexis]<br />
What might cause the force major event of the required scale? Everything seems to indicate that Israel will be sacrificed. Its involvement in a war with Iran - especially in a nuclear war - is bound to trigger a global catastrophe. The statehoods of Israel and Iran are based on the countries' official religions. A military conflict between Israel and Iran will immediately evolve into a religious one, a conflict between Judaism and Islam. Due to the presence of numerous Jewish and Muslim populations in the developed countries, this would make a global bloodbath inevitable. All of the active forces of most of the countries of the world would end up fighting, with almost no room for neutrality left. Judging by the increasingly massive acquisitions of the residential housing for the Israeli citizens, especially in Russia and Ukraine , a lot of people already have an idea of what the future holds. However, it is hard to imagine a quiet heaven where one might hide from the coming doom. Forecasts of the territorial distribution of the fighting, the quantities and the efficiency of the armaments involved, the profound character of the underlying roots of the conflict and the severity of the religious strife all leave no doubt that this clash will be in all respects much more nightmarish than WWII<br />

And collapse of heg triggers nuclear war<br />

A multipolar world that is not moving toward nuclear disarmament is a world of an expanding Nuclear Club. While Russia and the West continue to argue with each other, states that are capable of developing nuclear weapons of their own will jump at the opportunity. The probability of nuclear weapons being used in a regional conflict will increase significantly. International Islamic extremism and terrorism will increase dramatically; this threat represents the reverse side of globalization. The situation in Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North and East Africa will further destabilize. The wave of militant separatism, trans-border crime and terrorism will also infiltrate Western Europe, Russia, the U.S., and other countries. The surviving disarmament treaties (the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty) will collapse. In a worst-case scenario, there is the chance that an adventuresome regime will initiate a missile launch against territories or space satellites of one or several great powers with a view to triggering an exchange of nuclear strikes between them. Another high probability is the threat of a terrorist act with the use of a nuclear device in one or several major capitals of the world. <br />

Independent of war Lack of Chinese condemnation of provocations cause policymakers to shift to a confrontational policy<br />

These negotiations come at a critical time for the countries, which are preparing for a highly anticipated visit by Hu in January 2011. The two have sparred over a variety of economic, political and security disagreements, which have intensified since the global economic crisis. The North Korean attacks on the South Korean ChonAn and Yeonpyeong Island raised distrust to a new level, however, with the United States and its allies making shows of force and China resisting their calls to exert more pressure on Pyongyang.  This dispute has re-energized discussions in Washington about the possibility of adopting a fundamentally more confrontational strategy toward China, which has lurked in the background throughout the year as the United States accelerated its re-engagement of the Asia Pacific region, especially given China’s growing willingness to collide with its neighbors and even the United States over differences. Washington has several tools at its disposal, including trade barriers against China’s still-export-dependent economy, if it seeks a more confrontational posture. Given the intensity of the ongoing Korean tensions and trade disputes, there is a risk that the Hu visit could be canceled. <br />

Provocations are the key issue<br />
Evan Feigenbaum is Adjunct Senior Fellow for East, Central, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, “Korean conflict: Could it escalate?”, December 8th 2010, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:444:http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/08/korean-conflict-could-it-escalate/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/08/korean-conflict-could-it-escalate/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/08/korean-conflict-could-it-escalate/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:444 -->, (Najor)<br />
Still, that almost certainly means the crisis will sharpen US-China tensions. The US continues to bet that Chinese leverage will set limits on escalation by Pyongyang and restrain further provocations. But China has shown scant appetite for coercing North Korea, and that seems unlikely to change in a fundamental way. Indeed, while Beijing may well be privately telling the North to knock it off, those private messages have been sweetened by public displays of even-handedness and calls for ‘mutual’ restraint. And with President Hu Jintao coming to Washington in about six weeks, this issue has rocketed toward the top of the US-China agenda. North Korea won’t crowd out every other piece of business, some of which will be positive. But, like a growing number of issues in US-China relations, this one will produce more rancor than agreement.<br />

This shift will devastate relations – it will lock in a cold war mentality by the end of 2011<br />

If current trends continue unabated, the year 2011 is likely to see Washington and Beijing return to the 'megaphone diplomacy' that they sought to avoid in 2009. Adoption of this approach tends to occur naturally when the nationalistic sentiments of both populaces become increasingly galvanized. It makes both governments less amenable to compromise and restricts flexibility.  However, this is likely to become critically dangerous over the course of 2012, as the US approaches yet another presidential election in November of that year. There would be nothing to stop bilateral relations from fossilizing into some variation of a cold war. By this time, any compromise on Obama's part will be perceived as weakness and could put his re-election at risk.  Fortunately, there is still time for Beijing and Washington to adjust their bilateral trajectory; they have until late 2011 to turn things around. Having grasped the nature of US presidential power shifts, Beijing tends to see the second and third years of a first-term presidency as 'windows of opportunity' to improve bilateral relations. Washington too must seek engagement; both parties have little choice but to constructively engage each other.<br />

A cold war between China and the US would collapse the global economy, spread disease, destroy the environment, and increase terrorism <br />
Susan L. Shrik, Professor of International Relations @ UCSD, “China: Fragile Superpower: How China’s Internal Politics Could Derail Its Peaceful Rise”, 2007, Pg 5 (Najor)<br />
Even if the two sides manage to avoid a shooting war a Cold war with China would wreak havoc in the United States and throughout the world, The two countries have become economically dependent on one another. The United States is China's largest export market (buying approximately 20 percent of its total exports) and China loans most of the dollars it earns from trade to the U,S, government, which uses the money to cover its Large budget deficits, If Washington imposed economic sanctions on China and China retaliated by selling off some of the billions of dollars of American government debt it owns, American interest rates would shoot up, our economy would slow to a crawl, and a global recession could result. A hostile relationship with China would also make it impossible for our two countries to work together on the many global issues that affect the people of both countries, such as AIDS, avian flu epidemics, global warming, and terrorism<br />

Cooperation on AIDS key to prevent extinction<br />
Lederberg 91 (Joshua Lederberg, Molecular biologist and Nobel Prize winner in 1958, 1991In Time of Plague: The History and Social Consequences of Lethal Epidemic Disease, p 35-6)<br />
Will Aids mutate further ? Already known, a vexing feature of AIDS is its antigenic variability, further complicating the task of developing a vaccine. So we know that HIV is still evolving. Its global spread has meant there is far more HIV on earth today than ever before in history. What are the odds of its learning the tricks of airborne transmission? The short is, “No one can be sure.” But we could make the same attribution about any virus; alternatively the next influenza or chicken pox may mutate to an unprecedented lethality. As time passes, and HIV seems settled in a certain groove, that is momentary reassurance in itself. However, given its other ugly attributes,  it is hard to imagine a worse threat to humanity than an airborne variant of AIDS. No rule of nature contradicts such a possibility; the proliferation of AIDS cases with secondary pneumonia multiplies the odds of such a mutant, as an analogue to the emergence of pneumonic plague.<br />

To fight nuclear terrorism, the summit focused on establishing an international nuclear security mechanism. The United States and many countries face the threat of nuclear terrorism. China is no exception.  In case the East Turkistan separatists consider the timing is mature to intensify conflicts with Beijing, they will no doubt take whatever means necessary to penetrate nuclear facilities or acquire &quot;dirty bombs.&quot; Moreover, the large-scale construction of nuclear power plants in China introduces more security challenges. China will be in the peak period of building such plants in the next two decades.  The ongoing construction of such plants scattered in coastal areas would expose the nation to threat. A terrorist attack on even one plant would result in consequences more serious than that of detonating a nuclear bomb over a city. Taking this into account, Beijing has adopted various measures to strengthen nuclear security in recent years.  As a positive response from China to the international community, Hu Jintao made the decision to attend the summit, which reflects that Beijing and Washington actually are sharing common interests by making joint efforts to establish a global mechanism for countering nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism.  This action indicates that Beijing regards nuclear terrorist assaults as a huge threat to national security interests and it hopes to strengthen international cooperation to limit or even eliminate this type of threat.  <br />

What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? Even if it fails, it would further exacerbate the negative features of the new and frightening world in which we are now living. Societies would close in on themselves, police measures would be stepped up at the expense of human rights, tensions between civilisations and religions would rise and ethnic conflicts would proliferate. It would also speed up the arms race and develop the awareness that a different type of world order is imperative if humankind is to survive.  But the still more critical scenario is if the attack succeeds. This could lead to a third world war, from which no one will emerge victorious. Unlike a conventional war which ends when one side triumphs over another, this war will be without winners and losers. When nuclear pollution infects the whole planet, we will all be losers. <br />

Plan is key to China’s cost benefit calculus with Korea – they will support pressure<br />

Whether there is a change or not, China’s role in finding a solution to the North Korean crisis is critical. However, like any other country, China will get on board with an effective response only if it sees that its interests are affected or its interests can be served better by an active role. For China, there are three issues that could drive a more active role. As mentioned earlier, one of the major imperatives for China keeping Pyongyang as an ally is because it is a buffer state between the pro-west US-allies and Beijing. The Chinese have been paranoid about the US troops on its border. <br />

BEIJING (Reuters) ― China’s famed diplomatic fence-sitting now faces an agonizing test on the barbed-wire dividing North and South Korea, but Beijing is likely to endure the sting and shield its friend, the North.  North Korea’s deadly shelling of a South Korean island Tuesday will be a major test of how well China can balance its role as Pyongyang’s only major ally with international demands that it pressure, even punish, the North over the worst bombardment on the Korean Peninsula since 1953.  In the end, Pyongyang’s importance to China as a buffer against possible regional containment and conflict is likely to outweigh the urgings of the Obama administration and U.S. allies for a tough response from Beijing that could rile North Korea.  “There won’t be any shift in the macro-structure of relations because of a localized problem like this,” said Xu Guangyu, a retired major general in the People’s Liberation Army who now works for the government-run China Arms Control and Disarmament Association.  “Our biggest objective is stability on the Korean Peninsula. That interest is not served by abandoning North Korea,” he said.  “China’s attitudes won’t change. It will make calls for restraint. It’s afraid of an escalation. But there won’t be any fundamental shift.”  But if China resists calls for strong censure of Pyongyang, however, its regional standing could suffer, a worry that will also weigh on Beijing officials’ minds.  U.S. officials have already complained about China’s muted response to the shelling that killed at least four people. President Hu Jintao is due to visit Washington in early 2011, and that could add pressure on Beijing to criticize the North.  “The Chinese did not react in a way we thought was conducive to striving toward regional stability,” a senior U.S. official in Washington, D.C., said.  Japan has also urged Beijing to make a “proper response.”  Seoul and Tokyo were already upset over Beijing’s hands-off stance about the sinking in March of a South Korean navy ship that Seoul said was torpedoed by North Korea.  This time, China may move to chide the North sooner and more sharply. But Washington and its allies will probably want more.  They may look to China to back criticism of the North with sanctions, possibly through the United Nations Security Council. And here the divide will be sharper.  “A push for a new sanctions resolution at the United Nations may be necessary to test once more whether the international community faces a North Korea problem or a China problem,” Scott Snyder, an expert on Korea at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an emailed comment.  China sees North Korea as a strategic buffer against the U.S. and its regional allies, and throughout this year President Hu has shown how much political prestige and economic aid he is willing to invest in Pyongyang.  In early May, North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-il visited China on his first trip abroad since 2006, and he visited again in late August ahead of the anointment of his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, as heir-apparent in the dynastic one-party state.  Since then, senior Chinese leaders have visited Pyongyang.  China’s 1,415-kilometer border with North Korea includes stretches of rivers that freeze over in winter, and Beijing fears that frontier could become a conduit for refugees and upheaval if Pyongyang’s regime crumbles.  Chinese reluctance to push North Korea harder may also be compounded by joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea intended as a show of resolve and power.  Washington is sending the nuclear-powered USS George Washington, which carries 75 warplanes, to join exercises with South Korea from Sunday to the following Wednesday, U.S. officials in Seoul said on Wednesday.  Beijing was angered earlier this year by joint U.S.-South Korea naval exercises off the South Korean coast that those two countries said were aimed at warning North Korea.  “China will not welcome the U.S. aircraft carrier joining the exercises, because that kind of move can escalate tensions, and not relieve them,” said Xu, the retired major general. <br />

No impact to North-South war – South would easily win<br />
Tim Lister, CNN, former CNN International Vice-President, “North Korea's military aging but sizable”, November 25th 2010, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:450:http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/11/24/north.korea.capability/index.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/11/24/north.korea.capability/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/11/24/north.korea.capability/index.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:450 -->, (Najor)<br />
The main weakness of the North's military is a chronic shortage of computers, modern command and control and electronic warfare assets -- in other words, much of what makes up the 21st-century battlefield. At the same time, South Korea has used its economic strength to modernize its armed forces: for example, building three $1 billion Aegis-class destroyers to counter ballistic missiles.  The same applies in the air. North Korea's air force largely comprises aging Soviet MiG fighters (though it has some MiG 29s) that would be unable to compete with South Korean F-15 jets or the F-16 fighters of the U.S. 7th Air Force, based in South Korea. In addition, the North's air force has suffered fuel shortages, and Jane's estimated that the North's fighter pilots may get as little as 25 flying hours per year. The North Koreans also have a large fleet of Russian-design biplanes that would be better suited to crop-spraying but could be used to drop special forces behind enemy lines in the event of conflict.  To compensate for obsolescence, the North deploys boots on the ground in great numbers. Jane's estimates that its standing army numbers just over 1 million personnel, with reserves estimated at more than 7 million. But North Korean soldiers are poorly fed, according to analysts and reports from defectors, and rarely train due to scarcity of fuel and ammunition  Despite the size of its armed forces, few analysts expect that the regime in the North would want to launch a general assault on the South, knowing that it would probably be repulsed and that in turn would imperil the regime. It might also ignite dissent.  &quot;With the ongoing leadership transition in North Korea, there have been rumors of discontent within the military, and the current actions may reflect miscommunications or worse within the North's command-and-control structure,&quot; geopolitical risk analysis firm Stratfor says.  There is another practical reason why a land invasion would be difficult. South Korea has built an array of obstructions on roads from the North that would force an invader's tanks off the pavement and into rice fields. Only in the winter would those fields be hard enough to allow the tanks to cross them. <br />

North Korea does not possess a demonstrated second-strike capability. As noted in the previous section, North Korea’s nuclear tests suggest that its technicians have not yet mastered the implosion-design technology required for plutonium bombs. There is no hard evidence North Korea has achieved the more challenging task of fashioning a “miniaturized” warhead of reduced size and weight sufficient to fit on a missile, and of increased durability sufficient to reliably detonate upon arrival at the target.  In addition, with respect to threatening the United States directly, tests of the long-range Taepodong missile thus far have not been successful, and this missile takes much too long to assemble, fuel, and arm to provide retaliatory utility anyway. To possess a convincing nuclear deterrent capability, North Korea would need to be able to mount warheads on its missiles, insure the survival of those missiles through the initial attack, and then launch them with enough precision and reliability to reach valuable targets.<br />

Let’s take an example. North Korea is a mostly isolated, totalitarian, unpredictable, and downright weird regime. Its only “friend” in the world is China, which provides fuel and food to prop up a North Korean regime that cannot even feed its people during bumper harvests. With increasingly better relations with a South Korea that has a GDP greater than 30 times that of the North, why does China continue to provide a lifeline for the destitute North?  A New York Times editorial answered this question and then moralized by saying something that the Obama administration would likely agree with:  “China has long enabled North Korea, making clear that its only real concern is stability on its border. But China should realize that an erratic neighbor armed with nuclear weapons is anything but a recipe for stability…. After the [North Korean] shelling [of South Korean islands], China called only for a resumption of six-party nuclear talks. It has said nothing about the [newly discovered North Korean nuclear] enrichment plant.”  But if this were the full story, the Times argument would appear logical and valid. Why would China prop up a volatile nuclear power on its border?  When policy seems to defy logic, usually something is missing. In that same day’s newspaper, buried in a regular news story related to China’s reaction to North Korea’s shelling of South Korea and the discovery of the North ‘s enrichment plant, the Times unearthed something that confounded its own moralizing about China’s shoring up of the nefarious North Korean regime. Times reporters reference and then quote Cai Jian, professor of Korean studies at Fudan University:  “The [Chinese] support continues because China fears that the vacuum created by a sudden collapse [of North Korea] there would open the door to rule by South Korea, ‘and that will put an American military alliance on the doorstep of China.’”  Although never mentioned by the Times, the implicit conclusion is that China’s seemingly irrational propping up of pariah North Korea becomes logical if China fears encirclement by a superpower and its allies practicing neo-containment more than it does a small, erratic nuclear country on its border.  Given these uncomfortable facts, the United States could undermine Chinese support for North Korea by giving South Korea five years notice that it will abrogate the U.S.-South Korean security alliance. This alliance is an anachronism from the early years of the Cold War before South Korea’s economic miracle, when North Korea was backed by both the Soviet Union and communist China. If given time to beef up its military before the U.S. withdraws, the now wealthy South Korea could easily defend itself from the impoverished North. Furthermore, because South Korea refuses to significantly open its markets to U.S. goods, the United States is essentially paying a rich nation to defend it.  Thus, even if North Korea collapsed, the Korean peninsula was reunited, and South Korea ruled the unified country, China would no longer have to fear a U.S. alliance on its border. With this greater threat eliminated, China might very well rather deal with a more rational, wealthy, and stable united Korea, rather than have to prop up an erratic and bellicose North Korea. Thus, Chinese might very well have an incentive to end assistance to the North – the only thing that keeps the regime from collapsing. Also, a U.S. withdrawal from the South would greatly diminish the possibility that the United States could be embroiled in a brush-fire war over a peninsula that was of questionable strategic value even during the Cold War.  China, South Korea, and the United States could all benefit from the disintegration of North Korea. Thus, everyone – except North Korea – would benefit from a more realistic U.S. policy toward the Koreas.  <br />

Whether there is a change or not, China’s role in finding a solution to the North Korean crisis is critical. However, like any other country, China will get on board with an effective response only if it sees that its interests are affected or its interests can be served better by an active role. For China, there are three issues that could drive a more active role. As mentioned earlier, one of the major imperatives for China keeping Pyongyang as an ally is because it is a buffer state between the pro-west US-allies and Beijing. The Chinese have been paranoid about the US troops on its border. <br />

Unified Korea is key to end North proliferation – they will never give up nuclear weapons<br />

With two successful nuclear tests, North Korea has become a nuclear nation but without international recognition. Over the past two decades, the international community has tried every means but military action to end the North’s nuclear program. Why have the United States and other nations failed in these efforts despite their overwhelming military and economic supremacy?   Reactions to the North Korean nuclear question can be divided into two contrasting approaches. The moderate school favors dialogue as the primary means of solution and the hard-line school gives weight to sanctions. These positions have been reflected in the studies on international cooperation for denuclearization.   The moderates believe that North Korea’s nuclear development is essentially for negotiations purposes to achieve its survival. They think that the North can be persuaded to peacefully dismantle its nuclear program, if other nations remove what the Pyongyang regime perceives as security threats against it. This school argues that North Korea can be steered into denuclearization if South Korea, the United States and Japan create a “moderate coalition” resorting to dialogue and non-violent measures. The fundamental drawback in this approach, however, is its premise that the North’s nuclear program is a bargaining chip. And the moderates have failed to offer practical ways for the tripartite coalition to guarantee the North’s security and earn its trust.   On the other hand, the hard-liners are ready to accept that North Korea has accomplished nuclear armament. They argue that the moderates have failed in their initiatives depending on economic compensation and political security, insisting that the only way to resolve the North Korean nuclear question is to apply tough sanctions based on the superior power of the international community. However, the hard-liners have been ambivalent about whether sanctions should only be economic or should include military actions. They have failed to mount a convincing plan to nudge China into joining international economic sanctions or to show what to do if China remains opposed to sanctions on North Korea.   In order to find the best feasible solution, it is important to identify the limitations of international cooperation and seek ways to compensate for the deficiencies in both approaches. This study analyzes the theoretical and strategic drawbacks in international cooperation for the denuclearization of North Korea and suggests policy alternatives to achieve the goal.   II. Limits to International Cooperation Policies   1. Obstacles to International Cooperation   1) North Korea’s Fear about Its Survival   North Korea started developing nuclear arms for its survival after the collapse of the socialist bloc in the early 1990s. The dismantling of the Soviet Union ended a mutual assistance treaty, which had guaranteed automatic intervention in the event of an external aggression. Upon its normalization of relations with South Korea in 1990, Russia discontinued providing North Korea with offensive weapons. When China opened diplomatic relations with the South two years later, the North’s anxiety over its military security grew immensely.   Refusing to join in the international community, Pyongyang opted for nuclear armament over other survival options that included disregard of security crisis, increase of conventional military capacity and security assurance through alliance. Under its “military first” (songun) policy, North Korea put all available national resources into the development of its nuclear program. It converted its existing nuclear research projects which had started in the middle of the 1950s to a nuclear armament policy. While its economic system remained in shambles, Pyongyang retained its previous level of military expenditures. Between 1995 and 1997, the total national budget of the North was reduced to one-sixth of the amount in the early 1990s but its defense budget in 1997 stood at US$5 billion, or about half of the total government spending.   To force North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs, the international community has to consider the fact that the North has developed nuclear weapons as a means of survival. It should therefore either make it too costly for the North to continue its nuclear programs – to the extent that possessing nuclear arms threatens the existence of the regime – or collectively guarantee its survival. The international community, however, has failed to increase the cost for the North’s nuclear armament due to the limitations of applied sanctions. On the other hand, under the anarchistic system of the international community, it also is difficult for nations to provide comprehensive security measures to protect North Korea, let alone carry them out, because nations are afraid of being deceived by others.   Those are the two key obstacles to international cooperation in the denuclearization of North Korea. 2) Limitations of the Sanctions For successful international cooperation in denuclearizing North Korea, the cost of possessing nuclear weapons and subsequent disadvantage should be so immense as to make the North’s regime feel a serious threat of its demise. To arouse such a sense of vulnerability, concerned nations should take military options or enforce strong punitive sanctions. But a military strike has been excluded from feasible options since the first North Korean nuclear crisis of the early 1990s. At the height of the first nuclear crisis, Washington had prepared phased military action as well as economic sanctions, but the military option was shelved after former President Jimmy Carter’s visit to Pyongyang. Both South Korean and Chinese authorities also strongly objected to taking military actions against the North: Seoul feared the possibility of an all-out war with the North while China was worried about the destabilization of the regional situation.   Therefore, from the first nuclear crisis, North Korea perceived that the United States was unable to take military steps and consequently, the international community faced serious limitations in reining in North Korea. In the following years, the North test-fired long-range missiles, conducted nuclear tests twice and disclosed a uranium enrichment program to boldly escalate the crisis, and finally declared its being a nuclear-possessing power.   During the second North Korean nuclear crisis, South Korea and China opposed the U.S.-led economic sanctions against the North, which they argued would only aggravate the security situation on the Korean peninsula. Beginning in the late 1990s, South Korea promoted an engagement policy with the North, asserting that the South could induce the North to abandon its nuclear programs through dialogue if the international community eased pressure on the Pyongyang regime. The Roh Moo-hyun administration in Seoul did not take strong punitive actions even after the North conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 but instead increased economic aid and expanded economic cooperation.   China took a lukewarm attitude at the time of the North’s first nuclear test, and then agreed to the U.N. Security Council resolution after the second test, but without joining sanctions against Pyongyang. In other words, the international community failed to deliver a clear message to North Korea that its possession of nuclear weapons could lead to the collapse of its present regime. And there also was no dramatic rise in the North’s cost of possessing nuclear arms.   The UNSC adopted Resolution 1718 after North Korea conducted its first nuclear test on October 9, 2006, and Resolution 1874 after the second nuclear test on May 25, 2009. Under these U.N. resolutions, North Korea is being subjected to international sanctions that include bans on financial transactions related to weapons of mass destruction and arms trade, search of suspected ships and seizure of banned items, and prohibition on exporting luxury goods to the North. But these measures have exposed fundamental limitations in threatening the survival of the North Korean regime. 3) Concerns about Deception among Nations   Some experts have claimed that North Korea would give up its nuclear programs when a peace treaty is concluded between the North and the United States and other nations concerned. This argument ignores the reality of international politics, however. When we review the events related to the North Korean nuclear issue over the past two decades, both the United States and North Korea were unable to reach an agreement because of their mutual distrust and they exhibited very little possibility of implementing any agreement because of their mutual worries of being deceived by the other side.   During the past 20 years, North Korea has deceived the international community by vowing nonproliferation but at the same time taking strenuous steps to obtain nuclear materials. At the time of the first nuclear crisis, North Korea broke its promise to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and unilaterally declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. The 1994 Agreed Framework, an accord between the United States and North Korea signed after months of negotiations in Geneva, was scrapped under mutual distrust prompted by the North’s acts of deception. <br />
Pyongyang secretly carried out a uranium enrichment program after the signing of the Geneva accord, which provided a freeze of the North’s nuclear programs in exchange for energy aid by the United States, South Korea and other nations. The six-party talks to settle the second North Korean nuclear crisis have produced agreements and promises, none of which have been faithfully implemented. The two nuclear tests by North Korea have proved that the North has been cheating the international community.   A review of the first and second nuclear crises suggests an extremely low possibility that the international community and North Korea can reach an agreement through dialogue. Even if an agreement is reached, the chances are very low that the agreement will be honored, and there is no way of verifying its implementation if Pyongyang promises to do so.   The international community suspects that North Korea could break any promise and resume nuclear programs; on the other hand, the North would not completely trust the international community’s guarantee of the security of the regime. National security is a matter of survival and any mistake is irreversible. It is unrealistic to expect North Korea to forsake its nuclear programs on the back of international assurances.   Even if the United States and South Korea make good their assurance of North Korea’s security following complete denuclearization of the country, there still can be serious problems. Suppose the North Korean system is so durable that it can withstand external influences; the Pyongyang regime could quicken its economic openness and adopt reforms – and be unthreatened.   But, Pyongyang leaders know how vulnerable their system is. Since the collapse of the socialist system, North Korea has remained a pariah, pursuing “socialism of our own” and defying reform and openness. It is therefore unimaginable that North Korea would trust non-interference by the world in its domestic affairs. Summing up, North Korea’s demand for an international guarantee of its security is nothing but a ploy to justify its nuclear arsenal and to delay multilateral denuclearization talks. <br />

North Korea nuclear arsenal collapses deterrence and causes global nuclear use<br />
Cimbala 10 - Prof. of Political Science @ Penn State, (Stephen, Nuclear Weapons and Cooperative Security in the 21st Century, p. 117-8)<br />
Failure to contain proliferation in Pyongyang could spread nuclear fever throughout Asia. Japan and South Korea might seek nuclear weapons and missile defenses. A pentagonal configuration of nuclear powers in the Pacific basis (Russia, China, Japan, and the two Koreas – not including the United States, with its own Pacific interests) could put deterrence at risk and create enormous temptation toward nuclear preemption. Apart from actual use or threat of use, North Korea could exploit the mere existence of an assumed nuclear capability in order to support its coercive diplomacy. As George H. Quester has noted: If the Pyongyang regime plays its cards sensibly and well, therefore, the world will not see its nuclear weapons being used against Japan or South Korea or anyone else, but will rather see this new nuclear arsenal held in reserve (just as the putative Israeli nuclear arsenal has been held in reserve), as a deterrent against the outside world’s applying maximal pressure on Pyongyang and as a bargaining chip to extract the economic and political concessions that the DPRK needs if it wishes to avoid giving up its peculiar approach to social engineering. A five-sided nuclear competition in the Pacific would be linked, in geopolitical deterrence and proliferation space, to the existing nuclear deterrents in India and Pakistan, and to the emerging nuclear weapons status of Iran. An arc of nuclear instability from Tehran to Tokyo could place U.S. proliferation strategies into the ash heap of history and call for more drastic military options, not excluding preemptive war, defenses, and counter-deterrent special operations. In addition, an eight-sided nuclear arms race in Asia would increase the likelihood of accidental or inadvertent nuclear war. It would do so because: (1) some of these states already have histories of protracted conflict; (2) states may have politically unreliable or immature command and control systems, especially during a crisis involving a decision for nuclear first strike or retaliation; unreliable or immature systems might permit a technical malfunction that caused an unintended launch, or a deliberate but unauthorized launch by rogue commanders; (3) faulty intelligence and warning systems might cause one side to misinterpret the other’s defensive moves to forestall attack as offensive preparations for attack, thus triggering a mistaken preemption.<br />

North Korea will proliferate ballistic missiles – they have access to the technology<br />
Shaughnessy 11 − CNN National Security Producer (Larry, “Gates: North Korea could have long-range missile within 5 years,” January 11, Lexis) Crowe<br />
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said Tuesday that North Korea is becoming a direct threat to the United States, asserting that the rogue Communist regime is within five years of developing intercontinental ballistic missiles. &quot;I think that North Korea will have developed an intercontinental ballistic missile within that time frame,&quot; Gates told reporters during a visit to China. But he said he has doubts that the North Koreans will be able to field many ICBMs. &quot;I believe they will have a very limited capability,&quot; he said. A spokesman for the Defense Intelligence Agency later supported Gates' remarks, saying, &quot;North Korea's two recent attempts at 'space launches' indicate a continued trend toward development of ICBM capabilities. This trend of development, in addition to North Korea's stated goal of developing a nuclear warhead, supports the Secretary of Defense's recent statement regarding potential threats from North Korea.&quot; If North Korea acts with urgency, it could have ICBMs in five years, said John Pike, founder of GlobalSecurity.org, a military analysis group. Part of development is just a matter of trial and error. &quot;If you test enough times, you will eventually test out whatever fabrication and design flaws there are and you will have a workable missile,&quot; Pike told CNN. North Korea's most recent test of it's longest-range ballistic missile, in April 2009, was a failure in that it did not put a satellite into space. But experts point out that it flew over Japan before crashing, farther than any other North Korean missile. The 2,000-mile flight proved North Korea is getting better at building long-range missiles. The North Koreans are &quot;pretty aggressive with its ballistic missile program,&quot; said one U.S. official. &quot;It poses a &quot;serious threat.&quot; The Gates assessment reflects not new thinking but rather an intelligence estimate put out a decade ago, according to US officials. The 2001 National Intelligence Estimate reads &quot;most Intelligence Community agencies project that before 2015 the United States most likely will face ICBM threats from North Korea.&quot; <br />
<br />
This collapses deterrence causes nuclear war<br />
Mistry 2003 – assistant professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati (Dinshaw, “Containing missile proliferation”, Google Books, pages 9-12, WEA)<br />
Thus the missile threat is real (hundreds of short- and medium-range missiles can strike states in Europe and Asia), but its most dangerous aspect (the proliferation of ICBMs) is still limited. The threat could either expand or remain limited in the coming years: it would increase significantly if regional powers obtain foreign technical assistance to build greater quantities of more powerful missiles; it could be limited if foreign technical assistance remains embargoed and political initiatives and institutional barriers restrain target missile programs. The Strategic Consequences of Missile Proliferation Ballistic missiles are particularly deadly nuclear delivery systems and terror weapons because they cover distances of hundreds to thousands of kilometers in a matter of minutes, and are hard to defend against. Missile attacks and deployments therefore have serious strategic, political, and military consequences. On strategic grounds, missile proliferation undermines the nuclear, biological, and chemical nonproliferation regimes. Ballistic missiles enable states (and nonstate actors and terrorist groups) to quickly deliver weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) to distant regions, thereby exacerbating the WMD threat and weakening the nonproliferation regime. Conversely, halting missile proliferation mitigates the WMD threat, strengthens the nonproliferation regime, and enhances international security.  Missile attacks are a significant military threat to armed forces, international peacekeeping forces, and civilian populations. Missiles have been used in several international and civil conflicts: Germany fired thousands of missiles against London and Antwerp in World War II; Iraq launched hundreds of missiles against Iran and several dozen at Israel and Saudi Arabia; Afghan groups fired hundreds of missiles in their civil war, and missiles were used on a smaller scale in other conflicts. The military impact of missiles in these conflicts should not be exaggerated, because missiles are not very accurate, most missiles did not hit any significant targets, and they did not result in mass fatalities. Yet the occasional missile caused dozens, even hundreds, of casualties. In the Gulf War, a Scud strike on an American military barracks caused 28 fatalities, which was the largest number of allied fatalities in a single engagement Another Scud landed some 300 meters from cargo and oil facilities and would have caused high casualties if it had hit these targets. Missiles can be even more deadly against civilian populations; in World War II, a V-2 strike on Antwerp's Rex cinema caused 270 fatalities. Moreover, the above examples involved missiles with conventional warheads. A WMD missile attack would be far more catastrophic. Missile activity has destabilizing political consequences in both wartime and peacetime. Missile strikes that terrorize a target population and increase pressures on political leaders to retaliate can considerably escalate conflicts. In the Gulf War, Iraq's missile strikes against Israel could have had a very serious political impact. The Coalition might have fractured as Arab states left it if Israel had retaliated against Iraq. Further, ballistic missiles escalated tensions in the prewar phase (because of Iraq's declared policy of threatening Israel), widened the war's parameters once the fighting began, and diverted significant air power and special force resources away from other military tasks. Even when they are not used in wars, missile deployments and tests exacerbate interstate tensions. Three examples illustrate this point. First, Soviet missile deployments in Cuba provoked the 1962 missile crisis that brought the two superpowers to the brink of a nuclear exchange. Second, Chinese missile tests off Taiwan in 1995 and 1996 led to a tense standoff between the United States and China, and two U.S. naval battle groups were sent to the Taiwan Strait Third, North Korea's August 1998 rocket test over Japan terrorized Japan's population. Tokyo demanded an apology and explanation from Pyongyang and sus- pended its economic aid. North Korea responded harshly, declaring &quot;Japan's behavior is ridiculous,&quot; adding, &quot;We warn Japan to ... act with discretion and renounce its anachronistic hostile policy.&quot;8  Missile proliferation can also increase the likelihood of interstate conflict in the long term. International conflict studies suggest that neighboring states are more likely to fight wars with each other, and that proximity correlates positively with conflict.9 Ballistic missiles can quickly strike distant states and thereby bring distant states &quot;closer&quot; to each other, which (especially if deterrence stability cannot be attained) could increase interstate tensions and the likelihood of regional conflict. Moreover, missile deployments can be provocative in a region where nuclear weapons are vulnerable to a preemptive strike. Missiles then under- mine the stability of deterrence.<br />

North Korea’s totalitarian regime systematically murders millions of its own people and will continue to do so − failure to respond to this amounts to complicity in the face of democide − this is a side constraint − unification through war is the only solution, and it’s worth it<br />
Rummel 4 − Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of Hawaii (Rudolph, “The Democial Famine in North Korea,” February 12, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:455:http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles4/RummelKorea.php --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles4/RummelKorea.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles4/RummelKorea.php</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:455 -->) Crowe<br />
One of the most ignored cases of ongoing democide is the Kim Chong-il's regime created famine in North Korea. Perhaps as many as 3,000,000 North Koreas already have died of starvation or associated diseases, not to mention those that have been summarily executed. While it is true that this famine was not intentional in the sense that Kim said &quot;Let there be famine--I want to starve to death as many people as I can,&quot; or, &quot;I will use famine to enforce communism on the people,&quot; as was true for Stalin's intentional famine of the Ukraine in 1932, it is intentional in another sense. If parents cause the death of their children through a reckless and depraved indifference to their lives, such as punishing them through starvation, even were their deaths not intended, they could be tried in a court of law for murder. And the North Korean famine is intentional in that sense--the very communist totalitarian policies that created the famine continue despite their mortal consequences for the North Korean People, and with what must be Kim's clear knowledge of this.<br />
And here there can be no doubt that it is the fanatical devotion to communism itself that is responsible. Consider the world's most devastating famines. They all occurred under communist regimes. That in China under Mao in the early 1960s may have starved to death as many as 40,000,000 people, although a more conservative estimate puts the toll at 27,000,000. Even this estimate would make the famine the worlds deadliest, ever. This was due to Mao's Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s and especially his forcible collectivization of all peasants into factory like communes. Then there was the famine in the early twenties in the new Soviet Union under Lenin during which he tried to impose communist agricultural policies on the peasant, seize land from &quot;rich&quot; estates, and forcible requisition grain and produce. This caused huge peasant rebellions all over the country, and a Bread War between peasants and the communist regime in which hundreds of thousands were killed. The resulting famine alone may have killed about 5,000,000 people, and another 5,000,000 million may have been saved by foreign food aid, particularly from the United States. Then there was the aforementioned Stalin made famine in the early 1930s in Ukraine in which some 5,000,000 Ukrainians were killed, and another 2,000,000 died in the caucuses and elsewhere.<br />
Now, there is North Korea in which even as I write this people are dying by the thousands everyday due to the regime. These are human beings; these are men, woman, and children, old and young, all with individual personalities, individual skills, and human potential; all by virtue of their humanity, having a right to not only life, but also freedom. Yet, they die because of the ideological fanaticism of the small gang of thugs who hold power over them with their guns.<br />
Consider what these people face just in their human need for food and health, leaving aside their enslavement:<br />
North Korea's population requires about six million tons of food for each person to have a minimum diet. The regime controls all farming, all agriculture, and can only produce about four million tons. This causes a food shortfall of two million tons, or 33 percent below what is minimally required. <br />
Kim has imposed rationing, and his handouts are the only way to legally obtain food. There are no independent channels of distribution, except for the black market. This means that people get food as Kim and his thugs desire. <br />
Thus, Kim's food distribution system is highly unequal. Food is put aside first for &quot;patriotic rice&quot; and &quot;military rice.&quot; This has resulted in Kim cutting the consumption of 700g of food a day per person by 22 percent, or to 400g a day, well below the minimum consumption of rice set by the World Food and Agricultural Organization.<br />
This is not all. In this &quot;classless&quot; communist society, the regime has divided North Koreans into a rigid hierarchy of three classes, and fifty-one subdivisions, depending on a person's status within the communist North Korean Workers Party and the military, their perceived faithfulness to communism, and family backgrounds. In other words, Kim uses the very food people need to live as a tool to reward and punish his subject slaves. Thus, vast numbers of people whose loyalties are questioned or may be deemed useless to the regime do not receive enough food to live long. The worst off are those people and families incarcerated in Kim's concentration or forced labor camps. They receive the lowest food allowance of all, in spite of their being forced to work from 5 am to 8 pm.<br />
There are no hospitals, doctors, or medical distribution and supply companies independent of the regime. All are nationalized. As with food, therefore, medical treatment and medicine is distributed as reward and punishment. Not surprisingly, medicine is in short supply and not available everywhere. Thus, the diseases associated with famine and malnutrition often gets no medical treatment at all. Even a cold under such conditions can be mortal. An indicator of this situation is that only half of the population is now inoculation for such diseases as infantile paralysis and measles.<br />
Attempts on the part of the South Korea, the United Nations, and the United States, the major giver, to provide food aid has not worked well. In 2002 food aid was 62 percent under its target, but even if the target was reached, it would not substantial improve on the food available to the average Korean, even were it equally distributed. But it is not. The regime will not guarantee that food reaches those who need it most, it does not allow aid givers to carefully monitor who gets the food, and in some cases, it has redirected the food to its favorite classes or to the military.<br />
Aside from the daily accumulation of dead, the effects on the living have been disastrous. Long-term malnutrition has effected about half the living, and caused excessive underdevelopment in children--they have stunted in growth and excessively thin. There is wide-scale dwarfishness and, most important from any humanitarian point of view, their brain development has been retarded. Moreover, malnutrition has fostered rickets, scurvy, nyctalopia, hepatitis, and tuberculosis, among other diseases. North Korea is one of the few countries in which population mortality rates have been increasing. The life expectancy has fallen to 66.8 years from 73.2; newborn mortality rate has increased from 14 to 22.5; and the rate for those under five years of age has increased from 27 to 48 per thousand.<br />
And so on.<br />
And all this without even recounting the regime's terror, repression, executions, and absolute violations of what those living in liberal democracies take for granted, such as the freedom of religion and speech, of opportunity and association, fair trials, rule of law, sanctity of the person, and freedom from fear. <br />
What is to be done? There is a vast complicity in Kim's despicable treatment of his people and their continuing starvation. Oh, aid is being given, as mentioned, although hardly enough. But this has to be given each year forever as long as the regime survives. The complicity lies in the political failure to recognize the cost of appeasing this regime in human lives, health, security, and welfare. And appeasement it is. <br />
The North Korean communist regime should be forced to reform itself as least as much as has Chinese Communist Party over China, and better, to begin to democratize as has South Korea. Ultimately, democratic unification between North and South Korea is the goal. And forced not by sanctions, which not only rarely work, and punish the people rather than a regime, but by the threat of force, and if ultimately need be, by force itself. Diplomacy does not work. It did not on Hitler, it did not on Stalin, and it did not on Mao, just to mention a long line of failures of diplomacy to alter the domestic terror of totalitarian regimes. For one, Kim and his henchmen should be recognized as a megamurdering gang. They should be made pariahs among nations. Absolute diplomatic chill. Second, there are many ways of using force overtly and covertly that can be employed, such as attempt at destabilization of the regime, assassinations (yes, I'm in favor of assassinating these thugs who are responsible for murdering millions); and at the extreme, the threat of military action. To those who may have gasped, taken a step back, and covered their mouths with their hands, consider the human toll: There is the day-by-day, year-by-year, decade-by-decade lose of human lives and extreme suffering of 22 million people, versus the one time cost of military action, if it comes to that. How many would die is such action against North Korea, and the war that might result? Take a very high number--a million. Since there can be no doubt that the North Korean regime would lose, this cost would be once and only once, and much less than the three million estimated to have already died at the hands of the regime just by famine, and the millions more to come. But, surely, it would not come to that. The United States, among others, now has the military power to make fast work of the North's defensive and offensive capabilities. That has been shown in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br />
I know, I know, I am saying that war is good in this case, and willing to suffer the death of so many human lives. I started my career as a pacifist about war, but my studies of democide and other horrors that people suffer under such regimes as Kim's, have changed my views. My morality is the same, but I come to recognize the moral stupidity of not arming the police, refusal to attack terrorist because some hostages may die, or refusal to defend freedom when it is under attack because of the deaths inevitable in war. To those who say that war is wrong I can only ask, &quot;What is right about the deaths, murders, miserable slavery, and total loss of human rights that 22 million people are suffering under Kim? What is wrong about risking the lives of, at the extreme, a million people, to save the lives and promote human rights and security for 22 million? Can there be a greater case for a just war, if it comes to that? Does not the sheer human cost of letting Kim to continue to enslave North Koreas as he does far exceed the cost of war?<br />

SKFTA destroys Japan’s economy---kills exports<br />
Nikkei Weekly 12-13-10 (“U.S.-South Korea FTA Threatens Japan exporters,” lexis, jj)<br />
The free trade agreement that the U.S. and South Korea signed Dec. 3 is sure to deal a blow to Japanese exporters, from automakers to electronics makers and chemical producers.   Automobiles account for about 30% of Japan's exports to the U.S.; the free trade deal agreed between Washington and Seoul will scrap U.S. tariffs on South Korean cars after several years and is likely to put a dent in Japan's shipments. Lagging behind South Korea in signing free trade pacts is costing Japan a lot, and companies' complaints about the government's lethargy on trade are growing louder.   The Cabinet Office estimates that Japan's real gross domestic product will take a hit of 600-700 billion yen annually if Japan fails to join the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (TPP) - which U.S. and other nations are currently negotiating - and sign economic partnership agreements with the European Union and China, assuming South Korea inks FTAs with the U.S., China and the EU. Satoru Okuda of the Institute of Developing Economies estimates South Korea's free trade pacts with the EU and the U.S. will divert $1.4 billion worth of U.S.-bound exports annually from Japan to South Korea. <br />

Recently, many economists and scholars in the U.S. have been looking backward to Japan's banking disaster of the 1990s, hoping to learn lessons for America's current crisis. Instead, they should be looking ahead to what might occur if Japan goes into a full-fledged depression. If Japan's economy collapses, supply chains across the globe will be affected and numerous economies will face severe disruptions, most notably China's. China is currently Japan's largest import provider, and the Japanese slowdown is creating tremendous pressure on Chinese factories. Just last week, the Chinese government announced that 20 million rural migrants had lost their jobs. Closer to home, Japan may also start running out of surplus cash, which it has used to purchase U.S. securities for years. For the first time in a generation, Tokyo is running trade deficits -- five months in a row so far. The political and social fallout from a Japanese depression also would be devastating. In the face of economic instability, other Asian nations may feel forced to turn to more centralized -- even authoritarian -- control to try to limit the damage. Free-trade agreements may be rolled back and political freedom curtailed. Social stability in emerging, middle-class societies will be severely tested, and newly democratized states may find it impossible to maintain power. Progress toward a more open, integrated Asia is at risk, with the potential for increased political tension in the world's most heavily armed region. This is the backdrop upon which the U.S. government is set to expand the national debt by a trillion dollars or more. Without massive debt purchases by Japan and China, the U.S. may not be able to finance the cost of the stimulus package, creating a trapdoor under the U.S. economy.<br />

SKFTA tanks democracy<br />

The democratic rights of people are subverted by investor protection clauses.  Governments subjected to these clauses must now look over their shoulders before passing laws or regulations for fear of being challenged in foreign trade tribunals with, or by depocketed multinatiponal corporations.  Past agreements have largely been between unequal partners, so most of these agreements have been between developed countries and underdeveloped countries, and American multinationals have been given the advantage in these various suits and so forth because of it.  But the situation with the Korea Free Trade Agreement is quite different.  Korea is a very developed economy with the ability and most certainly the desire to invest in the United States.  And since, well in fact between 2001 and 2007, they have invested more than $15 billion in the United States and some of that coming into Orgeon as well.  Korea is a capital exporter.  According to Public Citizen, there are 85 Korean multinational corporations which are operating currently in the United States, and any one of those could bring suit before an international trade tribunal to overturn or at least to challenge laws that are made either at the national level, regulations made at the national level, or at the city, county, or state level.  Here in Oregon, Korea has investments in a semiconductor plant, an animal feed processor, and a shipping company.  Next door in Washington, their investments include air transport services, commercial banking services, marine transportation services, containerized international shipping, and international passenger and cargo air transport.  Huge.  And that’s just in Washington State.  There is also fear that American companies with subsidiaries in Korea will be able to use those Korean subsidiaries to challenge American laws and regulations, just the same way Pacific Rim was able to move their subsidiary.  So, in closing, a couple statements.  If democracy demands transparency and openness, free trade agreements are anti-democratic.  If democracy demands that government represents the desires and wishes of the people, free trade agreements are anti-democratic.  If democracy demands that corporations be subservient to people, free trade agreements are anti-democratic.  Only decisions made by citizens at the local level can truly be democratic.  We may decide to delegate some of our authority to higher representative bodies.  Every time we do that, we lose our ability to democratically participate in decisions which affect us.  Free trade agreements pass authority from our elect officials and ourselves to a new level, allowing non-elected, non-representative multinational corporations to challenge all our laws if those laws are perceived to threaten corporate profits.  This is anti-democratic.  So we must say no to the Korean Free Trade Agreement because it, like all, most all of these other agreements, allow multinational corporations to usurp our democracy via the investor protection clauses.  Thank you.<br />

Democracy solves extinction<br />

OTHER THREATS This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security and well-being in the coming years and decades. In the former Yugoslavia nationalist aggression tears at the stability of Europe and could easily spread. The flow of illegal drugs intensifies through increasingly powerful international crime syndicates that have made common cause with authoritarian regimes and have utterly corrupted the institutions of tenuous, democratic ones. Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons continue to proliferate. The very source of life on Earth, the global ecosystem, appears increasingly endangered. Most of these new and unconventional threats to security are associated with or aggravated by the weakness or absence of democracy, with its provisions for legality, accountability, popular sovereignty, and openness. LESSONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY The experience of this century offers important lessons. Countries that govern themselves in a truly democratic fashion do not go to war with one another. They do not aggress against their neighbors to aggrandize themselves or glorify their leaders. Democratic governments do not ethnically &quot;cleanse&quot; their own populations, and they are much less likely to face ethnic insurgency. Democracies do not sponsor terrorism against one another. They do not build weapons of mass destruction to use on or to threaten one another. Democratic countries form more reliable, open, and enduring trading partnerships. In the long run they offer better and more stable climates for investment. They are more environmentally responsible because they must answer to their own citizens, who organize to protest the destruction of their environments. They are better bets to honor international treaties since they value legal obligations and because their openness makes it much more difficult to breach agreements in secret. Precisely because, within their own borders, they respect competition, civil liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.<br />

SKFTA kills Korean food security<br />

Although the Korea FTA does not cover rice, the Agreement on Agriculture has already gradually opened the Korean rice market. By 2014, it will be completely opened. Korean farmers have already been hit hard by free trade, but the stark differences between South Korean and U.S. farms will drive most farmers to ruin. South Korea has just 4.2 million acres of farmland are under cultivation, compared with the United States, which has 434 million acres. The average farm in South Korea is 1.2 acres, compared with the average U.S. farm size of 71 acres. According to Lee of the Korean Peasants League, if the FTA is implemented, South Korean agricultural production will decrease by 45 percent and roughly half of Korea’s farmers will lose their livelihoods. As Korea’s dependency on imports and global food prices soar, South Korean corporations have been purchasing and leasing land in Africa and Asia as a  safeguard against the looming threat of food insecurity. In 2009, the South Korean corporation Daewoo, which is also owned by GM, nearly signed a deal with Madagascar for 3.2 million acres of farmland – half the country’s arable land – to produce mainly corn for export back to Korea over the next 99 years. Such land grabs would push residents of those nations into the same food deficits that Korea now faces. Lee Kwang Seok of the Korean Peasants League said that there are now some 30 Korean corporations buying land and investing in industrialized food production abroad, while Korean farmers who grow food cannot survive and are given no support. “Does such a things really have to be done,” Lee recently asked. “We who have lived through Japanese colonialism, do we have to go to other countries and do this?” In a recent op-ed in the Joong Ang Daily, a research fellow with the Samsung Economic Research Institute argues, “It is crucial to secure overseas agricultural suppliers to cope with speculative demand and global climate change.” <br />

SEOUL, Sept. 30 (Yonhap) -- President Lee Myung-bak said Thursday that South Korea will step up efforts to help the international community tackle famine in many countries as it has expertise on food security.     &quot;Today, energy and food security is an urgent issue that threatens the future of mankind in the 21st century,&quot; Lee said in his speech at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Regional Conference underway in Gyeongju, 371 kilometers southeast of Seoul.     He stressed that food security, a main agenda item at the session, is an issue of basic rights directly associated with human survival.     Lee noted official data showing that 16 percent of the world's population suffers chronic hunger and one child starves to death every six seconds.     &quot;This is an ethical challenge to mankind,&quot; he said, adding that South Korea can serve as a role model for countries stricken with famine.     South Korea was one of the world's poorest countries just decades ago and received food aid and technical training from the FAO and the international community.     &quot;South Korea has completely resolved the famine problem through green revolution over the past 40 years and achieved food security,&quot; he said. &quot;South Korea plans to take part in the international community's efforts to resolve the famine problem, taking advantage of its experience in resolving food security.&quot; <br />

Food insecurity sparks World War 3<br />
Calvin ’98 (William, Theoretical Neurophysiologist – U Washington, Atlantic Monthly, January, Vol 281, No. 1, p. 47-64)<br />
The population-crash scenario is surely the most appalling. Plummeting crop yields would cause some powerful countries to try to take over their neighbors or distant lands -- if only because their armies, unpaid and lacking food, would go marauding, both at home and across the borders. The better-organized countries would attempt to use their armies, before they fell apart entirely, to take over countries with significant remaining resources, driving out or starving their inhabitants if not using modern weapons to accomplish the same end: eliminating competitors for the remaining food. This would be a worldwide problem -- and could lead to a Third World War -- but Europe's vulnerability is particularly easy to analyze. The last abrupt cooling, the Younger Dryas, drastically altered Europe's climate as far east as Ukraine. Present-day Europe has more than 650 million people. It has excellent soils, and largely grows its own food. It could no longer do so if it lost the extra warming from the North Atlantic.<br />

SKFTA accelerates warming<br />
Grevatt ‘11 (Martha, “U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement: an attack on workers in both countries.”  Workers World, Jan 20.  Online)<br />
Like NAFTA, KORUS-FTA is bad for the environment. Communities that take action against corporate polluters could likely see a repeat of the Metalclad case. The changes in the new free trade agreement, hailed by both Ford CEO Alan Mulally and UAW President Bob King, make it easier for Detroit to export vehicles by lowering south Korea’s fuel economy standards and reducing higher taxes on larger engines. That means more carbon emissions, adding to global warming.<br />

Warming causes Extinction<br />
Tickell, 2008 (Oliver, Climate Researcher, The Gaurdian, “On a planet 4C hotter, all we can prepare for is extinction”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:461:http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:461 -->)<br />
We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told the Guardian last week. At first sight this looks like wise counsel from the climate science adviser to Defra. But the idea that we could adapt to a 4C rise is absurd and dangerous. Global warming on this scale would be a catastrophe that would mean, in the immortal words that Chief Seattle probably never spoke, &quot;the end of living and the beginning of survival&quot; for humankind. Or perhaps the beginning of our extinction. The collapse of the polar ice caps would become inevitable, bringing long-term sea level rises of 70-80 metres. All the world's coastal plains would be lost, complete with ports, cities, transport and industrial infrastructure, and much of the world's most productive farmland. The world's geography would be transformed much as it was at the end of the last ice age, when sea levels rose by about 120 metres to create the Channel, the North Sea and Cardigan Bay out of dry land. Weather would become extreme and unpredictable, with more frequent and severe droughts, floods and hurricanes. The Earth's carrying capacity would be hugely reduced. Billions would undoubtedly die. Watson's call was supported by the government's former chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, who warned that &quot;if we get to a four-degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase&quot;. This is a remarkable understatement. The climate system is already experiencing significant feedbacks, notably the summer melting of the Arctic sea ice. The more the ice melts, the more sunshine is absorbed by the sea, and the more the Arctic warms. And as the Arctic warms, the release of billions of tonnes of methane – a greenhouse gas 70 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years – captured under melting permafrost is already under way. To see how far this process could go, look 55.5m years to the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, when a global temperature increase of 6C coincided with the release of about 5,000 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, both as CO2 and as methane from bogs and seabed sediments. Lush subtropical forests grew in polar regions, and sea levels rose to 100m higher than today. It appears that an initial warming pulse triggered other warming processes. Many scientists warn that this historical event may be analogous to the present: the warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth.<br />

CTBT on the docket now – but controversial policies will derail its passage<br />
GSN, Global Security Newswire, “Obama Could Launch CTBT Ratification Push in March”, March 7th 2011, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:462:http://gsn.nti.org/gsn/nw_20110307_2210.php --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://gsn.nti.org/gsn/nw_20110307_2210.php" rel="nofollow">http://gsn.nti.org/gsn/nw_20110307_2210.php</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:462 -->, Najor<br />
The Obama administration is set to submit a new intelligence analysis to the U.S. Senate in March as part of an anticipated push to win congressional approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Kyodo News reported on Sunday (see GSN, March 2). Following circulation of the new National Intelligence Estimate, which outlines data said to support the case for ratification, the National Academies of Science is expected this spring to release a separate assessment in support of the pact's ratification, according to a high-level U.S. government source and an expert with administration ties.  The administration intends &quot;to move forward starting in March or so to begin providing background information about CTBT to the Senate, all in preparation for initiating a new debate with the intention of getting U.S. ratification,&quot; the expert said.  In making its argument for the pact's approval, the administration would refer to recent additions to the global array of sensors and laboratories intended for detecting underground test blasts, as well as strides in U.S. capabilities for evaluating the reliability of nuclear weapons without the use of test detonations, the insiders said.  &quot;My impression is that these are sincere plans, but of course unexpected political events can quickly change matters,&quot; the expert said.  In the current Congress, no fewer than 14 Republican senators must endorse the treaty for the pact to gain the 67 votes required for ratification. The GOP-led Senate rejected the pact in 1999.  &quot;A key question that will emerge this summer is whether there is time to prepare for a vote before the 2012 presidential and congressional elections begin to get in the way,&quot; the expert said. <br />

CTBT solves extinction<br />
Granoff and Tyson, President and Senior Author of the Global Security Institute, 09 (Jonathan and Rhianna, “Achieving the Entry-Into-Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty: What UN Member States Can Do Now,” April, Accessed 7-12-09)<br />
The treaty remains as important today as ever throughout its long, tortuous history. The threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons is arguably greater than at any time since the creation of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which itself is under newfound strains: the 21 st century threat of nuclear terrorism adds a new proliferation dimension against which existing mechanisms are unable to protect; a “renaissance” in nuclear energy highlights inadequacies of the non- proliferation regime; insufficient implementation of the disarmament obligations of the NPT has weakened many nations’ faith in the treaty; suspicious activity has cropped up across the globe in nearly every continent, including the potential quest of existing states to engage in vertical proliferation. After NPT States parties failed to strengthen the NPT at the 2005 Review Conference, it has become ever more imperative to bolster the global disarmament and non- proliferation regime in substantial ways. These challenges will persist despite positive signs coming from a new administration in Washington. From the creation of the NPT, a legal prohibition against testing has been central. States parties have affirmed and reaffirmed this centrality at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference 1 and again at the 2000 Review Conference. 2 Should States parties to the NPT fail to adhere to their own commitments to pursue the CTBT’s entry-into-force, faith in (and commitment to) the NPT—and the global non-proliferation regime at large—will suffer . The CTBT is one of the most effective non-proliferation tools in our shared toolbox. The global verification monitoring system, the International Monitoring System (IMS), can detect all nuclear explosions over a kiloton, (and sometimes smaller), according to a 2002 report from the prestigious US National Academy of Sciences. 3 Smaller tests are unlikely, as they are not useful for major nuclear powers and are unreliable indicators for new proliferators. 4 Beyond these immediate security gains, the CTBT is an important element in the new security paradigm that must emerge. A global norm prohibiting nuclear weapons testing is a light of hope that will help bring us out of the shadow of adversity and aggression. It will advance a cooperative security regime upon which our mutual survival, indeed the survival of the planet, depends. Just as the global recession has rendered the interdependence of our economies as conventional wisdom, so too must we realize the interdependence of our security, and build a network of global norms and laws that are non-discriminatory and technically-verifiable. It is for this latter reason that the CTBT is perhaps most important. The treaty is not just an effective arms control and non-proliferation tool. It is, in essence, a game-changer, a way not only by which we will strengthen our collective security, but will actually impel us to cooperate in that collective regime. The IMS is a global, holistic tool that both reinforces and transcends national security interests. It is a global intelligence gatherer which informs all nations, not just with data on nuclear explosions, but on earthquakes, tsunamis and other natural disasters possibly made more frequent by the collective challenge of climate change. 6 It constitutes another part, a physical, tangible part, of the web of relationships that engender the cooperation necessary to address the global challenges that threaten the existence of civilization and the living systems upon which it depends.<br />

A senior State Department official last week said there is a realistic chance for U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported (see GSN, Feb. 17).  &quot;Our view is there is a very good case to be made that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is now at a point&quot; where the Senate might offer the approval needed to bring the pact into effect, Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller told the newspaper.  The United States is one of 44 nations that must ratify the prohibition on nuclear test blasts before it can enter into force. It is among nine holdouts in that group; the others are China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan.  The Obama administration has indicated that CTBT ratification remains among its nonproliferation priorities following enactment of a new U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control treaty.  The Senate rejected the pact in 1999. Critics at the time said that future tests might be necessary to ensure the U.S. nuclear arsenal remained in working order, and questioned whether there was adequate technology to catch other nations that might conduct illicit testing.  Supporters say that developments in subsequent years should put those concerns to rest.  &quot;I think we have a lot more evidence that the Stockpile Stewardship Program is working well,&quot; Gottemoeller said, referring to the U.S. scientific program for maintaining the safety and reliability of the arsenal without testing.  The International Monitoring System, a global array of sensors and laboratories intended to detect any underground test blast, is four-fifths finished, Gottemoeller said.  &quot;The monitoring system is very large to make sure no nuclear tests go undetected,&quot; according to Annika Thunborg, spokeswoman for the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (Keith Rogers, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Feb. 26). <br />

CTBT will pass – 4 reasons <br />
Japan Economic Newswire, March 6th 2011, Lexis, Najor<br />
The U.S. official, however, emphasized several points that could expand the support base in the Republican Senate for ratification.  Firstly, the United States has improved its own detection measurements for covert nuclear tests by using seismic technologies, satellite images and debris-fallout collection measures over the past decade, the official said.  The International Monitoring System, created by a preparatory body of the CTBT Organization, also adds to the administration's case. The IMS had established and certified 264 monitoring and analytical stations worldwide as of January 2011. The detection capabilities of the IMS and the United States would enhance the verification mechanism and alleviate concerns among the Republicans about potential &quot;cheating.&quot;  Also technical improvements in the SSP would be good ammunition for Obama to persuade skeptical senators who put priority on maintaining a safe, secure and reliable nuclear deterrence for the United States and its allies including Japan, the official and the specialist said.  Potential political costs for the resumption of nuclear tests are also significantly high, the official added. The United States suspended nuclear tests after President George H.W. Bush announced a testing moratorium in 1992.<br />

While the FMCT continues to be in a bedlam in the Conference on Disarmament, the CTBT is an area where the US can, and should unilaterally move forward. Obama’s democratic predecessor Bill Clinton had to face an embarrassing defeat in his efforts to push forward the ratification of this treaty in 1999, and this weighs heavily on the minds of the disarmament pundits who wish to revive it. In fact any present attempts to re-visit the CTBT have been emphatically opposed by the Republican minority whip, Jon Kyl, who is quite influential in the Senate. However this should not deter the revisionists.  There still exists hope for the CTBT especially since the New START agreement with Russia was ratified by the Senate earlier this year despite Kyl’s opposition to it. Obama’s preference to go ahead with the CTBT in these difficult times will serve to strengthen US' geo-strategic interests worldwide. <br />

Though no one expects an enthusiastic President to ride on this success and hasten the ratification process of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the New START ratification, and the bi-partisan support it gained, raises the morale for US non-proliferation managers to work out a reconcilable process that could enable the CTBT ratification before the President’s term ends in 2012. That the security implications of New START are diametrically different from that of the CTBT, despite both being disarmament initiatives, will factor in this campaign. While New START only trims a superfluous nuclear arsenal while enabling funds for nuclear weapons modernisation, the CTBT has implications for their upgradation and improvisation into an infinite future with minimal firewalls against potentially unfavourable security environments. <br />

Will Pass – Obama has the votes <br />
Mistry ’10 (Dinshaw, associate professor of Poli Sci @ U of Cincinnati, 12-29, New York Times, “Toward a Nuclear Test Ban: Why a Treaty is Viable” lexis, jj)<br />
In ''The Senate's Next Task: Ratifying the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 29), Mikhail Gorbachev calls for Senate action on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Two points suggest that this treaty is viable. First, the New Start treaty was approved by about one-third of the Republican senators, and, if a similar percentage continues to be supportive, then the test ban can advance in the next Senate, despite the reduced Democratic majority. Second, one of the two main Republican concerns with New Start, the issue of missile defense, is helped by the test ban treaty. By preventing countries from testing smaller warheads and developing multiple-warhead missiles, the treaty makes defenses against such missiles easier. The other concern, about sufficient financing for the United States nuclear establishment, was addressed in the context of New Start, and senators are therefore not likely to seek even more money when considering the test ban.<br />

Two arguments raised by the opposition to the treaty at the time of the debate on the CTBT regarded the issue of verification and the question of whether our nuclear arsenal could be maintained without detonating nuclear weapons.  Those concerns, while sufficiently answered in 1999, are now addressed by a significant array of bipartisan scientists and national security experts.  President Ronald Reagan’s Secretary of State George Shultz, Henry Kissinger and President George H.W. Bush’s National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft have come out strongly in favor of this treaty on national security grounds.  This treaty is urgent to the security and health of our country because it helps to lessen the only remaining existential threat to the United States. A nuclear detonation, either by virtue of terrorism or a general attack, would lead to the devastation of the public health infrastructure in the area and the spread of dangerous radiation for miles.  A physician’s ability to respond to this is woefully inadequate, focusing on supportive care and comfort measures. As with most serious illnesses in medicine, prevention is the best practice.  With no need or desire to test nuclear weapons and a clear national security interest in preventing other countries from doing so, the CTBT is a common- sense treaty.  New Hampshire Sens. Kelly Ayotte and Shaheen have an opportunity to help lead a bipartisan majority to stop the worldwide testing of nuclear weapons and help reduce the risk posed from these weapons of mass destruction.<br />

US reducing its role in Libya – Budget and overstretch concerns<br />

WASHINGTON — Hemmed in by two other wars, an overstretched military and serious budgetary woes, the United States is reducing its role in the multinational military operation in Libya and is looking to other nations to arm and train rebels fighting to oust dictator Moammar Gadhafi, top U.S. Defense officials said Thursday.  &quot;My view is that the future of Libya — the United States ought not take responsibility for that. I think there are other countries both in the region and our allies in Europe who can participate in the effort,&quot; Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee. &quot;I just don't think we need to take on another one.&quot;  Gates' comments — which were echoed by Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — during a day of congressional hearings on Libya provided a window into the debate inside the Obama administration over how much U.S. support should be given to Gadhafi's outgunned opposition. <br />

The Pentagon has flexibility within its operations and maintenance accounts to shift funds to pay for unplanned operations.  It is that “huge fungibility” within the operations and maintenance coffers that will keep the congressional budget stalemate from forcing Pentagon officials to seek a Libya supplemental sooner than if a 2011 defense appropriations bill had already been signed by the president, Adams said. A senior Democratic aide on the House Appropriations Committee downplayed the possibility of a new supplemental spending bill. Citing the contingency funding already built into the Pentagon budget, the aide said the Libya operation “does not seem likely to require a supplemental.”<br />

U.S. re-engagement in combat operations in Libya could help break a stalemate between rebels and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi forces, but Washington appears reluctant to step back fully into an already messy conflict.  French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said this week Gaddafi's attacks would not be stopped without U.S. participation in strikes on his tanks and artillery, which ceased after NATO took command of Libyan operations on March 31.  A senior French official said on Wednesday U.S. involvement would help as European air forces conducting ground strikes lack low-flying A-10 &quot;tankbuster&quot; planes and AC-130 gunships that analysts say would be useful against Gaddafi's forces.  While stating publicly that those aircraft remain available if requested, Washington is reluctant to become ensnared in another conflict in the Muslim world, with a swift, decisive outcome seeming difficult to achieve. <br />

Qaddafi fall creates a power vacuum in Libya<br />

Libya today faces a dark future in the short term. While Qaddafi's departure from the scene would be mourned by few, it would also create an enormous power vacuum. Entirely unclear is what glue will hold together this largely decentralized country, in which nationalist identification is low, and tribal and clan affinity paramount. Unlike in neighboring Egypt, the military lacks the cohesion or unity needed to hold together the country. <br />

This bodes ill for foreign interests in Libya, where they have not had the same security concerns in recent years that they have had in Algeria or Yemen. If the Libyans truly buy into the concept of targeting the far enemy that supports the state, it would not be out of the realm of possibility for them to begin to attack multinational oil companies, foreign diplomatic facilities and even foreign companies and hotels. While Seif al-Islam, who certainly has political motives to hype such a threat, has mentioned this possibility, so have the governments of Egypt and Italy. Should Libya become chaotic and the jihadists become able to establish an operational base amid the chaos, Egypt and Italy will have to be concerned about not only refugee problems but also the potential spillover of jihadists. Certainly, at the very least the weapons looted in Libya could easily be sold or given to jihadists in places like Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria, turning militancy in Libya into a larger regional problem. In a worst-case scenario, if Libya experiences a vacuum of power, it could become the next Iraq or Pakistan, a gathering place for jihadists from around the region and the world. The country did serve as such a base for a wide array of Marxist and rejectionist terrorists and militants in the 1970s and 1980s.<br />

Failed States are the most probable scenario for major power wars – escalate globally <br />
Jakub Grygiel, George H. W. Bush Associate Professor of International Relations at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hopkins University, Aug 2009, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:472:http://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=622 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=622" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=622</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:472 --><br />
Failed states are not only a source of domestic calamities; they are also potentially a source of great power competition that in the past has often led to confrontation, crisis and war. The failure of a state creates a vacuum that, especially in strategically important regions, draws in competitive great-power intervention. This more traditional view of state failure is less prevalent these days, for only recently has the prospect of great power competition over failed “vacuum” states returned. But, clearly, recent events in Georgia—as well as possible future scenarios in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as southeastern Europe, Asia and parts of Africa—suggest that it might be a good time to adjust, really to expand, the way we think about “failed states” and the kinds of problems they can cause.  The difference between the prevailing and the traditional view on state failure is not merely one of accent or nuance; it has important policy implications. Intense great power conflict over the spoils of a failed state will demand a fundamentally different set of strategies and skills from the United States. Whereas the response to the humanitarian disasters following state failure tends to consist of peacekeeping and state-building missions, large-scale military operations and swift unilateral action are the most likely strategies great powers will adopt when competing over a power vacuum. On the political level, multilateral cooperation, often within the setting of international institutions, is feasible as well as desirable in case of humanitarian disasters. But it is considerably more difficult, perhaps impossible, when a failed state becomes an arena of great power competition.  The prevailing view of failed states is an obvious product of the past two decades—a period in which an entirely new generation of scholars and policymakers has entered their respective professions. A combination of events—the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the prostration of states such as Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti and Bosnia, and most importantly the terrorist attacks of September 11—created two interlocked impressions concerning the sources of state failure that are today largely accepted uncritically.  The first of these is that weak states have unraveled because of the great powers’ disinterest in them, which has allowed serious domestic problems, ranging from poverty to ethnic and social strife, to degenerate into chaos and systemic governance failure.1 The basic idea here is that the Cold War had a stabilizing effect in several strategic regions where either the United States or the Soviet Union supported recently fashioned states with little domestic legitimacy and cohesion for fear that, if they did not, the rival superpower might gain advantage. Some fortunate Third World neutrals even managed a kind of foreign aid arbitrage, attracting help from both sides. When support from the superpowers ended, many of these states, such as Somalia and Yugoslavia, were torn apart by internal factionalism. The state lacked the money to bribe compliance or to generate a larger economic pie, degenerating rapidly into corruption and violence. The key conclusion: The most egregious and tragic examples of failed states in the 1990s occurred because of great power neglect rather than meddling.  The related second impression that post-Cold War events have created is that the main threat posed by failed states starts from within them and subsequently spills over to others. Failed states export threats ranging from crime to drugs to refugees to, most dramatically, global terrorism.2 The lawlessness and violence of such states often spills across borders in the form of waves of refugees, the creation of asylums for criminals and more besides.  As the number and severity of failed state cases rose, Western powers reacted much of the time by hoping that the problems arising from the failure of states, even those geographically close to the United States or Europe like Haiti and Bosnia, would remain essentially limited so that internal chaos could simply be waited out. Interventions such as in Somalia, Bosnia or Haiti were driven by a Western public shocked by vivid images of suffering and slaughter rather than by a sense that these collapsed states directly threatened U.S. national security. The 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States changed the perception that failed states could be safely ignored. The Hobbesian world of a failed state could be distant, but it was also a breeding ground for terrorist networks that could train their foot soldiers, establish logistical bases and plan attacks against distant countries. Failed states suddenly were not only humanitarian disasters but security threats. As Francis Fukuyama observed in 2004, “radical Islamist terrorism combined with the availability of weapons of mass destruction added a major security dimension to the burden of problems created by weak governance.”3  However, 9/11 did not alter the conviction that the main threat posed by failed states stems from endogenous problems and not from a great power competition to fill the vacuum created by their demise. At least in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks, there was a naive feeling that the Islamist threat festering in failed or weak states such as Afghanistan was a menace to the international community writ large, and certainly to great powers like Russia and China, as well as the United States. It was therefore assumed that the great powers would cooperate to combat terrorism and not compete with each other for control over failing or failed states. As Stephen David pointed out in these pages, “Instead of living in a world of international anarchy and domestic order, we have international order and domestic anarchy.”4  The solution stemming from such a view of failed states falls under the broad category of “nation-building.” If the main challenge of failed states is internally generated and caused by a collapse of domestic order, then the solution must be to rebuild state institutions and restore authority and order, preferably under some sort of multilateral arrangement that would enhance the legitimacy of what is necessarily an intrusive endeavor. Great powers are expected to cooperate, not compete, to fix failed states.  U.S. foreign policy continues to reflect this prevailing view. Then-Director of the Policy Planning staff, Stephen Krasner, and Carlos Pascual, then-Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization at the State Department, wrote in 2005 that, “when chaos prevails, terrorism, narcotics trade, weapons proliferation, and other forms of organized crime can flourish.” Moreover, “modern conflicts are far more likely to be internal, civil matters than to be clashes between opposing countries.”5  The prevailing view of failed states is, to repeat, not wrong, just incomplete—for it ignores the competitive nature of great power interactions. The traditional understanding of power vacuums is still very relevant. Sudan, Central Asia, Indonesia, parts of Latin America and many other areas are characterized by weak and often collapsing states that are increasingly arenas for great power competition. The interest of these great powers is not to rebuild the state or to engage in “nation-building” for humanitarian purposes but to establish a foothold in the region, to obtain favorable economic deals, especially in the energy sector, and to weaken the presence of other great powers.  Let’s look at just three possible future scenarios. In the first, imagine that parts of Indonesia become increasingly difficult to govern and are wracked by riots. Chinese minorities are attacked, while pirates prowl sealanes in ever greater numbers. Bejing, pressured by domestic opinion to help the Chinese diaspora, as well as by fears that its seaborne commerce will be interrupted, intervenes in the region. China’s action is then perceived as a threat by Japan, which projects its own power into the region. The United States, India and others then intervene to protect their interests, as well.  In the second scenario, imagine that Uzbekistan collapses after years of chronic mismanagement and continued Islamist agitation. Uzbekistan’s natural resources and its strategic value as a route to the Caspian or Middle East are suddenly up for grabs, and Russia and China begin to compete for control over it, possibly followed by other states like Iran and Turkey.  In a third scenario, imagine that the repressive government of Sudan loses the ability to maintain control over the state, and that chaos spreads from Darfur outward to Chad and other neighbors. Powers distant and nearby decide to extend their control over the threatened oil fields. China, though still at least a decade away from having serious power projection capabilities, already has men on the ground in Sudan protecting some of the fields and uses them to control the country’s natural resources.  These scenarios are not at all outlandish, as recent events have shown. Kosovo, which formally declared independence on February 17, 2008, continues to strain relationships between the United States and Europe, on the one hand, and Serbia and Russia, on the other. The resulting tension may degenerate into violence as Serbian nationalists and perhaps even the Serbian army intervene in Kosovo. It is conceivable then that Russia would support Belgrade, leading to a serious confrontation with the European Union and the United States.  A similar conflict, pitting Russia against NATO or the United States alone, or some other alliance of European states, could develop in several post-Soviet regions, from Georgia to the Baltics. Last summer’s war in Georgia, for instance, showed incipient signs of a great power confrontation between Russia and the United States over the fate of a weak state, further destabilized by a rash local leadership and aggressive meddling by Moscow. The future of Ukraine may follow a parallel pattern: Russian citizens (or, to be precise, ethnic Russians who are given passports by Moscow) may claim to be harassed by Ukrainian authorities, who are weak and divided. A refugee problem could then arise, giving Moscow a ready justification to intervene militarily. The question would then be whether NATO, or the United States, or some alliance of Poland and other states would feel the need and have the ability to prevent Ukraine from falling under Russian control.  Another example could arise in Iraq. If the United States fails to stabilize the situation and withdraws, or even merely scales down its military presence too quickly, one outcome could be the collapse of the central government in Baghdad. The resulting vacuum would be filled by militias and other groups, who would engage in violent conflict for oil, political control and sectarian revenge. This tragic situation would be compounded if Iran and Saudi Arabia, the two regional powers with the most direct interests in the outcome, entered the fray more directly than they have so far.  In sum, there are many more plausible scenarios in which a failed state could become a playground of both regional and great power rivalry, which is why we urgently need to dust off the traditional view of failed states and consider its main features as well as its array of consequences. <br />

Stability in Iraq increasing <br />
Ranj Alaaldin, Guardian, September 6th 2010<br />
The formal end  of the US combat role in Iraq provides a suitable moment to consider what has been achieved since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.  Security is certainly one of the biggest achievements, despite some 100,000 Iraqi fatalities. Sectarian warfare has been defeated and the Sunni/al-Qaida insurgency is now reduced to sporadic attacks and restricted to the north of the country in Mosul and Diyala.  The sad reality is that reporting and analysis, often misinformed, is carried out through the Baghdad lens. The capital, as the nerve centre of the country, has naturally been the main target of terror attacks. It accounted for nearly 50% of the country's violence last week, with at least 19 people killed and 70 injured in various attacks.  However, life also exists beyond Baghdad and it is much rosier. In the southern provinces, security continues to improve, despite the rare attack in Basra last month. The relative stability in the south is complemented by an increase in foreign investment. Foreign firms are now penetrating the non-oil sectors in the south, usually dominated by Iranian investors. In the holy shrine city of Najaf, for example, one company has become the first British investor since 2003. More are expected to follow. <br />

While security in Iraq has now been improving steadily for some time, the concern that the situation could reverse itself remains substantial. The possibility that it will do so during, and indeed because of, the drawdown of U.S. forces can neither be ignored nor dismissed. If this happens, there is no question that a broad range of Iraq’s residents, including those in femaleheaded households, women, minorities in ethnically mixed areas, and the internally displaced (discussed in the next section), will be at increased risk relative to the population as a whole.1 However, there also exist a number of groups who may become more susceptible to violent attack as and after U.S. forces draw down and withdraw from Iraq, whether or not violence as a whole increases substantially: Tens of thousands of Iraqis and their families may face 􀁴􀀁 danger because of their affiliation with the United States (both with governmental or nongovernmental groups), which makes them targets for a variety of extremist and militia groups. Well over 100,000 Iraqis work and have worked for the U.S. government in Iraq, providing critical services in the areas of translation, construction, engineering, and office work, to name a few. Many have become displaced within and outside Iraq (Human Rights First, undated). 􀁴􀀁 Smaller minorities among Iraq’s permanent citizens have faced violence and been able to successfully turn, to varying extents, to U.S. forces for protection, which includes patrols and oversight of Iraqi forces.2 􀁴􀀁 Palestinian refugees received housing and other benefits from the Saddam Hussein government. They became targets of attacks after he was overthrown. Many fled. Today, hundreds remain trapped in camps near the Syrian border, and about 9,000 remain in predominantly Shia areas of Baghdad, where they have been particularly under threat from the Mahdi Army. Efforts to resettle Palestinians have found very little success. U.S. forces have protected Palestinians in Baghdad through patrols and oversight. 􀁴􀀁 Other refugee groups from outside Iraq who have taken shelter in that country over the years are seen as suspect by Iraq’s native populations and may face reprisals and even more difficult conditions after U.S. forces leave.3 Some, such as the Iranian ethnic Kurds, are being integrated into Iraq. Most continue to live in refugee camps. The Mujeheddin e-Khalq (MEK) is a cult-like dissident g 􀁴􀀁 roup from Iran. Because of its violent opposition to the Iranian regime, its members received sanctuary in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in 1991. They are not integrated into Iraqi society, having lived in their own enclave for decades. Because of their use of terrorist methods, the MEK is designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States. About 3,400 MEK members are now living at Camp Ashraf (now “Camp New Iraq”) in Iraq. Until February 2009, the MEK was under U.S. military protection, which was granted at the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom when MEK members willingly laid down their weapons. Protection of the MEK at the camp became a GOI responsibility in accordance with implementation of the U.S.-GOI Security Agreement. The MEK and its advocates have expressed fears that camp residents will be deported to Iran and/or otherwise endangered. At the time this report went to press, statements and actions by the Iraqi government indicated that these fears are not without foundation. 􀁴􀀁 U.S., other coalition, and Iraqi companies have brought in workers from around the world to carry out construction, food services, and myriad other tasks. Camps of contractor personnel have sprung up around Iraqi airports and elsewhere. While many workers, particularly those directly employed by the U.S. government, are unlikely to be at particular risk, there is less information about other groups. Some workers are reported to have been smuggled or trafficked in to work in Iraq. They may not have appropriate documentation or means to leave Iraq. Some may face resentment from Iraqis for having jobs when many Iraqis are unemployed. It is not clear that the Iraqi government has taken particular care to police this situation, and it is easy to imagine the potential problems, including tremendous personal and economic insecurity, that these people could face if they come to be stranded in Iraq. All of these groups have little reason to believe that Iraqi Security Forces will protect them should they be targeted by hostile actors. Many have directly depended on U.S. forces for security, and others count on the influence U.S. forces exercise over Iraqi Security Forces. In principle, the government of Iraq is responsible for providing security for all of these people. In practice, however, history does not give much reason to assume that the Iraqi government will have the capacity and will to protect them. <br />

Substantial violence against vulnerable groups would, without question, present tremendous humanitarian concerns. In addition, it would have a variety of adverse repercussions for the United States, Iraq, and the region more broadly. As the country globally seen as responsible for the Iraq war, the United States would be held accountable for any negative humanitarian repercussions. Perceptions of the United States, at home and abroad, may be particularly eroded by failure to effectively protect and assist U.S.-affiliated Iraqis. Failure of the United States to protect and help the people who were willing to help Americans would be rightly seen as a particularly egregious moral violation. In the Middle East and around the world, this would feed into and would be used to build anti-U.S. sentiment. That, in turn, would hamper U.S. efforts on a broad range of issues as the United States seeks to rebuild its global image and influence. Importantly, such a deleterious outcome would ultimately set a poor precedent for future U.S.-led military operations, making local citizens elsewhere less likely to help the United States. <br />

Successful intervention is key to de-escalate conflict – This prevents all scenarios for global nuclear war<br />

Experts throughout the world expect growing population pressures and increasing environmental stress to develop over the coming decades into intense, far-reaching social unrest and regional conflict. Economic development is the solution, however slow and uncertain it may be in coming. But the world also needs effective regional conflict-prevention procedures. Left on its own, regional violence can lead to confrontation and even war between the great powers, including the United States, as might occur, for example, in the event of conflict between Ukraine and Russia or between China and its neighbors. In the final analysis, unchecked regional violence and the fear of further violence will lead more states to develop nuclear weapons. In past decades, this process occurred in Israel, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Iraq, and presumably, in North Korea. A world with 20 or 30 nuclear weapon states would not only make a more effective global security system impossible, it would lead the present nuclear weapon states to modernize and increase their weapons--and it would markedly increase the vulnerability of the United States to direct attack.<br />

D’Souza 9 (Shanthie Mariet D’Souza, Associate Fellow, Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi, October 22, 2009, “Securing India’s interests in Afghanistan”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:475:http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article37329.ece --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article37329.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article37329.ece</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:475 -->)<br />
As instability and violence in Afghanistan intensify, and the policymakers in the U.S. grapple with the right strategy -- counter-insurgency or counter-terrorism -- New Delhi has indicated a ‘strategic shift’ in thinking from a military to political solution to the Afghan war. In an interview to The Wall Street Journal on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna said India did “not believe that war can solve any problem and that applies to Afghanistan too.”  There has been a significant shift in New Delhi’s thinking in the political uncertainty following the recently-held Afghan polls, in which allegations of fraud have marred the early claims of President Hamid Karzai’s victory. Afghanistan’s Election Commission has called a runoff for November 7 after investigations dropped Mr. Karzai’s votes below 50 per cent. Alternatively, intense diplomacy to cobble together a national unity government is being explored to avoid the scenario of a ‘runoff.’ Without a legitimate government in place, the troop surge could come to resemble foreign occupation.<br />

Only prior binding, genuine consultation solves – unilateralism prevents cooperation and ensures relations are unstable<br />
Blank ’04 (Stephen Blank, Professor of Russian National Security Studies at the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College. “India and the Gulf After Saddam.” Strategic Insights, Volume III, Issue 4 (April 2004) <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:476:http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2004/apr/blankApr04.asp --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2004/apr/blankApr04.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2004/apr/blankApr04.asp</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:476 -->)<br />
India's ambitions, capabilities, experience and interests all suggest that it is interested in playing a major role in helping to stabilize the Persian Gulf in a post-Saddam era. The issue is how to we craft an invitation to India to do so which has a chance of succeeding. Obviously we have to stop dismissing the UN for no matter what we think, India, like many other states, sees its authorization as indispensable to any legitimization of the use of force or for deployment in post-conflict stability operations. Second, before India enters into any such operation it will be necessary to conduct a candid discussion with it as to its strategic objectives, interests, and concerns in the new Gulf. And those interests and fears must be accommodated. Likewise, it will be necessary during this dialogue to elucidate its views as to how that structure or architecture should work and not just what it hopes to gain from its participation in any such system.  In other words, the perception abroad that U.S. policy is characterized by excessive unilateralism must be shown to be groundless. Allies like India must be consulted and accommodated much more openly than was previously the case. This consultation must mean and be seen to mean more than that they were simply heard and that then we proceeded as we had intended to do anyway. Their interests in a stable Gulf, which after all are not far removed from our goals for the area, must be seen as legitimate and it must be understood that no unilateral American system stands any chance of more than ephemeral success in constructing a post-Saddam order in the Gulf. The beginning of wisdom in constructing a Gulf security architecture entails genuine dialogue with allies and partners and a genuine give and take among them and us. The gains in getting the participation of a rising power with a good reputation in the Gulf and a democratic tradition in such a security architecture far outweigh any losses involved in accommodating their interests there and in taking their advice when it makes sense. Partnership, if not alliance, with India is one of the fundamental points of the Administration's agenda and even preceded September 11.[20] As India's power and standing grow it makes all the sense in the world to exploit that partnership on behalf of interests and values that are fundamentally shared and compatible and against common threats. Failure to devise a basis for a significant Indian presence in the new Gulf, on the other hand, all but ensures that the architecture will be built on sand.<br />

Relations are key to check nuclear war between India and Pakistan<br />
Dugger, ’02 (Celia “Wider Military Ties With India Offer U.S. Diplomatic Leverage”, NYT, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:477:http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/10/world/wider-military-ties-with-india-offer-us-diplomatic-leverage.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/10/world/wider-military-ties-with-india-offer-us-diplomatic-leverage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/10/world/wider-military-ties-with-india-offer-us-diplomatic-leverage.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:477 -->, 6/10)<br />
Military cooperation between India and the United States has remarkably quickened since Sept. 11, with a burst of navy, air force and army joint exercises, the revival of American military sales to India and a blur of high-level visits by generals and admirals. The fledgling relationship between American and Indian military leaders will be important to Mr. Rumsfeld in talks intended to put to rest fears of war between India and Pakistan. ''We can hope this translates into some influence and trust, though I don't want to overstate it,'' a senior American defense official said in an interview on Thursday. ''I don't want to predict this guarantees success.'' The American diplomatic efforts yielded their first real gains on Saturday when India welcomed a pledge by Pakistan's military ruler to stop permanently the infiltration of militants into Kashmir. India indicated that it would soon take steps to reduce tensions, but a million troops are still fully mobilized along the border -- a situation likely to persist for months -- and the process of resolving the crisis has just begun. India has linked the killing of civilians in Kashmir to a Pakistan-backed insurgency there and has presented its confrontation with Pakistan as part of the global campaign against terrorism. India itself made an unstinting offer of support to the United States after Sept. 11, and Washington responded by ending the sanctions placed on India after its 1998 nuclear tests. With that, the estrangement that prevailed between the world's two largest democracies during the cold war, when India drew close to the Soviet Union and the United States allied with Pakistan, has eased. India, for decades a champion of nonalignment, seeks warmer ties with the United States in hopes of gaining access to sophisticated military technology and help in dealing with Pakistan. From the start of President Bush's term, some influential officials in his administration saw India as a potential counterweight to that other Asian behemoth, China, whose growing power was seen as a potential strategic threat. But since Sept. 11, the priority has been terrorism. The United States is hoping its deeper military and political ties with India will give it some measure of leverage to prevent a war between India and Pakistan that could lead to a nuclear holocaust and would play havoc with the hunt for Al Qaeda in Pakistan.<br />

That conflict escalates to global nuclear war and extinction<br />
Fai ’01 (Ghulam Nabi, Executive Director, Kashmiri American Council, Washington Times, 7-8)<br />
The foreign policy of the United States in South Asia should move from the lackadaisical and distant (with India crowned with a unilateral veto power) to aggressive involvement at the vortex. The most dangerous place on the planet is Kashmir, a disputed territory convulsed and illegally occupied for more than 53 years and sandwiched between nuclear-capable India and Pakistan. It has ignited two wars between the estranged South Asian rivals in 1948 and 1965, and a third could trigger nuclear volleys and a nuclear winter threatening the entire globe. The United States would enjoy no sanctuary. This apocalyptic vision is no idiosyncratic view. The director of central intelligence, the Defense Department, and world experts generally place Kashmir at the peak of their nuclear worries. Both India and Pakistan are racing like thoroughbreds to bolster their nuclear arsenals and advanced delivery vehicles. Their defense budgets are climbing despite widespread misery amongst their populations. Neither country has initialed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or indicated an inclination to ratify an impending Fissile Material/Cut-off Convention. The boiling witches' brew in Kashmir should propel the United States to assertive facilitation or mediation of Kashmir negotiations. The impending July 14-16 summit in New Delhi between President Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister A. B. Vajpayee featuring Kashmir on the agenda does not justify complacency.<br />

The DoD can do the plan<br />
Reed 5 − Senator (Jack, “NEWS CONFERENCE WITH SENATOR HARRY REID (D-NV); SENATOR CARL LEVIN (D-MI); AND SENATOR JACK REED (D-RI),” December 14, Lexis) Crowe<br />
And also, at this juncture when I read reports in the press of the plans by the Department of Defense to reduce our force structure in terms of our Army and our -- both active and National Guard, it seems to contradict this notion that we'll stay indefinitely, we'll stay forever till we have this complete victory.<br />
So I think part of what we've asked, both the caucus collectively and many individually, is for a much more clearly defined objective that our military leaders can use to plan not only for the operations in Iraq but over time for the force structure of our -- particularly our Army and our Marine Corps.<br />

The DoD gives Obama political cover when it comes to reductions in military presence<br />
BJCL 10 (“Coleman/Plata: Highlighting the Need to Establish an Independent Corrections Commission in California,” 15 Berkeley J. Crim. L. 97, Spring, Lexis) Crowe<br />
The Federal Base Closure and Realignment Commission (&quot;BRAC&quot;) also serves as an example of an independent commission successfully making difficult decisions on politicized issues. No longer able to financially support the nation's extensive military bases and installations, from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s the federal government closed unnecessary military bases. n249 Estimated to save the federal budget at least $ 4.6 billion a year, the base closures provided savings that were needed to pay for future weapons, training, and troop salaries. n250 Because many civilian jobs would be lost in an area surrounding a closed base, base closures were politically unpopular decisions: in the 1993 round of base closures, Florida lost 18,500 jobs, Virginia lost 13,000 jobs and California lost 12,800 jobs. n251 As a result of the political unpopularity of the necessary base closure, Congress created BRAC, which provided &quot;political cover&quot; to make the difficult decision to close over seventy bases in four separate rounds of closures. n252<br />
BRAC is an independent and authoritative commission charged with providing the President and Congress with recommendations and analysis  [*123]  concerning base closures that the Department of Defense (&quot;DoD&quot;) recommended be closed. n253 The commission may use criteria outlined by Congress to reject DoD's recommendations and to suggest other military installations be closed. n254 BRAC publically reports its findings to the President, who can return the report to BRAC for further analysis or forward BRAC's list of suggested base closures to Congress. n255 If Congress does not issue a joint resolution rejecting BRAC's findings within forty-five days, the BRAC report becomes law. n256 Alternatively, the President may essentially veto BRAC recommendations by refusing to forward BRAC's report to Congress. n257 BRAC's analysis and recommendations allow both the President and Congress to approve or reject which bases close through a seemingly independent body, thereby making decisions &quot;which otherwise would not be politically feasible.&quot; n258<br />

Text: The United States Federal Government should dismantle and dispose of, in Europe, all its tactical nuclear weapons currently located in Europe using Radkowsky thorium reactor technology. The United States Federal Government should not withdraw tactical nuclear weapons from Europe. The United States federal government should prohibit all nuclear warheads located in the US, as of 2009, from being modified into nuclear bunker busters.

CP solves – thorium power solves weapons disposal, prolif, and reduces radioactive waste<br />
NEI, ’99 (Nuclear Engineering International, “Using thorium in a commercial nuclear fuel cycle: how to do it,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:478:http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=1000169 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=1000169" rel="nofollow">http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=1000169</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:478 -->, 1/8)<br />
The core of a power reactor using the thorium-based fuel known as RTF (Radkowsky Thorium Fuel) fits into exactly the same space as the cores of current standard uranium reactors, thus requiring only minor changes in the plant. The importance of this feature is evident – ensuring virtually no risk to the huge investments already made in the present LWR plants throughout the world. The RTF has the following advantages:<br />
• RTF spent fuel is completely nonproliferative for all practical purposes. In contrast, standard uranium LWRs (1 GWe) discharge between 250 and 300 kg of plutonium. Only 5 to 7 kg of such plutonium, with the services of only 3-4 people, is sufficient to fabricate a bomb.<br />
• There is a dramatic reduction in radwaste in quantity, toxicity, radioactivity and heat emission.<br />
• Safety is enhanced due to the elimination of soluble boron control during operation. Otherwise, kinetic behaviour is similar to that of standard LWRs, and the core meets accepted thermal specifications.<br />
• Natural uranium ore requirements are reduced by about 20%.<br />
• Fuel cycle costs are reduced by 20% to 30%.<br />
• There is no need for fuel reprocessing; the once-through cycle is optimal.<br />
• The RTF is especially suited for burning and disposing of either weapons-grade or reactor discharge plutonium.<br />
• RTF is especially suited for burning and disposing of HEU from dismantled nuclear weapons.<br />

Oceanic transportation has a higher risk of accidents than land transportation- more severe conditions<br />
Lyman, ’99 (Ed, scientific director of the Nuclear Control Institute, “The Sea Shipment of Radioactive Materials: Safety and Environmental Concerns,” Conference on Carriage of Ultrahazardous Radioactive Cargo by Sea: Implications and Responses, Oct, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:479:http://www.nci.org/e/el-malaysia.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nci.org/e/el-malaysia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nci.org/e/el-malaysia.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:479 -->)<br />
These standards were originally developed for land-based modes of transport, and questions have arisen regarding their adequacy for packages used for sea shipments, which may be subject to more severe accident conditions, including more energetic collisions, long-duration, high-temperature fires and long-term immersion or immersion at greater depths.  The IAEA's response to this issue has been two-fold.  First, it argues that although accident conditions that occur aboard ships may be more severe than the Type B testing regimen, the actual accident environment experienced by a RAM package most likely would be less severe.  Second, it claims that Type B packages have substantial safety margins built into them, so that even if they experience more severe conditions than they were designed to withstand they will &quot;fail gracefully&quot; rather than abruptly. There is scant evidence, however, for either of these assumptions.  The principle of &quot;graceful failure&quot; is largely accepted on faith, and has not been verified for any package used to ship RAM by sea. In fact, there is good reason to believe that current RAM package designs do not exhibit “graceful failure” in important respects.  <br />
<br />
Ocean transportation is worse – accidents spread globally and it risks terrorism<br />
Marin, ’01 (Lawrence, “Oceanic transportation of radioactive materials: the conflict between the law of the seas' right of innocent passage and duty to the marine environment,” Florida Journal of International Law 13 #2, p. 361-78, Summer, WilsonSelectPlus)  <br />
With the end of World War II, the world witnessed the destructive advent of a new energy. Devastating cities, nuclear energy demonstrated the potential power it could yield. As this new energy became more commonly used, the world also quickly discovered that its byproduct of radioactive waste was extremely dangerous. Several incidents where radioactive materials were improperly handled proved that indirect or direct exposure to radioactive materials had a deadly effect on human and animal life. The particular significance of the transportation of radioactive materials via oceanic vessels lies in the nature of the oceans. The oceans are in constant flow, and their currents spread throughout the Earth. Thus, while a radioactive accident on land can be successfully contained within a certain region, such an accident in the ocean may not be so easily checked. Because the oceans' currents would carry nuclear radiation everywhere they ran, a radioactive accident at sea has the potential to contaminate oceans and marine environments throughout the world. Another critical factor to consider in the oceanic transport of radioactive materials is the potential for terrorist attacks. The amount of radioactive material that is typically shipped has enough radioactive matter to produce several nuclear warheads. Consequently, the possibility that a ship laden with such a dangerous cargo may be hijacked or attacked in order to produce devastating weapons is very real.<br />

Collapse of ocean ecosystems ends life on Earth<br />
Craig ’03 (Robin Kundis, Associate Prof Law, Indiana U School Law, Lexis)<br />
Biodiversity and ecosystem function arguments for conserving marine ecosystems also exist, just as they do for terrestrial ecosystems, but these arguments have thus far rarely been raised in political debates. For example, besides significant tourism values - the most economically valuable ecosystem service coral reefs provide, worldwide - coral reefs protect against storms and dampen other environmental fluctuations, services worth more than ten times the reefs' value for food production. n856 Waste treatment is another significant, non-extractive ecosystem function that intact coral reef ecosystems provide. n857 More generally, &quot;ocean ecosystems play a major role in the global geochemical cycling of all the elements that represent the basic building blocks of living organisms, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur, as well as other less abundant but necessary elements.&quot; n858 In a very real and direct sense, therefore, human degradation of marine ecosystems impairs the planet's ability to support life. Maintaining biodiversity is often critical to maintaining the functions of marine ecosystems. Current evidence shows that, in general, an ecosystem's ability to keep functioning in the face of disturbance is strongly dependent on its biodiversity, &quot;indicating that more diverse ecosystems are more stable.&quot; n859 Coral reef ecosystems are particularly dependent on their biodiversity.  [*265]   Most ecologists agree that the complexity of interactions and degree of interrelatedness among component species is higher on coral reefs than in any other marine environment. This implies that the ecosystem functioning that produces the most highly valued components is also complex and that many otherwise insignificant species have strong effects on sustaining the rest of the reef system. n860 Thus, maintaining and restoring the biodiversity of marine ecosystems is critical to maintaining and restoring the ecosystem services that they provide. Non-use biodiversity values for marine ecosystems have been calculated in the wake of marine disasters, like the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. n861 Similar calculations could derive preservation values for marine wilderness. However, economic value, or economic value equivalents, should not be &quot;the sole or even primary justification for conservation of ocean ecosystems. Ethical arguments also have considerable force and merit.&quot; n862 At the forefront of such arguments should be a recognition of how little we know about the sea - and about the actual effect of human activities on marine ecosystems. The United States has traditionally failed to protect marine ecosystems because it was difficult to detect anthropogenic harm to the oceans, but we now know that such harm is occurring - even though we are not completely sure about causation or about how to fix every problem. Ecosystems like the NWHI coral reef ecosystem should inspire lawmakers and policymakers to admit that most of the time we really do not know what we are doing to the sea and hence should be preserving marine wilderness whenever we can - especially when the United States has within its territory relatively pristine marine ecosystems that may be unique in the world. We may not know much about the sea, but we do know this much: if we kill the ocean we kill ourselves, and we will take most of the biosphere with us.<br />
