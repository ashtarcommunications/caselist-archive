==Affirmative== 

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">I affirm : The United States ought to extend to non-citizens accused of terrorism the same constitutional due process protections it grants to citizens. I offer the following definitions for this round:</span>**




**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Definitions:</span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Constitutional due process protections</span>**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">: </span>
__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The reference in the 5th Amendment applies only to the federal government and its courts and agencies. The reference in the 14th Amendment extends protection of due process to all state governments, agencies, and courts. Due process, in the context of the United States, refers to how and why laws are enforced. It applies to all persons, citizen or alien, as well as to corporations.</span>__

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Framework:</span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Loss and vulnerability seem to follow from our being socially constituted bodies, attached to others and have created ties with one another . When someone or something is lost part of us goes along with it. We are all interconnected by the ties made in our community. When that something has passed we mourn and feel grief for it because it was worthy of our recognition. In order for one to grief there would have had to have been a life, a life worth noting, a life worth valuing and preserving, a life that qualifies for recognition. </span>**

It’s a life that holds value and is recognized by others because of the importance and the impact they gave made among those around them.</span>**

**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">“Our body is …signs of its undoing.”</span>__**

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Butler 3 continues, </span>**
**__<span style="color: #222222;">“The body implies … of our interdependence” (pg 26-27)</span>__**


**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Butler 4 states, (pg 36-38)</span>__**
**__<span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">“If violence is </span>__**<span style="color: #1e1e1e; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> … allies have killed.”</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">My **value** for this round will be **morality**.</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> Morality is antecedent to</span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">ethics: it denotes those concrete activities of which ethics is the science. It may be defined as human conduct in so far as it is freely subordinated to the ideal of what is right and fitting.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Thus my standard is resisting the norms that render a life ungrievable. </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Butler continues (Pg 17-19)</span>

<span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> “**__Ignoring its image …__** global options”</span>

**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">I contend that suspending the law makes lives ungrievable (Butler, 66-68)</span>__**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">“</span><span style="color: #3a3a3a; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The sovereignty </span><span style="color: #3b3b3b; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">… arrangement might dissolve” </span>

<span style="color: #212121; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">“The **__photographs produced …__** and protections</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">” (73-74)</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Many detainees are not given the recognition of grief and mourning. The suspensions of the law one, does not provide adequate protection but also uses the power of justice to dispose of their life’s as they wish with no respect no regard of those around them. As Rumsfeld states, the detainees are kept to protect the country from future attacks and preventany further attacks that may come, but this mentality will never end thus causing the damage on detainees a never ending cycle.</span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Sub point B:</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> The state of emergency invoked by the war on terrorism make that suspension of the law indefinite.</span>**
<span style="color: #383838; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">“From the point .. acts of suspension.” (Butler, 63-65)</span>
<span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">“</span>**__<span style="color: #3b3b3b; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Indefinite detention" is .. in the</span>__** **__<span style="color: #3b3b3b; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">use” (Butler 67-68)</span>__**

**<span style="color: #3b3b3b; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The detention of this individuals will never end because the state of emergency will always the mindset the United States have. Thus the War on Terror will never end and soon the United States will be posing a threat to this individuals. This never ending cycle will soon have no limits and the power will soon turn into a sovereign power.</span>**

**<span style="color: #3b3b3b; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Extending the same constitutional due process rights is essential because it will view life as grievable. Giving different or no due process protections to non-citizens or even citizens will regard their life with a different view or a difference in important. </span>**

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Rendering a life ungreivable means regarding a life without its importance and is value. This will allow the state of mind of individuals to continue negating the life of other and allowing violence to occur repeatedly.</span>

Obama Clears Way for Guantanamo Trials by. Scott Shane and Mark Landler
Published March 7th 2011.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Write,</span>

**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">“Administration officials declined …</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> complicating any trial.”</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The system that is used to prosecute the accused is not adequate because many procedures do not allow for an accurate trail and conviction. Torture, inaccurate testimonies, and deaths of prisoners who have been released have been the result of this system. If this system continues the torture and deaths will have a sense of legality because according to the United States the prisoner were tried thus every conviction is deemed legal. If the United States has jurisdiction the process will continue viewing this life as ungrievable and thus not a not worthy life. </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Also,</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Dead Gitmo detainee was cleared for release in 2009, By Michael Isikoff, NBC News</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Sub- Point B: Crime victims who act as jurors are bias </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Author(s): Scott E. Culhane, Harmon M. Hosch and William G. Weaver, 2004),</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">“Kassin and Wrightsman (1983) have **__a similar crime.”__** (652)</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">If the the United States multiple roles such as described above it will lead to bias and harmful actions. One not only will the procedures not be accurate but the conviction for this prisoners can be faital.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The negative has provided why the united States should not play multiple roles when deciding the conviction of terrorism because it will lead to an unfair procedure and the procedures will be view the prisoners life as ungrieavable causing the life to be viewed as unworthy of recognition thus I urge a negative Ballot. </span>
