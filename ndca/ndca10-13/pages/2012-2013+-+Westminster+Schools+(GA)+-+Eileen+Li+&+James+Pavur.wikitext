The chamber's Transportation Performance Index showed that America's transit system is not keeping up with growing demands and is failing to meet the needs of the business community and consumers.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Most important, the </span>__research proved for the first time that there is a **direct relationship between transportation infrastructure performance and GDP**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The index findings also showed that if America invests wisely in infrastructure, it can become more reliable, predictable, and safe. </span>__By improving underperforming transport infrastructure__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>__the____U__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>__could unlock nearly $1 trillionin economic potential__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
__Making investments that tackle immediate challenges, like congestion, and that account for growing demand into the future, America would boost productivity and economic growth in the long run and support millions of jobs in the near term.__
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Investment in infrastructure would also improve quality of life by reducing highway fatalities and accidents and easing traffic congestion that costs the public $115 billion a year in lost time and wasted fuel - $808 out of the pocket of every motorist. Such an investment would also allow the country to better protect the environment while increasing mobility.</span>
__If America fails to adequately invest in transportation infrastructure__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>__by 2020 it will lose $897 billion in economic growth. Businesses will see their transportation costs rise by $430 billion__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and the average American household income will drop by more than $7,000. US exports will decline by $28 billion. Meanwhile, </span>__global competitors will surge past us with superior infrastructure that will attract jobs, businesses, and capital__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
So how can the US get its infrastructure to go from insufficient and declining to
AND
Aviation Administration alone would help keep 70,000 workers on the job.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Next, America should expand energy infrastructure to support growing needs. A great example is the Keystone XL pipeline to connect Canadian oil sands with Texas refineries. The sooner the project is approved and construction begins, the sooner the US can rake in the benefits of added investment and government revenues, job creation, and more resources to fuel energy needs and keep costs down for businesses and consumers.</span>
Likewise, the US can't let a needlessly cumbersome permitting process stand in the way
AND
mobilize construction and hiring from one end of the country to the other.
In this era of tight government budgets, America must adopt innovative financing approaches and
AND
1.9 million jobs over 10 years and spur untold economic growth.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As for public investments, sooner or later we'll have to face the fact that the federal fuel tax has not been raised 1 cent in 17 years. The country needs modest, phased-in increase.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Comprehensively restoring America's infrastructure and revitalizing the economy are monumental tasks. Fortunately, we are the same nation that built our world-class system in the first place. If anyone is up to the challenge, we are.</span>

**This negatively influences the __entire economy__ --- prevents a __resilient__ supply chain**
**Little,** **Director, Keston Institute for Public Finance and Infrastructure Policy**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>**11**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> --- (4/5/2011, Richard, “Infrastructure Investment and U.S. Competitiveness,” [[http://www.cfr.org/united-states/infrastructure-investment-us-competitiveness/p24585]], JMP)</span>

The massive network of seaports, waterways, railroads, and highways we built in
AND
as consumers, would benefit from a more efficient and resilient supply chain.
Unfortunately, for far too long, Americans have been lulled by their political leadership
AND

The first step in addressing this problem will be to ensure that adequate revenue streams
AND
their upkeep or own both the responsibility for economic decline and its consequences.

**c) Confidence**
**Confidence is collapsing now and destroying investment --- a national infrastructure bank is the __best short term stimulus__ that __doesn’t drive up the deficit__**
**Skidelsky & Martin,** **Emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of Warwick, 11** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">--- macroeconomist and bond investor(3/30/2011, Robert Skidelsky and Felix Martin, New York Review of Books, “For a National Investment Bank,” [[http://www.skidelskyr.com/site/article/for-a-national-investment-bank/]], JMP)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But could a National Investment Bank also help with the urgent problem of the weak recovery and the exhaustion of the current policy options? We believe that it could.</span>
Keynes was skeptical that economies can stage spontaneous recoveries from major slumps because he recognized
AND
future is particularly uncertain and they see no clear prospects for future demand.
The current situation in the US conforms closely to Keynes’s analysis. There is no
AND
-term Treasury bills, and in banks’ accounts at the Federal Reserve.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Keynes’s summary of the situation in 1932 still makes sense today, though in less extreme degree:</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It may still be the case that the lender, with his confidence shattered by his experience, will continue to ask for new enterprise rates of interest which the borrower cannot expect to earn…. If this proves to be so, there will be no means of escape from prolonged and perhaps interminable depression except by state intervention to promote and subsidise new investment.</span>
The central challenge is to restore confidence on the one hand and on the other
AND
of the private sector until business regains the confidence needed for future investment.
For the time being such a policy is politically impossible, as President Obama has
AND
and deployed not by the federal government but by the National Investment Bank.
Of course, the creation of a National Investment Bank cannot be a fiscal free
AND
likely be attractive assets for pension funds and other long-term investors.

**Studies prove the plan is a __uniquely beneficial__ form of stimulus**
**Tyson, Chair of Business School at UC Berkeley, 11**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> --- Chan Chair in Global Management at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business (Laura D., “A Better Stimulus Plan for the U.S. Economy,” [[http://hbr.org/web/extras/hbr-agenda-2011/laura-d-tyson]], JMP)</span>

Although stimulus spending is a politically contentious issue, America is now in urgent need
AND
its creation through speeches, interviews, and opinion columns like this one.
__Unlike most other forms of stimulus, infrastructure spending benefits the economy in two ways: First, it creates jobs__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>__which__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, because those jobs put money in consumers' pockets, </span>__spurs demand__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__Analysis by the____C__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ongressional </span>__B__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">udget </span>__O__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ffice </span>__indicates that infrastructure spending is a cost-effective demand stimulus as measured by the number of jobs created per dollar of budgetary expenditure.__
Second, the resulting infrastructure enhancement supports supply and growth over time. By contrast

spending needed for other key public goals such as water delivery and sanitation.
Realizing the highest possible return on infrastructure investments depends on funding the projects with the

The bank would provide the most appropriate form of financing for each project, drawing

Crafting the law to achieve these goals is a serious and challenging undertaking, particularly
AND
work in meaningful jobs. The time has come to make it happen.

**d). Deficit spending**
**It’s good and the //only// way to create private sector wealth. Also, claims of international backlash are exaggerated**
**Harvey, Professor of Economics at Texas Christian University, 12** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">-former Executive Director of the International Confederation of Associations for Pluralism in Economics(Johnathan, 7/18/2012, “Why You Should Love Government Deficits,” [[http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2012/07/18/why-you-should-love-government-deficits/)JCP]]</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The calls for cutting the federal government’s budget and perhaps even balancing it have continued and are likely to grow louder during this election year. Don’t listen to them unless you want to see a fall in your net assets! </span>__Government deficits, by definition, create private sector wealth, while surpluses drain it.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It’s simple accounting.</span>
To understand this, start by imagining a world in which there is no government
AND
the person buying something) and income (for the person selling something).
__Now create a government. It is only at this point that it becomes possible for one sector (private or government) to spend more than they earned or earn more than they spent__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, say over its first year in existence, the government takes in $100 in tax revenues but doesn’t spend any of it. You might have something like this:</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Government Budget Surplus and Private Sector Deficit</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Private Government Total</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Income $1000 $100 $1100</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Spending $1100 $0 $1100</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Balance -$100 +$100 $0</span>
In this case, the private sector spent $1000 on the goods and services
AND
And with the government in surplus, the private sector goes into debt.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">On the other hand, look at what happens when the government spends in deficit:</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Government Budget Deficit and Private Sector Surplus</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Private Government Total</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Income $1100 $0 $1100</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Spending $1000 $100 $1100</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Balance +$100 -$100 $0</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Now it is the private sector that gets the surplus! In this scenario, the government has collected no taxes, but spent $100 on goods and services produced by the private sector. This creates enough income for the private sector for them to actually save money rather than go into debt.</span>
What the above means is this: government deficits create private sector wealth, while
AND
here: Money Growth Does Not Cause Inflation and What Actually Causes Inflation).
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">So, next time you hear Obama or Romney talking about reducing the deficit, be sure you put that into the proper context. They are talking about draining your savings account! That’s hardly a sound policy when we have over 12 million unemployed.</span>

Hungry people will fight to survive__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__Governments will use force to maintain internal order at home.____This section considers the geopolitical repercussion of economic collapse, beginning with the United States.__
First, the U.S. government’s tax revenues would collapse with the depression

foreign funding for the U.S. budget deficit would dry up.
Consequently, the government would have to sharply curtail its spending, both at home

Historically, empires were financed with plunder and territorial expropriation__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The estates of the vanquished ruling classes were given to the conquering generals, while the rest of the population was forced to pay imperial taxes.</span>
The U.S. model of empire has been unique. It has financed

The United States would have to maintain control over them whatever the price.
In this global depression scenario, the price of oil could collapse to $3

If international trade had broken down, would there be any reason for the United

for U.S. protection. Retreat from Asia might become unavoidable.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">And Europe? What would a cost–benefit analysis conclude about the wisdom of the United States maintaining military bases there?

In a severe worldwide depression, the country__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">— or, at least London—</span>__could become ungovernable__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Frustration over poverty and a lack of jobs would erupt into anti-immigration riots not only in the United Kingdom but also across most of Europe.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The extent to which Russia would menace its European neighbors is unclear. On the one hand, </span>__Russia__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> would be impoverished by the collapse in oil prices and might be too preoccupied with internal unrest to threaten anyone.

Recent research by the US Chamber of Commerce discovered that underperforming transport infrastructure cost the US economy nearly %242 trillion in lost gross domestic product in<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 20</span>08and<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 20</span>09<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The chamber~’s Transportation Performance Index showed that America~’s transit system is not keeping up with growing demands and is failing to meet the needs of the business community and consumers.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Most important, the </span>research proved for the first time that there is a direct relationship between transportation infrastructure performance and GDP<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The index findings also showed that if America invests wisely in infrastructure, it can become more reliable, predictable, and safe. </span>By improving underperforming transport infrastructure<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>theU<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>could unlock nearly %241 trillion in economic potential<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
Making investments that tackle immediate challenges, like congestion, and that account for growing demand into the future, America would boost productivity and economic growth in the long run and support millions of jobs in the near term.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Investment in infrastructure would also improve quality of life by reducing highway fatalities and accidents and easing traffic congestion that costs the public %24115 billion a year in lost time and wasted fuel - %24808 out of the pocket of every motorist. Such an investment would also allow the country to better protect the environment while increasing mobility.</span>
If America fails to adequately invest in transportation infrastructure<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>by 2020 it will lose %24897 billion in economic growth. Businesses will see their transportation costs rise by %24430 billion<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and the average American household income will drop by more than %247,000. US exports will decline by %2428 billion. Meanwhile, </span>global competitors will surge past us with superior infrastructure that will attract jobs, businesses, and capital<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
So how can the US get its infrastructure to go from insufficient and declining to
AND
Aviation Administration alone would help keep 70,000 workers on the job.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Next, America should expand energy infrastructure to support growing needs. A great example is the Keystone XL pipeline to connect Canadian oil sands with Texas refineries. The sooner the project is approved and construction begins, the sooner the US can rake in the benefits of added investment and government revenues, job creation, and more resources to fuel energy needs and keep costs down for businesses and consumers.</span>
Likewise, the US can~’t let a needlessly cumbersome permitting process stand in the way
AND
mobilize construction and hiring from one end of the country to the other.
In this era of tight government budgets, America must adopt innovative financing approaches and
AND
1.9 million jobs over 10 years and spur untold economic growth.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As for public investments, sooner or later we~’ll have to face the fact that the federal fuel tax has not been raised 1 cent in 17 years. The country needs modest, phased-in increase.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Comprehensively restoring America~’s infrastructure and revitalizing the economy are monumental tasks. Fortunately, we are the same nation that built our world-class system in the first place. If anyone is up to the challenge, we are.</span>

This negatively influences the entire economy —- prevents a resilient supply chain
Little, Director, Keston Institute for Public Finance and Infrastructure Policy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>11<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> —- (4/5/2011, Richard, "Infrastructure Investment and U.S. Competitiveness," [[http://www.cfr.org/united-states/infrastructure-investment-us-competitiveness/p24585-http://www.cfr.org/united-states/infrastructure-investment-us-competitiveness/p24585]], JMP)</span>

The massive network of seaports, waterways, railroads, and highways we built in
AND
as consumers, would benefit from a more efficient and resilient supply chain.
Unfortunately, for far too long, Americans have been lulled by their political leadership
AND
control, the challenge will be to muster the will to do so.
The first step in addressing this problem will be to ensure that adequate revenue streams
AND
their upkeep or own both the responsibility for economic decline and its consequences.

c) Confidence
Confidence is collapsing now and destroying investment —- a national infrastructure bank is the best short term stimulus that doesn~’t drive up the deficit
Skidelsky %26 Martin, Emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of Warwick, 11 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">—- macroeconomist and bond investor (3/30/2011, Robert Skidelsky and Felix Martin, New York Review of Books, "For a National Investment Bank," [[http://www.skidelskyr.com/site/article/for-a-national-investment-bank/-http://www.skidelskyr.com/site/article/for-a-national-investment-bank/]], JMP)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But could a National Investment Bank also help with the urgent problem of the weak recovery and the exhaustion of the current policy options? We believe that it could.</span>
Keynes was skeptical that economies can stage spontaneous recoveries from major slumps because he recognized
AND
future is particularly uncertain and they see no clear prospects for future demand.
The current situation in the US conforms closely to Keynes~’s analysis. There is no
AND
-term Treasury bills, and in banks~’ accounts at the Federal Reserve.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Keynes~’s summary of the situation in 1932 still makes sense today, though in less extreme degree:</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It may still be the case that the lender, with his confidence shattered by his experience, will continue to ask for new enterprise rates of interest which the borrower cannot expect to earn…. If this proves to be so, there will be no means of escape from prolonged and perhaps interminable depression except by state intervention to promote and subsidise new investment.</span>
The central challenge is to restore confidence on the one hand and on the other
AND
of the private sector until business regains the confidence needed for future investment.
For the time being such a policy is politically impossible, as President Obama has
AND
and deployed not by the federal government but by the National Investment Bank.
Of course, the creation of a National Investment Bank cannot be a fiscal free
AND
likely be attractive assets for pension funds and other long-term investors.

Studies prove the plan is a uniquely beneficial form of stimulus
Tyson, Chair of Business School at UC Berkeley, 11<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> —- Chan Chair in Global Management at UC Berkeley~’s Haas School of Business (Laura D., "A Better Stimulus Plan for the U.S. Economy," [[http://hbr.org/web/extras/hbr-agenda-2011/laura-d-tyson-http://hbr.org/web/extras/hbr-agenda-2011/laura-d-tyson]], JMP)</span>

Although stimulus spending is a politically contentious issue, America is now in urgent need
AND
its creation through speeches, interviews, and opinion columns like this one.
Unlike most other forms of stimulus, infrastructure spending benefits the economy in two ways: First, it creates jobs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>which<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, because those jobs put money in consumers~’ pockets, </span>spurs demand<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Analysis by theC<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ongressional </span>B<span style="font-size: 8pt;">udget </span>O<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ffice </span>indicates that infrastructure spending is a cost-effective demand stimulus as measured by the number of jobs created per dollar of budgetary expenditure.
Second, the resulting infrastructure enhancement supports supply and growth over time. By contrast
AND
spending needed for other key public goals such as water delivery and sanitation.
Realizing the highest possible return on infrastructure investments depends on funding the projects with the
AND
be selected after independent and transparent cost-benefit analysis by objective experts.
The bank would provide the most appropriate form of financing for each project, drawing
AND
in pension funds and dedicated infrastructure equity funds looking for such investment opportunities.
Crafting the law to achieve these goals is a serious and challenging undertaking, particularly
AND
work in meaningful jobs. The time has come to make it happen.

d). Deficit spending
It~’s good and the only way to create private sector wealth. Also, claims of international backlash are exaggerated
Harvey, Professor of Economics at Texas Christian University, 12 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">-former Executive Director of the International Confederation of Associations for Pluralism in Economics(Johnathan, 7/18/2012, "Why You Should Love Government Deficits," [[http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2012/07/18/why-you-should-love-government-deficits/)JCP-http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2012/07/18/why-you-should-love-government-deficits/)JCP]]</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The calls for cutting the federal government~’s budget and perhaps even balancing it have continued and are likely to grow louder during this election year. Don~’t listen to them unless you want to see a fall in your net assets%21 </span>Government deficits, by definition, create private sector wealth, while surpluses drain it. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It~’s simple accounting.</span>
To understand this, start by imagining a world in which there is no government
AND
the person buying something) and income (for the person selling something).
Now create a government. It is only at this point that it becomes possible for one sector (private or government) to spend more than they earned or earn more than they spent<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, say over its first year in existence, the government takes in %24100 in tax revenues but doesn~’t spend any of it. You might have something like this:</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Government Budget Surplus and Private Sector Deficit</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Private Government Total</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Income %241000 %24100 %241100</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Spending %241100 %240 %241100</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Balance -%24100 +%24100 %240</span>
In this case, the private sector spent %241000 on the goods and services
AND
And with the government in surplus, the private sector goes into debt.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">On the other hand, look at what happens when the government spends in deficit:</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Government Budget Deficit and Private Sector Surplus</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Private Government Total</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Income %241100 %240 %241100</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Spending %241000 %24100 %241100</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Balance +%24100 -%24100 %240</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Now it is the private sector that gets the surplus%21 In this scenario, the government has collected no taxes, but spent %24100 on goods and services produced by the private sector. This creates enough income for the private sector for them to actually save money rather than go into debt.</span>
What the above means is this: government deficits create private sector wealth, while
AND
here: Money Growth Does Not Cause Inflation and What Actually Causes Inflation).
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">So, next time you hear Obama or Romney talking about reducing the deficit, be sure you put that into the proper context. They are talking about draining your savings account%21 That~’s hardly a sound policy when we have over 12 million unemployed.</span>
NOTE: I~’m sure many of you are thinking that the above ignores our debt
AND
of how the budget deficit and national debt work, see this article:

e) Fiscal Cliff
Either outcome on the deal risks hurting the economy – only an NIB allows us to mitigate the impact successfully
Lawrence 11/19—<span style="font-size: 8pt;">MS from Stanford (John, "How to Go Over the Fiscal Cliff and Still Avoid Recession", San Diego Free Press, [[http://sandiegofreepress.org/2012/11/how-to-go-over-the-fiscal-cliff-and-still-avoid-recession/-http://sandiegofreepress.org/2012/11/how-to-go-over-the-fiscal-cliff-and-still-avoid-recession/]]) EL</span>

The deal that Congress and the President made that created the so-called fiscal cliff may not be so bad after al<span style="font-size: 8pt;">l. In fact </span>it has many good elements<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: raising taxes on the rich which will reduce burgeoning inequality in the US, deficit reduction and reduction of the bloated military-industrial complex budget.</span>
The one thing that many experts are worried about is that taking this much money out of the economy will create a recession<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However</span>, increased economic activity that would offset the fiscal cliff provisions can come about with increased leveraged spending on infrastructure development.A relatively small amount of government money when combined with money from private investors can goose the economy while preserving the good elements of the fiscal cliff deal.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This can lead to a conversion of what today is essentially a wartime economy to a peacetime economy and change the US from a national security state – one dependent on military related spending to create jobs – to a world leader in peacetime economic development.</span>
It is important to realize that development of infrastructure in the US will set the stage for the revival of the economy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. First class infrastructure will open up possibilities for the creation of 21st century businesses and enable them to thrive. It will also reduce carbon dioxide emissions and thus global warming.</span>
President Obama backed the proposed legislation in February 2008 for the creation of an infrastructure bank<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The bank would use the same methods as a commercial bank – that is fractional reserve banking. </span>Fractional reserve banking allows banks to leverage depositor funds so that they can loan out ten times what their deposits are <span style="font-size: 8pt;">on the theory that not all depositors will want their money back at the same time.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In this way </span>banks can make many more loans than they would be able to do otherwise<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Obama suggested that </span>the Bank would borrow %2460 billion of federal funding<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to invest in infrastructure over 10 years, </span>while leveraging "up to %24500 billion" of private investment. So a relatively small amount of Federal funding could be leveraged up to provide a substantial amount of spending on infrastructure.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The logic behind the bank isn~’t hard to grasp. In recent years, reams of white papers have come out describing how </span>much of the nation~’s transportation, water and energy infrastructure is in shambles<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A 2010 Government Accountability Office report, for one, found that a quarter of the country~’s 600,000 bridges are either "structurally deficient" or inadequate to today~’s traffic needs.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimates that </span>an investment of %242.2 trillion is needed to bring America~’s infrastructure up to snuff. The US lacks a central source of low-cost financing for big construction projects akin to the European Investment Bank.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The deal that created the fiscal cliff has many good aspects including the following:</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Taxes are raised on everyone but disproportionably on the rich reducing inequality.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A lot of revenue is generated to pay down the deficit.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The military-industrial complex takes a big hit.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans~’ benefits are not affected.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is a 5 to 1 ratio between revenues from taxes and savings from cuts.</span>
The only downside to the deal crafted by politicians as a means of kicking the can down the road is that taking that much money out of the economy might cause a recession. But here~’s a way to avoid that: create an infrastructure bank<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. My premise is that money needs to be taken away from the military-industrial complex establishment and spent on rebuilding infrastructure in the US.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In addition new infrastructure such as a smart electric and electronic grid, high speed rail and undergrounding and hardening of all utilities as a way to avoid widespread devastation from superstorms such as the recent Sandy is of paramount importance. </span>Whether or not we go over the fiscal cliff, creation of an infrastructure bank should be part of any deal before or after January 1.
Here~’s another way to do it: take some of the money from revenues generated
AND
dedicated purpose would be to loan out or grant money for infrastucture projects.
Those loans or grants would be made after due diligence on the requesting company~’s business model for the infrastructure project<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> it has in mind. These projects could be created by entrepreneurs or by the government itself. </span>Some of these projects could be revenue producing such as toll roads; some could be public investments with interest paid to investors over a period of time.
Obama~’s proposed Secretary of Business could oversee the infrastructure projects funded by the infrastructure bank
AND
MITI ran much of Japanese industrial policy, funding research and directing investment.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In 2001, its role was taken over by the newly created Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). </span>An industrial policy coupled with an infrastructure development policy could make the US better fit for not only nation building at home but place it on a better footing for international competition<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. At the same time </span>infrastructure redevelopment would create hundreds of thousands of jobs thereby avoiding a recession and placing the economy on a sounder footing.

The consequences of a New Great Depression would extend far beyond the realm of economics. Hungry people will fight to survive<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Governments will use force to maintain internal order at home.This section considers the geopolitical repercussion of economic collapse, beginning with the United States.
First, the U.S. government~’s tax revenues would collapse with the depression
AND
foreign funding for the U.S. budget deficit would dry up.
Consequently, the government would have to sharply curtail its spending, both at home
AND
might be the military that ultimately determines how the country would be governed.
The political battle over America~’s future would be bitter, and quite possibly bloody. It cannot be guaranteed that the U.S. Constitution would survive.
Foreign affairs would also confront the United States with enormous challenges. During the Great
AND
could not finance its military in the same way it does at present.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Therefore, </span>either the United States would have to find an alternative funding method for its global military presence or else it would have to radically scale it back. Historically, empires were financed with plunder and territorial expropriation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The estates of the vanquished ruling classes were given to the conquering generals, while the rest of the population was forced to pay imperial taxes.</span>
The U.S. model of empire has been unique. It has financed
AND
The United States would have to maintain control over them whatever the price.
In this global depression scenario, the price of oil could collapse to %243
AND
given that mass unemployment would inevitably lead to a sharp spike in crime.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Only after the Middle East oil was secured would the country know how much more of its global military presence it could afford to maintain.</span>
If international trade had broken down, would there be any reason for the United
AND
for U.S. protection. Retreat from Asia might become unavoidable.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">And Europe? What would a cost–benefit analysis conclude about the wisdom of the United States maintaining military bases there? What valued added does Europe provide to the United States? Necessity may mean </span>Europe will have to defend itself<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
Should a New Great Depression put an end to the Pax Americana, the world
AND
(other than North Korea, which is largely a Chinese satellite state).
However, in this disaster scenario, it is not certain that China would survive
AND
China~’s provinces, ruled by warlords, were at war with one another.
United or divided, China~’s nuclear arsenal would make it Asia~’s undisputed superpower if the
AND
be able to prevent mass migration southward, even if it wanted to.
In Europe, severe economic hardship would revive the centuries-old struggle between the
AND
democratic institutions would hold up better this time that they did last time.
England had an empire during the Great Depression. Now it only has banks. In a severe worldwide depression, the country<span style="font-size: 8pt;">— or, at least London—</span>could become ungovernable<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Frustration over poverty and a lack of jobs would erupt into anti-immigration riots not only in the United Kingdom but also across most of Europe.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The extent to which Russia would menace its European neighbors is unclear. On the one hand, </span>Russia<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> would be impoverished by the collapse in oil prices and might be too preoccupied with internal unrest to threaten anyone. On the other hand, it </span>could provoke a war with the goal of maintaining internal order through emergency wartime powers.
Germany<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is very nearly demilitarized today when compared with the late 1930s. </span>Lacking a nuclear deterrent<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of its own, it </span>could be subject to Russian intimidation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>While Germany could appeal for protection from England and France, who do have nuclear capabilities, it is uncertain that would buy Germany enough time to remilitarize before it became a victim of Eastern aggression.
As for the rest of the world, its prospects in this disaster scenario can

**Status quo MILCON is being pushed aside in order to maintain development of high-priority Asia-Pacific weapon systems such as the bomber – the plan reverses that**
**Hale 12 -** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Undersecretary for Defense Services Controller for the Pentagon and Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Defense(May 1, 2012, “House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Holds Hearing on the Proposed Fiscal 2013 Appropriations for Military Construction Programs,” </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/people/cno/Greenert/Testimony/120301%20HAC-M%20posture%20hearing_full%20transcript.pdf)JCP]]</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Now is this one? Now we're on. Good. All right. Mr. Chairman, members of the -- of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss our military construction and family housing request and let me thank all of you for your continued support of our men and women in uniform and the civilians who support them. I submitted a statement for the record. I'll summarize it briefly. </span>
As was said, the Budget Control Act reduced defense funding for '13 through '17
AND
focus on the -on -- on where they most affected military construction.
__We'll accommodate reduced defense spending in part through better discipline or more disciplined use of our resources, trying to stretch our defense dollars. Among the changes, a substantial rephrasing of military construction__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, pushing of projects until we know the nature and location of (inaudible). We'll also seek administrative savings in other ways to reduce base support costs.</span>
__Our new defense strategy provides additional opportunities for savings, we're planning for a smaller, leaner force__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with ground forces no longer sized for long -- prolonged civility operations such as we conducted in Iraq. We will reduce the end strength by a little more than 100,000 over the next five years for active duty mostly in our ground forces and that will yield a number or lead to a number of reductions in force structure.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">HALE: </span>
__Another strategic goal involves rebalancing our forces more toward the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This will involve increasing our presence in areas including Singapore and Australia, </span>__moves that will eventually have effects on military construction. We're also planning investments in high priority initiatives__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and some judicious cutbacks in weapons, </span>__not heavily military construction related__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> so I won't talk to about them in detail. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">And we will continue to support the all volunteer force. But we've proposed to slow the growth in selected components of military pay and benefits. So what does all this mean for the dollars that are before this subcommittee? For 2013, we're asking for $11.2 billion for military construction and family housing.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">That includes $9.1 billion for construction, a half billion to pay continued BRAC expenses. </span>
That's mainly environmental clean up and the rest for family housing. These are the
AND
but it will delink that facility from the moves from Marines off Okinawa.

**Large MILCON programs are required to be compete for funds with all other military priorities – defense policy**
**DoD 2k** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(2000, “The Army's Facility Construction and Maintenance Process An Assessment, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA386348)JCP]]</span>

For the purposes of this report, we estimate the cost of the planning phase
AND
phase's cycle time since programming milestones and budget preparation deadlines are relatively inflexible.
__Thus, during this planning phase, the installation identifies and justifies its MILCON request__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (i.e., the completed 1391). </span>**__The request competes with scores of other requests for funding as it works its way up the chain of command through MACOM to HQDA. This justification process is required for requests for construction or major repair projects valued above established thresholds.__**
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The other cost driver involves the facility-related policy from which the installations derive construction requirements. Some of these policies specify the number and type of facilities for different population levels. Other policies emphasize the Army senior leadership's priorities, such as building new daycare centers or renewing the barracks. When policies change, either from new design criteria or changing priorities, the installations respond accordingly and generate new MILCON requests.</span>

**Military construction doesn’t have it’s own budget category – it is forced to compete against all defense priorities**
**DOD 97**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (1997,“Statement of John J. Hamre, Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[[http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/test97-4-10Hamre.htm)JCP]]</span>

Each of the Military Departments and Defense Agencies have a disciplined requirements review and prioritization
AND
process and explain some of the factors used to determine our construction requirements.
Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that military construction and family housing
AND
the Secretary of Defense (OSD) before finalizing our annual budget request.
**__We do not program or budget for military construction as a percentage of the overall Defense budget request__**__.____The military construction title competes for resources within this process on the basis of how much it contributes to overall Department mission effectiveness__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The objective is always to create the best balance possible in Defense programs and budgets </span>__across all of the various mission areas of the Department.__
====Navy==== 
**The navy budget is capped and internal tradeoffs are already inevitable – further spending risks direct competition with the Air Force**
**Preble 12** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">-Ph.D. in history, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, Preble was a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy,(May 22, 2012, “After-Action Report on Cato’s Panel on the Future of the Navy Surface Fleet,” </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[[http://www.cato.org/blog/after-action-report-catos-panel-future-navy-surface-fleet)JCP]]</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While talking, I raised the subject of the LCS, not the first time that the subject has come up between us. He was nonplussed and claimed that the problems with the ship could easily be fixed. More specifically, he said “It is nothing that money can’t fix.” That is pretty much a direct quote.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nothing that money can’t fix.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are two problems with that statement. First, Mitt Romney might not become the 45thpresident of the United States in January 2013—the polls say that it is basically a 50-50 proposition that he won’t—and </span>__I think it highly unlikely that the Navy’s shipbuilding budget will grow__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> substantially if he isn’t elected.</span>
Second, I seriously doubt that the Navy’s shipbuilding budget will grow very much even
AND
. And the Air Force and Navy compete with the Army, etc.
====Deterrence==== 
**The Next Generation Bomber is critical to deterrence, power projection and combat effectiveness, our current fleet is inadequate and increasingly vulnerable**
**AFA 9-**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Air Force Association (AFA) is an independent, nonprofit, civilian education organization promoting public understanding of aerospace power and the pivotal role it plays in the security of the nation. AFA publishes Air Force Magazine(5/4/2009, “The Next Generation Bombmer”, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[[http://www.afa.org/grl/pdfs/NGB.pdf]]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">)JCP</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Next Generation Bomber </span>
Global reach, global power—the ability to yield strategic effects by striking targets
AND
and global power are sustainable tenants of US defense policy into the future.
Early air power theorists rapidly identified the potential of long range strike, but it
AND
, and effective bombing campaign anywhere in the world, at any time.
Despite these advancements in stealth, 87% of today’s bomber fleet is predates this
AND
the long range strike fleet is comprised of these same B-52s.
Looking to the future, modern long range strike platforms are a fundamental pillar of

the long range strike fleet by 2018 and AFA strongly supports this goal.

Might reports of culture-trained automatic thinking differ in ways unrecognized in existing SPI

A number of additional studies examine the effect of introspection, or thinking about reasons

In general the consequences of ageism are similar to those associated with all attempts to

====2NC Alt Solves==== 
**Only the alternative can overcome colorblindness – their approach is one of false knowing that renders real white hegemony invisible by replacing it with a meritocratic framework – the alternative uses the ballot as a first step in a new curriculum that reforms our understanding of racial identity**

__Another way to think of this is in terms of figure/ground. For most students who come into class a meritocratic framework is ascendant, it is the ‘figure, and white supremacy is the pale and mostly invisible “ground,”__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or background. </span>__My hope is to accomplish a reversal.__
Looking at challenging the hegemony of whiteness in terms of the adaptive unconscious sheds light
AND
tune on each issue is likely to have a significant impact on none.
During the past few semesters, as I have begun to look at classroom processes
AND
Wilson’s terms, I less frequently call students’ psychological immune systems into play.
Framing anti-racist teaching in terms of the adaptive unconscious also brings more clearly
