The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) must prepare now to transition smoothly to a future in which it does not depend on petroleum. This is no small task: <span style="font-size: 16px;">up to 77 percent of DOD’s massive energy needs</span> – <span style="font-size: 16px;">and most of the aircraft, ground vehicles, ships and weapons systems that DOD is purchasing toda</span>y – <span style="font-size: 16px;">depend on petroleum</span>




====DOD oil dependence will cause four scenarios for conflict: China, Straight of Hormuz, Terrorism, and Mexico collapse====

The Risks of Petroleum Dependence <span style="font-size: 16px;">The growing world demand for petroleum presents major geostrategic risks.High prices and rising demand are a boon to</span>major suppliers and <span style="font-size: 16px;">reserve holders</span>such as Iran and Venezuela,<span style="font-size: 16px;"> which are unfriendly to the United States</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">It also affects the international behavior of rising powers such as China</span>


====Conflict with China goes nuclear====

ACCOMMODATION ON TAIWAN? The prospects for avoiding intense military competition and war may be good, but growth in China's power may nevertheless require some changes in U.S. foreign policy that Washington will find disagreeable -- particularly regarding Taiwan. Although it lost control of Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War more than six decades ago, China still considers Taiwan to be part of its homeland, and unification remains a key political goal for Beijing. China has made clear that it will use force if Taiwan declares independence


====Strait of Hormuz conflict escalates and destroys the economy====

Ever since December 27th, <span style="font-size: 16px;">war clouds have been gathering over the Strait of Hormuz</span>, the narrow body of water connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean and the seas beyond. On that day, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi warned that Tehran would block the strait and create havoc in international oil markets if the West placed new economic sanctions on his country. “<span style="font-size: 16px;">If they impose sanctions on Iran’s oil exports,” Rahimi declared, “then even one drop of oil cannot flow from the Strait of Hormuz.” Claiming that such a move would constitute an assault on America’s vital interests,</span>



===Economic collapse causes nuclear war- extinction=== 

<span class="cite">Broward 9</span> ((Member of Triond) http://newsflavor.com/opinions/will-an-economic-collapse-kill-you/)

Now its time to look at the consequences of a failing world economy. With five offical nations having nuclear weapons, and four more likely to have them there could be major consequences of another world war



====Nuclear terrorism is an existential threat—it escalates to nuclear war with Russia and China==== 

**Ayson 10** (Robert Ayson, Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand at the Victoria University of Wellington, 2010 (“After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects,” Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, Volume 33, Issue 7, July, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via InformaWorld)



A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by the country attacked in the first place, would not necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds imaginable. Indeed, <span style="font-size: 16px;">there are reasons to wonder whether nuclear terrorism should ever be regarded as belonging in the category of truly existential threats. A contrast can be drawn here with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear exchange</span>




====A Mexico failed state would escalate====

Our nation is dangerously dependent on foreign oil. We import some 9 million barrels per day, or over 3 billion barrels per year; the U.S. military itself comprises [[http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/06/14/244716/military-renewables-efficiency-and-energy-security/?mobile=nc|two percent]] of the nation’s total petroleum use, making it the world’s largest consumer of energy and oil imports. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Of U.S. foreign oil imports, </span>[[http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/06/14/244716/military-renewables-efficiency-and-energy-security/?mobile=nc|one out of five barrels]]<span style="font-size: 16px;">comes from unfriendly nations and volatile areas</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The current direction of our defense posture is setting the United States along a path that could lead to defeat in a future conflict</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Airpower has been the asymmetric advantage of the U.S. military</span>

REGIONAL CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE This subsection attempts to synthesize some of the key operational implications distilled from the analyses relating to the rise of Asia and the potential for conflict in each of its constituent regions. The first key implication derived from the analysis of trends in Asia suggests that <span style="font-size: 16px;">American air</span>and space<span style="font-size: 16px;">power will continue to remain critical for conventional and unconventional deterrence in Asia</span>.

Then there is Southeast Asia, which, having weathered the Vietnam War and a variety of domestic insurgencies, and having moved onto the track of prosperity, shows no desire to complicate matters with political headaches. Fault lines nevertheless remain, and not least between the numerous and disproportionately successful ethnic Chinese and other inhabitants. And here again China is a looming worry. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Beijing's claim of "unquestionable sovereignty" over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea and its recent seizure of one of them</span>,

Air superiority is defined by Joint Publication 3-30 as “That <span style="font-size: 16px;">degree of dominance in the air battle of one force over another that permits the conduct of operations by the former and its related land, sea, and air forces</span>at a given time and place without prohibitive interference by the opposing force. ”Simply put, it is freedom of maneuver in the air. Generally, <span style="font-size: 16px;">air superiority</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The best way to begin DOD’s energy transition will be to begin with fast-tracked efforts at bases in the continental United States. The services are already increasing renewable power generation at their installations</span>

INTRODUCTION The United States faces some energy challenges that if not resolved will negatively affect our security, economy, and environment. The country depends on foreign oil for transportation, and greenhouse gases and other criteria pollutant emissions need to be reduced. There is no single solution to these critical problems; rather they require a multifaceted approach. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Hydrogen</span>, <span style="font-size: 16px;">together with </span>advanced biofuels, plug-in hybrids, and <span style="font-size: 16px;">other energy efficient transportation technologies</span>, <span style="font-size: 16px;">can be an important part of a more comprehensive and balanced energy portfolio.Fuel cells are central to establishing this integrated solution</span>



====Technology barriers have been overcome by recent developments====

PROGRESS TOWARD COMMERCIALIZATION DOE-funded research and development (<span style="font-size: 16px;">R&D) has made significant progress in overcoming technical challenges to hydrogen and fuel cell technology</span>commercialization. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Accomplishmentsover the last six year</span>





====A transition away from oil preserves solves for a perception of adaptation====

<span style="font-size: 16px;">A successful transition away from petroleum will produce financial, operational and strategic gains. Reducing dependence on petroleum will help ensure the long-term ability of the military to carry out its assigned missions</span>




====Hydrogen is uniquely key – on-site distribution eliminates supply lines==== 

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Reiman 9</span>

Perhaps <span style="font-size: 16px;">the one advantage of hydrogen that could enable a transformation of the military is distributed generation</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Hydrogen can be made anywhere there is access to fresh water and electricity</span>



====Existing energy strategies are not sufficient====

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Though each of the services has admirably developed its own energy strategy</span> to improve its near-term energy management, <span style="font-size: 16px;">DOD must also develop a comprehensive long-term energy strategy</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The strategies developed by individual services focus </span>
