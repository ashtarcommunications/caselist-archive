**__<span style="background: yellow;">The</span>__** __dyadic-level “**power preponderance**” **<span style="background: yellow;">hypothesis</span>, which holds <span style="background: yellow;">that war is least likely when one state has a preponderance of power over another</span> and is most likely when there is an equality of power, <span style="background: yellow;">has received widespread support in the empirical literature</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Kugler & Lemke 1996).</span>

**This is especially true when dealing with China – threat denialists overlook important material and discursive indicators of revisionist capabilities and intentions**

__The difficulty for defensive realists is that in a world with one or more greedy states, the puzzle driving the security dilemma largely disappears: the incompatibility of goals provides a straightforward explanation for competition and conflict__
…
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Such a policy is particularly important and opportune at this moment, considering the worsening relationship between Washington and Beijing at the beginning of the twenty-first century.</span>

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Epistemic communities are less a "new" international actor or unit of analysis than they are a vehicle for the development of insightful theoretical premises about the creation of collective interpretation and choice.</span>

Once committed to a conflict, these forces are capable of projecting significant firepower ashore. The inherent characteristics of maritime forces -- flexibility, self-sustainability, and mobility -- are vital in the post-Cold War world, where crises may arise outside areas where long-established U.S. alliances and bases exist.

The Blechman and Kaplan study, which is often quoted by those wishing to validate naval effectiveness in the forward presence role, can be a double-edged sword. The study can be viewed to document the self-fulfiling prophecy on the frequency of naval use and conclude, on balance, that naval use was often ineffective relative to land-based ground or air forces. 14 This is not to say that naval forces are not useful but rather that the pattern of use became habitual regardless of the effectiveness in achieving the desired objective. </span></span>

===China Deterrence=== 


<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="font-family: Verdana;">And, their strategy is working – they’ve repeatedly deterred carrier deployments in Chinese waters, weakening deterrence and encouraging aggression </span>**</span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana; margin: 3pt 0in;">__<span style="background: yellow;">**Hawkins ‘10**</span>__ (William R. Hawkins, consultant specializing in international economic and national security issues, serves on the Board of Directors of the Asia America Initiative, former President of the Hamilton Center for National Strategy, former Senior Adviser on Economic Policy and National Security to Representative Duncan Hunter, then-Chairman of the National Security Subcommittee on Military Procurement, former economics professor, M.A. Economics, University of Tennessee, B.A. Political Science, History, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, “Why Did the U.S. Kowtow to Chinese Naval Ambitions?” 7-27-2010, http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/id.6857/pub_detail.asp) </span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">The media has, however, noted how </span>**__the current naval “show of force” has been weakened by <span style="background: yellow;">the decision to hold the exercise in the Sea of Japan</span> rather than in the Yellow Sea__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. When Admiral Robert Willard, head of Pacific Command, held a [[http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4657|press conference]] in Seoul announcing the operation, he said “this is the first in a series of exercises that are intending to send a very specific signal to the North Koreans as a consequence of the Cheonan incident.” The South Korea warship Cheonan was sunk by a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine in March. Forty-six crewmen were killed. A focus of “Invincible Spirit”is anti-submarine warfare. However, the South Korea ship went down in the Yellow Sea on the other side of the Korean peninsula from where the maneuvers are taking place. Why not hold the drills where the North Koreans attacked? The Washington Post gave the correct [[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/25/AR2010072500754.html|answer]], “Facing vehement opposition from China, U.S. and South Korean officials decided to relocate the drills from the Yellow Sea, west of South Korea, to the Sea of Japan to the east.” Adm. Willard talked about possible future exercises in the West Sea (meaning the Yellow Sea, though this term was never used), but no date was given. And when asked whether the George Washington would take part in the western operations, he replied, “We’re not going to discuss the particulars of the follow on in the series of exercises.” Foreign governments understand that the Obama administration is appeasing China in what has been since World War II the area of greatest U.S. strength, naval and air power. The Singapore Straits Times reported, A senior U.S. defence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, went as far as to say that </span>__while the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier George Washington would join the [current] exercise, there are no plans for it to enter the Yellow Sea for subsequent exercises__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> this summer. </span>**__Such an assurance <span style="background: yellow;">is a tacit recognition</span> by the US <span style="background: yellow;">that the Yellow Sea lays within China’s sphere of influence</span>__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__To claim and defend this sphere of influence, **<span style="background: yellow;">Beijing has warned Washington not to deploy</span> any US <span style="background: yellow;">aircraft carriers</span> in the waters <span style="background: yellow;">off its coast</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__The paper even cited People’s Liberation Army Major-General Luo Yuan as saying in a TV interview that should the George Washington enter the Yellow Sea, the Chinese military would “welcome the opportunity to try out its anti-aircraft carrier skills, short of actually firing at the carrier.” Over the 4th of July weekend, **the <span style="background: yellow;">PLA</span> Navy conducted <span style="background: yellow;">live fire operations</span> in the East China Sea**, the gateway to the Yellow Sea, **<span style="background: yellow;">featuring</span>** their new **fast attack missile boats and other <span style="background: yellow;">anti-ship</span> air and sea <span style="background: yellow;">weapons</span>**. **Their demonstration <span style="background: yellow;">evidently had a deterrent effect on American decisions about where to deploy its forces</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The China Times of Taiwan also [[http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aOPN&ID=201007260010|reported]] that “The United States has been forced to relocate its latest joint military exercise with South Korea from the Yellow Sea to the Sea of Japan after a strong protest from China.” It raised the specter of “a new generation of commanders of the People's Liberation Army” taking the lead in foreign policy. “The phenomenon could be sending the ominous signals that the PLA is running out of control,” warned the paper, which concluded, “the PLA's saber-rattling has signaled that China can no longer tolerate a U.S.-led security framework blocking its rise as a new power. These developments can lead to tension and conflict in the region, and Taiwan's government should be prepared for this new trend.” Russia’s Pravada news service [[http://english.pravda.ru/world/asia/26-07-2010/114366-holy_war-0|reported]], “It was originally planned that the drills would be held in the Yellow Sea, where the Cheonan had sunk. China, the key ally of North Korea, did not like the idea….Washington and Seoul listened to Beijing and eventually decided to hold the event in the Sea of Japan.” The Russian press also gave prominent mention to Pyongyang’s threats. "The army and the people of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea will launch their own holy war based on nuclear deterrence at any necessary moment to give battle to American imperialists and puppet forces of South Korea which deliberately push the situation towards the edge of war. This is nothing but an open provocation to strangle the republic with the use of arms," was the statement cited from North Korean authorities. However, Pravda also noted, “North Korea has been making threats of retaliation for years.” Pyongyang has been deterred by superior U.S. military power from directly attacking American forces, but will this continue if Washington looks weak of will? With Chinese diplomatic support, the DPRK has moved ahead with its “nuclear deterrence” programs, conducting nuclear weapon tests and firing long-range missiles. With an ailing Kim Jong Il preparing to transfer power to his son, there is an incentive in both Pyongyang and Beijing to take a harder line against anything that could endanger communist rule. Since the sinking of the Cheonan, China has come out from behind the “responsible stakeholder” curtain where it was supposedly willing to help contain North Korea. Beijing has clearly shown its intent to back the Kim regime to the hilt. The current crisis is about more than Korea or the Yellow Sea. A July 26 editorial in the Chinese Communist Party publication Global Times [[http://opinion.globaltimes.cn/editorial/2010-07/555723.html|attacked]] Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s recent plea that disputes in the South China Sea be settled peacefully while keeping maritime navigation open. The editorial claimed this was just an example of “typical American ways of keeping a presence and causing interference in disputed areas.” The commentary took a dangerous turn at the end, Southeast Asian countries need to understand any attempt to maximize gains by playing a balancing game between China and the US is risky. China's tolerance was sometimes taken advantage of by neighboring countries to seize unoccupied islands and grab natural resources under China's sovereignty. China's long-term strategic plan should never be taken as a weak stand. It is clear that military clashes would bring bad results to all countries in the region involved, but China will never waive its right to protect its core interest with military means. Beijing’s claim that the South China Sea, the region’s major trade route, is “sovereign” territory is in direct contravention of international law. </span>**__Turning a show of strength into a show of weakness by appeasing China as to where the U.S. Navy will sail in international waters undermines deterrence__** __in a time of rising tensions. **<span style="background: yellow;">It could tempt Beijing to overreach itself in ways that could endanger the peace of Asia</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span> </span>

===Subs Offset CP=== 

The United States federal government should maintain United States’ naval presence in Japan, substantially increasing United States’ submarine presence in Japan commensurate with ending all other forms of United States’ naval presence in Japan.

__Competition__ – it’s mutually exclusive – doesn’t reduce military presence, merely shifts the form of that presence to submarines – the aff must be a net reduction:

a. reduce means to decrease in number

1. ( also intr ) **__<span style="background: yellow;">to make</span>__** or become **__<span style="background: yellow;">smaller in</span>__** size, **__<span style="background: yellow;">number</span>__**, extent, degree, intensity, etc

b. military presence is the totality of forces deployed in Japan

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Given its multifaceted nature, neither practitioners nor scholars have yet settled on a single definition of presence. Technically, the term refers to both a military posture and a military objective. This study uses the term “presence” to refer to a continuum of military activities, from a variety of interactions during peacetime to crisis response involving both forces on the scene and those based in the United States. </span>**__<span style="background: yellow;">Our definition</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> follows that </span>**__<span style="background: yellow;">articulated by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: “</span>**__<span style="background: yellow;">Presence is the totality of U.S. instruments of power deployed overseas</span>__** __(both permanently and temporarily) along with the requisite infrastructure and sustainment capabilities__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">."</span>

__Net Benefit__:

If presence in Japan means the 18 ships permanently stationed in Japan, then these four permanently stationed submarines are 22% of total presence in Japan – that’s our Global Security evidence from Topicality – means they necessarily withdraw submarines

And, if presence in Japan means all 60 of the ships of the Pacific Fleet rotationally deployed to Japan, then that includes 30 submarines, which is 50% of the total presence in Japan – they clearly reduce submarines

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The signs of a Chinese threat are all there: An increasing defense budget that may equal half of ours in 20 years, new long-range mobile nuclear missiles that will be harder for us to destroy, an increase in the number of nuclear warheads that can hit the United States to perhaps as much as two percent of the warheads we can hit them with, new cruise missiles similar to the hundreds of cruise missile we have deployed in the region for decades, warships that may be able to disturb the unhindered operations of our carrier battle groups and surface action groups, a handful of nuclear-powered attack submarines that </span>**__our 30 nuclear-powered attack submarines in the Pacific__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> will have to sink too, more fighters and bombers that will be harder for the hundreds of advanced fighters we have deployed in the region for decades to shoot down.</span>


2NC A2 Deficit - Perception

The Aff doesn’t solve this deficit – they only withdraw submarines from Japan – but the recent coordinated surfacing of three subs in Korea, the Philippines, and Diego Garcia is perceived as evidence of threatening containment
**__<span style="background: yellow;">Rozoff ‘10</span>__** (Rick Rozoff, “The Drums of War? Pentagon Provokes New Crisis With China,” Australia.to News, 7-11-2010, http://www.australia.to/2010/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3916:the-drums-of-war-pentagon-provokes-new-crisis-with-china&catid=94:breaking-news&Itemid=171)
__Three news features appearing earlier this week highlight tensions__ … __increasingly provocative - messages to China this year__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>

But, zero risk that China perceives our submarines – multiple warrants:

a. submarine deployments are secret
**__<span style="background: yellow;">Miasnikov ‘3</span>__** (Eugene Miasnikov, “Preventing Submarine Collisions,” Center for Arms Control, Energy, and Environmental Studies at MIPT, 8-21-2003, http://www.armscontrol.ru/subs/collisions/debates1.htm)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Q: Are submarine policies (not movements) covert? Yes, they are. Q: Can a policy be hidden from the public, other countries, or even Russia? Many aspects of sub policy is still hidden. For example, </span>**__<span style="background: yellow;">the U.S. Navy never tells public where</span> exactly <span style="background: yellow;">submarines go after they leave their ports</span>, and what are they ordered to do__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Russian Navy has similar practice. </span>

b. any decision to increase the presence of nuclear-armed subs in Japan would be kept secret – empirically proven
**__<span style="background: yellow;">Kristensen ‘99</span>__** (Hans M. Kristensen, “Japan Under the US Nuclear Umbrella,” [[#desc]]
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">"Secret" Agreements In addition to the question of whether the United States deployed nuclear weapons </span>… __epitomized by tacit acceptance of__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the </span>__nuclear ambiguity__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> demanded by the NCND policy. </span>

c. prefer empirics – our submarines have never been detected
**__<span style="background: yellow;">Kantor ‘4</span>__** (Andrew Kantor, “Military tech blurs the line with science fiction,” USA Today, 7-29-2004, http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2004-07-29-kantor_x.htm)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">That's gotten me thinking about military technology </span>… **__<span style="background: yellow;">they have never been detected by an enemy while on patrol</span>__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. These are boats filled with more than 150 men, tons of machinery, and a nuclear reactor. And they are silent. </span>

d. even if someone could see them, it wouldn’t be China – they functionally have no anti-submarine warfare capability
**__<span style="background: yellow;">Erickson, et al. ‘7</span>__** (Andrew S. Erickson, Lyle J. Goldstein, and William S. Murray, China Maritime Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, “China’s Undersea Sentries,” Undersea Warfare, 9(2), Winter 2007, http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_33/china.html)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The PLA Navy is making rapid strides in its modernization drive, </span>… <span style="font-size: 7pt;">very limited organic mine counter measures (MCM) capabilities.”3 </span>

e. new tech makes our subs invisible to detection

2NC A2 Deficit - Bumping

But, we’ll answer it anyway – Chinese subs are so noisy that we never have to get close enough to risk collisions or even use submarines to track them – there’s no risk of any deficit
**__<span style="background: yellow;">Miasnikov ‘3</span>__** (Eugene Miasnikov, “Preventing Submarine Collisions,” Center for Arms Control, Energy, and Environmental Studies at MIPT, 8-21-2003, http://www.armscontrol.ru/subs/collisions/debates1.htm)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Q: </span>__Does the U.S. trail Chinese subs? Perhaps__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>… <span style="font-size: 7pt;">was mostly focused on submarine nuclear accidents. </span>


2NC A2 Deficit - Subs Arms Race

And, here’s more recent evidence – China is rapidly expanding their submarine force – we’re already in a sub race with China – and other Southeast Asian countries are too – makes sub races inevitable
**__<span style="background: yellow;">Eaglen and Rodeback ‘10</span>__** (<span style="font-size: 11pt;">[[http://www.heritage.org/About/Staff/E/Mackenzie-Eaglen|Mackenzie Eaglen]]</span>, Research Fellow for National Security in the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies, a division of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for International Studies, at The Heritage Foundation; <span style="font-size: 11pt;">[[http://www.heritage.org/About/Staff/R/Jon-Rodeback|Jon Rodeback]]</span>, Research Editor at The Heritage Foundation; “Submarine Arms Race in the Pacific: The Chinese Challenge to U.S. Undersea Supremacy,” The Heritage Foundation, Backgrounder #2367, 2-2-2010, http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2010/02/Submarine-Arms-Race-in-the-Pacific-The-Chinese-Challenge-to-US-Undersea-Supremacy)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Submarine fleets and deployments have changed dramatically since </span>… __while the U.S. has steadily drawn down its submarine forces even as combatant commanders have demanded more of their capabilities.__


2NC A2 Other Things Solve

Submarine-based cruise missiles are the most important factor in Japanese perceptions of the credibility of the U.S. extended deterrent – multiple warrants:

a. Japan has specifically demanded these missiles – they’re the only capability which can stealthily hold a wide variety of targets at risk
**__Kristensen ‘9__** (Hans M. Kristensen, “Japan, TLAM/N, and Extended Deterrence,” Federation of American Scientists Security Blog, 7-2-2009, http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2009/07/tlam.php)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The final report of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture </span>... __either visible or **stealthy**, **as circumstances may demand**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.”</span>

b. even if other weapons provide similar capability, Japan believes that submarine-based nuclear Tomahawks are a critical short-term symbol of assurance
**__Warden ‘10__** (John K. Warden, Program Coordinator, Project on Nuclear Issues, Center for Strategic and International Studies, “New CSIS Report Analyzes Extended Deterrence and Assurance,” 1-7-2010, http://csis.org/blog/new-csis-report-analyzes-extended-deterrence-and-assurance)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">However, </span>**__Japan is__** __still **concerned with short-term symbols of assurance**.__ ... <span style="font-size: 7pt;">demonstrate its resolve and commitment while phasing out unnecessary capabilities.</span>

c. we have pointed at submarine-based nuclear cruise missiles and said this is your deterrent – in this context, withdrawal tanks perception of U.S. commitment – no other weapons system or verbal assurances can substitute
**__Acton ‘9__** (James M. Acton, associate in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment and a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow, “Extended Deterrence and Communicating Resolve,” Strategic Insights, 8(5), December 2009, http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=24653)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Against this background, </span>**__the U.S. strategy__** __of demonstrating resolve through capabilities__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, in practice, </span>**__boils down to pointing to certain nuclear weapons as symbols of American resolve__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span> ... **__It should come as no surprise__**__, therefore, **that discussions about the withdrawal of TLAM/N worry Japan**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span>
