Our ICBM force is experiencing reliability problems – Even though the Minuteman 3 went through a life extension, not developing a follow-on ICBM now means we’ll never be able to and we won’t be able to sustain the current force.

__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Schneider, National Institute for Public Policy, 12</span>__(Mark, “The Future of the U.S. ICBM Force,” Comparative Strategy, Volume 31, Number 2)
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">During the Cold War, the continuous modernization of U.S. ICBMs resulted in sustainment of design skills and industrial expertise; however, this pattern is long over. The last ICBM design team was dissolved in the 1980s.94 Based on air force data, the Defense Science Board concluded that “a serious decline in ICBM design capability would occur within five years [2011] and, with sustainment efforts within 10 years [2016].”95 In 2006, the DoD Threat Reduction Advisory Committee had reached a same conclusion: “In May 2006, a study of civil infranstructure for strategic strike concluded that the ‘current low level of effort on new or modified strategic strike systems is insufficient to maintain the health of the infrastructure and to provide strategic options for the nation.”’96 In 2008, the DSB pointed out that, “Industrial base skills . . . are in danger of significant further erosion in the areas of ballistic missiles” (emphasis in the original).97 This report was regarded as so significant that it was included as an annex to one of the reports of the U.S. Strategic Commission. According to the 2009 report of the U.S. Strategic Commission, “The infrastructure that supports two thirds of the strategic deterrent triad—the SLBMs and ICBMs—is not being sustained . . . Assuming the United States is not ready to abandon these kinds of missile systems, it needs to preserve the option to replace them when required . . . The skills being exercised today for nuclear deterrent forces are almost exclusively related to the less demanding sustainment of systems first deployed many years ago.”98 The limited effect of the Minuteman III life-extension program in preserving design expertise is rapidly coming to an end. The Minuteman III guidance replacement program was completed in 2008.99 The life extension program on the post-boost vehicle has also been completed.100 The impact of this on the industrial base is made worse by the overall situation in the U.S. aerospace industry which, as summarized by Aviation Week, is one in which “many beleaguered U.S. aerospace manufacturers are trimming back amid continuing uncertainty over the nation’s long-term goals . . . ”101 In a paper written for the U.S. Strategic Posture Commission, Robert Barker, former Assistant to the Secretary of Defense (Nuclear & Chemical & Biological Defense Programs) stated that, “In the not too distant future, the infrastructure unique to strategic missiles will not be available for any new programs or to respond to major problems, should they develop, in deployed systems. Any reconstitution of capability will take years and will inevitably be accompanied by schedule slips and cost overruns.”102 There has also been loss of expertise in the air force itself. No one in the air force project office has experience developing, or managing the development, of a new type of ICBM.103 In the 1990s, the air force abolished the Air Force Ballistic Missile Organization. This organization, which was formed in 1954, had managed the development of new ICBMs for approximately four decades. No significant design work on a new ICBM has been undertaken since the 1980s and the program office was downsized in 1997 to a small office supported by a prime contractor, Northrop Grumman, to manage and integrate the Minuteman life extension program.104 By 2005, the air force lost its only relatively modern ICBM, the Peacekeeper. Thus, the air force is losing experience in handling more modern ICBM systems. Under these circumstances, the 2008 mandate from Congress directing that the government itself perform systems integration functions should be reevaluated. If this mandate is applied to Minuteman replacement, the results may not be desirable. Even in maintaining the existing ICBM force, there has been a ten-fold increase in requests for engineering support from the ICBM Systems Division.105 The main reasons, according to the Defense Science Board, are the age of the support equipment and the reduced experience in units maintaining the equipment.106 New support equipment is not scheduled to become available until 2017, an obvious mismatch with the stated importance of the nuclear mission and the state of the existing equipment.107 The suggestion that theAir Force ICBMoffice should copy the Navy Strategic Program office is not nowa good idea. For decades, the navy has had a program office with operational responsibilities. Its missile, the Trident II (D-5), is still in production and is a much more modern missile to sustain. The navy has a much larger resource base than the air force from which to draw skills. This resource base supports the attack submarine force, the continued development of a new attack submarine, the Virginia-class, and initiation of the Ohio-class replacement program. The air force has none of these advantages. At this point, the air force cannot emulate the navy operation because of these fundamental differences. The navy does not operate refurbished 1960 vintage missile submarines carrying life-extended Polaris missiles using 40–50-year-old support equipment and facilities. The naval bases that support the Trident were built specifically for this deterrent system. The air force , on the other hand, does operate 1960s vintage missile silos and launch control facilities (although the electronics have been upgraded). The 40-year-old Minuteman III missile has two stages that are even older, since they come from the older Minuteman I and II. Unlike the nuclear navy, the ICBM force has ceased to be a unique career field in the air force. The Defense Science Board has also pointed out that “unlike the Navy SSP, the ICBM SPO has not worked with its industrial base to indentify and then fund incremental sub-system developments that would specifically retain critical skills.”108 The impact of this is that, if a major problem with Minuteman develops, the “root causes of design failure, should one occur, could be difficult to determine and correct.”109 We do not know if a major problem will develop with the Minuteman III in the next twenty years, but like any other weapons system we must be prepared to deal with one if it does. Sustainment plans cannot be based solely on best case assumptions. To move in the direction of the navy model, the air force must first build up its in house technical expertise and retain the critical industrial expertise that will be necessary to sustain the ICBM force to 2030 and beyond. This will be difficult for a number of reasons: (1) increasingly tight defense budgets, (2), hiring freezes, and (3) the long-term effects of eliminating the ICBM force as a career field in the air force, diminishing valuable air force expertise. These factors must be taken into account. In the short term, there is a critical need to maintain the industrial engineering and design expertise that still exists. No one who was involved in the original design of the Minuteman III is still involved in the program today. The 2008 Defense Science Board report on Nuclear Deterrence Skills strongly urged “an advanced development program for ICBM application . . . ”110 Even more egregious, “Expertise that provided designs for hardened and survivable launch control facilities, silos, communications, launch systems, reentry systems, and offensive countermeasures is not now available.”111 Moreover, “The declining trend of Air Force nuclear expertise has not been effectively addressed.”112 Within the air force itself, ICBM officers are leaving after a single tour of duty and enlisted personnel rarely volunteer for ICBM services.113 The March 2011 OSD report on solid-rocket motors industrial capabilities recognizes that the ability to produce large solid motors is not in and of itself sufficient to sustain our ability to design new large solid-fuel ballistic missiles. It states that, “Research and development programs, such as theAir Force ICBM Demonstration andValidation program, are required to preserve SRM [Solid-Rocket Motor] science and technology, engineering and design teams and their critical skills.”114 This is a useful step, but it is not at all clear that a program this small will preserve essential design expertise. The implication of this as recorded in the 2006 Defense Science Board report is that, “Current skills may not be able to cope with unanticipated failures requiring analysis, testing and redesign.”115 In its 2009 report, the U.S. Strategic Commission noted the critical importance of ICBMs: “The force is also immediately responsive in a highly controlled manner. And for the foreseeable future, there is no prospect that a significant portion of the ICBM force can be destroyed by a preemptive strike on the United States by small nuclear powers, including China.”116 To sustain this capability, there is a critical need to get research and development activities underway on a follow-on system. If this does not happen the prospects of an ICBM force after 2030 will become illusory, with grievous implications for U.S. national security.</span>

//<span class="Underline">A Brief History of Federal Policy and Freight Transportation The Federal Government has had an interest in freight transportation issues at least since 1808, when Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin sent a report to the Senate on potential federal-state-private partnerships to finance canals and roads.[1] Four decades later, Congressman Abraham Lincoln spoke eloquently of the need for federal investments in domestic transportation, specifically highlighting the movement of goods. He articulated a set of statistics to guide federal investments, including "the surplus, that which is produced in one place to be consumed in another; the capacity of each locality for producing a greater surplus; the natural means of transportation, and their susceptibility for improvement; the hindrances, delays, and losses of life and property during transportation, and the causes of each."[2] Throughout the nation's first 100 years, freight transportation policy deliberations focused on opening the frontier and supporting trade. Major initiatives included constructing the National Road, assigning responsibility to the U.S. Army for maintaining waterways and harbors, financing the transcontinental railroads through direct subsidies and land grants, and stimulating of demand for agricultural transport through homesteading.</span>//

Now, with the history of hatred repeating its repulsive virulence, freedom and justice--like all the precious promises of democracy-- must be defended to be defined. We do NOT have to understand the terrorist's hatred to know it exists, to know we must annihilate it if we are to survive. The United States denied this maxim to its perpetual peril and then to its unthinkable, unspeakable horror.

In theory, the greatest repudiation of terrorism would be to further unfurl the blessings of liberty, the glory of freedom's franchise. In reality, terrorism's manifest motive is to make us LESS free, to put limits on liberty, to make us reflexive in our repression and put our demand for security above and beyond our love of freedom and so, serve as an unwitting accomplice to the anarchist's creed, to the terrorist's hatred of democracy whose sole purpose is to destroy the coherence of coexistence and put asunder the sun of life, the love of living. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Desperation does NOT produce suicidal terrorist murder nor should it produce suicidal "security</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">" as its response. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">In our</span>____<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> tenacious battle against terrorism, </span>__**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">we must NEVER deny dissent</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the hallowed hallmark of our freedom. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Democratic dissent will NEVER devolve to anti-democratic depredations</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if it is given its free forum, its vibrant voice.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Big events sometimes call for big words. In times of crisis, Swedish politicians are also expected to become skillful rhetoricians, to describe events so that we can understand them and lead us into the future. But Swedes are suspicious of passionate, emotional rhetoric, and sceptical of big words. We are not used to politicians coming out at all odd times of the day to speak to the people. The Prime Minister rarely appears as the interpreter of the Swedish Parliament, or the Swedish people for that matter. We usually judge the American way of handling public language as excessive, emotional and full of religious terms. And this is also why </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">we</span>____<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> tend to </span>__**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">underestimate the significance</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> of what is said</span>____<span style="font-size: 11pt;">. </span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">We do not take it seriously;</span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> we consider it ‘mere rhetoric’, or empty content – and usually miss the real meaning and implications. Our unfamiliarity with linguistic analyses means that we often </span>__**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">underestimate the power of images</span>__****__<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and concepts</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">, especially when they are </span>__**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">vague</span>__****__<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and ambiguous</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> A cornerstone of this study is that the speeches, no matter how twisted they sometimes seem to us, express exactly what is meant; </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">they are not ‘mere rhetoric’, they</span>____<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> are a description of the reality that </span>__**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">will determine</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> how politics </span>__**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">will be conducted</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> and </span>__**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">should be understood</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">if we see the speeches as mere wordy desktop products, we are underestimating the power of constantly repeated assertions and vague but powerful terms and phrases. </span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This ‘war on terrorism’ has seen an accumulation of ambiguous but strong value words. There are plenty of ‘God’s terms’ and ‘Devil’s terms’, according to Richard M. Weaver’s modern rhetorical theory.5 He refers to positively and negatively charged words, usually arranged in pairs of opposites: freedom – fear; civilisation – barbarism; war – peace. This ongoing war has generated an abundance of big words and emotionally charged images. Events have been interpreted in value words and metaphors that sometimes remind us of what George Orwell in his gloomy utopia, Nineteen Eighty-Four, refers to as ‘Newspeak’, where war becomes peace,attacks becomes ‘pre-emptive defence’, military invasion becomes ‘change of regime’, occupation becomes ‘humanitarian intervention’. This </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">distortion of language is by no means a new phenomenon.

The United States federal government should fund port dredging initiatives at the Port of Jacksonville, the Port of Miami, the Port of New York and New Jersey, the Port of Charleston, and the lower Mississippi.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">We believe that the disappointed port authorities would do well to look at the port of Baltimore, which recently announced that it is due to complete its US$105mn dredging project two years ahead of schedule. Baltimore's dredging project has been made possible by a public-private partnership (PPP) with Ports America signed in 2009. The port authority was fully aware that the state of Maryland could not afford to pay for the major works involved in dredging, and instead signed a PPP deal, which leased the port's Seagirt terminal to Ports America for 30 years and specifically required it to deepen the terminal to 15.2m. The project is now on course to be finished ahead of schedule. BMI notes that </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">even if federal funding for east-coast dredging was granted, and work began in less than a year, the projects would likely extend into 2016</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if carried out by the US Army Corps of Engineers, </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">meaning </span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 12pt;">dredging would not be finished until roughly two years after Post-Panamax ships are expected to begin using the expanded</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Panama </span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 12pt;">Canal</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, while BMI understands the port authorities' disappointment with the budget proposal, we believe that </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">all is not lost for east-coast ports if they fail to dredge in time</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for 2014. </span>__<span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 12pt;">Not all ports can become hubs for vessels coming through the canal</span>____<span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Rather, we believe </span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 12pt;">ships could unload some cargo at deeper ports, such as Charleston or Norfolk, before calling at shallower ports such as **Savannah**</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> **<span style="background-color: lime;">when they are a few feet lighter and do not need a very deep dredge</span>**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We have previously stated our belief that although deeper and better prepared ports will get a bigger slice of the pie, </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">the increase in traffic that comes with the expansion of the Panama Canal will be such that most east-coast ports will benefit</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
