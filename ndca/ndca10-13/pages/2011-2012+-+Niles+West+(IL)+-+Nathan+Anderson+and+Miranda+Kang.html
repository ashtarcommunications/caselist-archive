Pollpeter started with a discussion of Chinese doctrine, noting that they pursue what is best translated from Chinese as an “active defense strategy.” </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Officially the Chinese state that they will not be the first to attack, but will actively defend themselves. </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">But Pollpeter said that although this is commonly interpreted in the West as meaning that the Chinese will not attack first, what they say to themselves is something different. Their doctrine is “politically defensive and militarily offensive,” Pollpeter explained. The Chinese have a term that means “gaining mastery by striking first.” Modern wars are violent and quick, finished very rapidly, causing a lot of damage up front. According to Pollpeter, the Chinese have studied numerous examples of the United States attacking other countries such as the first Gulf War, the Bosnian action, and the 2003 Iraq invasion, and determined that if they wait for the United States to build up its forces it is already too late. They need to gain the initiative from the outset. </span><u><span style="color: #222222; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Their strategy is to conduct targeted strikes against vital American targets</span></u><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. Most of their focus is on achieving “information control” for a specific time and location. They would hit decisively and get out before their enemy could recover. The Chinese don’t want to be Iraq, sitting by waiting for the Americans to attack. To the Chinese</span><u><span style="color: #222222; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> this includes hitting American space assets</span></u><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. Pollpeter explained that the Chinese</span><u><span style="color: #222222; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> consider American</span></u><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance </span><u><span style="color: #222222; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">satellites</span></u><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, and even meteorological satellites, </span><u><span style="color: #222222; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">to be “space weapons” and therefore legitimate targets</span></u><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. According to Pollpeter, a common theme in practically every Chinese book and magazine article about space is that “whoever controls space controls the Earth.” “It’s almost obligatory to put this in a book or article,” Pollpeter explained. The Chinese believe that 70–80% of US intelligence information is collected by satellites. They often tend to ascribe almost mythical powers to American intelligence satellites, assuming that the Americans can see and hear everything with their satellites. The Chinese also believe that space will inevitably become a battleground, no different than the oceans or the air.</span><u><span style="color: #222222; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Their strategy is to take down American satellites at the outset of any conflict.</span></u><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Pollpeter said that Chinese writings have been heavily influenced by American writings on “network-centric warfare,” which dates from the late 1990s. The general definition of network-centric warfare is connecting all battlefield systems to provide a common battlefield picture. Doing so, according to its advocates, increases the responsiveness and rapid response of American forces. </span><u><span style="color: #222222; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">The Chinese therefore are seeking to attack the nodes in the network in order to deny this capability to the Americans</span></u><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. But they are also seeking to emulate network-centric warfare themselves. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">US space forces are both an American strength and a vulnerability. But, Pollpeter noted, the Chinese have not yet seemed to recognize is that as they develop their own space systems they are inheriting the same vulnerabilities as the Americans.</span></span><br />

Burgess stated in little-noticed written testimony prepared for an appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee that </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Beijing is developing missiles, electronic jammers, and lasers for use against satellites.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Much of the space warfare activity is being carried out under the guise of China’s supposedly non-military space program, he said. “</span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">The space program</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, including ostensible civil projects, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">supports China’s growing ability to deny or degrade the space assets of </span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">potential </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">adversaries </span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">and enhances China’s conventional military capabilities,” Burgess said. “China operates satellites for communications, navigation, earth resources, weather, and intelligence surveillance, and reconnaissance, in addition to manned space and space exploration missions,” he said. “</span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">China</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">’s successfully tested a direct ascent anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) missile and </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">is developing jammers and directed-energy weapons for ASAT missions</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">,” he said. “A prerequisite for ASAT attacks, China’s ability to track and identify satellites is enhanced by technologies from China’s manned and lunar programs as well as technologies and methods developed to detect and track space debris.” China’s January 2007 anti-satellite missile test involved a modified DF-21 missile that destroyed a Chinese weather satellite. The blast created a debris field in space of some 10,000 pieces of space junk that could damage both manned and unmanned spacecraft. For the U.S. military, the successful 2007 ASAT test represented a new strategic capability for China. Analysts estimate that with as many as two-dozen ASAT missiles</span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, China could severely disrupt U.S. </span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">military </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">operations through attacks on satellites.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Burgess said China rarely admits that its space program has direct military uses and refers to nearly all satellite launches as scientific or civil. Additionally, Burgess said Chinese state-run enterprises “continue to proliferate space and counter-space related capabilities,” including some with direct military applications. For example, China’s Beidou global positioning system satellites will be available for regional users this year and globally by 2020, he said. The satellites will provide foreign militaries with precision targeting capabilities through purchases of Chinese Beidou receivers and services. The system will provide foreign militaries with “greater redundancy and independence in a conflict scenario that employs space assets,” he said.</span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: -40px; margin-left: 0in; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: -25px; width: 1px;"> BEIJING (AP) -- This year, a rocket will carry a boxcar-sized module into orbit, the first building block for a Chinese space station. Around 2013, <span class="DebateUnderline">China plans to launch a lunar probe that will set a rover loose on the moon. It wants to put a man on the moon, sometime after 2020. While the United States is still working out its next move after the space shuttle program, China is forging ahead. </span>Some experts worry <span class="DebateUnderline">the U.S. could slip behind China in human spaceflight - the realm of space science with the most prestige. &quot;Space leadership is highly symbolic of national capabilities and international influence, and a decline in space leadership will be seen as symbolic of a relative decline in U.S. power and influence</span>,&quot; said Scott Pace, an associate NASA administrator in the George W. Bush administration. He was a supporter of Bush's plan - shelved by President Barack Obama - to return Americans to the moon. <span class="Underline">China is still far behind the U.S. in space technology and experience, but what it doesn't lack is a plan or financial resources</span>. While <span class="Underline">U.S. programs can fall victim to budgetary worries or a change of government, rapidly growing China appears to have no such constraints. </span>&quot;One of the biggest advantages of their system is that they have five-year plans so they can develop well ahead,&quot; said Peter Bond, consultant editor for Jane's Space Systems and Industry. &quot;They are taking a step-by-step approach, taking their time and gradually improving their capabilities. They are putting all the pieces together for a very capable, advanced space industry.&quot; In 2003, China became the third country to send an astronaut into space on its own, four decades after the United States and Russia. In 2006, it sent its first probe to the moon. In 2008, China carried out its first spacewalk. <span class="Underline">China's space station is slated to open around 2020, the same year the International Space Station is scheduled to close. If the U.S. and its partners don't come up with a replacement, China could have the only permanent human presence in the sky</span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">.</span> </span>Its space laboratory module, due to be launched later this year, will test docking techniques for the space station. China's version will be smaller than the International Space Station, which is the size of a football field and jointly operated by the U.S., Russia, Canada, Japan and 11 European countries. &quot;China has lagged 20 to 40 years behind the U.S. in developing space programs and China has no intention of challenging U.S. dominance in space,&quot; said He Qisong, a professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. &quot;But it is a sign of the national spirit for China to develop a space program and therefore it is of great significance for China.&quot; <span class="Underline">Some elements of China's program, notably the firing of a ground-based missile into one of its dead satellites four years ago, have alarmed American officials and others who say such moves could set off a race to militarize space</span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">.</span></span> That <span class="DebateUnderline">the program is run by the military has made the U.S. reluctant to cooperate with China in space</span>, even though the latter insists its program is purely for peaceful ends. &quot;Space technology can be applied for both civilian and military use, but China doesn't stress the military purpose,&quot; said Li Longchen, retired editor-in-chief of Chinese magazine &quot;Space Probe.&quot; &quot;It has been always hard for humankind to march into space and China must learn the lessons from the U.S.&quot; <span class="DebateUnderline">China is not the only country aiming high in space. Russia has talked about building a base on the moon and a possible mission to Mars but hasn't set a time frame. India has achieved an unmanned orbit of the moon and plans its first manned space flight in 2016. </span>The U.S. has no plans to return to the moon. &quot;We've been there before,&quot; Obama said last year. &quot;There's a lot more of space to explore.&quot; He prefers sending astronauts to land on an asteroid by 2025 and ultimately to Mars. But those plans are far from set. <span class="Underline">Instead, NASA is closing out its 30-year space shuttle era this month, leaving the U.S. dependent on hitching rides to the space station aboard Russian Soyuz capsules at a cost of $56 million per passenger</span>, rising to $63 million from 2014. The U.S. also hopes private companies will develop spacecraft to ferry cargo and crew to the space station.</span><br />

The threat has not arisen due to a lack of a space arms-control regime, or because of the Bush administration’s disincli- nation to negotiate an accord that bans the weaponisation of space. Rather, it is rooted entirely in China’s requirement that it be able to defeat the United States in a regional conflict despite its conventional inferiority. This strategic chal- lenge has compelled Beijing to exploit every anti-access and battlespace-denial technology potentially available. The threat posed by this Chinese effort cannot be neutralised by arms-control agreements, even though all countries stand to profit from the absence of threats to their assets in space. There is a temptation, especially in the United States, to view China’s counterspace programmes in moralistic terms. This approach is undesirable and best avoided: Beijing’s desire to defeat the stronger by asymmetric means is not a reflection of its deviousness, nor provoked by mendacity on the part of the United States or the Bush admin- istration. It is grounded in the objective conditions that define the relationship between the two countries: competing political goals, likely to persist whether or not the Taiwan conflict is resolved. In such circumstances, the United States should seek, as the Bush administration’s own National Space Policy declares, to protect the ’use of outer space by all nations for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all humanity’. But if this fundamental goal is threatened by Chinese counterspace activities aimed at American space assets, the United States has no choice but to run an offence–defence arms race, and win.</span></span><br />

The term global positioning system (GPS) is used to refer to the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) developed by the United States Department of Defence. The proper name is The Navigation System with Timing And Ranging Global Positioning System (NAVSTAR GPS) however the acronym GPS is typically used. Though initially intended solely for US military purposes the GPS system was extended for civilian use in the 1980’s. Popular applications include automobile and marine navigation, tracking, farming and research. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">GPS is</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> a grouping of 24 well-spaced </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">satellites that orbit the earth and make it possible for people with ground receivers to pin-point their exact geographic location</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> with great accuracy. GPS equipment is widely used across the globe and is sufficiently “low-cost” so that anyone can own a GPS receiver. <span class="Underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;">Application of GPS to Disaster Management</span></span></span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> GPS is particularly useful during disasters because it operates in any weather, anywhere and at all times.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> While it functions simply to give the location of the receiver, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">the level of precision of GPS makes it quite useful in disaster management.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> In many instances GPS data is integrated with GIS to overlay real-time activity during emergency. <span class="Underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;">GPS find its greatest utility during the response and recovery phases; however it can also be utilized during preparedness and mitigation phases</span></span>. An important application of GPS in EDM is tracking of emergency vehicles or supplies. In this application the GPS receiver attached to the vehicle and the location is overlaid onto a map. Other applications include the monitoring the height of waves. GPS units are fixed to buoys and the height of the units are can be determined to within centimetres any significant change in wave height or velocity can trigger an alarm for a tsunami or sea surge. Volcanoes can also be monitored using GPS. By measuring the deformation of the ground, inferences about volcanic activity can be made. </span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: -40px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: -25px; width: 1px;"> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">In addition to longitude, latitude, and altitude, the Global Positioning System (</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: lime;">GPS</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">) </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: lime;">provides a critical fourth dimension – time</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. Each GPS satellite contains multiple atomic clocks that contribute very precise time data to the GPS signals. GPS receivers decode these signals, effectively synchronizing each receiver to the atomic clocks. This enables users to determine the time to within 100 billionths of a second, without the cost of owning and operating atomic clocks. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: lime;">Precise time is crucial to a variety of economic activities around the world</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. Communication systems, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: lime;">electrical power grids</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, and financial networks all </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: lime;">rely on precision timing for synchronization and operational efficiency</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. The free availability of GPS time has enabled cost savings for companies that depend on precise time and has led to significant advances in capability. For example, wireless telephone and data networks use GPS time to keep all of their base stations in perfect synchronization. This allows mobile handsets to share limited radio spectrum more efficiently. Similarly, digital broadcast radio services use GPS time to ensure that the bits from all radio stations arrive at receivers in lockstep. This allows listeners to tune between stations with a minimum of delay. Companies worldwide use GPS to time-stamp business transactions, providing a consistent and accurate way to maintain records and ensure their traceability. Major investment banks use GPS to synchronize their network computers located around the world. Large and small businesses are turning to automated systems that can track, update, and manage multiple transactions made by a global network of customers, and these require accurate timing information available through GPS. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) uses GPS to synchronize reporting of hazardous weather from its 45 Terminal Doppler Weather Radars located throughout the United States. Instrumentation is another application that requires precise timing. Distributed networks of instruments that must work together to precisely measure common events require timing sources that can guarantee accuracy at several points. GPS-based timing works exceptionally well for any application in which precise timing is required by devices that are dispersed over wide geographic areas. For example, integration of GPS time into seismic monitoring networks enables researchers to quickly locate the epicenters of earthquakes and other seismic events. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Power companies and utilities have fundamental requirements for time and frequency to enable efficient power transmission and distribution</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: lime;">Repeated power blackouts have demonstrated</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> to power companies </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: lime;">the need for improved time synchronization throughout the power grid. Analyses of these blackouts have led many companies to place GPS-based time synchronization devices <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">in power plants and substations</span></strong></span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. By analyzing the precise timing of an electrical anomaly as it propagates through a grid, engineers can trace back the exact location of a power line break. Some users, such as national laboratories, require the time at a higher level of precision than GPS provides. These users routinely use GPS satellites not for direct time acquisition, but for communication of high-precision time over long distances. By simultaneously receiving the same GPS signal in two places and comparing the results, the atomic clock time at one location can be communicated to the other. National laboratories around the world use this &quot;common view&quot; technique to compare their time scales and establish Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). They use the same technique to disseminate their time scales to their own nations. New applications of GPS timing technology appear every day. Hollywood studios are incorporating GPS in their movie slates, allowing for unparalleled control of audio and video data, as well as multi-camera sequencing. The </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: lime;">ultimate applications for GPS</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, like the time it measures, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: lime;">are limitless</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. As GPS becomes modernized, further benefits await users. The addition of the second and third civilian GPS signals will increase the accuracy and reliability of GPS time, which will remain free and available to the entire world.</span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: -40px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: -25px; width: 1px;"> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">But the real kicker in all this is that <strong>the power grid will be destroyed nearly everywhere</strong>. What happens when there's no electricity? Imagine </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">a world without electricity. Even for just a week. Imagine </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://au.ibtimes.com/topics/detail/456/new-york/" rel="nofollow">New York</a><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> City with no electricity, or Los Angeles, or Sao Paulo. Within 72 hours, most cities around the world will devolve into total chaos, complete with looting, violent crime, and runaway fires. But that's not even the bad news. Even if all the major cities of the world burned to the ground for some other reason, humanity could still recover because it has the farmlands: the soils, the seeds, and the potential to recover, right? And yet the real crisis here stems from the realization that </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">once there is no power grid, all the nuclear power plants of the world suddenly go into &quot;emergency mode&quot; and are forced to rely on their on-site emergency power backups</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">to circulate coolants and prevent nuclear meltdowns from occurring. And yet, as we've already established, these facilities typically have only a few hours of battery power available, followed by perhaps a few days worth of diesel fuel to run their generators (or propane, in some cases). Did I also mention that half the people who work at nuclear power facilities have no idea what they're doing in the first place? Most of the veterans who really know the facilities inside and out have been forced into retirement due to reaching their</span> <strong>lifetime limits</strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> of on-the-job radiation exposure, so most of the workers at nuclear facilities right now are <em>newbies</em> who really have no clue what they're doing. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">There are 440 nuclear power plants operating across 30 countries around the world today</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. There are an additional 250 so-called &quot;research reactors&quot; in existence, making a total of </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">roughly 700 nuclear reactors to be dealt</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> with </span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf01.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/i...</a>). Now imagine the scenario: You've got a massive solar flare that knocks out the world power grid and destroys the majority of the power grid transformers, thrusting the world into darkness. Cities collapse into chaos and rioting, martial law is quickly declared (but it hardly matters), and every nation in the world is on full emergency. But that doesn't solve the really big problem, which is that </span><span class="UnderlineChar">you've got</span> <strong>700 nuclear reactors</strong><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> that can't feed power into the grid</span></u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> (because all the transformers are blown up) </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">and yet simultaneously have to be fed a steady stream of emergency fuels to run the generators the keep the coolant pumps functioning</span></u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. How long does the coolant need to circulate in these facilities to cool the nuclear fuel? </span><strong>Months.</strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> This is also the lesson of Fukushima: You can't cool nuclear fuel in mere hours or days. It takes <em>months</em> to bring these nuclear facilities to a state of cold shutdown. And that means </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">in order to avoid </span></u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">a multitude of Fukushima-style</span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> meltdowns from occurring around the world, you need to </span></u></span></strong><strong>truck</strong> <strong>diesel fuel</strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, generator parts and nuclear plant workers to</span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> every nuclear facility on the planet, ON TIME</span></u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, every time, without fail, for months on end. Now remember, </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">this must be done in the middle of the total chaos</span></u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> breakdown of modern civilization</span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, where there is no power</span></u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, where law enforcement and emergency services are totally overrun, where people are starving because food deliveries have been disrupted, and when looting and violent crime runs rampant in the streets of every major city in the world. Somehow, despite all this, you have to run these diesel fuel caravans to the nuclear power plants and keep the pumps running. Except there's a problem in all this, even if you assume you can somehow work a logistical miracle and actually deliver the diesel fuel to the backup generators on time (which you probably can't). The problem is this: <strong>Where do you get diesel fuel?</strong> Why refineries will be shut down, too from</span> <strong>petroleum refineries.</strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Most people don't realize it, but petroleum refineries</span> <strong>run on electricity</strong><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Without the power grid, the refineries don't produce a drop of diesel. With no diesel, there are no generators keeping the coolant running in the nuclear power facilities. But wait, you say: Maybe we could just acquire diesel from all the gas stations in the world. Pump it out of the ground, load it into trucks and use that to power the generators, right? Except there are other problems here: How do you pump all that fuel without electricity? How do you acquire all the tires and spare parts needed to keep trucks running if there's no electricity to keep the supply businesses running? How do you maintain a truck delivery infrastructure when the electrical infrastructure is totally wiped out? Some countries might be able to pull it off with some degree of success. With <strong>military escorts</strong> and the total government control over all fuel supplies, a few nations will be able to keep a few nuclear power facilities from melting down. But here's the real issue: There are 700 nuclear power facilities in the world, remember? Let's suppose that in the aftermath of a massive solar flare, the nations of the world are somehow able to control half of those facilities and nurse them into cold shutdown status. That still leaves roughly 350 nuclear facilities at risk. Now let's suppose half of those are somehow luckily offline and not even functioning when the solar flare hits, so they need no special attention. This is a very optimistic assumption, but that still leaves <strong>175 nuclear power plants</strong> where all attempts fail. Let's be outrageously optimistic and suppose that a third of those somehow don't go into a total meltdown by some miracle of God, or some bizarre twist in the laws of physics. So we're still left with </span><strong>115 nuclear power plants</strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> that &quot;go Chernobyl.&quot; Fukushima was one power plant. </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Imagine the devastation of 100+ nuclear power plants, all going into meltdown all at once across the planet</span></u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. It's not the loss of electricity that's the real problem; it's the <strong>global tidal wave of invisible radiation</strong> that blankets the planet, permeates the topsoil, irradiates everything that breathes and delivers the final crushing blow to human civilization as we know it today. Because if you have <strong>100</strong></span> <strong>simultaneous global nuclear meltdowns</strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the tidal wave of radiation will make farming nearly impossible for years. That means no food production for several years in a row.</span></strong></span> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">And that, in turn,</span> <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">means a </span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">near-total</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> collapse of the human population on our planet</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. How many people can survive an entire year with no food from the farms? Not one in a hundred people. Even beyond that, how many people can essentially <strong>live underground</strong> and be safe enough from the radiation that they can have viable children and repopulate the planet? It's a very, very small fraction of the total population.</span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: -40px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: -25px; width: 1px;"> On the planet's final frontier, more and more countries are beefing up their border guards. <u>India</u> became the latest country to boost its defense presence in space, announcing last week <u>plans to develop a military space program to counter the fast-growing space defense efforts of neighboring China</u>. India, which has an extensive civilian space satellite program, must &quot;optimize space applications for military purposes,&quot; army Chief of Staff Gen. Deepak Kapoor <u>said</u> at a defense conference in New Delhi. <u>&quot;The Chinese space program is expanding at an exponentially rapid pace in both offensive and defensive content.&quot;</u> Last month, Japanese lawmakers passed a bill ending a decades-old ban on the use of the country's space programs for defense, although officials in Tokyo insist that the country has no plans to develop a military program in space. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in the first major review of France's defense and security policy in more than a decade, has proposed nearly doubling spending for space intelligence assets, including spy satellites, to more than $1 billion annually. &quot;I don't think what you are seeing is coincidental,&quot; said Wade Boese, a researcher at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. <u>&quot;Countries are increasingly aware of the potential for military development in space, and increasingly aware that other countries are moving ahead.&quot;</u> The issue of an arms race in space took on new prominence in January 2007, when China stunned Western military analysts by using a medium-range ballistic missile to shoot down a defunct weather satellite. Pentagon planners said two orbiting U.S. spacecrafts were forced to change course to avoid being hit by the thousands of pieces of space debris caused by the surprise test. China insists the exercise was not conducted for military reasons. &quot;We are against weaponization or an arms race in space,&quot; Zhou Wenzhong, China's ambassador to the United States, said in an interview at The Washington Times earlier this month. &quot;This was a scientific experiment.&quot; But in what many around the world saw as at least in part a return salvo to the Chinese action, the U.S. Navy in February shot down a wayward U.S. spy satellite over the Pacific, arguing that the action was needed to prevent the craft from crashing to Earth and spreading potentially toxic fuel. India, which competes for influence with China even as trade relations between the two Asian giants have blossomed, made no effort to hide its concerns about Beijing's plans for space. <u>&quot;With time we will get sucked into a military race to protect our space assets and inevitably there will be a military contest in space</u>,&quot; Lt. Gen. H.S. Lidder, one of India's most senior officers, said last week in comments reported by the Indian Express newspaper and confirmed by the country's defense ministry. &quot;In a life-and-death scenario, space will provide the advantage,&quot; Gen. Lidder said. Although the United States holds a vast technological and spending edge in space defense programs, the military's reliance on satellites and space-based assets exposes the United States more than any other country to military threats in space. Nancy Gallagher and John D. Steinbruner, researchers at the University of Maryland's Center for International Studies, argue in a study that the Pentagon cannot hope to dominate space through technological and material superiority. The United States will not be able to &quot;outspend and out-innovate all potential rivals in space,&quot; the two argue in a &quot;white paper&quot; just published by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Aides to Sen. Barack Obama, Illinois Democrat, and Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, are staking out markedly different stands on the space arms race as the presidential campaign heats up. &quot;We don't need more battlegrounds,&quot; Steve Robinson, an Obama campaign adviser, said in a debate at the National Space Society's annual meeting in May in Washington. &quot;The idea of militarization of space is not something that Senator Obama is in favor of, and cooperation is better than confrontation.&quot; Floyd DesChamps, a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee staffer representing Mr. McCain, said the senator from Arizona recognizes the need to defend U.S. space assets from hostile attack. &quot;The reality is that we have to protect those assets,&quot; he said.</span><br />

It tell the story of the 1991 Gulf War from the Iraqi point of view based largely on captured documents and published Arabic sources. The most important point in this study is that, from Saddam’s point of view, as well as that of the Ba’athist leadership, they won. After all, in spite of being ignominiously kicked out of Kuwait and having their armies thoroughly defeated on the battlefield, they remained in power. Political power was the only thing that counted and they had been able to keep it. One of the keys to their belief that they won was that they were able to launch dozens of long-range missiles at their enemies, especially at Israel. They believed that the boost that this gave them, at home and in the Arab world, somehow compensated for everything that happened on the battlefield in Kuwait and southern Iraq. In his autobiography It Doesn’t Take A Hero Norman Schwarzkopf wrote that “…in essence what they had was a weapon that could fly 300 miles and miss the target by a couple of miles with a warhead of only 160 pounds. Militarily, that was the equivalent of a single airplane flying over and dropping one small bomb and flying away—terrible for anyone it happened to land on but in the grand scheme of warfare, a mosquito. However the Scud was effective as a terror weapons against civilian populations.” Ever since 1991 this has been the accepted US and Western view of the missile campaign. Kevin Wood now has given us a much different view these attacks, one that has profound implications for missile defense policy and for the way that political leaders have to rethink the instructions they give to the military. Looking back on the German V-2 campaign against London and Antwerp that went on from September 1944 until April 1945, the greatest military effect was not the physical and psychological damage done to England and Belgium, but the impact on Germany’s national morale. One should never forget that these were called Vengeance weapons. For a population suffering under nearly non-stop Allied bombardment and facing defeat on every front, the fact that they were in some small way able to keep hitting back with a wonder weapon that their enemies could not match was a factor keeping them fighting. Nazi propaganda did not fail to manipulate these feelings. Ba’athist Iraq’s war-weary population was likewise subject to massive and—let’s face it—masterful propaganda. Hitting the hated Israelis, even with ineffective weapons, and the fact that due to US political pressure the Israelis did not strike back, was seen by Iraqis and by other Arabs as a great victory. A claim made explicit in a memoir written by Saddam’s missile force commander Hazim Abd al-Razzaq al-Ayyubi Forty-Three Missiles on the Zionist Enemy published in Amman, Jordan in 1998. Al-Ayyubi described how, in the years and months leading up to the war, his two missile brigades practiced their “shoot and scoot” operational techniques. He also wrote about the very serious efforts the Iraqis made building multiple secure communications links using both radio and phone lines. According to a report to Saddam, they started the war with 230 missiles and 75 “special” warheads. Interestingly, he also bragged about the success of his deception units, not only in fooling US and Coalition targeting efforts, but also in deceiving the UN inspectors who tried to account for the missiles. Wood makes it clear “that despite the cost to the Iraqi people, Iraq’s successful violation of UNSC [United Nations Security Council] resolution 687 was a source of great pride to its leaders.” Most, but not all, of what the Iraqis believed they had accomplished with their attacks was nonsense. The claims that they hit Ben Gurion Airport and the Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv, or the Haifa Technology Institute, are just not serious. As was their claim to have been “the first Arab country to conduct effective offensive operations against the enemy (Israel).” What is true is that these attacks “fulfilled the Iraqi President’s vow that he would retaliate against Israel as revenge for their attacks against the Iraqi reactor.” It is exactly this need for revenge that should get the attention of those in the US government who are trying to design a realistic missile defense policy for the next fifty years.</span> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Tyrannical regimes and terrorist movements share the need to excite people with dramatic and violent events. The more spectacular the attack, the better</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. Firing long-range missiles at an enemy, even if you only hit an empty parking lot, can provide followers with a level of emotional satisfaction. This in turn can motivate them to continue to fight even in a seemingly hopeless battle.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="Underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;">In future wars, those who are fighting against the West—today</span></span></span><span style="mso-bookmark: _Toc307613437;"><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Iran or North Korea</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, tomorrow, who knows?—</span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">will use ballistic missiles not only to terrorize enemy civilian populations but to build morale </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">among their own forces and people</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. Missile defense is the key to winning this critical psychological battle.</span> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">As long as their missiles are being shot out of the sky, claims that they are hurting the enemy and thus filling people’s need for revenge can be shown to be utterly empty. This, however, cannot be done with terminal phase defense weapons. To hit a missile or a warhead that is descending towards its target may be a feat of technological skill, but it does nothing to decrease the emotional satisfaction that comes from striking a hated enemy</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Midcourse interceptors such as the US GBI or the Israeli Arrow are better, but the best way to publicly humiliate those who are launching Scud-type missiles is to shoot them down as soon after they leave the launch pad as possible. The only weapon now in development that will—in theory—be able to do this is the Airborne Laser (ABL), which the Missile Defense Agency plans to test next year. This is indeed a promising system, but it has its limits. Its range is, according to unclassified reports, about 300 kilometers, and the US only plans to build, at most, seven aircraft.</span> <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">If the goal is to prevent the enemy from using its missile attacks to build its own side’s morale and thus lengthen the war, another solution must be found. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Space-based interceptors,</span> <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">such a</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> a new version of the</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Brilliant Pebbles </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">program that was canceled in 1993, could, in combination with space- and ground-based sensors, knock down missiles of this type in the boost phase</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Significantly, they would do so over the launching country’s own territory and at least some of the citizens would witness the destruction of their leader’s vengeance weapons.

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: -40px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: -25px; width: 1px;"> <span style="mso-bookmark: _Toc307613437;"><span class="underline0">This is a good thing, and it should continue to be a primary goal of American foreign policy to perpetuate this relatively benign international configuration of power. The unipolar order with </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">the United States as the redominant power</span></span><span class="underline0"> is unavoidably riddled with flaws and contradictions.</span><span style="color: black;"> It inspires fears and jealousies. The United States is not immune to error, like all other nations, and because of its size and importance in the international system those errors are magnified and take on greater significance than the errors of less powerful nations. Compared to the ideal Kantian international order, in which all the world 's powers would be peace-loving equals, conducting themselves wisely, prudently, and in strict obeisance to international law, the unipolar system is both dangerous and unjust. </span><span class="DebateUnderline">Compared to any plausible alternative in the real world, however, it<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> is relatively stable and less likely to produce a major war between great powers</span></span><span style="color: black;">. It is also comparatively benevolent, from a liberal perspective, for it is more conducive to the principles of economic and political liberalism that Americans and many others value. American predominance does not stand in the way of progress toward a better world, therefore. It stands in the way of regression toward a more dangerous world. The choice is not between an American-dominated order and a world that looks like the European Union. The future international order will be shaped by those who have the power to shape it. The leaders of a post-American world will not meet in Brussels but in Beijing, Moscow, and Washington. The return of great powers and great games </span><span class="DebateUnderline">If the world is marked by the persistence of unipolarity, it is nevertheless also being shaped by the reemergence of competitive national ambitions</span><span style="color: black;"> of the kind that have shaped human affairs from time immemorial. During the Cold War, this historical tendency of great powers to jostle with one another for status and influence as well as for wealth and power was largely suppressed by the two superpowers and their rigid bipolar order. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has not been powerful enough, and probably could never be powerful enough, to suppress by itself the normal ambitions of nations. This does not mean the world has returned to multipolarity, since none of the large powers is in range of competing with the superpower for global influence. </span><span class="underline0">Nevertheless, several large powers are now competing for regional predominance, both with the United States and with each other. </span><span class="DebateUnderline">National ambition drives China's foreign policy today, and although it is tempered by prudence and the desire to appear as unthreatening as possible to the rest of the world, the Chinese are powerfully motivated to return their nation to what they regard as its traditional position as the preeminent power in East Asia</span><span class="underline0">. </span><span style="color: black;">They do not share a European, postmodern view that power is passé; hence their now two-decades-long military buildup and modernization. Like the Americans, they believe power, including military power, is a good thing to have and that it is better to have more of it than less. Perhaps more significant is the Chinese perception, also shared by Americans, that status and honor, and not just wealth and security, are important for a nation. Japan, meanwhile, which in the past could have been counted as an aspiring postmodern power -- with its pacifist constitution and low defense spending -- now appears embarked on a more traditional national course</span><span class="underline0">. Partly this is in reaction to the rising power of China and concerns about North Korea 's nuclear weapons. But it is also driven by Japan's own national ambition to be a leader in East Asia or at least not to play second fiddle or &quot;little brother&quot; to China. China and Japan are now in a competitive quest with each trying to augment its own status and power and to prevent the other 's rise to predominance, and this competition has a military and strategic as well as an economic and political component.</span><span style="color: black;"> Their competition is such that a nation like South Korea, with a long unhappy history as a pawn between the two powers, is once again worrying both about a &quot;greater China&quot; and about the return of Japanese nationalism. As Aaron Friedberg commented, the East Asian future looks more like Europe's past than its present. But it also looks like Asia's past. Russian foreign policy, too, looks more like something from the nineteenth century. It is being driven by a typical, and typically Russian, blend of national resentment and ambition. A postmodern Russia simply seeking integration into the new European order, the Russia of Andrei Kozyrev, would not be troubled by the eastward enlargement of the EU and NATO, would not insist on predominant influence over its &quot;near abroad,&quot; and would not use its natural resources as means of gaining geopolitical leverage and enhancing Russia 's international status in an attempt to regain the lost glories of the Soviet empire and Peter the Great. But Russia, like China and Japan, is moved by more traditional great-power considerations, including the pursuit of those valuable if intangible national interests: honor and respect. </span><span class="underline0">Although Russian leaders complain about threats to their security from NATO and the United States, the Russian sense of insecurity has more to do with resentment and national identity than with plausible external military threats. 16 Russia's complaint today is not with this or that weapons system. It is the entire post-Cold War settlement of the 1990s that Russia resents and wants to revise. But that does not make insecurity less a factor in Russia 's relations with the world; indeed, it makes finding compromise with the Russians all the more difficult. One could add others to this list of great powers with traditional rather than postmodern aspirations. India 's regional ambitions are more muted, or are focused most intently on Pakistan, but it is clearly engaged in competition with China for dominance in the Indian Ocean and sees itself, correctly, as an emerging great power on the world scene. In the Middle East there is Iran, which mingles religious fervor with a historical sense of superiority and leadership in its region. 17 Its nuclear program is as much about the desire for regional hegemony as about defending Iranian territory from attack by the United States</span><span style="color: black;">. Even the European Union, in its way, expresses a pan-European national ambition to play a significant role in the world, and it has become the vehicle for channeling German, French, and British ambitions in what Europeans regard as a safe supranational direction. Europeans seek honor and respect, too, but of a postmodern variety. The honor they seek is to occupy the moral high ground in the world, to exercise moral authority, to wield political and economic influence as an antidote to militarism, to be the keeper of the global conscience, and to be recognized and admired by others for playing this role. Islam is not a nation, but many Muslims express a kind of religious nationalism, and the leaders of radical Islam, including al Qaeda, do seek to establish a theocratic nation or confederation of nations that would encompass a wide swath of the Middle East and beyond. Like national movements </span>elsewhere, Islamists have a yearning for respect, including self-respect, and a desire for honor. Their national identity has been molded in defiance against stronger and often oppressive outside powers, and also by memories of ancient superiority over those same powers. China had its &quot;century of humiliation.&quot; Islamists have more than a century of humiliation to look back on, a humiliation of which Israel has become the living symbol, which is partly why even Muslims who are neither radical nor fundamentalist proffer their sympathy and even their support to violent extremists who can turn the tables on the dominant liberal West, and particularly on a dominant America which implanted and still feeds the Israeli cancer in their midst. Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. <span class="underline0">Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power</span><span class="DebateUnderline">, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China</span><span class="underline0"> in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus</span>. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as &quot;No. 1&quot; and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. <span class="underline0">American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying -- its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them</span> less likely, or it could simply make them <span class="underline0">morecatastrophic</span>. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance<span class="DebateUnderline">, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters.</span><span class="underline0"> They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways</span><span class="DebateUnderline">. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such</span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> order as exists in the world rests </span>not merely on the goodwill of peoples but<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> on a foundation provided by American power. </span>Even</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe 's stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world 's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between<span class="DebateUnderline"> Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers,</span><span class="underline0"> including the United States.</span></span><span style="mso-bookmark: _Toc307613437;"><span class="underline0"> Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region</span><span class="DebateUnderline">.</span> That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. <span class="underline0">In Europe, too,</span> <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">the departure of the United States from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- could be destabilizing</span>.</span><span class="underline0"> It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery.</span> Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe,<span class="underline0">history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United Stateswithdrew from Europe -- if it adopted what some call a strategy of &quot;offshore balancing&quot; -- this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in</span> under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position <span class="underline0">in the Middle East</span> and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role would lead to greater stability there. <span class="underline0">The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. N</span>or would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened.<span class="cardChar"> That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation</span><span class="underline0">.</span> In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn 't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change.<span class="DebateUnderline">The alternative to American predominance</span><span class="underline0"> in the region is not balance and peace. </span><span class="DebateUnderline">It is further competition</span><span class="underline0">.</span> The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. <span class="DebateUnderline">The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.</span></span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: -40px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: -25px; width: 1px;"> There is reasonable historic support for the notion that <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">the most peaceful and prosperous periods in</span> modern<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> history coincide with </span>the appearance of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a strong</span>, liberal<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> hegemon. </span>America has been essentially unchallenged in its naval dominance over the last 60 years, and in global air supremacy for the last 15 or more.</span> Today, there is more international commerce on the oceans and in the air than ever. Ships and aircraft of all nations worry more about running into bad weather than about being commandeered by a military vessel or set upon by pirates. Search and rescue is a far more common task than forced embargo, and the transfer of humanitarian aid is a regular mission. Lest one think this era of cooperation is predicated on intentions rather than military stability, recall that the policy of open skies advocated by every president since Eisenhower did not take effect until after the fall of the Soviet Union and the singular rise of American power to the fore of international politics. The <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">legacy of American military domination</span> of the sea and air<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> has been positive, and the same should be expected for space.</span></span> <span class="DebateUnderline">To be sure</span><span class="DebateUnderline">, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">America will maintain the capacity to influence decisions and events beyond its borders</span>, with military force if necessary.

This force would be precise, unstoppable and deadly</span>. At the same time, the United States would forgo some of its ability to intervene directly in other states because the necessary budget tradeoffs would diminish its capacity to do so. Space weapons offer no advantage if the opponent is not dispersed broadly around the globe. Against massed and regionally concentrated forces, conventional weaponry is far more efficient. As such, transformation of the American military assures that the intentions of current and future leaders will have but a minor role to play in international affairs. <span class="DebateUnderline">The need to limit collateral damage, the requirement for precision to allay the low volume of fire, and the tremendous cost of space weapons will guarantee they are used only for high-value, time-sensitive targets.</span> An opposing state's calculation of survival no longer would depend on interpreting whether or not the United States desires to be a good neighbor. <span class="DebateUnderline">Without sovereignty at risk, fear of a space-dominant American military will subside.</span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> The United States will maintain its position of hegemony as well as its security, and the world will not be threatened by the specter of a future American empire.</span></span></span><br />

No obstacles can stop Iran's nuclear work.&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> As sanctions mount, ordinary Iranians are suffering from the effects of soaring prices and a collapsing currency. Several Iranian nuclear scientists have been killed over the past two years in bomb attacks that Tehran has blamed on its arch-adversary Israel. In response, Iran has issued a series of statements asserting its right to self-defense and threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil tanker route. The collapse of the nuclear talks came as Iran seems increasingly isolated, with some experts seeing the Islamic republic's mounting defiance in response to sanctions against its oil industry and financial institutions as evidence that it is in no mood to compromise with the West. Elections on March 2 are expected to be won by supporters of Khamenei, an implacable enemy of the West. The failure of the two-day visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency could now hamper any resumption of wider nuclear negotiations between Iran and six world powers as the sense grows that Tehran feels it is being backed into a corner. In the view of some analysts, the Iranians may be trying to keep their opponents guessing as to their capabilities, a diplomatic strategy that has served them well in the past. &quot;But they may be overdoing the smoke and mirrors and as a result leaving themselves more vulnerable,&quot; said professor Rosemary Hollis of London's City University. A team from the IAEA had hoped to inspect a site at Parchin, southeast of Tehran, where the agency believes there is a facility to test explosives. &quot;</span><span class="UnderlineChar">During both the first and second round of discussions, the agency team requested access to the military site at Parchin. Iran did not grant permission for this visit to take place</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">,&quot; the Vienna-based IAEA said in a statement. &quot;It is disappointing that Iran did not accept our request to visit Parchin. We engaged in a constructive spirit, but no agreement was reached,&quot; said IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano. A Western official added: &quot;We think that if Iran has nothing to hide why do they behave in that way?&quot; &quot;It is another missed opportunity,&quot; French Deputy Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said. &quot;This refusal to cooperate adds to the recent statements made by Iranian officials welcoming the progress of their nuclear activities.&quot; Iranian analyst Mohammad Marandi said providing the West with any more access than necessary to nuclear sites would be a sign of weakness. &quot;Under the current conditions it is not in Iran's interest to cooperate more than is necessary because the West is waging a war against the Iranian nation,&quot; he told Reuters. Earlier, Iran's envoy to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said Tehran expected to hold more talks with the U.N. agency, but Amano's spokeswoman said no further meetings were planned. Iran rejects accusations that its nuclear programme is a covert bid to develop a nuclear weapons capability, saying it is seeking to produce only electricity. But its refusal to curb sensitive atomic activities which can have both civilian and military purposes, and its record of years of nuclear secrecy has drawn increasingly tough U.N. and separate U.S. and European measures. The United States and Israel have not ruled out using force against Iran if they conclude that diplomacy and sanctions will not stop it from developing a nuclear bomb. &quot;This was only to be expected, given Iran's evasions,&quot; a senior Israeli official said. The failure of the IAEA's mission may increase the chances of a strike by Israel on Iran, some analysts believe. But this would be &quot;catastrophic for the region and for the whole system of international relations,&quot; Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said. STILL TIME FOR DIPLOMACY? An IAEA report in November suggested </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: lime;">Iran had pursued military nuclear technology and helped precipitate the latest sanctions by the European Union and United States</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: lime;">One key finding was information that Iran had built a large containment chamber at Parchin to conduct high-explosives tests.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">The U.N. agency said there were &quot;strong indicators of possible weapon development&quot;. The IAEA said intensive efforts had been made to reach agreement on a document &quot;facilitating the clarification of unresolved issues&quot; in connection with Iran's nuclear programme. &quot;Unfortunately, agreement was not reached on this document,&quot; it said in an unusually blunt statement on Wednesday. The IAEA mission's failure may reduce the chance of any resumption of wider nuclear negotiations between Iran and the six world powers - the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. The West last week expressed some optimism at the prospect of new talks, particularly after Iran sent a letter to EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton promising to bring &quot;new initiatives&quot;, without stating preconditions. But the United States and its allies may be reluctant if they feel that the Islamic state is unlikely to engage in substantive discussions about its nuclear activities.</span></span><br />

Key ally Russia gave the Islamic Republic a major boost, rejecting tighter sanctions despite a U.N. watchdog report detailing suspected arms-related advances. Israel called on the world to stop Iran's nuclear program in response to the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency's report. The Israeli statement did not refer to the option of a military attack despite recent signals that would be a possibility. In his first reaction to the report, Ahmadinejad strongly criticized the agency -- a day after it claimed Tehran was on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon -- saying the IAEA is discrediting itself by siding with &quot;absurd&quot; U.S. accusations. The comments, broadcast live on state TV, were a sharp rebuke to Western warnings that <span class="Underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;">Iran appears to be engaged in a dangerous defiance of international demands to control the Islamic Republic's nuclear ambitions</span></span>. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the IAEA report confirmed long-standing claims by Israel and Western countries that </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Iran is developing nuclear bombs</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. &quot;The significance of the report is </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">that </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">the international community must bring about the cessation of Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, which endanger the peace of the world and of the Middle East</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">,&quot; the statement said. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Israel sees Iran as an existential threat, citing the nuclear program,</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Ahmadinejad's calls for Israel's destruction and Iran's support for Arab militant groups. Israeli officials are hopeful the international community will pass tough new sanctions that cripple Iran's key energy sector or target its central bank, which would hinder its ability to conduct international trade. In an interview with Israel Radio on Tuesday, ahead of the report's release, Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that without effective sanctions, Israel would not take any option &quot;off the table,&quot; a reference to possible military action. In Paris, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said France would support boosting sanctions against Tehran to an &quot;unprecedented scale&quot; if Iran stonewalls investigations, even as Israel and others say that military options are still possible</span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. &quot;We cannot accept this situation</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (of a nuclear-armed Iran), </span><span style="mso-bookmark: _Toc307613437;"><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">which would be a threat to stability and peace of the region and beyond,</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; he said on France's RFI radio. </span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: -40px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: -25px; width: 1px;"> <span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">The Middle East conflict is unparalleled in terms of its potential for spreading globally</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. During the Cold War, amid which the Arab-Israeli conflict evolved, the two opposing superpowers directly supported the conflicting parties: the Soviet Union supported Arab countries, while the United States supported Israel. On the one hand, the bipolar world order which existed at that time objectively played in favor of the escalation of the Middle East conflict into a global confrontation. On the other hand, the Soviet Union and the United States were not interested in such developments and they managed to keep the situation under control. The behavior of both superpowers in the course of all the wars in the Middle East proves that. In 1956, during the Anglo-French-Israeli military invasion of Egypt (which followed Cairo’s decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company) the United States – contrary to the widespread belief in various countries, including Russia – not only refrained from supporting its allies but insistently pressed – along with the Soviet Union – for the cessation of the armed action. Washington feared that the tripartite aggression would undermine the positions of the West in the Arab world and would result in a direct clash with the Soviet Union. Fears that hostilities in the Middle East might acquire a global dimension could materialize also during the Six-Day War of 1967. On its eve, Moscow and Washington urged each other to cool down their “clients.” When the war began, both superpowers assured each other that they did not intend to get involved in the crisis militarily and that that they would make efforts at the United Nations to negotiate terms for a ceasefire. On July 5, the Chairman of the Soviet Government, Alexei Kosygin, who was authorized by the Politburo to conduct negotiations on behalf of the Soviet leadership, for the first time ever used a hot line for this purpose. After the USS Liberty was attacked by Israeli forces, which later claimed the attack was a case of mistaken identity, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson immediately notified Kosygin that the movement of the U.S. Navy in the Mediterranean Sea was only intended to help the crew of the attacked ship and to investigate the incident. The situation repeated itself during the hostilities of October 1973. Russian publications of those years argued that it was the Soviet Union that prevented U.S. military involvement in those events. In contrast, many U.S. authors claimed that a U.S. reaction thwarted Soviet plans to send troops to the Middle East. Neither statement is true. The atmosphere was really quite tense. Sentiments both in Washington and Moscow were in favor of interference, yet both capitals were far from taking real action. When U.S. troops were put on high alert, Henry Kissinger assured Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that this was done largely for domestic considerations and should not be seen by Moscow as a hostile act. In a private conversation with Dobrynin, President Richard Nixon said the same, adding that he might have overre-acted but that this had been done amidst a hostile campaign against him over Watergate. Meanwhile, Kosygin and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko at a Politburo meeting in Moscow strongly rejected a proposal by Defense Minister Marshal Andrei Grechko to “demonstrate” Soviet military presence in Egypt in response to Israel’s refusal to comply with a UN Security Council resolution. Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev took the side of Kosygin and Gromyko, saying that he was against any Soviet involvement in the conflict. The above suggests an unequivocal conclusion that control by the superpowers in the bipolar world did not allow the Middle East conflict to escalate into a global confrontation. After the end of the Cold War, some scholars and political observers concluded that a real threat of the Arab-Israeli conflict going beyond regional frameworks ceased to exist. However, in the 21st century this conclusion no longer conforms to the reality.</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> The U.S. military operation in Iraq has changed the balance of forces in the Middle East. The disappearance of the Iraqi counterbalance has brought Iran to the fore as a regional power claiming a direct role in various Middle East processes</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. I do not belong to those who believe that the Iranian leadership has already made a political decision to create nuclear weapons of its own. Yet Tehran seems to have set itself the goal of achieving a technological level that would let it make such a decision (the “Japanese model”) under unfavorable circumstances</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. Israel already possesses nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles. </span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">In such circumstances,</span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> the absence of a Middle East settlement opens a dangerous prospect of a nuclear collision in the region, which would have catastrophic consequences for the whole world. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">The transition to a multipolar world has objectively strengthened the role of states and organizations that are directly involved in regional conflicts, which increases the latter’s danger and reduces the possibility of controlling them. This refers, above all, to the Middle East conflict. The coming of Barack Obama to the presidency has allayed fears that the United States could deliver a preventive strike against Iran (under George W. Bush, it was one of the most discussed topics in the United States). However, </span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">fears have increased that such a strike can be launched by Israel, which would have unpredictable consequences for the region and beyond.<span class="Underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;"> It seems that President Obama’s position does not completely rule out such a possibility.</span></span></span></span><br />

It was a miscalculation in 1979 when a microchip malfunctioned at the North American Aerospace Defense Command and initiated the hectic preparations to return fire in response to a perceived Soviet threat. And if the accidental flight of a nuclear weapon equivalent in strength to ten of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima over the United States in 2007 did not cause madness, maybe people would consider the launching of a missile northward to study the northern lights, misinterpreted by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation as an attack on Moscow, madness. Whatever misfires you consider to fit the three categories described by JFK, it’s obvious that <span class="Underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;">we can’t afford miscalculations, accidents, and mistakes when dealing with arms capable of</span></span> accidentally <span class="Underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;">wiping out</span></span> American <span class="Underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;">cities.</span></span> If you’re not terrified by the statistics of military error (and trust me<span class="Underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;">, there are plenty more close encounters to be found,)</span></span> you should be in awe of the fact that world leaders will spend $1 trillion in the next ten years on nuclear weapons. There’s no better time than now to remind congress of the facts concerning what we spend on these vehicles of destruction — the United States has, according to the Brookings Institution, spent at least $8.15 trillion on nuclear weapons since their inception if accounting for inflation. $52 billion was spent on the nuclear program in 2008 according to The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and yet it seems the major concern of many congressmen is to do away with The Affordable Healthcare Act, things like clean energy, public safety, and most worryingly to myself as a student, educational funding. I truly believe that many Americans simply aren’t capable of comprehending the shortfalls in our budget. And the most frustrating part, for me, is that we make cuts of a few billion, rejoice, and pretend that trillions of dollars in cuts shouldn’t be made. “Hands off of the Department of Defense and Social Security” is something we frequently hear from politicians on both sides of the isle but, in all reality, that’s where an unreasonable amount of our money is being spent.

In this sense it can become a deterrent and thus contribute to stability. Arguably, there is some evidence of this likelihood, in that at least some of the reasons for the Soviet Union’s collapse was due to an inability to keep up with U.S. technological developments in this field. Even as the USSR was scaling itself down, it was engaging in ways to share missile defense technology and use – an effort that was discontinued by the U.S. government after 1993.10 </span></span><br />

The key to unlocking this challenge lies in finding and exploiting the best possible BMD basing medium</span>. What is needed is a system that can somehow be or get close enough to engage a boosting missile launched from any location anywhere in the world that threatens the U. S. or its interests, and can cover any potential launch site on the earth's surface, regardless of its nature, land or sea. Such a system must also defend against submarine-launched Ballistic Missiles full, as much as ICBMs. Such a system must somehow also comply with international treaties, to legally surmount issues ofborders or sovereignty. <span class="Underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;">It should</span></span> further <span class="Underline">be capable of</span> the following: <span class="Underline">achieving as high</span> a maximum <span class="Underline">speed as possible, to reach its targets as quickly as</span> physically <span class="Underline">possible</span>, enough to enable repeated attempts; afford the greatest possible ranges and probabilities of success; and, be 'on duty' at all times, and positioned or within range to engage boosting missiles (especially ICBMs) anywhere on earth, with as few deployed weapons as necessary. Obviously, <span class="Underline">there is no way to cover the entire Earth with ship-based, landbased, nor even air-based limited-range boost-phase interceptor missiles; that would require thousands of weapons, far too expensive a proposition even for the U.S</span>. This is not to say that the current generation of ground-based boost-phase BMD systems, such as KEI and ALTB are unneeded. Quite the contrary, they are vital answers as part of the layered defenses against the near to mid-term threats of rogue states with short-range, medium-range, and intermediate range ballistic missiles, with coastlines and internal territories small enough to be covered with these weapons, from one direction or another. In the longer term, they would still provide the ability to reinforce the defenses, in and around vital areas, such as major cities and military bases. However, it is for the longer term future, in which missile, especially ICBM <span class="Underline">threats, are foreseen to be growing worldwide, that an answer must be found that can defend against all such threats. There is a solution, which can only be</span> fully provided, and fully <span class="Underline">covered, from space</span><u><span style="text-underline: thick;">. </span></u>Advantages of space-based weapons for missile-defense. Space-based weapons, for missile defense, have many critical advantages over terrestrial-based systems. The first and foremost of these is the old real-estate adage, 'location, location, location.' Objects in orbit circle the globe in as little as 90 minutes. According to James G. Lee, with the U.S. Air Force Air University, speeds are typically as much as 4.5 miles per second in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), granting them as much initial velocity (more, with booster motors) as is technologically possible, while still being located near the Earth. From LEO, they have as little distance as possible to reach a boosting BM, while still being in orbit proper. In fact, Lowell Wood described in &quot;Ballistic Missile Defense in an Ideal World,&quot; they would most likely follow a downward path from their orbital altitude to effect an interception of a boost-phase missile, giving them maximum advantage in an intercept flight. Inali, Space-Based Ballistic Missile Defense weapons have an immense advantage of speed over their ballistic missile adversaries, since they are already going faster than their targets ever will, i.e., at orbital velocity, and will add even more speed (i.e., more mi/sec.) in the process of boosting and descending to intercept their targets. Second, <span class="Underline">under international law, space-based systems are legally entitled to overfly any place on Earth</span> at any time they do so. In addition, Lee showed, objects in orbit overfly the same points and areas on Earth many times a day, every day, for spans of years or more. Even if international law prohibited space overflights, the complexity and cost of stopping objects in space would limit the possibilities of doing so to a very few states (at least at present.) Third, objects in space have the advantage of height, always a critical advantage in warfighting, and one that gives the added advantages of line of sight (range), descent, speed, and range, especially with respect to a boosting ballistic missile target as it struggles up out of its ocean of air, up out of Earth's gravity well, from far below. Space-based objects also have the advantage of persistence, since they lose speed and altitude only very marginally, enabling them to remain in orbit for years. Such devices are also necessarily automated. Thus, all of these aspects enable space-based missile defenses to remain active, in service, and always 'on duty' for several years straight. Fourth, and arguably the greatest single advantage of SB-BMD weapons, is their inherent force-multiplier effect. As Gregory Canavan observed in his article, &quot;Estimates of Cost and Performance for Boost-Phase Intercept,&quot; <span class="Underline">any single space-based weapon can replace hundreds or even thousands of ground-based weapons to cover the same territory.</span> This is because an object in space will sweep over the entire globe, covering a swath of ground, and air, for thousands miles on either side of its flight-path. This same effect holds true for space-based weapons when compared sea-based forces, though the latter's greater mobility and of movement reduces the advantages somewhat. However, like land-based counterparts, sea-based weapons must also climb out the earth's gravity -well and atmosphere, with zero initial and altitude, the same constrictions that apply to all surface-launched systems. Finally, <span class="Underline">SB-BMD weapons would be placed in orbiting 'bands' of interceptors in approximately the same orbits, providing both continuous coverage of target regions, and affording multiple opportunities to intercept any given ballistic missile throughout its flight</span>, although this depends upon the interceptor's boost capabilities. Further interception opportunities are available in the missile's midcourse and even terminal phases as much as the boost-phase, according to Pfaltzgraff's and Van Cleave's 2009 report, &quot;Independent Working Group on Missile Defense, the Space Relationship, and the Twenty -First Century.&quot; </span><br />

During the Cold War, the United States adopted a strategic doctrine called MAD: Mutually Assured Destruction. The logic behind it was both perverse and compelling: So long as we were vulnerable to missile attack by the Soviets, and so long as the Soviets were vulnerable to missile attack by us, neither side would benefit by attacking first — on the contrary, a devastating retaliation would be assured. Assuming that both we and the Soviets were rational, the result would be a standoff, stability, and peaceful coexistence. Veterans of the Cold War, still influential in the foreign-policy establishment and the Obama administration, believe that if this kind of deterrence worked then, it can work now. The current occupants of the Kremlin go farther. They claim it is destabilizing and provocative for Americans and Europeans to attempt to protect themselves from the possibility of an Iranian or North Korean missile attack by building a missile-defense system that may one day be robust enough also to thwart a Russian missile attack. “If NATO wants to reduce tension with Russia,” Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s ambassador to the Atlantic alliance recently said, “it should cancel the missile-defense project. We have always criticized these plans as deeply anti-Russian.” </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Missile-defense advocates</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> — I list myself among them — </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">counter that MAD is an idea whose time has come and gone</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. The regime that </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">rules Iran appears to view nuclear weapons and missile development as its highest priority</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, worth the pain being inflicted by a growing catalogue of international sanctions. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">It proclaims that “a world without America . . . is attainable</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">.” <span class="Underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;">More than a few of</span></span></span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Iran’s rulers hold the </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">theological</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> conviction that </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">the return of the Mahdi</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, the savior, can be brought about only by an apocalypse</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. As scholar Bernard Lewis has aptly phrased it, for those who share the views of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">“Mutually assured destruction is not a deterrent. It is an inducement.”</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> As for the authoritarian regime that rules Russia, it is not America’s enemy, but neither is it likely to become an ally anytime soon — no matter how hard the Obama administration tries to “reset” relations. What’s more, the Kremlin has been actively assisting Iran. Two years ago, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the U.S. should create a missile-defense “umbrella” that would protect not only American citizens at home and American forces abroad but also America’s allies. But such a project is not in development. And some say, given the state of the economy, we can’t afford it now. Three reasons I disagree: (1) If just one American city should be hit by just one missile, the cost — not merely in dollars — will be far greater than that of any missile-defense system being contemplated. And it would require only a single enemy missile to stage an Electromagnetic Pulse Attack, which could cripple the United States for years. (2) </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Deploying a comprehensive missile-defense system would dramatically alter the strategic environment. The rationale for building nuclear-armed ballistic missiles for offensive purposes disappears if it is clear the U.S. has both the will and a way to prevent those weapons from reaching their targets.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> At the moment, the incentives are reversed: Moammar Qaddafi gives up his nuclear weapons, and NATO tries to kill him. The North Koreans refuse to give up their nuclear weapons, and we leave them alone no matter what they do. (3) The cost need not be exorbitant. Our missile-defense architecture is made up of various systems — some can be cut. One example: Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) is a joint venture undertaken by the United States, Italy, and Germany. It’s now a decade behind schedule and more than a billion dollars over budget, with Americans on the hook to pick up at least half the total cost of $25 billion. The Pentagon recently concluded that MEADS “will not meet U.S. requirements or address the current and emerging threat without extensive and costly modifications.” The Germans and the Italians no longer see MEADS as a good value either. Yet MEADS continues to receive funding. Why? One argument is that the U.S. has contractually agreed to “termination costs.” But surely President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and their crackerjack diplomats ought to be able to persuade the Germans and Italians to waive or at least reduce those. And even if they can’t manage that, continuing project spending would end up being more costly. MEADS proponents also argue that we can “harvest” useful technology from the program whether or not a final product is developed. But by putting the funds to other uses — for example, modernizing the PATRIOT missile-defense system, which is used by eleven U.S. allies who pay 60 percent of the cost to sustain it — we can reap new technology while also developing a renewed, improved, and readily deployable system. </span></span>
