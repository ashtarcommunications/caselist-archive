**Contention One: Never Again**

**After many consequences of hurricanes, and disastrous threats New Orleans still lacks mass transit evacuation plans. The carless will be trapped again. ====**

**The objective of this study is to research how state departments of transportation (state**

**Thus the plan: Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation should increase its investment in evacuation transportation infrastructure in New Orleans. ====**

**Contention Two: The Carless**

==Taking It Back- Heritage Hall== 
**1AC**

**When presented with this topic we need to take it back a little bit- Let’s rewind and view history- From the first State transportation policy, the shipping of the slave to the Americas, to Homers Plessy’s "separate but equal", and most recently the "white flight" of suburbanization, the condition of possibility for freedom and mobility associated with transportation is the subjugation of raced bodies. The colored body is the spine of transportation, the backbone of the ship- Basically to speak of transportation is to speak of race.**

**Three major kinds of infrastructure in the United States contribute to the separation of races**
**AND**
**, poor inner city schools, continuing job discrimination, and regressive taxes.**


**This discrimination is no coincidence – it is part of a biopolitical transportation system designed to shield whites from having to interact with minority populations. This is a modern day system of clean apartheid, cleansed of the excessive violence and reduced to its purest form of segregation.**

**How did the Census explain the increase in population that was taking place?**

**You have an apriori academic and ethical obligation to historically interrogate whiteness – it poisons all social relations, solidifying a permanent system of oppression and rendering problems increasingly invisible to political analysis.**
