__Note from Bill Batterman__: The archived wikis from the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 season were taken down by our hosting provider in March 2011. They were restored to a mediawiki installation on The3NR.com but a hack has made them no longer available. You can download the raw wiki data from [[http://www.debatecoaches.org/wikidb.zip|debatecoaches.org]], but this is not particularly useful. If anyone wants to post that data somewhere, please contact an administrator and we will share the link.
