We excerpt the critical passages from Mazzetti’s article below: “</span>__The top American commander in the Middle East has ordered a broad expansion of clandestine military activity in an effort to disrupt militant groups or counter threats in Iran__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and other countries in the region, according to defense officials and military documents. </span>__The secret directive__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, signed in September by Gen. David H. Petraeus, authorizes the sending of American Special Operations troops to both friendly and hostile nations in the Middle East, Central Asia and the Horn of Africa to gather intelligence and build ties with local forces. Officials said the order </span>__also permits reconnaissance that could pave the way for possible military strikes in Iran if tensions over its nuclear ambitions escalate__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.” We would note that Mazzetti has actually seen the directive—the “Joint Unconventional Warfare Task Force Execute Order”—signed by General Petraeus on September 30, 2009, and has talked directly with several government officials who are familiar with the directive and how it is being implemented. Furthermore, in response to concerns about troop safety raised by CENTCOM, Mazzetti “withheld some details about how troops could be deployed in certain countries”. The very fact that CENTCOM raised such concerns provides powerful confirmation for Mazetti’s reporting. His article continues: “</span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__While the Bush administration had approved some clandestine military activities__</span>** __far from designated war zones, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">the new order is intended to make </span>such efforts <span style="background: yellow;">more systematic and long term</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, officials said. Its goals are to build networks that could “penetrate, disrupt, defeat or destroy” Al Qaeda and other military groups, as well as to “prepare the environment” for future attacks by American and local military forces, the document said… </span>__The seven-page directive appears **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">to authorize <span style="background: yellow;">specific operations in Iran</span></span>**, most likely to gather intelligence about the country’s nuclear program or identify dissident groups that might be useful for a future military offensive__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Obama administration insists that for the moment it is committed to penalizing Iran for its nuclear activities only with diplomatic and economic sanctions. Nevertheless, the Pentagon has to draw up detailed war plans to be prepared in advance, in the event that President Obama ever authorizes a strike.” Mazzetti’s article also provides important insights into the rationale for conducting these operations through the military rather than through CIA: “During the Bush administration, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld endorsed clandestine military operations, arguing that Special Operations troops could be as effective as traditional spies, if not more so. </span>__Unlike covert operations undertaken by the C.I.A., such clandestine activity does not require the president’s approval or regular reports to Congress__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, although Pentagon officials have said that any significant ventures are cleared through the National Security Council. Special Operations troops have already been sent into a number of countries to carry out reconnaissance missions, including operations to gather intelligence about airstrips and bridges.” </span>__Mazzetti’s article clearly raises urgent and disturbing questions about the direction of America’s Iran policy under President Obama. It also provides important context for Iranian actions which are routinely derided in the American media as either paranoid or gratuitously vicious__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">—e.g., the ongoing detention of three American hikers who illegally entered Iran last year, or the detention of the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Haleh Esfandiari in 2007. Mazzetti writes that “General Petraeus’s September order is focused on intelligence gathering—by American troops, foreign businesspeople, academics or others—to identify militants and provide ‘persistent situational awareness,’ while forging ties to local indigenous groups.” If that is American policy, exactly how should Iran deal with three Americans who entered the Islamic Republic, without visas, by crossing the Iraqi-Iranian border in an area with no immigration checkpoints? If what Mazzetti reports is American policy, why is every American academic who visits Iran not a legitimate subject of concern for Iranian security agencies? We have known Haleh Esfandiari and her husband, Shaul Bakhash, for many years. We do not believe that she is a security threat to anyone. But the Bush Administration’s overt efforts to destabilize the Islamic Republic in the name of “democracy promotion”, as well as its anti-Iranian covert campaign, put Haleh in a position in which no innocent American should be placed by his or her government. </span>__The Obama Administration’s policies will only exacerbate the risks__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> to Americans—especially those of Iranian origin—who travel to Iran. In our criticism of President Obama’s early decision to continue the anti-Iranian covert programs he inherited from his predecessor, we compared his lack of strategic vision to the statesmanship of President Richard Nixon—who, on coming to the White House in 1969, ordered the CIA to stand down from a longstanding covert action program in Tibet, to show Beijing that he was serious about rapprochement with the People’s Republic of China. As we predicted early on, Obama is, unfortunately, headed in exactly the opposite direction. </span>__President **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Obama’s policies</span>** are not only generating risks for innocent, non-official Americans. They **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">are <span style="background: yellow;">further eroding the </span>already <span style="background: yellow;">deteriorating prospects for an improvement in U.S.-Iranian relations—and increasing the chances of</span> an eventual U.S.-Iranian <span style="background: yellow;">military confrontation</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span> </span></span>

This report draws on my long experience of forecasting crisis scenarios and running military war games that examine the use of force in the Middle East__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It draws on the extensive coverage of telltale incidents in the Iranian press and occasionally even in the U.S. media. It also is an update of my previous work.1 Two years ago, I wrote about the pressures that were moving the United States toward the military option against Iran. In that report, I examined rational policy choices and the potential efficacy and limitations of military action. The situation has changed. This report will describe how the United States policy has evolved over the past two years, moving more and more toward covert operations as policymakers have come to see the costs of “preventive” military attack as prohibitive. The report will consider Israel’s role as strategic rival to Iran in the region, and it will assess the ways the Iranians have reacted to what they believe the United States and Israel have done. The consequences of the action and reaction have produced the current delicate situation. The report will describe that situation and conclude with recommendations to reduce the danger of an unintended escalation of violence. The situation has become very fragile, and may well take on a life of its own. The situation is likely to become more delicate and more explosive in the final months of the Bush administration and in the early months of a new U.S. administration. The Military Option The military option is on the table, as the president has repeatedly underscored. We have heard talk of a military strike for the past two years. Nothing happened. Why not? Part of the answer has appeared in the press. The first firebreak to the strike option, as military planners inside the Pentagon pushed back, came in the spring of 2006. The White House made a great deal of what was to be the “summer of diplomacy.” Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced that if Iran suspended enrichment, the United States would open dialogue. The summer ended with no suspension of enrichment and no diplomatic engagement. Pressures to keep to the diplomacy path and eschew violence have come from a number of directions. Internationally, the Russians and, ever more vocally, the Europeans have been quite open about opposing the military option. Inside the administration, Robert Gates, the secretary of defense who replaced Donald Rumsfeld after the 2006 congressional elections, and Admiral Michael Mullen, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, have made public statements against using military force. House and Senate members have pressed legislation that would prohibit the use of military force against Iran without congressional approval. In addition, grassroots networks of the peace movement have organized themselves to give voice to opposition to the military option, to seemingly greater effect than when Capitol Hill ignored their warnings on Iraq in 2002. The second reason for delay in the strike option seems to have been to give covert operations a chance to work. For those alert to clues in press reports, this seems to have involved covert operations inside Iran as well as the funding of groups to take on Hezbollah, Iran’s presumed proxy in Lebanon. Finally, senior officials inside the administration, as well as many in Congress and most leading allies in Europe, insisted that sanctions had to be given a chance. It took protracted negotiations to get approval of sanctions by the U.N. Security Council, but now the administration has the third successively tightened sanctions package from the United Nations. Have we achieved anything with Iran over the past four years? One can imagine this is the exact question that Vice President Dick Cheney asks. He listened to the arguments about diplomacy and sanctions. From the beginning he was skeptical of these alternatives. Perhaps he was right. Iran has openly continued enriching. From recent reports, Iran may have installed more sophisticated centrifuges at the Natanz facility. And beyond the nuclear issue, Iran continues to support Hezbollah. Iran continues to send arms into Iraq, and may be increasing arms shipments to the Taliban in Afghanistan.2 The United States Pushing Iran The president has said many times that the war on terror is being carried out on fronts known to the American people—and on fronts unknown to the American people. There are increasing signs that one of those fronts is now Iran. Intelligence operations inside Iran by Americans, even involving U.S. troops, probably began in 2004, while moderate Mohammad Khatami was still Iran’s president. Some reports appeared in the Western press about elements of the operations, as did reports in the Iranian media. According to reports, U.S. and Israeli troops were planting sensors. In early 2005, the United States began flying Predator drones into Iran, again according to both Western and Iranian sources. The support for proxy groups appears to have begun in mid-2005. The first group to which the United States funneled training and money was the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), the Iranian opposition group on the State Department’s list of terrorists groups. The day-to-day dealings with the MEK during this period may have been handled through a contractor. Early operations inside Iran were done without a governing presidential finding, a formal authorization for covert operations. The secretary of defense assumed the activities were within the authorizations that existed to conduct military operations.3 The specific objective of the United States to destabilize the government of Iran was reported by ABC News nineteen months ago. According to that report, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) plan was approved for action with a non-lethal presidential finding. Again, according to ABC News, which the White House did not explicitly deny, the plan included “a coordinated campaign for propaganda, disinformation and manipulation of Iran’s currency and international financial transactions.”4 The Iranians describe these activities as the use of soft power against them. They say the United States is seeking to deny them the tools they need to govern. </span>__The **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">covert</span></span>** and clandestine **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">operations were significantly escalated</span></span>** in late 2007 or early 2008__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

The MEK has been doing work for the United States for at least three years. Intelligence seems to be the most important product of their efforts. The individuals in the political, nonterrorist wing of the group wear expensive suits and give press conferences.8 More direct combat operations are coming from The Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PJAK). This well-uniformed, high-publicity group operates out of the Kurdish area of northern Iraq. It is equipped with Russian arms, as is standard for U.S.-backed proxy groups throughout the world. The Los Angeles Times quotes a Kurd as saying that every two or three months, U.S. military vehicles can be seen entering the PJAK strongholds. If the Kurdish group’s Web site and Iranian reports are to be believed, PJAK are heavily engaged inside Iran, and take casualties.9 The next group, known as Jundullah, is particularly scruffy looking and seems to bungle operations frequently. It operates out of Afghanistan and the Baluchistan province of Pakistan and seems to take particular care to leave behind videos of its operations.10 A Pakistani official told ABC News that the group had hundreds of men for unspecified missions across the border in Iran.11 The leader of Jundullah has announced with pride that the group has the capability and will to take operations to Tehran.12 Finally, a new group recently has surfaced, the Ahwazi Arabs of southwest Iran.13 Although this group has been identified as being a component of U.S. covert operations, not as much is known about it. The group has made claims of operations, and Iran has reported incidents consistent with the claims. Evidence of Covert Operations </span>__Tracing covert operations always presents a problem of evidence, which often is circumstantial. The Iranian situation is unusual because many sources are reporting parts of the picture. The groups that the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>__is supporting have their own public relations programs, and reporting raids and clashes is crucial to their efforts to be seen as effective opponents of the Islamic regime. In addition, Iranian press services very often report on clashes when they occur. Many times, claims by a group can be matched with an Iranian report. Although the picture may not be complete, the evidence is strong. The flow of clashes and attacks can be seen to have grown with the escalation of presidential approvals__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Here is some of what has been reported: The Jundullah, one of the identified U.S. proxy groups, claimed credit for killing eleven members of the Revolutionary Guard in February 2007. The official Islamic Republic News Agency also reported the bombing of the bus in which the troops were killed.14 Iranian television reported in May 2007 that authorities captured ten men crossing the border with $500,000 in cash along with maps of sensitive areas and spy equipment. A senior Pakistani official told ABC News that the men were members of the Jundullah organization.15 The Ahwazi Arab group issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility for the assassination of an Iranian cleric, Abbas Abbasian. The killing took place during an attack on a convoy on March 27, 2008, near an Iran/Iraq War battlefield.16 In one of the most significant recent incidents, on April 12, 2008, a cultural center in Shiraz was bombed. Fourteen were killed and over 150 were injured. At first the Iranians said it was an accident. After a few days, they began to mention individuals trained by the United States. They then settled on saying it was a group sponsored by the CIA and that this was the first of what was to be many bombings planned by the group.17 By June, Iran announced that it had evidence that it would present to the world of U.S. sponsorship.18 A previously unknown group claimed credit for the bombing. The group’s statement said it was done in the name of the minorities of Iran. This list included all the minorities being supported by the U.S. program.19 Although it never presented the evidence of U.S. sponsorship that it claimed to have, Iran did make an official protest to the United States through a Swiss intermediary.20 On April 24, 2008 a U.K.-based element of the Ahwazi Arab group reported the killing of a colonel of the 92nd Armored Division of the Revolutionary Guard inside Iran. In its press report, the group said the colonel was “assassinated.”21 In June 2008, nine members of the PJAK were killed in fighting with police in Western Azerbaijan province of Iran. The clash was described in the Iranian press.22 In June 2008, a “terrorist group” was responsible for a blast on the natural gas pipeline through which Iran supplies gas to Turkey. According to the Fars News Agency, the PJAK was responsible. The pipeline has been a source of some tension between the United States and Turkey.23 Iran reported the arrest of eleven individuals “with links to foreigners” who were responsible for an attack on a bus convoy in March 2008. The bus attack was previously unreported by the Iranians but was in the area where the Ahwazi Arab group has been operating.24 In another front of proxy operations, ABC News reported in June 2008 that Pakistan had in custody six members of the Jundullah group. Pakistan was threatening to turn the individuals over to Iran.25 In an unusual press release on June 4, 2008, the PJAK claimed heavy fighting inside Iran. The group said ninety-two Iranian soldiers had been killed between May 25 and June 2. Some of the clashes in the press report:26 May 27 Military base near Kamiyaran attacked—many soldiers killed and wounded. Army units in Alwatan area attacked—seven Revolutionary Guard soldiers killed. Military vehicle in Kirmanshah city attacked—four Revolutionary Guard members killed. Military vehicle destroyed in the village of Zale—thirteen soldiers killed. May 31 Military base close to Shno attacked—thirteen soldiers killed many wounded. June 1 Military base near Saghez attacked—fifteen Revolutionary Guard soldiers killed and two cars destroyed. High-ranking Basij member by the name of Asad killed.27 The Iranian Fars News Agency reported on June 22, 2008, that the “terrorist group” Jundullah was responsible for kidnapping sixteen Iranian policemen near the border with Pakistan.28 Iran’s Press TV reported on July 7, 2008, that Iranian security forces had killed an insurgent and captured another in Tabriz, the East Azerbaijan province in the northeast part of the country. Four others escaped. The broadcast quoted a Revolutionary Guard commander as saying, “They had intruded into Iranian territory to destabilize the situation.”29 The PJAK reported on its Web site that on July 14, 2008, the military station at Geragor was hit. The PJAK say they took control of the station, destroyed the site building, destroyed six military vehicles, and killed sixteen Iranian soldiers.30 On July 18, 2008, the Iranian News Agency reported that two Revolutionary Guard soldiers were killed by the PJAK. A colonel was one of those killed.31 In a major escalation, according to press reports, a major event took place on July 19, 2008. A massive explosion hit a military convoy carrying munitions in the suburbs of Tehran. The ammunition was reported to be bound for Hezbollah.32 The covert programs of the United States involve efforts for propaganda and disinformation and the support of political minorities. Since 2004, the United States has funded an initiative to do the same kind of thing in a more open way—the Iran “Democracy Program.” Over $120 million has been spent on this effort. Most has gone to fund broadcasting efforts, but some seems to have been passed to exile groups that can make connections with opposition groups inside Iran. Steven Hadley, the president’s national security adviser, said the United States would “increase pressure” on Iran in his briefing to the press aboard Air Force One as the president flew to the Middle East in May of this year.33 For some, this recalled the kinds of statements that were made in the summer and early fall of 2002 as the White House began marshalling public and media support for the invasion of Iraq. The White House has a very well established and fairly disciplined strategic communication apparatus. It worked—critics might say “spun”—at its best in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. It has a fairly simple strategy: saturate the media with a strong story line. The result of the White House pressure on the issue of Iran can be traced from that Hadley statement through the warnings and missile firings by Iran in response to escalating Israeli and American threats of attack. Iran is emerging as a national security issue, even if many experts and allies may view it as mostly a manufactured one. Still, public anxieties are stoked at home—and in Iran, tensions build. The Israel Factor “George Bush understands the severity of the Iranian threat and the need to vanquish it, and intends to act on the matter before the end of his term in the White House,” declared Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert after his June meeting with the president in Washington. Clearly, Israel’s security establishment feels it is able to move decision-makers in the United States, and its firm conviction that Islamic Iran is the major remaining threat to Israel in the region heightens the risk of miscalculation in the current situation. Often missed in the discussion of the Iranian threat is the Israeli position that the threshold of serious danger occurs not when Iran has a nuclear weapon, but when Iran has mastered the knowledge of the enrichment cycle. President Bush used to say the United States could not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. He began to adopt the Israeli line of argument almost two years ago. When he is being precise in a warning to Iran, he will say, “We cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon or the knowledge to produce one.” The knowledge threshold significantly changes the situation. It means the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate that Iran had terminated its weapons efforts does not affect either U.S. or Israeli policy. When will Iran master the enrichment cycle? That becomes the driving question for the intelligence communities of both countries. Israel believes Iran will cross this “knowledge red line” sooner than does the United States. The consequence of this shared understanding of a knowledge red line brings U.S. and Israeli timelines together. Although Iran is a long way from a nuclear weapon, the situation is not seen as a problem to worry about some time in the future. It is an immediate problem with immediate political resonance. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee met in Washington in June. Within days of that meeting, over two hundred cosponsors had put their names to a resolution introduced into the House of Representatives that used almost the exact words of the committee in describing the threat from Iran and what should be done about it. The resolution urged the president to lead an international “effort”—without reference to the U.N. Security Council—to prohibit the export to Iran of all refined petroleum products, to prevent Iranian diplomats from leaving the country except for nuclear negotiations, and to impose inspections of all people and cargo leaving from or bound for Iran. Reports of cooperation between the Israeli intelligence services and those of the United States in Iran have been in the press for over four years. Coordination of covert and clandestine operations has to be assumed by the Iranians. The New York Times recently described an Israeli military exercise in early June that “appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.” The piece in the New York Times quoted an American official that the exercise was meant to send a signal to both the United States and Iran that Israel was prepared to carry out a military strike if diplomatic efforts fail.34 Israel’s hard-nosed security establishment has the capacity, it seems, to escalate Washington’s sense of crisis. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has recently taken a less strident public position about striking the Iran nuclear facilities, especially after a meeting at which Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was said unequivocally to have ruled out such an attack by either country. Still, given Israel’s own internal political infighting as Olmert’s government unravels, one should not underestimate its share of responsibility for the volatile situation becoming more dangerous. The Iranian Reactions What is in the minds of the leaders of Iran? It is very difficult to know. We do know they do not understand the United States very well. Few in the highly conservative circles currently running the government have had contact with Americans, and few have even traveled outside the country. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__It is fairly certain the leadership of Iran is of one mind on what the <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__is doing. <span style="background: yellow;">The <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span></span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow; border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">may continue to insist publicly that diplomacy is the preferred path</span> for dealing with Iran, <span style="background: yellow;">but from the perspective of Tehran</span>, the U.S. administration’s <span style="background: yellow;">actions speaker louder than</span> its <span style="background: yellow;">words</span>__</span>**__.

The regime there has been accusing the CIA as well as United Kingdom and Israeli intelligence operatives of many acts inside Iran. The CIA has specifically been fingered as the source of a bombing of a cultural center in April. The Iranian press limited itself to a summary of the Seymour Hersh article on covert operations. Iranian television went farther. According to the Los Angeles Times blog, Iranian television went “bonkers” over the story. The Los Angeles Times said a roundtable discussion on the article was entitled, “Sabotage of the U.S. in Iran and a new wave of psychological warfare.” </span>__For a regime with a relatively controlled press, the question of whether or not to make a big deal out of these kinds of revelations of outside involvement in the country is an important decision__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

On the other hand, </span>__choosing to let the people of Iran know suggests that the leadership is preparing the population for something that might follow. Citing the CIA in Iran is a particularly potent weapon to generate support for the government__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In a step of escalation, Iran has mobilized portions of its volunteer Basij forces in response to apparent U.S. covert operations. Iran announced that beginning on May 23, 2008, the Islamist Basij militia would begin dusk to dawn patrolling of urban areas across the country. According to the report, the patrols are to provide security for “governmental, public and private buildings.”35 In the past, the Basij have dealt with student unrest and even enforced dress codes. What’s significant about this mobilization is that the government has connected it to the claimed CIA bombing of the cultural center in Shiraz. Iranian officials have often parried their enemies’ attacks on them by adroit use of “soft” power. Again, they have responded accordingly. Within the Armed Forces General Headquarters, they have created an organization called the Passive Defense Bureau. According to the order creating the organization, it is to defend the Islamic Republic against the enemies’ moves. The head of the Passive Defense Bureau in an interview described the enemies’ moves as attacks on the ability of the government to govern the nation. He mentioned propaganda, software attacks, and protection of infrastructure as the countermeasures available to Iranians.36 All of the activity has made Iran jittery about protecting its nuclear facilities. On July 4, 2008, the sea patrols that guard the Bushehr nuclear reactor stopped and detained four fishing boats that were in international waters. The boats were from Saudi Arabia and had Indian crews. According to reports in the Indian press, the boats and the seventeen crewmen were fifty kilometers from the reactor.37 </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">Iran is responding</span>__</span>** __in other ways. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Military units have fired artillery into Iraq</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> against the PJAK for quite a while.

In late June 2008, 70,000 people attended a rally outside Paris sponsored by the National Council Resistance for Iran. They were protesting the failure of the European Union to remove from its list of terrorist groups the MEK, one of the groups whose operations inside Iran the United States is supporting. This is not lost on the Iranians. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__The warnings and threatening actions accumulate__</span>**__. It has become almost a daily event for one or more of the three countries to ratchet up the threats. A very significant characteristic of the Iranian threats is that they are not coming from__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the Iranian president, Mahmoud </span>__Ahmadinejad. The Iranians who are making the statements are individuals who are closely associated with__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the Supreme Leader, </span>__Ayatollah__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Ali </span>__Khamenei__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. June 28—Commander of the Revolutionary Guard: if attacked, “one of Iran’s steps will definitely be to exercise control of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.” June 29—Iranian brigadier general: “We will dig 15,000 to 20,000 graves in each of our border provinces” for the burial of enemy soldiers. July 4—Commander of the Revolutionary Guard: if nuclear facilities are attacked, “any action against Iran will be interpreted as the start of a war.” July 8—Iranian Supreme Leader spokesman: “Iran would set fire to Israel and the U.S. Navy if it were attacked.” July 9—Iranian Missile Firings and Commander of the Revolutionary Guard: “have to know that our finger is always on the trigger and we have hundreds even thousands of missiles ready.” July 12—Representative of the Supreme Leader: “before the dust from these attacks settles on the ground, our armed forces will strike the very heart of Israel and 32 U.S. military bases in the region.”39 July 16—Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: “Punishment will be meted out to anyone who dares and try to attack Iran.” Ahmadinejad is known for off-the-wall rhetoric, but except for a general threat on July 13, he has been silent in the flow of threats during this three-week period. What makes these threats unique is that they have been coming from the office of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and from people who work directly for him. Ahmadinejad does not control the Revolutionary Guard, which reports directly to the Supreme Leader; when the Commander of the Revolutionary Guard makes a public statement, it has a heightened importance. The other aspect that is different is that the threats have become more specific than in any previous times I can recall. It is almost as if the Iranians were announcing what they would do rather than just making a threat to show they were serious. We cannot know if the Iranians have thought through consequences of the position they are staking out in the current situation. In the policy realm, it is possible to find yourself forced into doing something to deal with a message you have over-used. Iran has heavily used the message that the United States is working to destabilize the government. At what point do increasingly belligerent U.S.-sponsored “pressures” trigger more forceful Iranian countermeasures? What becomes the Iranian tipping point? If we were in a Supreme National Security Council meeting being chaired by the Supreme Leader, we would probably not get a good answer. But the United States needs to think about the question. When does the regime decide it has been pushed too far? When does it begin to do some of the things it has threatened? What action by the United States warrants Tehran’s restricting the flow of oil from the Gulf? Or, might the Iranians respond more indirectly, through more covert measures in new places? Iran shares responsibility for making the volatile situation more dangerous.

But if financing for covert operations will not bring down the mullahs’ regime, what is it supposed to accomplish? One possibility is to provoke Tehran into escalation. As Seymour Hersh was told, Vice President Cheney is very interested in a casus belli, a reason to move to the next step in the use of force against the Iranians. According to Hersh’s sources, the vice president has even had a brainstorming session on how to start a war with Iran. There is historical precedent for provoking an adversary. The United States has explored that route in politically charged cases that go back over twenty years—in its contra war against Nicaragua in the 1980s, and in scenarios in 2003 that senior officials hoped could create the impression that Iraq had initiated the hostilities. There is another possibility for what U.S. policymakers might intend by the covert operations in the immediate future. Maybe the goal is just to punish the Iranians for bad behavior, to make them understand there is a price to pay for continuing enrichment, for trying to expand their influence in Iraq under the very nose of the large U.S. military deployment, and for supporting terrorist groups around the Middle East. Maybe it is the very simple notion we have to show bad guys the United States is tough. The president and vice president want people to believe they are tough.41 Although sending messages through the use of force has never been very successful as a policy tool, message-sending is a preferred White House objective. Maybe the immediate United States objective is just about sending a message to the Iranians. Maybe we will see the United States use covert operations to attack an important target inside Iran. It is not easy to interpret what is happening within the U.S. government on Iran. The military and now civilian leadership of the Pentagon seem to be fairly strong that a conflict with Iran should be avoided. It would be a mistake to conclude that is a major restraint. Covert operations are not being directed by the Department of Defense. There are likely very few individuals who even know the extent of the effort beyond what they can read in the open press. The State Department is out of the loop. The focus of both covert and clandestine operations seems to be the White House. They are being run and coordinated from there. Finally, looking to the immediate future, there is the political situation. President Bush is not going to escalate the use of force against Iran simply because Senator Barack Obama may be elected to succeed him. On the other hand, the more it appears as if Obama is likely to be elected, the more President Bush may be tempted to respond forcefully to an untoward event and to the options of escalation. Fearful that a liberal-minded successor may not have the resolve to confront and take down a mortal enemy, some political analysts suggest, he might prove more susceptible to upping the ante in a dangerous sequence of events. Dangerous Events </span>__The U.S.-Iranian situation has previously weathered some rather serious events__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian civilian airliner by mistake in 1988. A U.S. Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia was blown up, killing and wounding U.S. military personnel, and the Saudis convinced the FBI that Iran was behind the act.42 </span>__In the current environment, it is difficult to imagine either of these events not leading to some form of retaliation__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The political situation in the three countries compounds the fragility. President Bush has reportedly promised to deal with the Iranian problem before the end of his administration. Prime Minister Olmert, facing serious corruption charges, will have stepped down after a party leadership election in September. The Iranian leadership is facing a presidential election in June 2009 amid rising discontent over the economy and cannot be certain it can completely manage the event.

The scenario is simple. An Iranian scientist walks into a U.S. embassy in the region with the story that he is concerned that what his country is doing may bring about a serious war. He cannot stand to have that on his consciences. The defector describes a secret enrichment facility buried in the mountain in the Natanz area. Iran is much farther along with enrichment than we previously thought. Because of the U.S. and Israeli knowledge red line, the defector does not have to say Iran is close to a weapon to generate action. He just has to tell the intelligence types that Iran is farther along with enrichment. The CIA checks out everything possible about the defector. They cannot find holes. What he is saying is also consistent with some of the information the United States is getting from Israel. I have played this kind of intelligence with former U.S. officials in war games. </span>__Even with the uncertainty and the negative hangover from defectors before the invasion of Iraq, this will stimulate decision-makers. A strike could well be the option selected__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Sanctions that are more than sanctions. About a year ago, proposals for a more substantial level of sanctions against Iran surfaced. The idea was to stop the flow of refined petroleum products going into Iran. It seems more and more as if this option will be considered seriously in the near future. On the surface the notion has an attraction. Gasoline has been a sensitive topic with the population. Iran imports around half of the refined petroleum products it uses. It seems like vulnerability. Pressure the people, and the government will be forced to terminate enrichment and stop support for terrorism. Like many countries, Iran has subsidized gasoline prices for many years. Although there have been some price increases, the regime has felt the people would not tolerate paying anything remotely close to the international market price. This “sanction” would open a window for the government to increase prices while blaming the great Satan.45 Then there is the question of blockade. How would the United States prevent the import of refined products? It would have to be by stopping ships going to Iranian ports. That is a blockade—considered an act of war (absent Security Council authorization), yet it is a feature of the congressional resolution pressed by the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">Major destructive event at an Iranian nuclear facility with U.S. DNA</span>__</span>**__. The targeting of U.S. covert and clandestine operations to this point has been trivial. It might not remain that way__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. If the United States and Israel want to show Iran there is a price to pay for continuing with enrichment, one of the nuclear facilities in Iran might be targeted. As part of the preparations for one of the war games I conducted, I counted over twenty-five separate targets that are part of the Iranian nuclear system. It would be very difficult to covertly target some of these. The facility where the banks of centrifuges are working at Natanz is hardened and well protected. Other facilities are vulnerable to this kind of attack, however. The research facility in Tehran, for example, is not very well protected. It is possible that </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">an attack</span> by a resistance group on an Iranian nuclear facility <span style="background: yellow;">could be a tipping point</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> for the United States. Russian agreement to provide Iran with the S-300 air defense system. Iranian air defense capabilities are not very good. They did get a boost two years ago when Russia delivered a low-altitude missile and radar system. For almost ten years, there have been press reports that Russia would sell its S-300 system to Iran, with high altitude radar and missile capabilities—a deal that was in the works even before the South Ossetia crisis of August 2008 and which Israeli defense sources now believe to have been consummated.46 The S-300 could prove to be a tipping point for the United States and Israel. It would add significant problems to attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities. A dangerous situation would be more dangerous. Reducing the Danger </span>__The January 2008 encounter between U.S. Navy ships and Iranian speedboats should be a warning of how **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">small events between Iran and the <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span></span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow; border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">could escalate into a</span>n unintended <span style="background: yellow;">larger conflict</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Even during the most dangerous periods of the Cold War, the United States agreed to confidence-building measures with the Soviet Union. One of the most important of those was an agreement dealing with incidents at sea. Navy commanders have said such an agreement would make sense with the Iranians given the close quarters in the Persian Gulf. Leading members and key committees of Congress ought to press the administration to work on this kind of agreement with the Iranians, with provisions for: not interfering in the maritime formations of the other party, avoiding maneuvers in areas of heavy sea traffic, not simulating attack on the other party’s ships, and informing vessels when submarines are operating near them.47 In November 2002, an armed unmanned aerial vehicle operated by the CIA over a remote part of Yemen killed an individual suspected of having been involved in the bombing of the USS Cole. The Iranians see that capability and believe the United States is engaged in a parallel campaign of assassination of individuals inside Iran. They claim some evidence to support their argument. In 1975, a Senate Select Committee investigated assassinations in intelligence activities. The committee stated, “We condemn assassination and reject it as an instrument of American policy.”48 This is clearly an area where congressional oversight could have an impact. A similar select committee needs to be formed to investigate the actions taken under (or perhaps notwithstanding) the presidential findings of President Bush. The American public needs to know if assassination by proxy has become U.S. policy; and if it has not, the suspicious Iranians need to know that.49 The presidential candidates could help. The candidates could declare that fomenting regime change is a counterproductive approach for dealing with Iran, and that the Iranian people’s right freely to choose new leadership next year must be respected. This would be a major step in softening an Iranian reaction to an incident between now and the change of administration in the United States. And the winner on November 4 should discreetly but quickly telegraph to the agencies concerned that he will suspend the covert operations program on January 20. Policy is often driven by weak assumptions. The dangerous situation with Iran reflects that dilemma. Those who write and speak about national security issues could help with a better examination of some of the assumptions of the current and prospective new leadership in the United States and Israel: Iran’s nuclear program presents an existential threat to Israel similar to the Holocaust. This kind of exaggeration is not helpful. Iran is a long way from having deliverable nuclear weapons. Even ten nuclear weapons would not threaten Israel’s existence. As a former Israeli intelligence chief has said, a greater Middle East war caused by rash actions stemming from this assumption could be a real existential threat to Israel. Iran could give nuclear weapons to terrorist groups. This is a speculative assumption contradicted by actual experience. The evidence is just the opposite. Iran has an extensive chemical weapons capability, and chemical weapons have not been given to terrorist groups. The United States can dominate the escalation ladder. This is probably more wishful thinking rather than an assumption that can be supported. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">There is nothing in Iranian history that suggests it will tolerate continued U.S. covert attacks</span>__</span>**__. There is nothing in Iranian history that suggests that if the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>__were to strike Iran with conventional forces it would accept the blow **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">and not respond</span></span>**. If nothing else, the Iranians could be forced to respond by their own rhetoric__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. If the causing-incident is right, the American people will support attacking Iran. Seymour Hersh has described this as an assumption of the White House that came out of the January 2008 incident between Iranian speedboats and a U.S. destroyer. This assumption that the public will simply rally around the flag crumbles when the question of support is posed not in terms of the day of an attack, but the day after: is it obvious that the American people would support a military strike precipitating oil prices of $200 or $250 per barrel, much less a tax increase? Finally The president and other members of the administration say, “The first option for the United States is to solve this problem diplomatically.” That might be the case for the nuclear problem, but the administration has other, deeper problems with Tehran for which it has consistently refused any diplomatic option. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__The option the <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__has picked involves__</span>** __beginning with **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">the use of proxy forces and conducting direct action inside Iran</span>**.

Perhaps they have already concluded as much, at least regarding the expiring administration, and imagine they can hold it at bay with counterthreats, hints of nuclear flexibility, and oil jitters till a new team enters the White House. At some point, U.N. Security Council members and the European Union are going to realize the United States has several layers of ends and means, of which the hard-negotiated Security Council “5+1” track on the nuclear program is but one. The United States is not interested just in Iran’s nuclear program. While it has been talking about diplomacy on the one hand, the United States has been working on multiple levels that involve very little coordination with allies and Security Council partners. </span>__Since the increased funding for covert operations by the United States in Iran has only recently been approved, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">we have not yet seen the full extent of </span>the effort.

As that happens, the point resurfaces. When does Iran reach its tipping point and begin to fight back, not with words, but with expanded terrorist acts? When and how do the Europeans and other U.N. Security Council members begin to work together to refocus the “real” U.S. policy back on nuclear containment? </span></span></span>

In a best-case scenario, the U.S. will destroy all nuclear, chemical, and missile facilities in Iran with conventional and low-yield nuclear weapons in a lightning surprise attack, and Iran will be paralyzed and decide not to retaliate for fear of a vastly more devastating nuclear attack. In the short term, the U.S. will succeed, leaving no Iranian nuclear program, civilian or otherwise. Iran will no longer threaten Israel, a regime change will ensue, and a pro-Western government will emerge. However, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">even in the best-case scenario</span>__</span>**__, the long-term consequences are dire. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">The nuclear threshold will have been crossed</span></span>** by a nuclear superpower against a non-nuclear country. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Many more countries will rush to get their own nuclear weapons</span>** as a deterrent.

A recent ABC News report revealed that President George W. </span>__Bush had signed **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">a presidential finding giving the CIA the authority <span style="background: yellow;">to conduct “non-lethal” covert operations against Iran</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Former and current intelligence sources tell RAW STORY, however, that there have been “at least two” presidential findings over the past few years </span>__which have empowered the agency to run an “open-secret” information war against Iranian interests, mainly leveraging resources and assets “within the United States__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and France.” </span>__Although the resources – people, groups, organizations – were not identified, sources say that **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">they are not</span> terrorist organizations or groups <span style="background: yellow;">using violent tactics to achieve their goals</span></span>**. “**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">It's a propaganda operation</span></span>**,” said a former intelligence case officer__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the information. “</span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__It is not new or aggressive__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">,” the source added, </span>__explaining that **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">the operation has been going on for some time and has Congressional funding and oversight</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. <span style="background: aqua;">CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano</span> would not comment about the allegations made in the ABC report or discuss the existence of the presidential findings identified to RAW STORY. “The CIA does not, as a matter of course, publicly discuss allegations of covert action, whether the assertions are wrong, right, or somewhere in-between,” Gimigliano said. “That's one reason why the term ‘covert action’ still exists.” “But it's important to remember that, </span>__through the Congress, there is vigorous oversight of secret intelligence activities__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">,” he added. According to current and former intelligence officials, the various presidential findings are not limited to Iran. Several countries within the Middle East – including Syria and Lebanon – as well as groups such as Hezbollah, are being targeted through what sources call “black propaganda” efforts. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__Iran is being targeted by the CIA's activities with a “pro-democracy” message__</span>**__, sources say, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">and <span style="background: yellow;">the agency is supporting overt “pro-democracy” groups</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The program’s particulars are highly classified. </span>__Intelligence sources stress__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, however, </span>__that **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">the groups being used are </span>**rather**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"> mainstream <span style="background: yellow;">and the operations are</span></span>** almost entirely **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">restricted to information warfare</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Sources would not identify what mechanism was being employed to distribute the propaganda, if it included news media, individuals or organizations, or whether that information was seeping back into domestic news reports. One former intelligence case officer did explain that the CIA's program is operating largely outside of the Middle East and is aimed at identifying potential allies, as well as using already existing well known groups through whom information can be delivered. The type of “information” and the “groups” and “organizations” involved were not identified. ABC News may have reported the presidential finding as “new” because of the recently passed massive intelligence budget. Under the bill, roughly $50 million was appropriated for the “Democracy Fund” and the “Broadcasting Board of Governors,” both earmarked for Iran operations. Sources close to the Select Senate Committee on Intelligence would not discuss any aspect of the CIA program or comment on anything relating to the presidential findings. “This is an area I simply cannot get into,” said one source.

A series of RAW STORY reports has identified some of the “off book” or black operations running out of the Pentagon over the last several years. In 2003, the Defense Department began working with terrorist and dissident groups in an effort to destabilize Iran, bypassing traditional intelligence channels. One of the assets the Pentagon used was a terrorist organization known as Mujahedeen-e Khalq (MEK), which was being “run” in two southern regional areas of Iran, including a Shia region where a series of attacks in 2006 left many dead and hundreds injured. These activities have often been guided by the same individuals whose actions during Iran-Contra were the reason for a 1991 law on covert activities which for the first time clearly defined covert activities and how their oversight should be handled. During Iran-Contra, the Reagan White House – via the National Security Council – sold weapons to Iran, an avowed enemy of the United States, and used the money to fund various terrorist and dissident groups, collectively called the Contras, to fight a proxy war against the government of Nicaragua. Sources say that MEK has been used for intelligence collection, an activity which has traditionally fallen under the CIA. The administration also appears to be looking the other way as groups such as MEK commit acts of violence. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__Intelligence sources__</span>** __interviewed for this article **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">all expressed concern over the lack of attention to the Pentagon’s covert activities</span>**. Some believe **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">illegal activities</span>** like those of the Iran-Contra days **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">are now being hidden under the loophole of “traditional military activities” to avoid Congressional oversight</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__Steven Aftergood, director for the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy, says this loophole exists in Congressional oversight with regards to military covert activities__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. “</span>__CIA covert actions have to be authorized by a written presidential finding, which must be provided to Congress__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">,” Aftergood said. “</span>__By contrast, DOD operations, including clandestine or covert operations, are not subject to this procedure__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. “</span>__As a result__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">,” he added, “</span>__there may be a temptation to opt for a purely military action to take advantage of the loophole in congressional notification requirements__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.” </span></span></span>

This channel, beaming images and reports sent by normal Iranian citizens back into the country, has been hugely influential in spreading news of the protests to Iranians who would otherwise have relied on state television or the inferior American-based Persian-language channels. Peruse recent public opinion polls on the topic of U.S. policy toward Iran going back 5 years or more, and you won't find any mention of enhancing intelligence, propaganda or covert ops as a choice in polling questions. (A CBS News/New York Times poll conducted 9/21-24, 2008 indicates the public favored "diplomacy now" over "military action now" in Iraq by a margin of 61 to 10 percent) Perhaps the pollsters assume the public has a "don't ask, don't tell" attitude regarding covert ops, or they include it conceptually as an intelligence function under the rubric of "diplomacy."

In this same spirit, Iran and (as we recently learned) Syria have also been pursuing nuclear weapons (the only bright spot in this department being that Israel with an air strike last September destroyed the nuclear reactor that Syria was building in secret, with North Korean help, on the Euphrates River). At the hands of this gang, </span>__Lebanon since__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the uplifting scenes in March, 2005 of </span>__its Cedar Revolution has suffered an obscene onslaught of subversion, infiltration, and violence designed to thwart any progress toward stable democratic rule. A series of leading reformers have been threatened, attacked, or murdered__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> — such as newspaperman Gebran Tueni, an outspoken force for democracy, blown up in his car in December, 2005. In July, 2006, having launched an unprovoked war with Israel by kidnapping two Israeli soldiers who have not been heard from since, Hezbollah dug into its huge illicit arsenal to pose as the defender of Lebanon, posturing as a “resistance” force upon the wreckage its own actions had wrought. When the U.N. in August, 2006 brokered a peace deal, Hezbollah took the breather, but refused to comply with terms that it disarm. Instead, while attacking the legitimacy of the elected government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, Hezbollah resumed trucking in weapons and building its parallel infrastructure, both physical and political, of a terror-state within a state, overseen by “Death to Israel! Death to America!” Iran acolyte Hassan Nasrallah. In other words, </span>__having been only recently delivered from years of occupation by Syrian troops and secret police, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Lebanon is now being colonized by Iran</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and affiliates — though, there is of course considerable overlap among these forces of murk, mayhem, and totalitarian rule. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">The only way out</span>__</span>** __for Lebanese who desire a free state **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">is to disarm Hezbollah</span></span>**<span style="background: yellow;">. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">But as long as Hezbollah enjoys the havens, training camps, supply lines, and support of</span>**</span> Syria and**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"> <span style="background: yellow;">Iran, trying to wrest away its weapons is like trying to empty a</span> </span>**near-**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">bottomless well</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. What of the U.N.? Stacks of U.N. sanctions and other resolutions, plus a long-simmering U.N. investigation into Syrian involvement in the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, have all failed to prevent the debacles described above. As for the U.N. peacekeepers, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL (now celebrating its 30th year as an “interim” U.N. exercise), the tale is no better. Clearly UNIFIL has been no obstacle to Hezbollah’s current bout of in-country carnage. Beefed up after the 2006 summer war, and currently fielding more than 12,000 military staff and more than 600 Lebanese, with an annual budget of $713 million, UNIFIL by various accounts has resumed its old routine in which Hezbollah stocks its arsenal, struts its guns, and UNIFIL observes. According to Lebanon’s An-Nahar newspaper, for instance, a UNIFIL patrol in late March tried to inspect a suspicious-looking truck in the Bekaa Valley. Up drove two vans carrying five men with assault weapons. The UNIFIL troops left. In a ritual U.N. response that won’t deflect a single bullet, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon called the encounter “worrying.” </span>__The truth is that **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">there will be no salvation for Lebanon until there is regime change in Iran</span></span>**. One might dicker over whether an end to the regime in Damascus might suffice__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, especially given the strong ties that inspire Hezbollah to decorate its rallies in Lebanon with posters of Syrian President Bashar Assad. </span>__But **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">the epicenter of the problem</span>; the prime boot camp <span style="background: yellow;">where Hezbollah</span> foot-<span style="background: yellow;">soldiers go for indoctrination and</span> terrorist <span style="background: yellow;">training; the</span></span>** oil-rich **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">moneybags</span></span>** and top dog among this transnational pack of thugs, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">is </span>the regime of <span style="background: yellow;">Iran</span></span>**. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Until it goes, <span style="background: yellow;">Hezbollah will have the resources,</span> the <span style="background: yellow;">safe havens, and </span>the <span style="background: yellow;">incentive to press on</span> with its role <span style="background: yellow;">as Iran’s proxy force on Israel’s northern border</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and sharp stick in the eye of a White House that hailed and tried to support Lebanon’s 2005 Cedar Revolution. As a prescription these days, regime change in Iran may of course sound quite useless and maybe even deranged — at least as far as it might require any input from the United States. Washington can still talk a good game, but on the ground — apart from following up in Afghanistan and Iraq — the administration has gone out of the regime-change business. In a statement last week on the fighting in Beirut, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice got most of the words right: “Backed by Syria and Iran, Hezbollah and its allies are killing and injuring fellow citizens, undermining the legitimate authority of the Lebanese government and the institutions of the Lebanese state.” O.K., but now what? Now, nothing. The policy of preemption, declared by Bush in 2002, ended with the toppling in 2003 of Saddam Hussein. During Bush’s second term, in dealing with threats that include a nuclear-proliferating North Korea and a nuclear-bomb-seeking Iran, White House policy has been all about appeasement and procrastination, packaged as peace deals. Israel, with its air strike on Syria’s reactor last fall, did more in one morning to protect the security of the free world than anything the diplomats of the Bush administration currently have in the works. Were Bush willing to reconsider and attempt something — anything — forceful enough to truly give </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">regime change</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> a chance </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__in Tehran__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, it could head off a great many evils.

In that sense, Israel may for the first time become the victim of its own policies of massive non-proportional retaliation in such wars, as it was the case when 1,500 civilians were killed during the 2009 operation against Hamas in Gaza.

Mainly because </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">Hezbullah now has the capacity to strike</span> heavily__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">During the 2006 war</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the world watched as Israeli towns were hit time and time again by the Katyushas. What was not discussed by the main stream news media was the fact that the ordinance delivered by the Katyushas was mainly harassment fire with very limited effect. </span>__The Iranian/Syrian trained and supplied **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">Hezhollah commandos were holding back their</span> "heavy stuff" both in terms of</span>** their **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">longer range guided missiles</span>** capable of hitting southern Israel **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">and</span>** most importantly warheads of strategic military importance. That is NBC (nuclear [in this case **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">radiological</span></span>**] chemical **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">and biological</span></span>**) and advanced-conventional **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">warheads</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. They were demonstrating their ability to deliver "ordinance on target" and their ability to survive a heavy Israeli ground and air combined arms attack. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__Hezhollah has the capability of loading__</span>** __truly **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">strategic warheads on the large number of</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> mostly crude older technology </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__unguided rockets that it has__</span>**__. The use of advanced-conventional fuel-air explosive__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (FAE) </span>__warheads__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> on the Katyushas would have had a much more profound effect in Israeli cities. The use of FAE submunitions on the larger missiles capable of hitting any target in Israel </span>__would have given Hezhollah the firepower of low-yield nuclear weapons without crossing the nuclear threshold__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Coupled with the large number of missiles in Syria and those in Iran, the Hezhollah rockets posed, and continue to pose, a truly grave strategic threat to Israel if FAE warheads are used. </span>__This threat is dramatically increased if radiological__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> ("dirty bombs"), </span>__chemical, and/or biological warheads are used__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. During the late 80s I had lunch with the CEO of a US aerospace company and one of Israel's top generals. I warned the general of the military threat posed by Saddam's Scuds and related missiles armed with FAEs and radiological warheads. He assured me that the air force could locate and take out all, or almost all, Scud launchers. I responded by saying, "Look around you. How many Scuds or cruise missiles could you hide in this restaurant, with pre-surveyed launch positions just outside and knock-down walls, you could erect and launch a number of Scuds without any aircraft locating the position in time to knock it out." In the First Gulf War, Saddam continued to demonstrate his ability to launch missiles and to deliver ordinance on target over the Middle East. He held back his "heavy stuff" and we did NOT go to Baghdad until the Second Gulf War (when allied intelligence knew that Saddam had denuded himself of his radiological, chemical, and biological weapons). FAE warheads work somewhat like a automotive engine's carburetor. They mix fuel with a much larger amount of air to create an explosion, which in the case of the car drives the camshaft but in the case of a FAE creates a rather large footprint bomb. Instead of a bomb the size of your living room sofa (like a 1,000 bomb), the fuel air vapor cloud, created by the FAE aerosol, can create a bomb the size of a city block (or even much larger if multiple guided missiles with FAE submunitions are used). FAEs use an embedded detonator to trigger the fuel air "brew" which itself results in a high overpressure blast followed by a vacuum effect. In fact the Russians refer to FAEs as "vacuum bombs". An exposed person would likely be killed by the overpressure but in any case, should a person survive the overpressure blast the vacuum effect has been known to suck the lungs right out of people. FAEs can utilize a number of liquid explosive bases, including gasoline. A gasoline FAE uses a ratio of gasoline fuel vapor to air at a 1.3% to 6% gasoline to 98.7% to 94% air mix. The FAE can be spiked with assorted agents, such as powered aluminum, to increase blast effect. The Russians have developed variations of the FAE such as a slurry-explosive warhead (a mix of a combustible liquid with solid high explosives) and a reactive-surround warhead (nitrocellulose and combustible aluminum in a thin walled container). </span>__The massive number of Hezbollah rockets could also be outfitted with chemical warheads__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is worth noting that the joint Syrian-Iranian chemical warfare R&D and production program is perhaps the largest and most complicated on earth. Generally the Israelis have shown themselves to be prepared for chemical warfare, however a chemical war attack following closely behind a FAE attack (to open up bunkers and apartment buildings) would greater effect. </span>__While it is not necessary to utilize a rocket to deliver a biological war attack, it could be done and there is some benefit militarily to a rapid dispersal of biowar agents under the cover of conventional attacks__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Radiological weapons deliver the long term (which can be hundreds of thousands of years) lethal effects of radiation without the blast effect of a nuclear bomb. The combined military strategic capability of NBC/Advanced Conventional warheads and very large numbers of rockets operated and protected by Hezbollah, coupled with the arsenal of Syria and Iran acts as a MAD (mutually assured destruction) between Israel and Iran/Syria. Yes the Israelis can nuke the hell out of both Iran and Syria, however, they possess a fatal return punch. Hence it is very likely that any attack on Iran and it's ally Syria would first require a very serious weakening of their offensive strategic firepower by taking out the Hezbollah arsenal. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__In the 2006 war__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, this was attempted by Lt.-General Dan Halutz, the Israeli Air Force general who was the Chief of Staff of </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__the Israel Defense Force__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. They </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__seriously miscalculated__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Syrians had bought a large number of very nasty, relatively low cost Russian AT-14 Kornet solid fuel anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) and the Iranian trained Hezbollah commandos dug in massive numbers of concrete bunkers and firing positions. After over 50 Merkava main battle tanks were hit, and the high tech American made warplanes and pinpoint weapons proved ineffective, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__the handwriting was on the wall. Either use neutron bombs or lose a large number of Israeli soldiers to remove the Hezbollah threat__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">; or declare peace and walk away for the time being ~ the Israelis chose the latter. Since the Israelis do not like being caught with their pants down, they have been spending a considerable amount of time seeking a non-nuclear military solution to the Hezbollah threat. I suspect that the solution will utilize massive numbers of FAEs. Then we shall see if the Iranian combat engineers have build the bunkers to withstand the vapors of massive numbers of FAEs (this means air tight bunkers that are very strong). </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">The real danger </span>point <span style="background: yellow;">will come if either, a second non-nuclear Israeli attempt fails, or if it appears to be succeeding</span>. <span style="background: yellow;">If it fails, the temptation to use neutron bombs will be very high on the Israeli side</span>__</span>**__. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">If it appears to be succeeding, the <span style="background: yellow;">Hezbollah</span> side</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (with their Iranian and Syrian backers) </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">will be faced with the "use it or lose it" option for their strategic rocket force</span>__</span>**__. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">Using </span>the <span style="background: yellow;">full force </span>of the massive number <span style="background: yellow;">of </span>rockets with <span style="background: yellow;">strategic weapons on</span> the <span style="background: yellow;">Israel</span>i population <span style="background: yellow;">would ensure a full nuclear response </span>from the Israel Defense Force</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Not using the strategic weapons would mean that a massive US/Israeli/allied attack on Iran (and perhaps Syria) would be highly likely, and the destruction of Iraq and its leadership has shown the high stakes involved. </span></span></span>

National ownership of nuclear weapons offers perceived international status and insurance against aggression at a modest financial cost__. Against this backdrop, we provide a quantitative assessment of the potential for casualties in a regional-scale nuclear conflict, or a terrorist attack, and the associated environmental impacts (<span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref4|4]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref5|5]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">). Eight nations are known to have nuclear weapons. In addition, North Korea may have a small, but growing, arsenal. Iran appears to be seeking nuclear weapons capability, but it probably needs several years to obtain enough fissionable material. Of great concern, 32 other nations--including Brazil, Argentina, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan--have sufficient fissionable materials to produce weapons (</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref1|1]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref6|6]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">). A de facto nuclear arms race has emerged in Asia between China, India, and Pakistan, which could expand to include North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan (</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref1|1]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">). </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow; color: black;">In the Middle East, a nuclear confrontation</span>__</span>**__<span style="color: black;"> between Israel and Iran **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">would be fearful</span></span>**</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">. Saudi Arabia and Egypt could also seek nuclear weapons to balance Iran and Israel. Nuclear arms programs in South America, notably in Brazil and Argentina, were ended by several treaties in the 1990s (</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref6|6]]</span><span style="color: black;">). We can hope that these agreements will hold and will serve as a model for other regions, despite Brazil's new, large uranium enrichment facilities. </span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">Nuclear arsenals containing 50 or more weapons of low yield [15 kilotons (kt), equivalent to the Hiroshima bomb] are relatively easy to build (</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref1|1]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref6|6]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">). India and Pakistan, the smallest nuclear powers, probably have such arsenals, although no nuclear state has ever disclosed its inventory of warheads (</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref7|7]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">). Modern weapons are compact and lightweight and are readily transported (by car, truck, missile, plane, or boat) (</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref8|8]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">). The basic concepts of weapons design can be found on of the Internet. The only serious obstacle to constructing a bomb is the limited availability of purified fissionable fuels. </span>__<span style="color: black;">There are many political, economic, and social factors that could trigger a regional-scale nuclear conflict, plus many scenarios for the conduct of the ensuing war</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">.

We did not evaluate specific military targets and related casualties. We considered a nuclear exchange involving 100 weapons of 15-kt yield each, that is, ~0.3% of the total number of existing weapons (</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref4|4]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">). India and Pakistan, for instance, have previously tested nuclear weapons and are now thought to have between 109 and 172 weapons of unknown yield (</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref9|9]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">). Fatalities were estimated by means of a standard population database for a number of countries that might be targeted in a regional conflict (see figure, above). For instance, such an exchange between India and Pakistan (</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="color: black;">[[http://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu:10151/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1224#ref10|10]]</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">) could produce about 21 million fatalities--about half as many as occurred globally during World War II. </span>__<span style="color: black;">The direct effects of thermal radiation and nuclear blasts</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">, as well as gamma-ray and neutron radiation within the first few minutes of the blast, </span>__<span style="color: black;">would cause most casualties.

Its list, with which we concur, includes removing nuclear weapons from alert status to reduce the danger of an accidental or unauthorized use of a nuclear weapon; reducing the size of nuclear forces in all states; eliminating tactical nuclear weapons; ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty worldwide; securing all stocks of weapons, weapons-usable plutonium, and highly enriched uranium everywhere in the world; controlling uranium enrichment along with guaranteeing that uranium for nuclear power reactors could be obtained from controlled international reserves; safeguarding spent fuel from reactors producing electricity; halting the production of fissile material for weapons globally; phasing out the use of highly enriched uranium in civil commerce and research facilities and rendering the materials safe; and resolving regional confrontations and conflicts that give rise to new nuclear powers.

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">The failure of the FBI to prosecute the perpetrator of the anthrax letters even though the FBI is believed to know who it is has led several experts to conclude that the perpetrator is untouchable because he has knowledge damaging to the government. That knowledge is believed to be the US violation of the 1972 Convention on Biological Weapons, which states that it is illegal to "develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire" such weapons. The US is using state-of-the-art genetic splicing to make designer bioweapons. An article by Laura Rozen in Salon (2/8/02) revealed that the "Defense Intelligence Agency hired Battelle to create a genetically enhanced version of anthrax" even though no vaccine was proven to be effective beforehand. A former Clinton administration official, Elisa D. Harris, "was shocked to read in the New York Times" (9/4/01) about bioweapons research "that she herself had not known about, although she had served for eight years in the White House as the point person for weapons of mass destruction nonproliferation issues."What other secret, illegal and genetically modified bioweapons are in the works?

Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a "nuclear winter," resulting from a massive exchange of <span style="background: yellow;">nuclear weapons</span>, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they <span style="background: yellow;">are easier to control</span>. <span style="background: yellow;">Biological weapons</span>,**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> on the other hand, </span>**__<span style="background: yellow;">can get out of control very easily</span>__****__, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions__**__. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause.__ <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. Potentially worse than that, </span>**__<span style="background: yellow;">bio-engineered agents</span>__** <span style="font-size: 7pt;">by the hundreds with no known cure</span>__**<span style="background: yellow;">could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation</span>**.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? </span>**__HUMAN <span style="background: yellow;">EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE</span>__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Ironically, the Bush administration has just changed the U.S. nuclear doctrine to allow nuclear retaliation against threats upon allies by conventional weapons. The past doctrine allowed such use only as a last resort when our nation’s survival was at stake. Will the new policy also allow easier use of US bioweapons? How slippery is this slope? Against this tendency can be posed a rational alternative policy. </span>__To preclude possibilities of human extinction, "patriotism" needs to be redefined to make humanity’s survival primary and absolute. Even if we lose our cherished freedom, our sovereignty, our government or our Constitution, where there is life, there is hope. What good is anything else if humanity is extinguished?__ <span style="font-size: 7pt;">This concept should be promoted to the center of national debate. For example, for sake of argument, suppose the ancient Israelites developed defensive bioweapons of mass destruction when they were enslaved by Egypt. Then suppose these weapons were released by design or accident and wiped everybody out? </span>__As bad as slavery is, extinction is worse__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Our generation, our century, our epoch needs to take the long view. We truly hold in our hands the precious gift of all future life. Empires may come and go, but who are the honored custodians of life on earth? Temporal politicians? Corporate competitors? Strategic brinksmen? Military gamers? Inflated egos dripping with testosterone? How can any sane person believe that national sovereignty is more important than survival of the species? Now that extinction is possible, our slogan should be "Where there is life, there is hope." No government, no economic system, no national pride, no religion, no political system can be placed above human survival. The egos of leaders must not blind us. </span> </span></span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">The expansion of special operations </span>forces <span style="background: yellow;">into the </span>realm traditionally occupied by the CIA's <span style="background: yellow;">covert operators has created several</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> other </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">controversies</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> beyond those in Congress. The first involves the question of who is better suited to conduct such operations, whatever they are called. Pentagon officials contend that the CIA is not responsive enough to the military's needs, that it is too risk-averse, and that it is simply too small to meet the global terrorist challenge. The CIA has approximately 700-800 covert operators, compared to the roughly 10,000-13,000 special operations forces. On the other hand, their relative sizes are not as askew as these numbers seem to indicate. Of that total, no more than 2,000 are JSOC black operators, i.e. directly comparable to CIA operatives. Moreover, according to many analysts, </span>__the difference in size of the overall organizations is a significant advantage for CIA operators. Having much less bureaucracy to deal with, they can do things faster, cheaper and with more flexibility than special operations forces - the main reason, the CIA's advocates contend, that the agency was able to have men on the ground at the beginning of the Afghanistan war quicker than the military__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Even though this has clearly been one of the Pentagon's priorities in enacting its SOCOM reforms, </span>__most analysts still believe that the CIA continues to retain an advantage in speed and flexibility__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__The CIA also has the advantage of experience: it has been conducting this type of operation for a long time and thus has case officers stationed at embassies throughout the world who have built up an extensive network of contacts that the military simply does not have__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In addition, conducting operations where the role of the US is unacknowledged means, by definition, operating out of uniform. If captured, therefore, a special operations soldier is in an inherently different position than a conventional one. Whereas the latter is covered by international legal mechanisms such as the Geneva Conventions, which govern the conduct of war and the treatment of prisoners, a special operations soldier will have no such recourse. People who join the CIA's operations division are aware of and accept the risk that, if captured, they will essentially be completely on their own and that their country will not acknowledge them. Soldiers, however, join with a different set of expectations. They generally assume that if they fight for and defend their country, Washington will do its best to protect them if they are captured. While many special operations soldiers knowingly accept that risk, analysts point out that it is a dangerously slippery slope. Once some contingent of US military personnel is left without protection, they argue, that endangers the protection of all military personnel serving abroad, and could damage troop morale as well. </span>__Many CIA and JSOC operators oppose the Pentagon's emphasis on moving special operations forces into the unacknowledged realm for precisely these reasons. There was__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, for instance, </span>__considerable opposition among special operations forces themselves to the 9/11 Commission's recommendation of moving all paramilitary responsibilities to SOCOM__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Furthermore, these critics argue, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__JSOC's <span style="background: yellow;">direct action units do not have the training for covert</span> action <span style="background: yellow;">op</span>eration<span style="background: yellow;">s and</span> if they do undertake the training required, <span style="background: yellow;">that will detract from their readiness for their traditional, highly specialized missions, such as</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> hostage rescue, close-quarters combat and </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">dealing with w</span>eapons of <span style="background: yellow;">m</span>ass <span style="background: yellow;">d</span>estruction__</span>**__. While there are other personnel capable of conducting covert action (i.e. in the CIA), **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">if special operations forces are distracted</span> from their traditional missions, <span style="background: yellow;">there is no one else who can take their place, leaving the US vulnerable</span></span>** in certain situations__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. One final issue that arises in weighing the relative advantages of CIA unacknowledged operations versus those conducted by special operations forces stems from the differences in mission planning procedures between the two organizations. Traditionally, CIA covert operations are developed by an operational planning group, and then subjected to several levels of approval within the agency. After receiving the CIA's approval, the proposal is then reviewed by the deputies' committee at the National Security Council (NSC), and possibly by the principals themselves, before being passed on to the President. Military operational planning, however, is conducted quite differently. Because its primary mission is combat, the military has full authority to make its own operational decisions with no input from outside agencies. A military black operation, therefore, is planned completely within the Pentagon and approved by the Secretary. This insulated decision-making system raises obvious diplomatic risks in a situation where special operations forces are conducting unacknowledged operations in a wide range of countries with which the US has a variety of relationships. There has also been increasing concern that the military is running its own unacknowledged operations without even notifying the 'country team' in the relevant location; i.e. the CIA station chief and the ambassador. As Chief of Mission, the ambassador has traditionally had authority over all US government personnel and activities in a country, meaning that no US personnel could operate there without the ambassador's approval, while the CIA station chief has been in charge of coordinating any intelligence operations in the country. In March 2006, the New York Times revealed the existence of 'military liaison elements' (MLEs), small teams of special operations forces (some just two or three people) that had been placed in embassies in various countries in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia with which the US was not at war and with which it had friendly relations, to gather intelligence and 'prepare for potential missions to disrupt, capture or kill' terrorists. According to the Times, some of these MLEs had, at least initially, been operating without the knowledge of the country team.23 Such completely independent special operations not only run the risk of embarrassing the US diplomatically, but if the CIA were conducting an operation in the same area and the operators were unknown to each other, they could conceivably perceive each other as the enemy, a situation known as 'confliction'. In an attempt to resolve the confliction issue, in October 2005 the administration designated the CIA's Directorate of Operations as the new National Clandestine Service (NCS), and put it in charge of coordinating all overseas human intelligence activities, no matter what agency they were conducted by. As evidenced by the continuing MLE dispute, however, that step proved not to have enough bureaucratic punch to resolve the problem. The MLE issue was merely the latest, and most concrete and public, symbol of the larger problem that had been brewing in the administration's counterterrorism ranks since the early days after 9/11, when President Bush framed his response to the attacks in strongly militaristic terms and dubbed it the 'Global War on Terror'. As Rumsfeld pushed ever harder for more authority and independence, both the CIA and the State Department challenged what they saw as the Pentagon's usurpation of their authority in its unilateral expansion of its counterterrorism mission. Resolving these turf battles (and the numerous others engendered by the war on terror) was the primary goal of a contentious two-year-long review designed to specify each agency's responsibility and the lines of division between them. The review finally resulted in the adoption of the classified National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 46 in March 2006. The directive designated the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC, created by the intelligence reform legislation and housed under the Director of National Intelligence) as the entity responsible for ensuring that each agency sticks to the 'lanes in the road'. However, as frequently happens when negotiations are particularly difficult, the most contentious issues were left to be worked out later in annexes negotiated among the agencies involved.24 One of the most contentious issues was precisely this issue about how much independence the Pentagon should have in conducting operations in countries with which the US is not at war. Eventually, the level of animosity over the MLEs got to the point that then-Deputy Director of Intelligence Michael Hayden had to step in and pressure the two sides to come to some sort of agreement. The result was a memorandum of understanding in which the Pentagon and the State Department agreed that ambassadors would be informed of all military activity in their countries and given the opportunity to object.25 </span>__Another controversy triggered by the Pentagon's increasing covert profile concerns the rising level of discomfort within the **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">special operations forces themselves</span>** about the direction their expansion is taking. Their **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">fear</span>** is **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">that <span style="background: yellow;">all the attention is being focused on direct action</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (especially 'man-hunting') </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">to the exclusion of</span> SOCOM's <span style="background: yellow;">other</span> main <span style="background: yellow;">missions, including</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> unconventional warfare, civil affairs work, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">foreign internal defense</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and information operations.

The ability of US allies and partners to address the threat ranges from sophisticated to almost non-existent, but even in the most capable partner areas (i.e., Europe), Islamist terrorist cells have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to operate. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">To prevail</span>__</span>** __in this war, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">the <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span></span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow; border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates, along with its allies and partners, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">will need to </span>conduct a sustained, multifaceted, global “smother campaign” to <span style="background: yellow;">deny terrorists sanctuary</span>__ </span>**__whether in under-governed areas or state-controlled territory, sever the transnational links upon which they rely,**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"> <span style="background: yellow;">impede recruitment and fundraising</span>, track them down </span>**wherever they may be hiding and plotting,**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"> <span style="background: yellow;">and disrupt</span> their <span style="background: yellow;">operations</span></span>**. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__cannot successfully wage this campaign alone. <span style="background: yellow;">It will be essential to build</span> the <span style="background: yellow;">security </span>capabilities and <span style="background: yellow;">capacities of as many partners</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> — both nations and disaffected non-state actors — </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">as possible</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Conversely, it will be necessary to put additional pressure on state sponsors of terrorism. The US government will also need to shore up weak or failing states to prevent them from becoming terrorist sanctuaries. In particular, the United States will need to ensure that the “key terrain” of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan does not fall into the hands of violent Islamic radicals. 63 Finally, for long-term success, it is imperative for the US government to engage more aggressively in the “war of ideas” to isolate the Salafi-Takfiri and Khomeinist extremists from the mainline Muslim community, divide these violent movements internally, and undermine their ideological appeal. To do so, the United States will need to rally as many allies as possible to the cause, including non-violent Salafis who are best positioned to lure conservative Muslims away from terrorist groups. Most critically, the US government must avoid making statements or taking actions that legitimize the call to defensive jihad. It should also take steps to ameliorate the social, economic, and political plight of the Muslim world and other so-called “root causes” of radical Islamic terrorism.64 In short, </span>__defeating violent Islamic extremism will require a multifaceted approach — one in which the military instrument will often be far less important than effective foreign assistance, public and private diplomacy, strategic communications, and covert action. That being said, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">SOF will need to be</span></span>** shaped, sized, and **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">postured to</span></span>**: > **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">Conduct proactive, sustained “manhunting” and</span> disruption operations globally</span>**; > **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">Build partner capacity</span></span>** in relevant ground, air, and maritime capabilities **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">in scores of countries</span></span>** on a steady-state basis; > Help generate persistent air and maritime surveillance and strike coverage over “under-governed” areas and relevant littoral zones; and > Employ unconventional warfare against state sponsors of terrorism and transnational terrorist groups globally__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">These</span>__</span>** __four operational **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">tasks are critical to the formation of</span></span>** what is sometimes referred to as **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">a global combating terrorism network</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (GCTN). SOCOM, for example, describes the GCTN as a “loosely organized affiliation of people and organizations and capabilities that are generally connected by a common desire to contribute to a global environment that is inhospitable to terrorist activity.”65 </span>__The idea is that, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">with time, this network will become <span style="background: yellow;">so expansive and dense that transnational terrorist groups will no longer be able to operate effectively</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The underlying goal is to increase dramatically the anticipated costs of conducting terrorist acts, convincing would-be terrorists that the probability of successfully orchestrating a major plot is very low, while punishment would be painful, swift and certain. In theory, </span>__by influencing the cost-benefit calculus associated with terrorism, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">the GCTN will deter terrorists from acting — and in the event deterrence fails, it will effectively disrupt terrorist plots</span> before they are hatched</span>**. For the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__the key to this strategy is to work indirectly through partner states__</span>** __and non-state actors, shifting as much of the cost of maintaining the GCTN as quickly as possible. The desired end-state is a world in which US partners can effectively suppress terrorist activity in their territory and regional neighborhoods with little or no American assistance__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Until those partner capabilities can be developed, however, the United States will need to assume a disproportionate burden in creating and sustaining the GCTN. While SOF can make an important contribution to this GCTN, its backbone will likely be human and physical infrastructure developed by the CIA’s National Clandestine Service. Conducting Manhunting and Disruption Operations Globally In close cooperation with the other government agencies (primarily the CIA), SOF will help locate, track, and capture or kill terrorists and their leaders in hostile, statecontrolled territory (e.g., Iran and Syria), under-governed areas (e.g., the tribal areas of Pakistan), and densely populated cites from Beirut to Mindanao. They will also be relied upon to interdict the movement of critical supplies and destroy terrorist infrastructure (e.g., training camps, communications, and weapon/supply caches). These operational tasks have two major implications for SOF posture. First and foremost, SOF will need to build and maintain a persistent, low-visibility ground presence in several known or suspected terrorist operating areas around the world, as well as in expansive, under-governed areas that are vulnerable to terrorist exploitation (e.g., the Trans-Saharan region of Africa, the Sulu/Sulawesi Seas littoral, and large swaths of Central Asia). Second, SOF will need to be prepared to conduct clandestine operations (most likely unconventional warfare) and support CIA-led covert activities against state sponsors of terrorism, including those armed with significant anti-access capabilities. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__An <span style="background: yellow;">on-the-ground presence is essential</span>__</span>** __not only for collecting tactical intelligence and developing local situational awareness, but also **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">for </span>supporting partner security forces and <span style="background: yellow;">responding rapidly</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (either unilaterally or in a combined operation) </span>__if and **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">when high-value terrorist targets are identified and located</span>**. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">Currently, however, over 80 percent of SOF capacity is allocated to just</span></span>** two countries: **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">Iraq and Afghanistan</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has indicated that </span>__the SOF commitment to those countries will probably not decline significantly over the next several years, even as conventional forces withdraw from Iraq__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As he remarked in May 2008: The eventual drawdown in Iraq is not the end of the mission for our elite forces. Far from it. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__Even as our regular troops reduce their presence__</span>** __and are replaced by Iraqis, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">special operations force levels will remain fairly constant</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and be the connective tissue for the overall mission. They will be in Iraq and Afghanistan for an extended period of time — a force to hunt and kill terrorists, and also as a force to help train Iraqis and Afghans.66 </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">The opportunity cost of that commitment</span>__</span>**__, however, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">has been a significant reduction in SOF presence in </span>other countries, including several <span style="background: yellow;">terrorist “hot spots” in Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Admiral Eric Olson, commander of SOCOM, summarized the unfortunate situation: “we’re going to fewer countries, staying for shorter periods of time, with smaller numbers of people than historically we have done.”67 </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__This <span style="background: yellow;">limited</span>, episodic <span style="background: yellow;">SOF presence outside of Iraq</span> and Afghanistan <span style="background: yellow;">is unacceptable</span> strategically__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As will be addressed in the next chapter of this report, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">additional SOF capacity is needed</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, possibly beyond that called for in the 2006 QDR, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__to sustain a persistent, low-visibility ground presence in scores of areas outside of Iraq and Afghanistan__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In countries willing to host SOF to train, advise, and equip their security forces, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__this expanded presence could be generated relatively easily. Personnel assigned to the overt foreign internal defense mission__</span>** __could leverage their in-country access for collecting tactical intelligence, making contacts with local government officials and civilians, and conducting a host of other preparation-of-the-environment activities__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Additional SOF and other government personnel (i.e., CIA officers) could be embedded with foreign internal defense units, as necessary. </span>__This in-situ force **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">could respond quickly to counterterrorism tasks</span>**, either with or without the host nation’s approval, within its assigned area of influence. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">A large number of</span> relatively <span style="background: yellow;">small, covert</span> foreign <span style="background: yellow;">internal defense</span> teams distributed <span style="background: yellow;">around the world</span> would make an important contribution to the above-mentioned GCTN</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. To support these teams adequately, DoD will need to invest in logistical infrastructure, additional ISR collection and TPED (tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination) capacity, intelligence analysis, secure communications capabilities, and “on-demand” precision fire support. Developing a low-visibility ground presence in countries that are not willing to host SOF will, of course, be more problematic. To support expanded clandestine military operations, SOF will need to invest in myriad capabilities to enable specially trained personnel to infiltrate into, exfiltrate from, and conduct operations within semi-permissible and denied areas. Among other things, they will require new cover mechanisms and means for defeating modern biometric identity verification technologies. It will also be necessary to develop new tools, as well as supporting tactics, techniques, and procedures, in order to collect relevant tactical intelligence, especially with respect to locating and tracking high-value terrorist targets (and possibly WMD-related material) in what may often be very cluttered environments. Finally, SOF must be prepared to conduct clandestine military operations against state sponsors of terrorism such as Iran. In addition to unconventional warfare operations, which will be discussed below, this could entail manhunting operations against key terrorist leaders/operatives, as well as direct action against critical terrorist support infrastructure (e.g., training camps). Building Partner Capacity </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__Given finite US counterterrorism capacity, the impracticability of conducting US military (or even covert) operations in several relevant places__</span>** __around the world, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">and the</span>** political/diplomatic **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">need to avoid the perception of a unilateral American war against Islam, it is essential to train, equip, and advise foreign security forces</span>** — including air and maritime forces as well as ground forces — **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">in as many countries as possible</span>**. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">If the <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__is successful in this regard, more and more partner states will__</span>**__, in time, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">become fully capable of suppressing or eliminating terrorist threats within their own territory</span>**. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Not only will this create the conditions for a gradual reduction of the US military’s commitment abroad, it could also facilitate more effective counterterrorism operations since these partners have unmatchable advantages with respect to cultural intimacy and language proficiency</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified to Congress in April 2008, “As borne out by Afghanistan, Iraq, and in other theaters large and small, success in the war on terror will depend as much on the capacity of allies and partners in the moderate Muslim world as on the capabilities of our own forces.”68 Similarly, as the late General Wayne Downing, former commander of JSOC, put it, “when you fight an insurgency, the best people to do this are [in] the host country.”69 </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__Because of their foreign language skills, cultural expertise, and familiarity with a wide range of commonly used foreign weapons, SF are the country’s premier force for training, advising, and equipping foreign security forces__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In addition, MARSOC’s Marine Special Operations Advisor Group teams are developing specialized foreign internal defense-related skill sets and expertise. Elements of this mission, however, could and should be performed by general purpose forces, freeing up SOF for missions that exploit their “special” capabilities. With modest training and basic language instruction, for example, conventional Army and Marine Corps units could train and advise conventional military forces in basic counterinsurgency tactics, techniques, and procedures in partner states that are politically willing to accept what is likely to be a relatively large American “footprint” on their territory. </span>__In countries where the disclosure of a US military presence would be politically risky for the host nation, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">SOF will likely be relied upon for the foreign internal defense mission</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Unfortunately, given falling favorable public views of the United States over the past several years, </span>__more and more states want to keep their involvement with the US military as discreet as possible. Moreover, SOF will also be required for training and advising foreign special operations forces__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This is now happening in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Philippines, among other places. In short, </span>__while the general purpose force may reduce the foreign internal defense workload for SOF at the margins, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">one should harbor no illusions that it will be possible (or desirable) for SOF to divest the bulk of the foreign internal defense mission; it will unquestionably remain a major operational focus for SOF in the years ahead</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This assessment is shared by the SOCOM Commander Admiral Eric Olson, who remarked recently: We’d like to hand off a number of [FID] tasks to the conventional forces as they develop the capability to do it, but the reality is striking me that there are really very few countries in the world where you can put a brigade combat team to do a train and assist mission. In most countries of the world, access is gained through low-profile operations, keeping it out of the newspapers, working in small unit to small unit level kinds of engagements. We woke up in 58 countries of the world this morning, and only a couple of those where we’re engaged in a fight or where a brigade combat team could perform a significant train and assist kind of mission…That said, I’d like to see Special Operations get in the business of training Special Operations a little bit more, and in the business of training new recruits how to march in straight lines and shoot on seven-meter ranges a little bit less. But I think that the reality is that, given the skills to which Special Operations trains, the global demand will still be mostly for us.70 </span>__As is the case when creating a low-visibility network for global manhunting and disruption operations, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">the</span></span>**<span style="background: yellow;"> **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">primary challenge</span>**</span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"> associated <span style="background: yellow;">with</span> the closely-linked requirement of <span style="background: yellow;">building and leveraging partner capacity is a lack of available SOF force structure</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

In an effort to explain his thinking to his followers, and to help guide their efforts, the al Qaeda leader has offered a number of statements that provide a need and rationale for using weapons of mass destruction as a means of achieving the group’s concrete and ambitious goals. Most recently, he promised in a 2007 video release to “escalate the killing and fighting against you (Americans)”–on grounds of destroying an international conspiracy to control the world–adding, “The capitalist system seeks to turn the entire world into a fiefdom of the major corporations under the label of globalization in order to protect democracy.” </span>__These statements should not be interpreted as empty rhetoric and idle threats: Osama **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">bin Ladin has signaled a specific purpose for using WMD in<span style="background: yellow;"> al Qaeda’s quest to destroy the global status quo, and </span>to create conditions more conducive to the <span style="background: yellow;">overthrow </span>of apostate <span style="background: yellow;">regimes</span> throughout the Islamic world</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

In this sense, their approach has been “Muhammed Atta-like”—similar to the modus operandi Khaled Sheikh Mohammed employed in making preparations for the 9/11 attacks—</span>__as opposed to resembling the signature characterizing most terrorist attacks to which the world has become accustomed__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__Al Qaeda’s patient, <span style="background: yellow;">decade-long effort to steal or construct an improvised nuclear device</span>__</span>** __(IND) **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">flows from their perception of the benefits of producing the image of a mushroom cloud rising over a US city</span>**, just as the 9/11 attacks have altered the course of history. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">This</span>** lofty aim **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">helps explains why al Qaeda has consistently sought a bomb capable of producing a nuclear yield, as opposed to settling for the more expedient and realistic course of devising a “dirty bomb,”</span>** or a radiological dispersal device__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__Another 9/11-scale operational plot managed by the al Qaeda core leadership was the development of anthrax for use in a mass casualty attack in the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates. </span>__The sophisticated anthrax project was run personally by al Qaeda deputy chief Ayman Zawahiri, in parallel to the group’s efforts to acquire a nuclear capability__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">; anthrax was probably meant to serve as another means to achieve the same effect as using a nuclear bomb, given doubts that a nuclear option could be successfully procured. Notably, al Qaeda’s efforts to acquire a nuclear and biological weapons capability were concentrated in the years preceding September 11, 2001. </span>__Based on the timing and nature of their WMD-related activity in the 1990’s, al Qaeda probably anticipated using these means of mass destruction against targets in the US homeland in the intensified campaign they knew would follow the 9/11 attack__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__There is no indication that the fundamental objectives that lie behind their WMD intent have changed over time__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. On the other hand, </span>__the pursuit of crude toxins and poisons appears to have been of little interest to the al Qaeda leadership, even though the production of such weapons is easier and thus might seem more attractive for potential use in attacks__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Although experimentation and training in crude chemical agents and pathogens was standard fare in al Qaeda’s camps in Afghanistan before 9/11, their use in attacks appears to have been left to the initiative of individual cells and planners outside the direct supervision of the al Qaeda core leadership. Prominent examples of small-scale chemical- and biological- related activity include Midhat al-Mursi’s (aka Abu Khabab) basic training for operatives in the al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan before 9/11; the Abu Musab al Zarqawi network’s plotting to use ricin and cyanide in multiple attacks planned in Europe in late 2002-early 2003; and a Bahraini terrorist cell’s plot to use a crude cyanide gas device called the “mobtaker” (an Arabic word roughly meaning “invention”) in an attack on the New York City subway in the same time frame. In each of these cases, the evidence suggests that the al Qaeda senior leadership was not directly involved or apparently even aware of attack preparations until late stages of planning. Moreover, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__there is no evidence that the al Qaeda leadership regarded the use of crude toxins and poisons as being suitable for conducting what would amount to pin prick attacks on the U__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__S__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates; </span>__on the contrary, Zawahiri canceled the planned attack on the New York City subway for “something better,” suggesting that a relatively easy attack utilizing tactical weapons would not achieve the goals the al Qaeda leadership had set for themselves__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. So, why hasn’t a terrorist WMD attack happened since 9/11? </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__There are many plausible explanations for why the world has not experienced an al Qaeda attack using__</span>** __chemical, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">biological</span>**, radiological **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">or nuclear weapons, but <span style="background: yellow;">it would be foolish to discount the possibility that such an event will occur</span></span>** in the future. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">To date, al Qaeda’s WMD programs may have been disrupted</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This is in fact one likely explanation, given a sustained and ferocious counterterrorist response to 9/11 that largely destroyed al Qaeda as the organization that existed before the fateful attack on the US. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__If so, <span style="background: yellow;">terrorists must continue to be disrupted</span>__</span>** __and denied a safe haven to reestablish the ability to launch a major strike on the US homeland__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, or elsewhere in the world. Or perhaps, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">al Qaeda</span> operational planners have failed to acquire the kind of weapons they seek, because they <span style="background: yellow;">are unwilling to settle for anything other than a large scale attack in the US</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It would surely be hard for al Qaeda to lower the bar they set on 9/11: what would constitute a worthy follow-up to 9/11, on their terms? What would they achieve through another attack? </span>__There are few weapons that would meet their expectations in this regard. It is extremely difficult to acquire a functioning nuclear bomb, or to steal enough weapons usable material to build a bomb. And as al Qaeda probably learned in trying to weaponize anthrax, biological pathogens may seem simple enough to produce, but such weapons are not easy to bottle up and control__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. To complicate matters further, an attack on the scale of 9/11 is more difficult to accomplish in an environment of heightened security and vigilance in the US. </span>__But if Osama bin Ladin and his lieutenants had been interested in employing crude chemical, biological and radiological materials in small scale attacks, there is little doubt they could have done so by now__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. However, </span>__events have shown that the al Qaeda leadership does not choose weapons based on how easy they are to acquire and use__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, be they conventional or unconventional weapons. </span>__They choose them based on the best means of destroying the specific targets that they have in mind. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Al Qaeda’s reasoning thus runs <span style="background: yellow;">counter to </span>analytic <span style="background: yellow;">convention that equates the ease of acquisition</span></span>** of chemical, biological or radiological weapons **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">with</span> an <span style="background: yellow;">increasing likelihood of</span> terrorist <span style="background: yellow;">use</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">—i.e., a terrorist attack employing crude weapons is therefore more likely than an attack using a nuclear or large scale biological weapon. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__In fact, it is the opposite__</span>**__: If **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">perpetrating a large-scale attack serves as al Qaeda’s motivation for possessing WMD</span>**, not deterrence value, then **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">the greatest threat is posed by</span> the most effective and simple means of mass destruction, whether</span>** these means consist of **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">nuclear, biological, </span>or other forms of asymmetric <span style="background: yellow;">weapons</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. An examination of the 9/11 attack sheds light on al Qaeda’s reasoning behind the selection of specific weapons, and how that may apply to the role WMD plays in their thinking. Al Qaeda opted to pursue a highly complex and artfully choreographed plot to strike multiple targets requiring the simultaneous hijacking of several 747 jumbo passenger aircraft, because using airplanes as weapons offered the best means of attacking the targets they intended to destroy. </span>__If conventional wisdom on assessing WMD terrorism threats had been applied to considering the likelihood of the 9/11 plot, analysts may well have concluded it never would have happened; at the time, it was simply hard to believe any terrorist group could pull off such an elaborate plot utilizing novel, unpredictable weapons that were so difficult to acquire__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Yet, </span>__WMD terrorism skeptics abound, and for understandable reasons. There is widespread suspicion in America and abroad that WMD terrorism is another phony threat being hyped for political purposes, and to stoke fears among the public__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is difficult to debunk this allegation, given the US government’s lack of credibility in the case of Iraqi WMD. That said, WMD terrorism is not Iraqi WMD. </span>__The case that **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">the WMD terrorism threat is real</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> bears no association with the Iraqi intelligence failure whatsoever, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">in terms of the reliability of </span>the sources of <span style="background: yellow;">intelligence, </span>the <span style="background: yellow;">quality of the information</span> that has been collected,__</span>** __**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">and </span>the <span style="background: yellow;">weight of the evidence</span></span>** that lies at the heart of our understanding of the threat. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">If anything, the biases in WMD terrorism analysis tilt towards <span style="background: yellow;">treating the absence of information as an absence of threat</span>; this could become <span style="background: yellow;">a vulnerability</span></span>** in the defenses, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">considering the very real possibility that there may be a terrorist plot in motion that has not been found</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span> </span></span>

The agency has removed all significant amounts of highly enriched uranium from 18 countries, helped convert 60 reactors in 32 countries to the use of safer, low-enriched uranium and closed seven reactors.

An operation that is taken in secret (in order, for instance, to retain tactical surprise) but is then later acknowledged openly by the government, is neither clandestine nor covert in nature.

Conetta, Co-Director of the Project for Defense Alternatives, former Research Fellow, Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies, “Forceful Engagement: Rethinking the Role of Military Power in US Global Policy,” Project on Defense Alternatives, December 2008, http://www.comw.org/pda/081201ForcefulEngagement.htm) </span></span>
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">__A key objective of the new administration will be to “rebalance” America’s foreign and security policy “tool kit”, giving greater prominence to diplomacy and other elements of “soft power”__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. And it is easy to see why. The surge in US defense spending and military activity that began ten years ago, and then sharply accelerated after the 11 September 2001 attacks, has had disconcerting results—to say the least. But setting an effective alternative course for US policy will not be as easy to accomplish as some assume. Since 1998, defense spending has risen by 90 percent in real terms, bringing the national defense budget close to $700 billion annually, which represents about 46 percent of global defense expenditure (in purchasing power terms). All told, there are approximately 440,000 US military personnel presently overseas, which is close to the number that was overseas during the last decade of the Cold War. About 200,000 are currently engaged in combat operations and more than 38,000 have been wounded in action or killed since 2001. Despite this prodigious and costly effort, the world today seems, on balance, to be less secure, stable, and friendly than eight years ago. Terrorist activity and anti-Americanism have increased. The nation’s military activity has unsettled its alliances and prompted balancing behavior on the part of potential big power competitors: China and Russia. And there remains no real end in sight for America’s consumptive commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq. Indeed, the scope of US military intervention is expanding. What the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown the world is that the United States, unimpeded by a peer competitor, cannot by its current methods reliably stabilize two impoverished nations comprising only one percent of the world’s population—despite the investment of nearly 5,000 American lives and more than $850 billion. What General David Petreaus once asked of the Iraq war—“Tell me how this ends”—might be asked of the “war on terror” as a whole. The effort waxes and wanes, meandering into every corner of the earth, but shows no sure progress toward an end that might be called “victory.” No great wisdom is needed to suspect that a sea-change in method is due. </span>__Giving greater play to diplomacy and “soft power” is advisable, but not sufficient. More **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">fundamental is the need to roll back America’s over-reliance on military instruments</span>**, which has proved both improvident and counter-productive. That the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>__faces serious security challenges is not at question. Nor at question is the need for energetic global engagement.

It is now experiencing not just diminishing returns, but negative ones__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Thus, America finds itself paying more and more for less and less security. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">Military moderation is</span>__</span>** __also **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">essential to the revival of America’s</span> world reputation and <span style="background: yellow;">leadership position</span></span>**.

This divide helped drive the Bush administration deeper into unilateralism. It was apparent during the 1990s as well, when the rise in anti- American sentiments first made headlines. Indeed, most post-Cold War US military interventions have involved considerable contention with key allies. Even when they join the United States on the battlefield, differences over the use of force re-emerge at the tactical level and with regard to “rules of engagement”. Refiguring the role of force and the armed forces in US policy will not come easily. The current balance is well-rooted ideologically, institutionally, and politically. Some US leaders see it as reflecting America’s unique competitive advantage in the post-Cold War world and as pivotal to America’s strategy for shaping the process of globalization. But </span>__the costly wreck that is recent policy constitutes a strong argument for a change__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. And the advent of a new administration in Washington provides an opportunity to go “back to the drawing board”. Unlike the first post-Cold War administrations, the next one will have the benefit of hindsight—having seen clearly both the nature of today’s security challenges and the downside of adopting an overly-militarized approach to addressing them. Mapping a path out of the current policy cull-de-sac begins with the question, How did we get here? The advent of primacy The end of the East-West Cold War, beginning with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, put the United States at a strategic crossroads that remains relevant today. America entered the new era with a margin of military predominance greater than that enjoyed by any power since Rome in the Augustan age. Suggestive of the change, the US share of world military spending rose from 28 percent in 1986 to 34 percent in 1994. (Today it stands at approximately 46 percent, as noted above.) More relevant was the altered balance of power between the United States and potential adversary states. Again, defense expenditure can serve as a proxy measure. In 1986, America’s adversaries—including Russia, China, and their allies—taken together spent 50 percent more on defense than did the United States. By 1994, this same group was spending 42 percent less than the United States. Although US defense spending actually declined during this period, aggregate spending by the adversary group fell faster and much further. The change affected not only the balance in standing military forces, but also in command of the arms trade and in capacities for military assistance, global military presence, and military research and development. Notably, America’s margin of superiority has grown larger since the mid-1990s, despite increased spending by Russia and China. Today, US defense expenditures— not including war costs—are more than twice as great as those of Russia and China combined (in terms of purchasing power). The end of the Cold War also prompted strategic realignments favoring the United States. As the Soviet bloc disintegrated, former Soviet satellites turned toward the West and then, in 1992, the Soviet Union itself dissolved into 15 separate countries. Former Soviet clients in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere found themselves substantially shorn of material support. Equally important, the contest of ideologies and social systems that had helped animate the Cold War ended. Both Russia and China adopted the posture of ordinary, self-interested great powers. These circumstances presented a historic opportunity to increase global cooperation, advance the demilitarization of international affairs, and claim a permanent peace dividend. The end of the Cold War also brought to the fore a host of transnational problems—terrorism among them—that could be effectively addressed only through broad cooperation. Grasping the promise that was born when the Wall came down proved from the start to be more difficult than many had hoped. One problem was that Russia, China, and other second-tier powers—including core US allies—were unwilling to simply accept American global leadership. On the American side, leaders were unwilling to accept the costs and risks of building out and relying on global institutions and cooperative regimes. The “transaction costs” of deeper cooperation—including implied limits on America’s freedom of action—seemed too high to too many. And, of course, the United States was at odds with much of the world over the prospective role of military power. The primacy principle </span>__Many nations, including America’s partners, have tended to depreciate the utility of American military predominance__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This, because the circumstance that produced it— the Soviet collapse—also seemed to make it less relevant. The US strategic community, by contrast, has been mesmerized by primacy. As Richard Haass, the current president of the Council on Foreign Relations, put it: “The fundamental question that confronts American foreign policy is what to do with a surplus of power and the many and considerable advantages this surplus confers.” To many, America’s new, sole-superpower status seemed to provide the leverage with which it might further enhance its security, extend its position of world leadership, and advance an American vision of world order—a “new rule set”. Implicit in these aspirations was a reorientation of the military from a reactive “defense and deterrence” stance to a more proactive one. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">The exercise of primacy does not</span>__</span>** __necessarily **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">entail military activism</span></span>**, of course__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The United States also possesses abundant “soft power.” But, as “soft power” advocate Joseph Nye (and others) have observed: it is only in the military dimension that the world can be thought to be unipolar. Moreover: military power is the policy instrument that the United States has in greatest supply. The US national defense budget is 15 times as large as the budget for international affairs. And Defense commands 200 times as many people as State. By 1997, military primacy had been codified as the foundation of US post-Cold War security policy. The Quadrennial Defense Review and National Security Strategy documents of that year together asserted that US world leadership was essential to the nation’s security and that leadership, in turn, depended on maintaining America’s distinct global military predominance. Thus, primacy became a security end in its own right and the cornerstone of US global policy. In 2000, Defense Secretary William Cohen publically declared the post-Cold War peace dividend to be over. (How much had America saved? Measured in 2008 dollars, the United States spent $760 billion less on defense during 1991-2000 than it had during the last decade of the Cold War.) To paraphrase former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: many US leaders treated US military primacy as though it were the peace dividend. </span>__A persisting problem, however, is that **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">military primacy </span>does not translate automatically into strategic gains. It <span style="background: yellow;">conveys a unique competitive advantage only if national leaders can put it to effective use</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Otherwise, much of America’s post-Cold War military would amount to nothing more than costly surplus. Former Secretary of State Madeline Albright succinctly captured the problem in a 1993 conversation about the Balkans conflict with then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Colin Powell. Powell had said the options for effective military action in the Balkans conflict were limited. Albright reportedly shot back, “What’s the point of having this superb military, if we can’t use it?” Putting primacy to work Throughout the 1990s, the US national security establishment set to work refiguring how America might effectively put military primacy to work. In doing so, they developed a set of practices and perspectives that continue to frame security policy today. Surveying US policy developments during the post-Cold War period: </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 7pt;">■</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Three successive US administrations have lowered the threshold on using force, undertaking nine significant wars and forceful military interventions in 14 years. (By comparison, the United States undertook only six, small or modest-size combat operations during the period 1975-1989.) </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 7pt;">■</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The ways in which national leadership imagine using force and our armed forces have multiplied, and </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 7pt;">■</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> America’s objectives in war have grown steadily more ambitious. These now include the aim of fighting multiple overlapping wars, achieving fast decisive results, overturning regimes, and sustaining protracted large-scale occupations. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__Beyond the traditional objectives of deterring and defending against aggression, there has been an increasing <span style="background: yellow;">emphasis on trying to use force</span>__</span>** __and forceful pressure **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">to </span>actually “<span style="background: yellow;">prevent the emergence” of threats </span>and, more generally, to stabilize and “shape” the strategic environment</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (as the 1997 US Quadrennial Defense Review put it.) </span>__In the past, threat prevention and “environment shaping” were largely in the purview of the State Department. But a feature of our post-Cold War practice has been the increasing intrusion of the__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Department of Defense (</span>__DOD__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">) </span>__on the provinces of State__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Parallel to this, </span>__diplomatic functions have been increasingly militarized__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Thus, today coercive diplomacy plays a bigger role relative to traditional “quid pro quo” diplomacy. </span>__Similarly, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">“offensive counter-proliferation”—that is, arms control <span style="background: yellow;">by</span> means of <span style="background: yellow;">bombardment or </span>even <span style="background: yellow;">regime change—has grown</span></span>** in importance__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. DOD has even exerted more influence over US programs in support of democratization and development— and this influence is growing. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review strongly advocated for greater Pentagon authority in managing US security partnerships and conducting development assistance programs. Already the Pentagon oversees 22 percent of US official development funds—up from 3.5 percent in 1998. The use of force—a last resort? </span>__One legacy of the 20th century’s great conflicts was the emergence of a general societal presumption against war: the simple idea that war should be an instrument of last and infrequent resort, mostly restricted to defense against aggression__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The reasons are both moral and pragmatic, </span>__having to do with the inherent unpredictability of war and its human cost__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The “last resort” principle embodies an implicit recognition that war constitutes a zone of profound and chaotic effects. Thus, it holds, we mostly should not go to war unless it is forced upon us. The “last resort” principle has been in retreat in US policy since the end of the East-West conflict. President George H.W. Bush first enunciated the shift in a 1993 address at West Point. Therein, he set aside the common “last resort” principle for a more permissive formulation. Rather than last, force might be the preferred option when other approaches were not thought to be as likely to work or to work as well. It is precisely this type of complacent utilitarianism that the last resort principle takes to be inappropriate, given the chaotic and extreme nature of war. A nation’s “war threshold” reflects a number of considerations: For what purposes should a nation resort to military force and threats? What are the diplomatic prerequisites to using force? How soon in a developing clash of interests should force be brought into play? The threshold also pertains to the level of civilian casualties, collateral damage, and general mayhem that a nation is willing to risk. </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">Lowering the threshold on force can mean</span>__</span>** __that the relationship between going to war and national self-defense becomes more attenuated. It can mean that **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">the limits on “pre-emptive” uses of force become looser</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">— or that forceful coercion becomes diplomacy’s routine companion. </span>__It can mean that **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">the “rules of engagement”</span>** within war **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">become more permissive</span>** or that firepower comes to play a greater role in stability operations. It can mean a greater willingness to “go it alone” in prosecuting a war or undertaking it with just a small circle of friends in coalition. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">In sum: all those <span style="background: yellow;">considerations that </span>normally act to <span style="background: yellow;">limit the frequency, extent, and intensity of war become less compelling</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Certainly, the advent of clear US military predominance has figured in the willingness to lower the threshold on using force. Additionally, the dissolution of the Soviet sphere greatly reduced the likelihood that small wars would escalate to large. Especially important is the fact that regional conflicts no longer carry a substantial risk of escalation to global nuclear war. Refiguring threat At the same time that official thinking about the use of force was changing, defense planners (especially at Rand Corporation) began exploring new ways of calibrating threats and managing the security environment. These ideas became important enablers of increased military activism. In 1991, General Colin Powell, who was then Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs, had observed that the Pentagon was “running out of demons.” But as the scale of “clear and present” dangers receded, the Pentagon refocused defense preparation and action on unknown and prospective threats. Emphasizing “uncertainty,” planners relaxed their assumptions about America’s future interests and about the identity of potential foes, their capabilities, and their objectives. Planners lowered the bar on the plausibility of threat scenarios, brought ”worst case” possibilities to the fore, and boosted their estimates of what these might require of our armed forces. </span>__Paradoxically, as the scale and stakes of security challenges declined, the Pentagon adopted more ambitious military objectives, seeking to deploy force ever faster and win wars more quickly and in more than one theater simultaneously__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. One aim was to be prepared to deal quickly and decisively with a very broad range of possible “surprises”. None of these were remotely as serious or immediate as the challenge that had once been posed by the Soviet bloc. And almost none involved attacks on the US homeland. But hedging against the whole set of them worldwide substantially boosted putative defense requirements. </span>__Unfortunately, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">rather than immunizing the <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__against unpleasant surprises, the effort to defeat uncertainty only dissipated America’s resources and attention__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Thus, when Al Qaeda terrorists attacked the United States in 2001, America’s intelligence agencies and armed forces were mostly preoccupied with other concerns. Bioterrorism, missile defense, North Korea, and Chinese military power dominated security discourse in the months before 11 September. This effectively distracted from eight years of strategic warning—beginning with the 1993 World Trade Center attack—and eight months of more immediate warnings regarding Al Qaeda’s interest in attacking the US homeland. A few years later, the armed forces were similarly unprepared for the eventuality of protracted counter-insurgency campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. These </span>__recent failures point to a simple truth: **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Attempts to hedge against uncertainty by preparing in all directions for all scenarios will leave a nation’s defenses less sensitive to and prepared for what is actually emerging</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In fact, the emphasis on “uncertainty” during the past decade has allowed each military service and branch to find some justification for continuing to do and buy what it has been doing and buying for years. Thus, despite years of talk about “transformation”, the US military entered the new century looking not much different than it did in 1990, albeit smaller. It is hubris that leads policy makers and planners to think that America can decisively trump surprise and attain complete security. A better approach to managing uncertainty is to invest more in intelligence, improve America’s capacity to quickly adapt its defenses to new circumstances as they arise, better protect those national assets that are most critical, and ensure that the nation has the fundamental strength to absorb unexpected blows and “bounce back”—as it did after Pearl Harbor. Prevention or provocation? The post-Cold War focus on potential worst case scenarios also increased the attraction of “jumping the gun”— that is, taking action early. “Acting early” can refer to several stratagems—preemption, prevention, or preclusion— each more risk-averse than the one preceding. Preemption involves taking action to spoil an attack that is in its preparatory stages. Prevention, by contrast, involves acting forcefully now against an adversary who officials believe will attempt a serious, unavoidable aggression at some point in future years. Preclusion goes a step further, seeking to remove the possibility of a future aggression even when this eventuality does not seem certain or undeterrable To appreciate the difference among these stratagems, </span>__it helps to dissect the notion of “threat”. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">A “real and present” threat of aggression minimally comprises</span>** a serious clash of interests and **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">the intention, capability, and opportunity to do harm</span>**.

Prevention and preclusion also can target actors who security officials believe are predisposed, due to the nature of their governments or belief systems, to do America significant harm at some point in the future, although they presently lack the capability__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Successive US administrations have marked such recalcitrant state actors as “rogue states” or “axis of evil” states—designations that tend to invite efforts at regime change. Similarly, the failure of some nations and social movements to integrate with the sphere of market democracy is seen as posing a military security problem of growing significance. While the second Bush administration clearly crossed a threshold in attacking Iraq, the notion of applying US military power more proactively than during the Cold War was already well-established before George W. Bush took office. Key precursors and enablers of current policy ideas—such as offensive counter-proliferation, the “rogue state doctrine”, and regime change—were already evident in US policy toward Iraq and elsewhere during the late 1990s. Some of these ideas may survive the Bush administration—although in transmuted form as part of the new enthusiasm for armed nation-building. Does prevention work? Our recent experience shows that </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">treating potential threats as though they are imminent ones can exacerbate tensions and precipitate the outcome that “prevention” is meant to preclude</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Thus, </span>__in addressing the nuclear programs of both North Korea and Iran, America’s coercive efforts spurred, rather than retarded, undesirable behavior__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In the Iraq case, too, a confrontational approach in the run-up to the 2003 war fed the regime’s “bunker-mentality”, making war more likely, not less. Generally, the declaration of “regime change” objectives and the frequent resort to saber-rattling undermine diplomacy and help to precipitate and harden anti-American attitudes and coalitions. </span>__The Iraq case also suggests that preventive uses of military force rest on unrealistic assumptions about our capacity to control outcomes and a serious underestimation of the potential costs and consequences of going to war__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Additionally, the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan illustrate the limits of military occupation as a means of advancing stability and democracy. In both cases, the dominant role of armed foreigners (and their too frequent resort to firepower) have fed and sustained rejectionist movements and sentiments. Using military power to shape the world The most costly peacetime function of the US military in the post-Cold War era is something the 1997 US Defense Review called “environment shaping”. This encompasses America’s worldwide military presence, its alliances and military-to-military contacts, and its arms transfers and military assistance programs. A putative goal of this activity is to nudge nations that are at a “strategic crossroads” to develop in a preferred direction. So, this too is a form of preventive action. First among those nations that Washington sees at a crossroads are China, Russia, India, and Pakistan. “Nudging” is supposed to occur by means of “armed dissuasion”—a process that involves using military assets and activity to “stake out” or strongly assert US interests in a specific situation or outcome. We might think of this as “preemptive deterrence” or “preemptive containment.” The spread of US military bases and partnerships toward the borders of Russia and the increased US naval presence in Asia are supposed to serve a dissuasive function. They are supposed to communicate implicitly that an undesirable competition or confrontation may ensue if Russia or China undertakes a proscribed course of action. Another key objective of dissuasion has been to discourage other countries from initiating arms competitions with the United States and, in this way, preserve American military primacy. How? By creating and maintaining “substantial margins of advantage across key functional areas of military competition”—as Secretary Cheney put it in his 2002 report to Congress. The conceit is to preempt arms races by winning them in advance and, thus, make competition seem hopeless. And so, US military modernization efforts proceed full-bore, despite the absence of anything resembling peer competition. Linking military modernization to the dissuasion of military competition also alters the status of arms control in US policy. The only negotiated agreements that are congruent with the drive for dissuasive power are those that codify or otherwise preserve a distinct US superiority. Does armed dissuasion work? One test of the increased emphasis on militarized environment shaping is relations with Russia and China. Unfortunately, both nations seem less willing today, not more, to accept a “rule set” written in Washington, or to integrate within a global order led by the United States. Both also have responded energetically to the advance of US bases, alliances, missile defense, and military modernization. We cannot assume that US efforts at “preemptive containment” and “preemptive deterrence” are the principal drivers of this behavior, but it is worth re-considering how these practices might be counter-productive. Whether armed dissuasion is provocative or not depends on what behaviors it targets and what rules it seeks to set. Generally speaking: if dissuasive acts impinge on the internal affairs, sovereignty, core interests, or normal prerogatives of a target country, they are more likely to prompt resistance than compliance. The United States might effectively dissuade Chinese naval activism in the Caribbean, for instance—but not in the South China Sea. Likewise, if the United States seems to be claiming extraordinary rights or privileges through dissuasive acts, the targeted nations will either resist complying or strive to alter the power balance between themselves and America. This seems to be precisely what China and Russia are attempting to do as the US network of bases and partnerships gradually surrounds them. Smaller states can respond to shaping efforts by seeking shelter under the strategic umbrella of larger ones. In this way, efforts at militarized “environment shaping” may be adding impetus to a process of global repolarization and remilitarization. This process is apparent in the formation and expansion of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which includes as full members China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The SCO has afforded observer status to India, Iran, Mongolia, and Pakistan. Among its policy priorities are limitations on US efforts to secure new, enduring military bases in Central Asia. Is primacy worth the candle? For more than a dozen years, US policy has been ruled by the “primacy principle”. This is the notion that America’s present condition of distinct military primacy is essential to the nation’s security—not just a fortuitous thing, but a necessary one. What recent practice shows, however, is that </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow;">US leaders have dangerously overestimated the utility of America’s preponderance of military power</span>__</span>**__. At fabulous expense, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow;">the efforts to extend primacy and put it to work have been overwhelmed by</span> unwanted and <span style="background: yellow;">inadvertent effects</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Military primacy is not sustainable, at any rate. Indeed, the more it is exercised, the more it invites balancing behavior on the part of others. In this light, it is important to note that present global disparities in military power do not reflect the global distribution of human and material resources. Today, the United States devotes 70 percent more of its GDP to defense than do other nations, on average. This gap is much higher than the one prevailing in 1985. This means that other nations—China and Russia, among them—have considerable latent capacity to narrow the military gap between themselves and the United States, if they so choose. Something worth contemplating is that none, not even China, are doing all they might to close the military gap—not yet, at least. Why not? Implicit in the “primacy principle” and in the expanded use of America’s armed forces is a wager about the nature of strategic competition today, and about the balance among the strategic challenges that face America and all nations. Most nations—including major US allies and potential competitors—are betting that the military sphere is not the key one. Potential competitors and adversaries, especially, are wagering that America has over-invested itself in the wrong contest, the wrong sphere. The current economic upheaval, which has done more to damage American power than Bin-Laden could ever hope, suggests that they are correct. A litmus for progress </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__Setting a new course in policy begins with acknowledging that the diffuse surge in US military activism__</span>** __that followed the 9/11 attacks **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">has been</span>**, on balance, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">counter-productive</span>**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Looking to the future, </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__national leadership must be more realistic about what can be reliably accomplished by military means__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The most important relationship to keep in mind is not the balance between US power and that of its adversaries, but the balance between US power and US objectives. American leaders also need to be more cognizant of the costs and chaos that attend war. Among these is the risk of unnecessarily adding impetus to global remilitarization and re-polarization. A new cost-benefit calculus must be brought to bear in US military strategy. To escape the paradox of “less security at greater cost”, America’s leaders must rethink the US security policy “problem set” and alter the balance among policy tools. An adequate alternative would emphasize broad multilateral cooperation in containing and resolving regional crises, reducing conflict potentials, and redressing the sources of instability in the international system. And, it would recognize that the sources of instability today are not principally military, political, or ideological in character, but instead economic, demographic, and environmental. The United States should redouble its effort to promote the spread of human rights and democracy. And it should energetically support sustainable development. But these efforts should be demilitarized. And care should be taken to ensure that they do not become or seem to become part of a strategic competition between states or groups of states. The real measure of a renewed US diplomacy will be efforts to reach across current strategic divides—especially to Russia, China, and the Muslim world—and find common ground. Cooperation on water, food, energy, and health security, global warming, economic development, and the management of globalization could serve as a foundation for cooperation on more divisive issues. Regarding these divisive issues, a re-emphasis on traditional “quid pro quo” diplomacy will pay higher dividends than will the resort to coercive diplomacy and saber rattling. </span>__In the future, America’s armed forces should focus more narrowly on containing, deterring, and defending against actual threats of violence to critical national interests__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Efforts at “environment shaping” and “threat prevention”, which currently preoccupy much of the US military, are most appropriately the job of the State Department. Peace and stability operations are important and will remain so—but they should be undertaken only as multilateral affairs under the auspices of inclusive international institutions. To be successful, they must be based on strong global, regional, and local consensus. They are not wars and should not be prosecuted as such. Generally speaking, the rules of engagement in such efforts—and in counter-insurgency campaigns as well—should become more restrictive, not less. The struggle for meaningful transformation During the first two years of the Obama administration, all of America’s defense guidance will be reviewed and, to an unknown extent, rewritten. The impediments to adequate policy change are substantial. Several factors predispose the American polity to a dependence on military power and on its exercise in international affairs. First, popular domestic assent to US global activism characteristically has depended on such activism being framed as a “security issue”—a matter of “defending forward”. This maps a path to globalism that accords with deep-seated “American exceptionalist” and “isolationist” sentiments. So does a preference for emphasizing “decisive” (that is, military) means—because these seem to promise a quick, clear, and surgical form of engagement. Thus, past surges in US global activism have been war-driven—in 1917, 1941, and 1950—with peacetime engagement thereafter almost continuously framed in terms of “Cold War”. Today, the “war on terror” defines a politically practicable path for global activism. Unfortunately, as an overall framework for foreign policy, it favors the wrong mix of instruments. Still, it may be difficult to form a domestic consensus around an alternative path—that is, a path that does not rely on a war frame (as former president Bill Clinton learned during the 1990s). A second impediment to change is that </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__the institutional base of America’s security policy discourse strongly favors <span style="background: yellow;">a militarized view</span>—<span style="background: yellow;">that</span> is, <span style="background: yellow;">the “Pentagon lens” predominates</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The defense establishment enjoys an unmatched capacity to broadly convey its assessment of the global security environment and US security requirements. DOD and the services employ thousands of personnel to communicate their perspectives to various constituencies. And they heavily court retired officers and government officials who routinely serve the news media as “independent analysts”. Finally, DOD and the services sustain a network of policy centers and contracted think tanks whose aggregate size rivals those in the public sphere. (Expenditures for DOD’s “studies and analysis centers” surpass $200 million annually, excluding research laboratories. By contrast, the largest nongovernmental “think tank” devoted principally to foreign and security affairs—the right-of-center Center for Strategic and International Studies—had a 2005 budget of $28 million.) </span>__Like all bureaucracies, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">DOD and the services</span>** tend to see and represent the world in terms of their own defining missions and functions.

Of course this arrangement has come under fire in the postwar period on a number of policy grounds. Some critics have argued, for example, that fundamental political and technological changes in the character of international relations and the position of the United States in the world have rendered obsolete an eighteenth-century document designed for a peripheral, small state in the European system of diplomatic relations. Moreover, it has been asserted that quick action and a single, authoritative voice are necessary to deal with an increasingly complex, interdependent, and technologically linked world capable of massive destruction in a very short period of time. Extollers of presidential dominance have also contended that only the president has the qualitative information, the expertise, and the capacity to act with the necessary dispatch to conduct U.S. foreign policy.

Moreover, most of the disputes at stake between the executive and legislative branches in foreign affairs, including the issues discussed in this chapter, have virtually nothing to do with the need for rapid response to crisis.
