<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Some short sea shipping operations are already moving freight in the United States, and Matsuda wants to help them expand. "These are the experts, these are people who have started up new markets in the past," he said. "They know the industry, they know the people and the operations."</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Matsuda is clear about engaging existing operators. "The government~’s role here is really to help promote these and get them up and running," he said.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 6pt;"> "</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We can talk to local transportation planners and say, ~’Hey, here are some of the federal programs that help.~’ There~’s a limited amount of federal dollars to put towards buying cranes or barges or fixing up a port or something that we need to have up and running."</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 6pt;">Some projects are economic no-brainers, such as moving overweight or hazardous materials, where the cost of obtaining road permits would be prohibitive for truck shipments. In most cases, however, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">in order for a project to make sense and for shippers to make money,MARAD must identify corridors with strong two-way traffic so empty ships don~’t ply the waters.</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 6pt;">A good example of such a project is a proposed Green Trade Corridor in California, a project funded by %2430 million of TIGER funds that connects the inland agricultural areas and the Port of Oakland by a marine highway.</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Currently, goods from Asia come into the port of Oakland and are trucked across the state while agricultural products are trucked in the opposite direction. "It~’s a tax on commuters, and it adds to the congestion, beats up the bridges and raises the cost of maintaining infrastructure," said Matsuda</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 6pt;">. "It~’s not just getting the trucks off the road, but also putting people to work in some of these areas that are really devastated."</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">A marine highway would move some of that traffic onto barges</span>


<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">and guarantee two-way traffic for the company operating the barges.</span>

Reject the affirmative – their failure to question the indebtedness of their intellectual project to institutions is mired in the very privilege they sanctimoniously criticize – your obligation as an intellectual is to struggle against becoming the object and instrument of power.

The aff’s choice to frame their plan in terms of the USFG as the agent of action mediates our relationship to other people, removing their personal responsibility for action and displacing it onto the state- this perspective makes possible everyday violence

Scientific discourse... causes.
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The impact turns the case- the decision to externalize power and responsibility onto the state removes individual responsibility and personal reflection, calculating them in terms of state action- that prevents empathetic identification with others and ensures their project of looking towards the cosmos fails</span>
