This ultimately results in the violent scapegoating of those who can't fit in — we would rather sacrifice them than give up on our desire for utopia. Vote negative to reject the affirmative which allows for the revelation of this process of fantasy and symptom, exposing the fiction at the core of the affirmative's political project</span>**
