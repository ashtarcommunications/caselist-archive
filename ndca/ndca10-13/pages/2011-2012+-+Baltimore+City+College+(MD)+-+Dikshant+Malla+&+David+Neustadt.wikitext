**The United States federal government should establish space as common heritage.**

**A hegemonic neoliberalism utilizing nation building, party politics, the military industrial complex, and a fundamental motive of profit are increasingly the drive of the US into space. This is characterized by an increasing privatization and deregulation of space interests, increasingly foreclosing indigent access.**

Even when the specific language of ...value calculus cannot discern any problem.

**The United States federal government should develop space as common**

**We redefine what it means to develop space – reappropriating space under the common heritage principle allows for a reduction in the imperialist and neoliberal status quo in space toward a more equal use of space – redistribution and reappropriation of resources, technology, and energy for a more collective society**

==2AC Framework (Against Centennial MK)== 
**The affirmative presents an integration of power relations without tying that interrogation to a specific mechanism outside of the debate community. They become the revolutionary hero who limits analysis to one scenario instead of formulating strategy to turn theory into replicatable praxis – their strategy is that of the armchair philosopher**

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">We see that... in a desired manner</span>

**Adopting a view of power based on philosophical abstraction turns their attempts to engage politics because minorities need to have political analysis that relates to the material conditions they face. They make debate less relevant for people of color**

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">It is sadly ironic....critical practices which would support radical liberation struggle </span>

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Contextualizing analysis of oppression around material change is essential to provide political training to make more effective advocates.

The Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis (IFPA) is an conservative research and strategic planning organization that specializes in issues of national security, foreign policy, political economics, and government-industrial relations.
The IFPA was founded in 1976 by a seed grant from the Scaife Family Trust to focus on "the danger of international communism and the need for a strong defense for the United States."..........
On April 8, 1992, Pfaltzgraff wrote a piece for the Wall Street Journal praising the Raytheon-produced Patriot missile, and attacking MIT professor's Dr. Theodore Postol's questioning of its effectiveness. Other members of the IFPA sung the praises of the Raytheon corporations Patriot missile as well. In the fiscal year 1991, Raytheon's Missile Systems Division had donated $60,000 to the IFPA.
