*Hecker --- prof at Stanford, emeritus director of Los Alamos National Laboratory

The seemingly new uranium enrichment facility in North Korea is increasing concerns that the Stalinist state could provide the equipment to recipients such as Iran...build global support for increased pressure on regime leaders (Matt Spetalnick, Reuters III, Nov. 24).

**Troop withdrawal is the lynchpin for Chinese cooperation**
**Carpenter 8/3/10 [**Ted Galen Carpenter, *vice president for defense and foreign-policy studies at the Cato Institute, PhD in history, China Spats, http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/china-spats-3778]

Relations between China and the United States have become decidedly testy in recent weeks. Sharp disagreements over policy toward North Korea and the status of disputed...American military bases in Korea if the North Korean threat were neutralized. Yet Washington has not offered the slightest hint of concessions on either issue. U.S. officials implicitly expect Beijing to accept the risks entailed in getting tough with Pyongyang but receive nothing at all in return.

**Cooperation is key to effective economic sanctions**
**Gyeong-seob 12/21/10 [**By Oh Gyeong-seob, *secretary general of Network for North Korean Democracy and Human Rights & Research Fellow at the Sejong Institute, date last modified: 12/21/10, International Cooperation for the Denuclearization of North Korea: Limitations and Alternatives, http://www.koreafocus.or.kr/design2/layout/content_print.asp?group_id=103198, accessed on: 1/5/11, nrbontha]

2. China’s Non-participation in International Sanctions
International efforts to disarm North Korea have failed because of China’s reluctance to participate in sanctions on the North...North’s external trade and up to 35 percent fall in its gross domestic product. On the contrary, China’s non-participation greatly reduces the effect of the sanctions.

**Only sanctions solve proliferation**

Reactions to the North Korean nuclear question can be divided into two contrasting approaches. The moderate school favors dialogue as the primary means of solution and the hard-line school gives weight to sanctions...let alone carry them out, because nations are afraid of being deceived by others. Those are the two key obstacles to international cooperation in the denuclearization of North Korea.

**AND, diplomacy fails --- hard-line solutions are key**

Some experts have claimed that North Korea would give up its nuclear programs when a peace treaty is concluded between the North and the United States...It is unrealistic to expect North Korea to forsake its nuclear programs on the back of international assurances.

**Cimbala 10 [**Stephen, *Prof. of Political Science @ Penn State, Nuclear Weapons and Cooperative Security in the 21st Century, p. 117-8]

Failure to contain proliferation in Pyongyang could spread nuclear fever throughout Asia. Japan and South Korea might seek nuclear weapons and missile defenses. ... systems might cause one side to misinterpret the other’s defensive moves to forestall attack as offensive preparations for attack, thus triggering a mistaken preemption.

Tensions ran perilously high on the Korean peninsula in the months ... this imperative would likely prove irresistible especially for South Korean leaders, who would likely see it as a historic but possibly fleeting opportunity to reunify the peninsula.

Intelligence analysts and academics report that North Korea has developed anthrax, plague, and botulism toxin and conducted extensive research on smallpox, typhoid and cholera. ... impossible to trace. The technology to develop biological agents is widely available for legitimate purposes and large quantities can be developed within days.

**Bioweapons cause extinction**

Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life ... The game is over. If patriotism would extinguish humanity, then patriotism is the highest of all crimes.

**Only withdrawal prevents US involvement and conflict escalation**

Notwithstanding its occupations of two nations — Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. Empire is at it again, fulfilling its role as the world’s international policeman, this time with respect to North Korea.

The United States believes that if the North collapsed, China would have to back reunification to demonstrate that it is a responsible player in regional cooperation...China would probably ask for a U.S. troop withdrawal as a precondition to the reunification of the two Korea’s under a liberal and democratic government.

Text: **The United States federal government should negotiate a bilateral defense treaty with the government of Afghanistan that unequivocally commits to removing the Taliban from Afghanistan. The United States should adopt a counterinsurgency strategy that is primarily centered on protecting the Afghanistan population, and should provide all necessary resources to implement this strategy, including making the surge part of a permanent commitment to Afghanistan and clarifying that it has no withdrawal deadline. The United States should freeze the size of its training commitment to the Afghan National Army and focus on training for quality over quantity, locating ANA divisions in their local provinces, and training an ANA helicopter division for mobile operations.**
