==**Rethinking the Frontier**== 
**SPACE...THE FINAL FRONTIER.**

**SINCE THE DAWN OF MANKIND – FOR MOST PEOPLE WANDERING THE EARTH – THIS SEEMINGLY ENDLESS WONDERLAND HAS BEEN NOTHING MORE THAN SOMETHING TO GAZE INTO. BUT TO THOSE UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THAT THERE EXISTS NATURAL BOUNDARIES IN THIS LIFE, SPACE HAS BECOME THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE – A COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED CRADLE OF BEAUTY WAITING TO BE CLAIMED.**

**AND IN MODERN WESTERN CIVILIZATION, THIS CHALLENGE HAS BEEN ACCEPTED.**

**THESE ARE THE VOYAGES OF THE WEST. ITS MISSION: TO EXPLORE STRANGE NEW WORLDS, TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS, TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE...TO RECREATE THE AMERICAN IDENTITY IN ITS IMAGE.**

**WE BEGIN** //**OUR**// **DISCUSSION OF THIS YEAR'S RESOLUTION WITH SUCH A VOYAGE.**

**THIS REPRODUCTION OF THE AMERICAN IDENTITY HAS BEEN PRESENT SINCE THE VERY DISCOVERY OF THE NEW WORLD, EXCEPT NOW THE ERROND IN THE WILDERNESS HAS BECOME THE WEST’S ERROND IN THE UNIVERSE. THE PURITANS ATTEMPTED TO REPROUDCE ITS CULTURE AND PRACTICE ONTO THE INDIGINOUS WORLD DISGUISED IN BY THE VALE OF ASSISTANCE OR DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS KNOWN AS THE JEREMIAD, AND SUCH AN EXCEPTIONALIST DRIVE TO EXIST CAN ONLY RESULT IN THE MOST EXTREME FORMS OF IMPERIALISM.**

**IT IS THIS IDENTITY REBORN IN SPACE THAT RENEWS THE ONTOLOGICAL TRADITION OF WESTERN METAPHYSICS, OF VIEWING EXISTANCE FROM ABOVE AS A MEANS TO DECIDE WHAT OUGHT TO EXIST WITHIN THE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES OF OUR UNIVERSE DISPITE THE FACT THAT THESE POSSIBILITIES WILL ALWAYS BE UNTAMABLE.**

**WE CHOOSE THE LATTER -- IT IS THIS CONTRAST THAT IS KNOWN AS THE NOTHING OF OUR POLITICAL PROJECTS, AND IS VIEWED AS DANGEROUS TO THE WESTERN IMPERIALIST MACHINE, JUSTIFYING ANY MEANS OF ELIMINATION IN THE NAME OF SECURING WESTERN POWER AND DOMINANCE.**

**THE DOMINANT FORM OF KNOWLEDGE, OF POWER, AND OF SOCIETY WISHES TO ERASE “THE NOTHING” FROM THE “SOMETHING”…TO RID THINGS CONTRARY TO NORMALITY FROM WHAT IS PREFERRED OR VIEWED AS ACCEPTABLE. IT IS THIS “SOMETHING” THAT IS MOST NOTABLY KNOWN IN THE POLITICAL AND THE SOCIAL AS THE WEST…THE DOMINANT…THE POWERFUL…AND THE RIGHT. IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPTION OF IMPERIAL LOGIC, WHICH IS TO SAY, THE SOMETHING, AND ITS RELATION TO WESTERN THINKING, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND METAPHYSICS AND ITS EXISTANCE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THIS WORLD. TO THINK METAPHYSICALLY IS TO THINK IN SUCH A WAY THAT ONE VIEWS ITSELF ABOVE OR BEYOND THE OBJECT, MAKING SUCH AN OBJECT ABLE TO BE MANIPULATED AND USED BY THE SUBJECT FOR THE SUBJECT’S SAKE…TO VIEW THE SUBJECT WITH A PURPOSE AND NOTHING MORE…TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO A PART OF THE “SOMETHING”…IT BECOMES CIVILIZED. IF THERE EXISTS NO PURPOSE FOR THE OBJECT, THAN THE OBJECT IS SEEN AS USELESS AND DISPOSABLE…AND AN EVEN WORSE FATE AWAITS AN OBJECT THAT THREATENS THE SUBJECT, FOR THREATS SHAN’T BE TOLERATED, ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF STRUGGLE…AND UNTIL THE “NOTHING”, EVERYTHING THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF THE WEST AND ALL OF ITS GLORY IS GONE, SUCH A STRUGGLE WON’T END. SUCH IS THE DESTRUCTIVE NATURE OF THE SOMETHING, AND ITS QUEST FOR SAMENESS.**


**IT IS MORE SPECIFICALLY THE TOPICAL NOTHING IN WHICH WE AFFIRM AKA THE ASPECTS OF THE RESOLUTION THAT ARE ALWAYS PUSHED ASIDE FROM WHAT IT MEANS TO BE SOMETHING CONSTANTLY DRIVEN TO THE MARGINS OF POLITICAL DECISION MAKING BECAUSE THERE IS ALWAYS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE’RE TOLD SHOULD BE THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE IT.**
