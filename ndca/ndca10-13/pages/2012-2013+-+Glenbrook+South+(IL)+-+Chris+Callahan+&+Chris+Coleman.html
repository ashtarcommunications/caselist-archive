<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In surveys transport is the most commonly cited local problem, disproportionately so among disabled people (48% v. 39%: DPTAC¶ 1¶ 2002). People with¶ disabilities affecting their ability to travel make considerably fewer trips than¶ those without. This can mean less access to education, employment, health¶ services, social events, and leisure: all essential for social inclusion.¶ Policy responses remain inadequate. The 1995 Disability Discrimination Act¶ explicitly excluded transport vehicles from accessibility requirements; while¶ they’ve recently modiﬁed this, the current government suggests 2020 as the¶ target for train compliance. Moreover, policy focus on accessible buildings may¶ be at the expense of transport-related accessibility. New Private Finance Initiative¶ hospitals may improve building accessibility yet result in services moving to less¶ accessible out-of-town sites (Aldred 2007). Similarly, Post Ofﬁce closures¶ adversely affect many disabled people.¶ Disability movement writers stress the profound failures of public transport to¶ accommodate disabled people; these are compounded by deregulation and privatisation. Perhaps because of this the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) wants to¶ ensure that measures to limit environmental and health harms of car use do not¶ apply to disabled car owners. Lobby group Mobilise calls pedestrian schemes¶ “of particular concern”, keeps a “close watch” on the “anti-car lobby” and is integration through motorisation (Mobilise undated). Although the DRC¶ and disabled people’s organisations support inclusive walking environments, in¶ a car-dominant society this message is marginalised.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The inequities of mobility and movement are connected to sociocultural values and practices which prioritise mobile bodies or those characterised by societally defined norms of health, fitness, and independence of bodily movements. Such bodies are, as Ellis (2000, page 5) notes, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:00:``naturalised as a biological given'' and projected as `` -->naturalised as a biological given'' and projected as <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:00 -->the legitimate basis of order in a humanist world''. Illustrative of this are the plethora of metaphors of mobility and movement which are infused with conceptions of bodily completeness and independence, of the (normal) body far removed from those with physical and mental impairments. Such representations counterpoise the mobile body to reinforce what Oliver (1990) refers to as a <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:01:``legacy of negativism'', or values which mark out disabled people as `` -->legacy of negativism'', or values which mark out disabled people as <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:01 -->problems because they are seen to deviate from the dominant culture's view of what is desirable, normal, socially acceptable, and safe'' (Corker, 1999, page 20; in addition, see Abberley, 1987; Paterson and Hughes, 1999). In this paper, I argue that assumptions of unrestricted movement and mobility in contemporary Western societies are hegemonic in prioritising specific bodies and modes of mobility and movement. (2) In particular, mobility and movement are defined through discourses which serve to alienate impaired bodies and to prioritise the movement of what one might term `the mobile body'. In exploring such ideas, the paper is divided into three parts. The first part is a discussion of the hegemonic discourses of the body in relation to mobility and movement. This is followed by an empirical exploration, through self-testimonies, of disabled people's experiences of movement and mobility. I conclude by exploring some of the practical and political possibilities for challenging the hegemonic discourses of the body, mobility, and movement.</span><br />

<strong>This plays into a broader narrative of <u>fear</u> and <u>disgust</u> towards the “broken body” that has been coopted by policy decisions – this refusal to accept our own finitude is the root cause of status quo inequities</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While both concurring with and expanding upon Eiesland’s sociological insights, I suggest also that disability refers us to a deep anxiety inherent in humanism’s relation to the flesh—a fear of being “humiliated” (from the same Latin root as “humus” or earth) by life. When bodies are labeled “disabled,” society marks out and makes these refused others carry the dread fear of the precarious vulnerability of flesh. Feminist philosopher Mary Daly was well aware that “sex racism” had in no small way to do with the “mind-binding societal/ mental embeds” within consciousness—with, for example, women’s loathing of our own flesh—and thus with grueling regimes of self-surveillance on behalf of patriarchy. That we might today speak of a regime change, might acknowledge living amid the aesthetic phase of globalizing capitalism, does not invalidate, but might actually exacerbate feminist and disability concerns for the ways in which disgust and dread have been shaped into culturally powerful, “mind-binding,” if positivist forces—namely, “the politics of health.” The ways in which Western culture encourages the anxious conscience to patrol the flesh, which tears, tears up, trembles, tables, and tires, might lead in one instance to those social technologies of food disorders and surgical enhancements, readily fit to the female form. In another instance, it creates an economic and cultural structure of exclusion named “disability,” thereby categorically multiplying abject and economically “waste/d” bodies. Cultural normativity still harbors and indulges that psychically comforting, because controlling, power of totalization—in this case, as somatic, morphological reification. Disability studies can remind feminism about aesthetics: when wed to representational totalization (as with “the body”), aesthetics can become “mind numbing.” Feminist theology can learn again from disability theology the insidiousness of the politics of health and how women might be tempted to metabolize that politics so as to embody acceptable hetero-femininities—out of both conforming pleasure and the fear of defect. Consequently, it seems to me, that this terrain of the flesh—where dread and disgust and humiliation get played out, in economic, cultural, and political, if also deeply personal registers— marks still or yet again an important site of shared work between feminist and disability theologians. One possible way forward might be this: As ecology must now learn to do without that romantic neologism “Nature,”10 perhaps feminist as also disability theologians must learn to think flesh without “the body.” Theological Practice with the Flesh in Mind Eiesland first ventured to think disability theology within a liberationist methodology. While the disability rights movement has made political headway in the United States, the liberationist model has not necessarily proven very amenable to disability. Even as I find myself in emphatic agreement with disability theorists’ sensibility that the construction of “disability” creates a structure of social exclusion, the public stubbornly sees “disability” as individual pathology. That disability seems so categorically apparent to the public, thus suggests to me that persons religious (Christians being those with whom I’m most familiar) too remain within the scope of a totalizing force—of the idealism of “the body.” If Christian theology is, for one example, to separate itself from the aspirations of aesthetic capitalism, it needs to release this overdetermined body and its judgmental conscience (aspirational “wholeness” constitutes a frequent liturgical litany) so as to lean into an alternative, posthumanist philosophy of the capaciousness of the flesh—surely, with limits, but not necessarily split between wholeness/brokenness. Flesh names a locus of flux; insomuch as flesh differs with itself day to day, flesh situates difference as preceding identity. While I cannot speak for other religious traditions, Christian theology, given that God presumably enters into finitude, constituting thereby something of a metaphysical reversal, should not be so surprised by the fact that “life happens.”11 Because the Western cultural politics of health can and do exclude along the lines of wholeness/brokenness, I’d like to propose two theological options for cultivating religious practice in relation to the flesh—the first, hoping to build upon the ways in which Buddhist philosophies deal with the formations of fear, disgust, and dread; the second, an encouragement for theology to recuperate a discourse or theological pedagogy for pain. Following upon these proposals, I point out several other theological venues where disability and feminist theologies might share a co-incidence of interest. First, when disability theology begins from the terrain of the flesh (rather than assuming, as culturally prescribed, the outlines of the deficient body), one point of interruption that comes immediately into view is the psychosocial structure creating exclusion of persons disabled: flesh names, as Judith Butler has put it, a “precarious . . . vulnerability to the other”;12 consequently, anxiety, fear, disgust, dread, and shame haunt the flesh and can be borrowed by cultural technologies like the politics of health. Eiesland herself was aware of the fact that the stigmatization of disabled persons, resulting in institutionalized forms of discrimination, involves “conditions of the modern human psyche.”13 Disgust—that formation of sentient consciousness caught on the cusp of always already offering up judgment about fleshy matters—as philosopher Martha Nussbaum points out, has become part of social stigmas and cultural norms and, most dangerously, has even been instantiated in laws (as, for example, where disability is concerned, the “ugly laws”).14 Disgust might be that formation of consciousness most easily co-opted by the generative power of cultural normativity. For example, as I am shamed for refusing prosthetic rehabilitation (according to a visual cultural norm not particularly interested in my physical capaciousness), so even very young girls cannot evade cultural messages aggravating body dissatisfaction. When “successful,” these messages culminate in self-surveillance, which makes the production of the work of art named “the body”—in romantic relief—a primary preoccupation—often thereby foreclosing upon energies that might have been expended toward matters of democratic citizenship or other collective interests.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Most of us expect to be able to move around the built environment with ease of access and entry into buildings. For Blomley (1994, page 413), <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:02:``rights and entitlement attached to mobility have long had a hallowed place within the liberal pantheon and, as such, mobility is part of the democratic revolution''. For instance, in the United States and Canada, mobility rights are formally enshrined in legislation and mobility is considered as fundamental to the liberty of the human body. As Hobbes (1996, page 57) has argued, `` -->rights and entitlement attached to mobility have long had a hallowed place within the liberal pantheon and, as such, mobility is part of the democratic revolution''. For instance, in the United States and Canada, mobility rights are formally enshrined in legislation and mobility is considered as fundamental to the liberty of the human body. As Hobbes (1996, page 57) has argued, <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:02 -->liberty or freedom, signifieth, properly, the absence of opposi- tion; by opposition, I mean external impediments of motion''. This, then, suggests that movement and mobility are intrinsically `good things'; practices which ought to be propagated as ends in themselves. Others see mobility as a means to an end and a mechanism for opening up opportunities. For instance, Maat and Louw (1999, page 160) assume that <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:03:``mobility gives people the opportunity to develop themselves socially and economically'' and Marshall (1999, page 4), who says that `` -->mobility gives people the opportunity to develop themselves socially and economically'' and Marshall (1999, page 4), who says that <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:03 -->to be going places is to be getting on'', clearly considers mobility to be a valued commodity.(3) For many people, their inability to go places or restrictions on their mobility and movement is of paramount importance in their everyday lives. Children, for example, are often not permitted to travel unaccompanied on airlines and find their access to places reduced by heavy doors and high counters.(4) A raft of research also highlights the gendered nature of mobility and, in particular, women's unequal access to trans- port (Huxley, 1997; Little et al, 1988; Massey, 1994; Matrix, 1984; Wajcman, 1991). Likewise, the mobility of ethnic minorities is often confined to particular times of day and places because of fear of racial abuse and physical assault (Greater London Council, 1985; Wajcman, 1991). Moreover, elderly people often find their movement and mobility restricted by virtue of a poorly designed built environment, including narrow and uneven pavements and steep steps into shops (Hine, 1999; Hine and Mitchell, 2001). Such illustrations indicate that the mobility and movement of a large segment of the population are limited by existing patterns of transportation provision and related infrastructure, and this is particularly so for disabled people. Barnes et al (1999, page 121), for instance, note that UK households with a disabled person are half as likely as those without to own a car (also, see OPCS, 1993). In addition, most cars are designed for standardised bodies and few mobility-impaired or ambulant impaired disabled people are able to get into one. Specially adapted cars are expensive, and insurers regard disabled people as a risk and charge high motor insurance pre miums. These experiences are connected to the domination of medical discourses which are infused with conceptions of the incapacitated and immobile body, or the body which is malfunctioning due to a loss of functional capacity. Disabled people are portrayed as less than whole and as a population requiring particular forms of regulation, discipline, and control by state programmes and policies. Indeed, Levi-Strauss (1955) refers to modern societies as anthropoemic or, as Young (1999, page 56) defines it, societies that <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:04:``vomit out deviants, keeping them outside of society or enclosing them in special institutions''. Such discourses see disability as a social burden which is a private, not public, responsibility. The impairment is the focus of concern, and biological intervention and care are seen as the appropriate responses. The problem of immobility is seen as personal and specific to the impairment; that it is this that needs to be eradicated, rather than transformations in sociocultural attitudes and practices, if mobility is to be restored. In particular, political and policy assumptions about mobility and movement are premised on a universal, disembodied subject which is conceived of as neutered, that is without sex, gender, or any other attributed social or biological characteristic (see Hall, 1996; Imrie, 1994; Law, 1999; Whitelegg, 1997). The hegemony of what one might term the mobile body is decontextualised from the messy world of multiple and everchanging embodiments; where there is little or no recognition of bodily differences or capabilities. The mobile body, then, is conceived of in terms of independence of movement and bodily functions; a body without physical and mental impairments. The hegemony of the mobile body is also reinforced by professional discourses which seek to measure, characterise, and understand disability through the movement and mobility of disabled people's body parts. Such conceptions see disabled people as neither sick nor well but in a liminal state which is characterised by a (potential) movement from one bodily state to another (also, see Ellis, 2000; Leder, 1990; Paterson and Hughes, 1999). The underlying objective is the disciplining of the deviant or impaired body through the restoration of movement in body parts to facilitate independence of mobility (and the restoration of the `whole person'). For Ellis (2000), such (welfare) discourses emphasise the importance of individuals attaining an `independent body', or a body which revolves around self management, personal responsibility, and the projection of desirable bodily characteristics. As Ellis (2000, page 17) suggests, it is a carnality which propagates the aestheticisation of the body while seeking to exclude those (impaired) bodies which are, so some claim, a source of anxiety in contemporary culture (see, for instance, Lupton, 1994) Indeed, as Paterson and Hughes (1999, page 604) argue, `` -->vomit out deviants, keeping them outside of society or enclosing them in special institutions''. Such discourses see disability as a social burden which is a private, not public, responsibility. The impairment is the focus of concern, and biological intervention and care are seen as the appropriate responses. The problem of immobility is seen as personal and specific to the impairment; that it is this that needs to be eradicated, rather than transformations in sociocultural attitudes and practices, if mobility is to be restored. In particular, political and policy assumptions about mobility and movement are premised on a universal, disembodied subject which is conceived of as neutered, that is without sex, gender, or any other attributed social or biological characteristic (see Hall, 1996; Imrie, 1994; Law, 1999; Whitelegg, 1997). The hegemony of what one might term the mobile body is decontextualised from the messy world of multiple and everchanging embodiments; where there is little or no recognition of bodily differences or capabilities. The mobile body, then, is conceived of in terms of independence of movement and bodily functions; a body without physical and mental impairments. The hegemony of the mobile body is also reinforced by professional discourses which seek to measure, characterise, and understand disability through the movement and mobility of disabled people's body parts. Such conceptions see disabled people as neither sick nor well but in a liminal state which is characterised by a (potential) movement from one bodily state to another (also, see Ellis, 2000; Leder, 1990; Paterson and Hughes, 1999). The underlying objective is the disciplining of the deviant or impaired body through the restoration of movement in body parts to facilitate independence of mobility (and the restoration of the `whole person').

These send out specific signals or codes which favour the corporeal status of nonimpaired people, or at least do little to facilitate the independent ease of movement of people with physical and mental impairments. (5) This, for Paterson and Hughes (1999, page 606), is indicative of <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:05:``a subtle interplay of micro and macro relations of power'', where specific design features, for example, prioritise forms of movement based on the bodily needs of the neutered body (which is devoid of physical and mental impairments). In this sense, intercorporeal encounters between the hegemonic world of the mobile body and disabled people tend to reinforce the former's sense of presence and the latter's sense of absence, in other words a recognition of disabled people being there but being unable to interact with the social or physical structures which surround them. It is, in Leder's (1990) terms, a projection of the absent body or bodies which `` -->a subtle interplay of micro and macro relations of power'', where specific design features, for example, prioritise forms of movement based on the bodily needs of the neutered body (which is devoid of physical and mental impairments). In this sense, intercorporeal encounters between the hegemonic world of the mobile body and disabled people tend to reinforce the former's sense of presence and the latter's sense of absence, in other words a recognition of disabled people being there but being unable to interact with the social or physical structures which surround them. It is, in Leder's (1990) terms, a projection of the absent body or bodies which <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:05 -->dys-appear'' when confronted with the embodied norms of everyday life [see Paterson and Hughes (1999) for an amplification of these points]. The dys-appearance of disabled people's bodies is not unconnected to the work of transportation planners and operators who, as Whitelegg (1997, page 14) notes, make <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:06:``decisions about what kinds of travel are important and which journey purposes and destinations are to be favoured''. In particular, the impaired body is largely invisible in transportation planning and policy or, as Law (1999, page 566) notes, `` -->decisions about what kinds of travel are important and which journey purposes and destinations are to be favoured''. In particular, the impaired body is largely invisible in transportation planning and policy or, as Law (1999, page 566) notes, <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:06 -->bodies appear in conventional transportation models as discrete entities with independent trajectories''. As Whitelegg (1997) suggests, this leads to the provision of transportation infrastructure which tends to prioritise the movement and mobility of <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:07:``productive bodies'' between a limited range of destinations (also, see Marshall, 1999). Thus, mobility policies largely revolve around the provision of commuter networks between home and the workplace, seeking to facilitate movement which is limited to specific social, geographical, and temporal ranges. (6) The effect is, as Huxley (1997, page 2) observes, one of reducing mobility to `` -->productive bodies'' between a limited range of destinations (also, see Marshall, 1999). Thus, mobility policies largely revolve around the provision of commuter networks between home and the workplace, seeking to facilitate movement which is limited to specific social, geographical, and temporal ranges. (6) The effect is, as Huxley (1997, page 2) observes, one of reducing mobility to <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:07 -->predictable, purposeful trips, origins and destinations'' rather than seeking to conceive of mobility as ``a messy, unpredictable, diverse and changeable reality''. Such observations are apt in relation to the ways in which disabled people's mobility needs are conceived of by policymakers, where there is a tendency to categorise disabled people's corporeality in essentialist terms. As previous research suggests, it is common- place for disabled people to be defined as having walking difficulties or an impairment that confines them to a wheelchair (Imrie, 1996). These definitions are problematical because they fail to recognise the diversity of physical and mental impairments and the often conflicting and different mobility needs of different categories of (disabled) people (Imrie, 1996). They also have the potential to reduce the provision of modes of mobility to particular types which might, as a consequence, be inattentive to the corporeal diversity of disabled people. Thus, although it is common for public buildings to provide ramps to facilitate wheelchair access, it is less so to see signage, texture, or colour coding of a type which provides ease of sight, direction, and communication to vision-impaired people and those with learning difficulties (see Imrie, 1996; Royal National Institute for the Blind, 1995).</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The real problem in this existential mire is not disability but non-disability, those normative and ideal ‘clean and proper’ bodies that got a mention in the last paragraph. Let me expand this argument by way of a quick detour. In studying the phenomenon of white attraction to black ethnicity and style bell hooks (1992, p. 29) noted by way of explanation that: ‘One desires a “bit of the other” to enhance the blank landscape of whiteness’. She described this desire as ‘eating the other’ and is critical of it as a form of majority culture guilt for its long historical involvement in slavery and racism that manifests itself in a desire to consume the exotic. This approach to difference is, in my view, not something that is apparent in the relationship between disabled and non-disabled people, because non-disabled people do not desire a ‘bit of the disabled other’ and impairment is seldom, if ever, constructed or represented as exotic. Desire for the black ethnos, exemplified by (white) wearers of cornrows and dreadlocks or by WASP rappers, is based, despite its naive romanticism, on recognition of the value of cultural alterity. There is at least discernable in these kinds of mimetic cultural practices a vision of the other in which her ontological worth is validated and that her ways of being in the world are deserving of respect. Save for a desire to misappropriate disabled people’s parking spaces, one cannot find a parallel in the relationship between disabled and non-disabled people. The existential landscape of non-disability, no matter how ‘blank’ or uninteresting it may be, has neither room nor time for deficit and tragedy, save perhaps to make a charitable contribution towards its elimination. Indeed, frailty and vulnerability, the ontological flagships of non-disabled people’s perceptions of disabled people’s embodiment, are not only not objects of desire but are regarded as among those very qualities that constitute a risk to ontological security. Frailty and vulnerability are the stuff of Kierkegaardian dread. Indeed, if we rip open the psychological nest of disabling culture to examine the interstices of intersubjectivity between disabled and non-disabled actors we are more likely to discover fear and anxiety than the playful admiration and aesthetic mimicry that hooks (1992) described with such poignant derision. Dread refers to the ‘prospect of being overwhelmed by anxieties that reach to the very roots of our coherent sense of being in the world’ (Giddens, 1991, p. 37). Whilst borrowing from black culture smacks of cool and complicates but adorns the self-identity and existential coherence of some white people, non-disabled people are very unlikely to open themselves in a similar fashion to the ‘disabled other’, since it raises the question of their own vulnerability and embodied coherence and illuminates the challenges posed by the very existential questions from which they try to protect themselves. The love of coherence and order, the ‘natural attitude’ that people adopt to shield themselves from the vicissitudes of existence, particularly in our age of anxiety, forms a force field that keeps the threat of vulnerability, the approaching stranger, at bay. It is, to put the argument another way, the normative, invulnerable body of disablist modernity that is the problem. Indeed, the invulnerable self is a fantasy and form of self-deception associated with carnal ‘normalcy’. It is widely used by non-disabled people to create and sustain social distance between disabled and non-disabled people. One can use Tom Shakespeare’s work from the mid 1990s to develop this argument. Shakespeare (1994, p. 298) argued that non-disabled people ‘project their fear of death, their unease at their physicality and mortality onto disabled people, who represent all these difficult aspects of human existence’. There are two important elements involved in this psychoemotional and social process that results in the ‘disavowal of disability’ and its invalidation as a worthwhile existential status. One is psychological and the other ontological. The first is fear of physical frailty, bodily difference and social vulnerability that is projected onto the disabled other and the second is the process by which the social distancing associated with projected fear is frozen into a binary of being that embodies a hierarchy of existence. Ironically, the ontological insecurity of non-disabled identity is the original sin that pushes disabled people to the margins of the human community. Disability is not an outcome of the infraction of social norms about ‘normalcy’ but a product of the failure of carnal normalcy to take proper account of itself, to indulge in ‘bad faith’ and delude itself into thinking that it is exempt from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. The problem rests with the normative body that does not want to be reminded of its own vulnerability or to admit that abjection and death is its fate. In this context the disabled body is troublesome because it ‘exposes the illusion of autonomy, self-government and self-determination that underpins the fantasy of absolute able bodiedness’ (Thomson, 1997, p. 45). Readers may have noticed in this very preliminary and adumbrated account of what a critical social ontology for disability studies might look like a measure of intellectual affinity with one of the key building blocks of the critique of the individual and medical model’s of disability (and ergo of the social model of disability), namely ‘personal tragedy theory’ (Oliver, 1990). This concept need not be reduced to issues of compensation, entitlement or therapeutic interventions (Oliver, 1996, p. 131; Kumari Campbell, 2005) but is closely articulated with the negative and invalidating way in which non-disabled people relate to disabled people and the threat that this poses to the ‘psycho-emotional well-being’ of disabled people (Thomas, 1999). Fiona Kumari Campbell (2005, p. 109) argued that, almost without fail in modern discourse, disability ‘is assumed to be ontologically intolerable, that is, inherently negative’ and ‘always present … in the ableist talk of normalcy, normalization and humanness’. The assumption that a disabled life is ubiquitously, even invariably, blighted and aberrant is spliced into the emotion of pity that underpins disability charity (Smith, 2005), into the ‘practices and effects of the law’ (Kumari Campbell, 2005), into conceptions and practices of care (Hughes et al., 2005), into the humiliations and violations of institutional life (Malacrida, 2005), into the order of things, into everyday subjectivity. One could go one better, extending the (recently researched) list of realms in which the authenticity of disability is implicitly or explicitly questioned, the blight of oppression felt and ontological recognition denied. It is the task of a critical social ontology for disability studies to claim authenticity for disability whenever it is denied, be it in the cold logic of Peter Singer’s (1995) ‘preference utilitarianism’ that revokes personhood from those who are unable to engage reflexively with their own temporality or in the most mundane everyday words or deeds that exclude or invalidate.</span><br />

Each disabled person is a singular person experiencing his or her situation in a specific, different, unique way. Yet whatever the disabilities, they confront us with incomparable exclusion, different from the others: the disabled person opens a narcissistic identity wound in the person who is not disabled; he inflicts a threat of physical or psychical death, fear of collapse, and, beyond that, the anxiety of seeing the very borders of the human species explode. And so the disabled person is inevitably exposed to a discrimination that cannot be shared. If I attempt to share this situation, however, it is not only because of my sons neurological difficulties, which led to an atypical education for him and exposed me to the singularity of each disabled person. Nor is it because, as a psychoanalyst, I have treated psychical disabilities (depression, psychosis, borderline states, and other disorders). But because my frequent visits outside the Hexagon have convinced me that, compared to countries such as Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Canada, the United States, and many others, France has been slow to establish a true solidarity with disabled people and to provide personalized support for each of them.1 In fact, at the dawn of this millennium, while biology, anthropology, and astrophysics explore human frontiers and the most advanced democracies refuse discrimination against people whose bodies and minds test our notions of human identity, trying to incorporate them into every level of society, France, in this difficult, provocative, and promising moment, is still a long way from creating what one would be right to expect from the country of the rights of man. More fundamentally still, faced with the rather cynical pragmatism of some and the religious clashes of others, I am convinced that humanism - which has always been in search of itself, from its emergence in the past to its crises or revitalizations today and in times to come - can find a chance to revitalize itself in the battle for the dignity of the disabled by constructing what is still sorely lacking: respect for a vulnerability that cannot be shared. My ambition, my utopia, consists of believing that this vulnerability reflected in the disabled person forms us deeply, or, if you prefer, unconsciously, and that as a result, it can be shared. Could this humanism be the &quot;cultural revolution&quot; with which to construct the democracy of proximity that the postmodern age needs? The outsize nature of this ambition is actually built on ordinary, painful, everyday experiences. Here are three, among many others: John, Claire, and the Woman on Television People Say I'm Crazy was the title of a documentary shown on TV in the United States, which I saw during a recent visit. The film aims to show how a schizophrenic person can be &quot;cured&quot; and &quot;integrated&quot; into society. The hero, stuffed full of medications that make him &quot;obese&quot; (his complaint), might be saved by his sister, a filmmaker who comes up with the idea of filming poor John, who likes to draw and make woodcuts. Thanks to the film, his works are soon made public; he has an exhibition; he is showered with grants. The madman has become &quot;a disabled artist.&quot; He can leave the appalling shelter he shares with a few others of his kind, and even find a certain serenity, because social services now pays for a home worthy of being called one. Now he is cured. The only thing left to do is to award the film a prize, which happens shortly thereafter. From time to time, the artist protests against the camera that is trained on him and, to some extent, against those who are making his illness a work of art. But he ends up going along with it, and participates, so to speak, in the filming. Isn't the camera a third party that recognizes him, a bit of space between his ill-being and his family? John is not crazy enough to deprive himself of that. More than the charming, &quot;very American&quot; therapist who encourages him with her kind, &quot;social worker-y&quot; advice, his filmmaker sister's loving recording promotes the artist's &quot;works,&quot; which no one appears to understand but in which John seems to have enclosed his life. Then, something apparently happens, but that is for another film. This movie will not reveal it. No words or interpretations accompany his creations: dramatic representations of brains and the seething viscera of abject flora and fauna. No one seems to contemplate letting the disabled artist speak of his anxieties and desires, or the exclusion in which &quot;people&quot; wall him up, which is nevertheless referred to in the title of the documentary, People Say I'm Crazy. Perhaps he was unable to speak? Perhaps no one thought of trying to let him speak? Perhaps he tried to speak after filming? Who knows? Today, the patient has disappeared; he is the object of a film and, we might say, a coauthor, and it is true that this venture compelled him to produce and exhibit objects that might even, with some luck, be sold. What success! Clearly, he has been cured. What else could a good disabled person hope for in a cheerful society of all-pervasive spectacle? All the patient has to do is become a producer or an object of the show. An immense sadness keeps me from applauding with both hands. Something seems to be missing from this lovely &quot;integration&quot; represented by the art opening and the film. Since the question of the subject is not raised, there is no sharing. I witnessed a process, perhaps even a practice, but not di personal rebirth-, I saw an exhibition, and commerce, but no interaction between the disabled and the able. The disabled person was certainly helped, but it was in order to help him include the objects he made in a circuit of consumption, success measured by access to the screen. The person, the subject, is absorbed by his objects, and his psychical life seems cured, because it has quite simply disappeared. The malaise that pervaded me on seeing this spectacle has only reinforced my engagement in the National Council on Disability, whose motto is to &quot;sensitize, inform, and train,&quot; and which proposes nothing more or less than a revolution of mentalities: &quot;changing outlooks,&quot; shaking up hypocrisy and productivist righteousness by attentive support of the subject beneath the producer of images (which, for example, is what John became), the subject in the limited body or mind (which might awaken and develop if given personalized treatment).2 What is the subject? That which in a man or woman remains open to a search for meaning, and sharing. Despite the limitation, and sometimes even in cases of great dependency brought on by multiple disabilities, this opening, this evolution, this sharing are possible: that is my experience; that is my conviction. I also met Claire, Mother Courage. Since the birth of her daughter, Marie, &quot;people&quot; noticed a few indefinable motor difficulties, before &quot;people&quot; told her that Marie, age three, was autistic. Marie s father withdrew into his work: &quot;With a disability, nothing can be done,&quot; he seemed to say without saying it, and sometimes saying it. It was a way of disappearing to protect himself from depression. This man's pain had cemented the opening. Sharing had turned into flight. Claire was left to handle everything, and Mother Courage became a militant member of an organization. In response to Marie's father, her own personal slogan was &quot;We have to face it, as if nothing were the matter.&quot; Salvation through the Band-Aid of denial, refusal. Claire tried to convince herself that all was not lost (that her daughter would not be lacking), if they &quot;both&quot; could just get something: any available help, financial aid, a place in a day care center or a little school, a CAT scan . . . The list was endless. The courage, rage, and despair of community work. Mothers soldiering on with steely resolve. Claire's struggle kept herself going. She directed all her energy toward pleading her case to public authorities, which she found, rightly, to be indifferent, hostile, and arrogant. Oh, the malaise of the isolated world of disability, its outbursts and bitterness! Ceaseless demands reiterated without satisfaction, suffering in silence for being unable to share the wound, the intolerable, the unshareable! Since Marie's birth, Claire had lived in another world, an antiworld, the world of disability cut off from the world. She couldn't bear it any longer and had come to see me for analysis. I referred her to a colleague. It so happened that I met her three years later. In the course of her analysis, Claire had taken the time to lose herself in a third party: to cry and share her anguish, first with her analyst, then with her co-workers - in work she had taken up again thanks to her therapy. &quot;I deinsulated myself,&quot; she told me. &quot;Marie and I were no longer two people with a single body. And Marie found a job; she makes photocopies at a law office where everyone respects her as she is. She even has a boyfriend now.&quot; I knew, as Claire did, that nothing had really been resolved, and yet I shared her joy, wondering: Will it always take psychoanalysis and the help of a kindly attorney to &quot; deinsulate&quot; disability? Might disability, paradoxically, become an opportunity to bring us closer to the most vulnerable, and lead us to reconsider the political link itself? To spread charity thanks to a democracy of proximity and solidarity, so often discussed but slow in coming, in which the disabled would not expect a kind of generous compassion but quite simply the respect of their rights? To do this, people must be convinced that they have a right to these rights: &quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.&quot; A true &quot;cultural revolution&quot; that perhaps is not impossible today. Still, no one would deny that disability often provokes fear, when not shame. This shame was recently admitted to on television: a mother who had failed her child, who was unable to make her healthy, still felt guilty (as did the father). In the face of this sort of trouble, you want to hide. It s easy to understand her! And yet the pride, the unconscious desire for parental power in these maternal tears! This tragic and courageous admission touched the parents of disabled children, ultimately revealing the archaic weight of a culture from which we have trouble detaching ourselves: a culture that posits human beings as creatures capable of excellence, pleasure, and achievement, in the image of an almighty Creator; a culture of absolute parental power; a culture that blames vulnerability when it does not exclude it; a culture of the &quot;perfect child,&quot; who is able to repair parental malaise. Because guilt is the daughter of omnipotence, while the Man-God, issued from the marriage of the Renaissance and Thomist rationalism, responds perfectly to our narcissistic fantasies and continues to inhabit us, unbeknownst to us, by continuing to deny the lack of being essential to the human condition. A human, too human, reaction. Perhaps stronger in France than elsewhere, since here the Greek worship of natural beauty was joyfully wed to the goddess of Reason; since a prevailing Catholicism - or what remains of it in peoples unconscious - prefers to glorify the Resurrected without lingering on kenosis, sparing themselves Protestant melancholy in order to cohabit with absolute power, whether that of the monarch or of centralizing and in fact elitist republican Jacobinism; and, finally, since globalization, which one would think would put our hexagonal importance in perspective, has not prevented us from claiming that we are the best, worthy of the best, deserving of the best, et cetera. In this context, to inscribe the disabled within the republican pact -not as a marginal group that merits compassion but as people with the same rights as others - constitutes an ambitious challenge. Why Today? We all sense a new historical period beginning: Good has lost its bearings in the globalization of the spectacular and is contrasted with Evil, or rather the axis of Evil, against which terrified humanity has been asked to mobilize. Others are seeking a new foundational myth, when not trying to reconstruct or deconstruct the divine. And yet, &quot;fundamentally,&quot; as we say, in the everyday experience of the excluded in their incommensurable diversity, a new humanism is being sought. I would even say that humanity has never had such a rebellious, free, and human ambition. It is not a matter of a new mythology of love. I see it rather as a challenge to nature and to the tragic: the acceptance and support of vulnerability expresses the desire of men and women to overcome the most insurmountable of fears - one that confronts us with our limitations as living beings. I am wary of the term &quot;integration&quot; of the disabled: it has a whiff of charity about it toward those without the same rights as others. I prefer &quot;interaction,&quot; which expresses a politics that has become an ethics, broadening the political pact to the frontiers of life. And it is not surprising that we find a majority of women on this new political front: would that be because after years of feminism and expanding its best ambitions, they are able to revitalize the age-old feminine capacity to care for psychical and physical life, making it a political act, a political philosophy? Do not see in this praise of female caretaking any attempt to reduce woman to the infirmary of the Good Samaritan! As an exile of the communist regime, I am convinced that if the political link is not implicitly one that allows us to care for our most singular, most unshareable vulnerabilities and creativities, it is doomed to run aground in new forms of totalitarianism. On the contrary, inscribing vulnerability at the center of the political pact (understood as taking care of others), seems to me to be the best antidote to barbarity, and thus an excellent opportunity to produce, through politics, the feminine in women as well as men. Three projects undertaken by the president of the Republic allow us to consider these preoccupations with a bit of optimism.3 &quot;A whole man, composed of all men and as good as all of them and no better than any&quot; - Sartre's words could be the motto for the national &quot;Disability&quot; project.4 Yet, as those concerned know, this project, no doubt the most difficult of the three for the reasons I have just mentioned, seems, if not broken, then at least unmonitored by the public and not yet on par with those of other advanced democracies. Charity, or the &quot;Political Subject&quot; Contrary to a widespread notion, charitable organizations are never directly or specifically interested in the disabled. &quot;The work of charity&quot; (which comes from Matthew 25: &quot;For I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me . . . Assuredly I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to me&quot;) is addressed indistinctly to all those who need help - the poor, the sick, the leprous, the rootless, and the invalid. From the start of these works of charity, the Byzantine martyr Zotikos shocked the ancient world by caring for &quot;crippled&quot; lepers: he no longer left the infirm to divinity by &quot;exposing&quot; them, but welcomed them as a gift from God with the power to &quot;sanctify&quot; us. Saint Augustine integrates the anomaly into the normal, and with him the infirm become lovable, helpful. However, &quot;houses of God&quot; in the Middle Ages excluded lepers, and sometimes the paralyzed and the incurable. Where were the disabled? medievalists wonder today. The Franciscans did the most to help the poor and infirm, because, like Saint Francis, they glorified them. Starting with the epidemics of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and the mystical resurgence, society begins to treat the marginal, but it is still difficult to find the disabled within these blurred categories (cf. Stiker 2000). The only exception was the founding of the Quinze-Vingts Hospital for the blind by Saint Louis: a royal initiative rather than one of the Church, though inspired by the Dominicans and Franciscans. Moreover, the various Catholic or Protestant communities or establishments caring for the disabled today do not necessarily claim confessional ties, and offer civil support that, ostensibly, does not rely on a specific notion of disability within the faith. Personally, I feel great admiration and unswerving gratitude toward associations whose often discreet charitable motives effectively supplement the shortcomings of the state. I will note, however, that their actions are based on a generous philosophy of caring and support rather than on &quot;interaction&quot; and thus take the risk of infantilizing the disabled person. In sum, in the spirit of the Old and New Testaments, the ecclesiastical attitude toward the &quot;poor&quot; interprets the mission of the Church as that of a &quot;community of the suffering servant&quot; and blends all disabled people together without taking into consideration the specificity of their sufferings and exclusions. Now these differ radically from racial, ethnic, religious, and economic exclusions, because disability confronts the able-bodied person with the limits of life, with the fear of deficiency and physical or psychical death: disability therefore awakens a catastrophic anxiety that in turn leads to defensive reactions of rejection, indifference, or arrogance, when not the will to eradicate by euthanasia. A scientific approach a century or two old and yet still in its infancy allows us to identify various forms of disability and ways to anticipate and support them for the disabled persons improved development, but this approach must be surrounded, indeed preceded, by a specific philosophy of disabled life and a fraternity suited to the singularity of disabled men and women: a philosophy and a fraternity based on a right to compensation, which theology seems to leave aside. Indeed, whether we talk about the Lumen Gentium of November 21, 1964, the theological response to Pope John XXIIIs wish to make the Church a &quot;Church for all and particularly the poor&quot;; the four texts by John Paul II from 1979 to 2001 concerning his vision of mankind, the poor in the Church, and the meaning of suffering; or Jean-Marie Lustiger s support of the activities of Jean Vanier s LArche (&quot;to recognize the disabled person as a brother equal in dignity is to understand our true condition and consequently how our society should function and live&quot;), the believer is always called on to &quot;suffer along.&quot;5 The personalized support of those who suffer from a disability undeniably starts with empathy with the disabled person, but this modern support cannot do without the specific knowledge of the ill-being or the fight for the recognition and compensation of rights within the social pact that aims to remove this person from the compassionate margins, where we tend to isolate him or her, with love. The recognition of people with disabilities as political subjects is the work of the Enlightenment. Written by Diderot, Lettre sur les aveugles à lJusage de ceux qui voient (1749) (Letter on the Blind for the Use of Those Who See) marks the first phase in a social awareness of disability, after its being handled by the religious orders. In the eighteenth century, France was at the forefront of this domain, as it was of others. The philosophy of the Enlightenment demonstrates the capacities of the &quot;infirm&quot; and rehabilitates the limited person as a political subject. These positions open the way to education and to the development of educational techniques based on the disability. The French encyclopedist was struck by his meeting with a geometry professor at Cambridge, who, though blind at birth, and never having seen the slightest object, was capable of doing very sophisticated calculations with volume. Diderot concluded that if a genius like this could be struck by infirmity, it was because something was not working properly in the &quot;divine order,&quot; which was supposed to identify &quot;beautiful nature&quot; with &quot;divine reason.&quot; This revolt against Christian rationalism led Diderot the deist to become an atheist, which resulted in his imprisonment at Vincennes. In the following centuries, there is a clear increase in the number of people with disabilities (injured in work accidents or wounded in the two world wars). The state then takes responsibility, the disabled person requests more and more solidarity from the national community, and the law of 1975 crowns this second phase. Inspired by François Block-Lainé, Simone Veil, and Jacques Chirac, this law took an important step: asserting national responsibility, pledging resources to the condition of the disabled, and leading the way for therapies tailored to specific needs (notably with the creation of the Coto rep). Since then this law, made unreadable by numerous amendments and decrees, has fallen out of sync with the new approach to disability, which, in international texts, associates individual parameters (limitations) and social parameters (disadvantages), and does not consider disabled people &quot;objects under treatment&quot; but emerging subjects. That, moreover, is why certain people involved in aid to the disabled continue to refer to them as personnes en situation de handicap (people in a situation of handicap) - terminology that, far from being politically correct, has the advantage of indicating that the handicap is the result of a limitation and a social response, in other words, a &quot;situation&quot; created for the disabled person by society's reception of them. In short, the law of 1975 has become obsolete. For example, the obligation to send disabled children to school was indicated so vaguely that it has always managed to be avoided. There are still tens of thousands of children who are not in school because of their disability; they could be, with support. Another example: benefit payments, access to jobs, accessible public transportation and public places; none of this is addressed. The shortcomings are enormous, and the state has largely passed responsibility on to volunteer organizations, which assume a large number of the tasks. Yet organizations do not always follow the most useful advances; they often get caught up in competition and internal conflict. Better evaluation is necessary, as well as state services taking on some of the burden. Not that we have to centralize everything, but how can such colossal work be left to individual initiative? Of course, many institutions in France support the disabled with maximum attention and exemplary care. Yet structures of admission are often relegated to isolated executives, cut off from the social flux. To break with this phenomenon of ghetto ization, the training of those capable of interacting with the disabled must be improved: from psychiatrists to instructors, special ed teachers to teacher's aides, from homecare givers to personal attendants, all should feel valued and able to provide optimal care. Today, we are in the third phase of the history of disability, which we are trying to establish in France, notably by relying on the &quot;law for the equal opportunity of people with disabilities,&quot; which has just been voted on by the two chambers of Parliament. What Will the New Law Bring? It's going in the right direction. Its intentions and propositions are bringing radical innovations that may enable us to catch up, provided amendments follow and an effective national solidarity is established. Among the contributions of the new law: the extension of the general principle of nondiscrimination toward people with disabilities; the simplification of care and support by the creation of a one-stop service, or a &quot;commission on rights and integration&quot; involving regional disability centers; &quot;personalized compensation,&quot; or support through local agencies of technical and human aid; physical and functional &quot;accessibility&quot; in all places; school, work, transportation, buildings, culture, leisure, for all disabilities and not motor disabilities alone; the full responsibility of the Ministry of Education to enroll children with disabilities in schools closest to home; the recognition of various forms of psychical disabilities; priority given to work in an ordinary workplace; the creation of a national support fund (Caisse nationale de solidarité), notably by eliminating one holiday, with a part of the revenues allocated to people with disabilities and the rest to the dependent elderly. Under the pressure of organizations, joined by the National Council on Disability (&quot;to sensitize, inform, and train&quot;), and after several amendments brought by deputies from both the Right and the Left, the text of the law has been considerably improved. And although it still leaves a lot to be desired, so considerable are the needs and delays, it represents an advancement on which a new politics of disability can finally be built in France. It is here that the National Council takes on all its meaning. From the National Council on Disability to General Assemblies Charged by the president of the Republic with the mission of reflecting on disability in France, resulting in a report published as Lettre ouverte au président de la Republique sur les citoyens en situation de handicap, à Vusage de ceux qui le sont et de ceux qui ne le sont pas (Open Letter to the President of the Republic on Citizens with Disabilities, for the Use of Those Who are Disabled and Those Who Are Not), I made several concrete proposals concerning schools, businesses, culture, accessibility, old age, and multiple disability.6 For these proposals, I envisioned the need to start a true &quot;cultural revolution&quot; to change the way the disabled are viewed - based on real interaction between the able and the disabled - to allow for political interventions that would finally be effective. Because my inquiry convinced me that, whatever the reasons for the French delay and the shortcomings of measures taken or neglected, the core of the difficulties lies in the abyss that separates the world of disability from the world of the able. And it is urgent to create messengers between these &quot;two merciless worlds&quot;: one of disability, with its sufferings and its protective but also aggravating isolation; the other, a society of performance, success, competition, pleasure, and spectacle that &quot;doesn't want to know.&quot; That is why the national council was created, to sensitize, inform, and train, its goal being to work toward interaction between the able and disabled. Difficult tasks, you would be right to assume, but ones we have tried to accomplish by - gathering more than a hundred personalities from the worlds of science, arts and letters, sports, and the media, to change the discourse and outlook on people with disabilities, with scholars contributing new and specific information to lift the veil of ignorance and the fears linked to it, and artists, athletes, and media personalities adding their sensibilities and resources, as eloquent examples of possible interaction; - publishing a series of articles in the national and local press to enrich the debate on the law being prepared; - public service announcements on public television channels devoted to the theme of &quot;encountering&quot; a person with disability; - organizing a Tour de France of disability: disability and the comic book in Angoulême; disability and citizenship in Lille; psychical disability in Nice and Vannes. These initiatives, which do not duplicate the activities of other organizations but amplify them and address them to people without disabilities, acting in concert with these organizations, led to an assembly on disability on May 20, 2005, at UNESCO. We called this assembly &quot;Disability: Time for Engagement.&quot; It encouraged a taking into account of people with disabilities by everyone, and was held at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, a symbol of universal brotherhood. It was not another colloquium that gathered specialists and experts around scholarly reflections or generous denouncements. The national council was concerned instead with rallying around the question of disability those who would normally turn away from it. We invited figures from the world of academia, business, local authorities, and central administrations. What was the Philosophy of this Initiative? To answer this, we have to go back to an earlier question: where does the French lateness in the domain of disability come from? From a Catholicism that is certainly compassionate but that infantilizes the person and moreover does not develop the basic solidarity of the Protestant experience - seeking &quot;grace&quot; through effort and mutual aid here on Earth? From an excessively centralizing Jacobinism that neglects community ties? From a secularization that exalted the Man-God and, in battling rightly against the miserabilism and masochistic latencies of the Christian religion, nevertheless leans toward a triumphal humanism that creates humanity in the image of an almighty God, where there is no place for vulnerability? If these hypotheses are true, with secularization supplanting the compassion of our world, don't we risk getting stuck in this impasse in France as well - an impasse that threatens all countries but France even more dramatically - reducing the disabled to either patients or workers? John's story, which I mentioned at the beginning, is an example of this: Americans manage this &quot;process&quot; more efficiently than we do, and consumerism triumphs in the most insidious of good consciences. I would prefer to try to rehabilitate the subject in the imperfect body, to remove him or her from the exclusion in which in which he or she has commonly been enclosed. I prefer to believe that real and necessary cultural change will help us improve laws and material compensation. Twenty-five years of analytical practice have convinced me that listening to the unconscious reveals the vulnerability of the speaking being: at the borders of biology and meaning, a permanent imbalance, a source of anxiety but also creativity. Since psychoanalysis is the quintessential intimate experience, there can be no politics of psychoanalysis. On the other hand, listening to the speaking being is a Copernican revolution of values and norms, opening new possibilities of connection to others, which constitutes the very essence of politics. If listening to the unconscious reveals the vulnerability of the speaking being, psychoanalysis must inevitably encounter the central preoccupation of the third millennium: what meaning to give the limits of life - birth, death, deficiencies? Transferring the religious and philosophical ambitions of an Occident concerned with human singularity to the very core of scientific rationality, the Freudian discovery of the unconscious is probably the only approach to the human that is likely to avoid euthanasia in the name of science, as well as the pseudohumanism of armoring the patient in the carapace of a worker. We all know about bodybuilding; we have come to the point of producer-building. Will advanced democracies have the means to support life with its limits and shortcomings, soliciting and favoring the subject within them? That is the issue for which the Freudian discovery of the unconscious prepares us, if we admit that it is a discovery of the essential vulnerability of the speaking body. To sum up analytical listening this way requires some explanation: Eros and Thanatos, which Freud unveiled in the unconscious of twentieth-century men and women, did not reveal a desiring superman (as certain acolytes of Lacan would have it) or result in feeling sorry for suffering humanity (as post-Freudian orthodoxy suggested). In fact, the duel between the hedonists and the nihilists is one of those French exceptions that do well in the media, but that cannot withstand the complexity of psychical life as revealed on the couch of the contemporary psychoanalyst. It is the delicacy of the speaking being that the analyst listens for today, the analyst who knows his or her Freud and has read Lacan, Melanie Klein and Bion, Winnicott and Frances Tustin. The Freudian journey into the night of desire was followed by attention to the capacity to think: never one without the other. The result? Modern psychoanalysis, as I understand it, seems to be the bringing to light of this vulnerability that arises at the intersection of biology and language; and a perpetual rebirth of the subject, if and only if this vulnerability is recognized. Situated in this untenable place, psychoanalysts have the (unique?) privilege today of accompanying the emergence of new capacities of thinking/representing/ thinking, beyond the frequent and increasingly noticeable disasters of psychosomatic space - capacities that are so many new bodies and new lives. As for biology, it has been observed that &quot;cellular death&quot; is &quot;programmed&quot; in the gene pool of living beings, so that it assumes the role of a sculptor, gradually &quot;removing&quot; or &quot;canceling out&quot; inherited elements of both parents, chance and error being the fate of this creative destructivity, of this cohabitation of death in life (see Ameisen 1999). From another perspective, we need only observe how people all over the world, who brood over politics when they don't reject it, will mobilize for causes considered &quot;humanitarian&quot; (though not without discrediting them at times). In reality, these are modern experiences of the tragic that ask humanity to give meaning to its very being - to birth, death, reproduction, ecological catastrophes, health emergencies (the tragedies of tsunamis, mad cow disease, bird flu, deadly heat waves, not to mention AIDS) and, with even more anxiety, to give meaning to the limits of humankind itself, revealed by personal &quot;deficiencies&quot; inseparable from social &quot;disadvantages&quot;: I have named the obstacles. Sharing Vulnerability Contrary to the propaganda with which globalized technology assaults us, the global age that has followed the modern age is not one of the highperformance, pleasure-filled Man, bisexual master of his desires, their debacles, or both. The vulnerability that is revealed today on the couch is precisely that which is determined to deny the manic invasion of hyperproductivity, all-pervasive spectacle, and suicidal religious warfare. Coming from different horizons, a question is emerging: how do we inscribe in the concept of the human itself - and therefore in philosophy and political practice - the constitutive part of the destructivity, vulnerability, and imbalance that are integral parts of the identity of the human race and, singularly, of the speaking subject? By adding a fourth term (vulnerability) to the humanism inherited from the Enlightenment (liberty, equality, and fraternity), analytical listening inflects these three toward a concern for sharing, in which and thanks to which desire and its twin, suffering, make their way toward a constant renewal of the self, the other, and connection. It is because I have been sounding out the delicacy and vulnerability of men and women who have put their trust in me for more than two decades that, in the plans of the president of the Republic to catch up in terms of personalized support of citizens with disabilities in France, I believe I have heard an appeal ... to psychoanalysis! Because no other discourse, no other inquiry or therapy, is better able to recognize lack of being and to inscribe it in a project of continual rebirth, whether subtle or startling. I am not speaking only of the psychoanalytical approach to psychical disability (psychosis or autism), which, in the best of cases, causes the subject to come about where he or she was barred. Without denying pharmacological help or other approaches that facilitate social behaviors, I also want to discuss an approach whose goal is the protection and optimization of psychical life, insofar as it is an infinite quest for meaning, bios transversal to zoe, a biography with and for others. What John, in the documentary, did not manage to say or think, although the film (almost in spite of its producers) allowed one to imagine the possibilities. Because other disabilities - mental (trisomy), sensory (deafness, blindness) or motor disabilities - lead those affected by them to situations of deficiency that expel them from the social link, in different ways. Because those not afflicted with these incapacities are faced with the anxiety of castration; the horror of narcissistic injury; and beyond that, the intolerableness of psychical or physical death: thus deepening the most untreatable of exclusions. Having come to terms with their vulnerability, analysands and all those trying to open their speech to the unconscious can offer disabled subjects the best chance for the desires, anxieties, and creativities of excluded people, those not like others, to be expressed and worked out. Finding our limits gives us the ability to share those of the disabled subject, failings and flashes of brilliance alike, in the full sense of the word &quot;share,&quot; which is not fusion, osmosis, or identification. To share: to take part in a distinctiveness beyond the separation imposed on us by our fates; to participate, without erasing the fact that each is &quot;apart&quot; and recognizing the part that cannot be shared, that is irremediable. Those rejected because of race, social origins, or religious difference have given rise to political struggles that, for at least two centuries, have taken up the baton of charity and have managed, against all odds, through law and mindsets, to reestablish the well-named &quot;rights of man&quot;: a horizon that is still unsatisfying but now a part of &quot;good sense,&quot; so that it seems obvious to us to resist racism, as well as religious persecution or disparagement based on class. The same does not go for the exclusion from which people with disabilities suffer. The voluntarism of the beautiful humanist soul that sustains a fairly generous solidarity, followed (not always) by legal and social measures, has revealed itself incapable of traversing the fears and anxieties that control the unconscious - and often conscious - rejection of the disabled by those who are not. It is precisely here that psychoanalytical listening to vulnerability could take on political meaning, addressing not only those affected by a disability but also the society of others, who, instead of integrating them, might have real interaction with them. Rest assured, I am not suggesting &quot;psychoanalyzing&quot; anyone (unless he or she seeks it out, which does happen); nor am I saying, &quot;We are all disabled,&quot; as we were able to say, &quot;We are all German Jews,&quot; New Yorkers in the Twin Towers, gays, or women! I am simply saying this: by lending a psychoanalytical ear to the incomparable singularity of this exclusion that is not like others from which people with disabilities suffer, it becomes clear that it concerns us. Not necessarily because &quot;it could happen to anyone,&quot; but because it is already in me /us: in our dreams, our anxieties, our romantic and existential crises, in this lack of being that invades us when our resistances crumble and our &quot;interior castle&quot; cracks. Because to recognize it in me will help me to discover the incomparable subject in the limited body, to construct a common life project. A project in which my fear of castration, narcissistic injury, defect, and death, repressed until now, is transformed into attention, patience, and solidarity capable of refining my being in the world. In this encounter, could the disabled subject become not my analyst, but my analyzer? I am not claiming that this social contract supported by psychoanalytical listening might dissolve disability in vulnerability. If every speaking being is constructed around a central deficiency, disability inflicts a very different trial: the disabled subject is confronted with the irremediable, lacks or insufficiencies that evolve within certain limits, when they don't stagnate or worsen. Yet the analysand who has not confronted the irremediable in him- or herself has not completed his or her journey to the end of the night. And how many unfulfilled desires, aptitudes in a state of vigilance, and possibilities for an amazing life there are in this cohabitation with the irremediable! Aren't we very far away from psychoanalysis in this dream of citizenship shared with the most fragile? In a way. But not really, if we admit that far from being a world away, a coded language, or a cult of initiates, psychoanalysis is another way of being in the world. As I write these lines - here as in my Open Letter to the President of the Republic - I catch myself hoping that our efforts to &quot;sensitize, inform, and train&quot; can really change people's mentalities. That each of us can slip into our own dreams, the most bizarre or most repetitive, and rise to the surface, listening to those who speak, walk, hear, see, or move about bizarrely, crazily or scarily New worlds then open to our listening, difficult or enchained, neither normal nor disabled, a flowering of surprise, worlds becoming polyphonies, resonances, different yet compatible, worlds finally returned to their plurality Don't tell me I'm dreaming or that this is poetry. What if this were the private face of the politics of disability?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Skepticism and a degree of distance from one’s own culture can provide the basis for a duty of care and stewardship for other cultures. This description of cosmopolitan virtue ethics as a set of obligations flows from a recognition of the vulnerability of persons and the precariousness of institutions. It is intended to offer a stand against relativism and awaken the recognition of similarities between the prospect and problems of cosmopolitan understanding and an ecumenical commitment to dialogue with other cultures. The argument is not that contemporary cosmopolitanism can be simply a return to classical cosmopolitanism or religious universalism. Cosmopolitan irony is generally incompatible with these forms of nostalgia, because our contemporary dilemmas cannot be solved simply by a naive return to origins. The cosmopolitanism of the Stoics attempted to come to terms with the cultural diversity of classical times. Classical cosmopolitanism was a product of Roman imperialism, but contemporary globalization cannot be easily or effectively dominated or orchestrated by a single state. Contemporary cosmopolitanism follows from social changes that are associated with globalization. These changes include: the partial erosion of national sovereignty and the growth of post-national citizenship; the emergence of global markets, especially a global labor market, and a corresponding growth of diasporic communities: and cultural hybridity as an aspect of mainstream political life. These global political communities require ironic and reflexive membership, if the modern world is to escape from the vicious cycle of ethnic conflict, revenge, and retribution. Cosmopolitan virtue may well turn out to be an ethic of exile for people who are migrants, and thus for people who are no longer attached to a permanent homeland. This study of human rights places the human body at the center of social and political theory, and it employs the notion of embodiment as a foundation for defending universal human rights. My argument is based on four fundamental philosophical assumptions: the vulnerability of human beings as embodied agents, the dependency of humans (especially during their early childhood development), the general reciprocity or interconnectedness of social life, and, finally, the precariousness of social institutions. The dialectical relationship between these four components becomes obvious when one thinks about the process of technological modernization. Within this dialectical balance of vulnerability, dependency, reciprocity, and precariousness, modern technologies—especially medical technology—have powerful and far-reaching implications, and they largely disrupt the relationships among the four components. If our embodiment is the real source of our common sociability, then changes to embodiment must have implications for vulnerability and interconnectedness. The new microbiological revolution in medical sciences, for example, holds out the promise of “the mirage of health” (Dubos 1960), including the prospect of “living forever.” It is driven by a powerful commercial logic and has (largely unrecognized) military and security applications and implications that are problematic for human rights and democracy. New medical procedures such as therapeutic cloning, new reproductive technologies (NRTS), regenerative medicine, stem-cell applications, cryogenically frozen patients, fetal surgery, and organ transplants create the possibility of a medical utopia, but they also reinforce social divisions and inequalities, especially between rich and poor societies. This chapter raises two fundamental political questions. First, what are the proper ends of a political community? And does the current biotechnological revolution anticipate, following Michel Foucault (1970), the erasure of man? Human beings are ontologically vulnerable and insecure, and their natural environment, doubtful. In order to protect themselves from the uncertainties of the everyday world, they must build social institutions (especially political, familial, and cultural institutions) that come to constitute what we call “society.” We need trust in order to build companionship and friendship to provide us with means of mutual support. We need the creative force of ritual and the emotional ties of common festivals to renew social life and to build effective institutions, and we need the comforts of social institutions to fortify our individual existence. Because we are biologically vulnerable, we need to build political institutions to provide for our collective security. These institutions are themselves precarious, however, and cannot work without effective leadership, political wisdom, and good fortune to provide an enduring and reliable social environment. Rituals typically go wrong; social norms offer no firm blueprint for action. The guardians of social values—priests, academics, lawyers, and others— turn out to be open to corruption, mendacity, and self-interest. Yet the afflictions and uncertainties of everyday life also generate intersocietal patterns of dependency and connectedness, and in psychological terms, this shared world of risk and uncertainty results in sympathy, empathy, and trust, without which society would not possible. This contradictory and delicate balance between scarcity, solidarity, and security characterizes all social life. Such a theory of society embraces a set of Hobbesian assumptions, in which life itself is vulnerable— that is, nasty, brutish, and short. Yet it does not follow that we are forced to accept the individualistic assumptions of a Hobbesian social contract. Instead, human and social rights are juridical expressions of social solidarity, whose foundations rest in the common experience of vulnerability and precariousness. As Pierre Bourdieu (2000) suggests in his Pascalian Meditations, the everyday use of our bodies leads us to acquire practical reason and to assume a habitus that expresses our tastes or preferences for various goods, including symbolic goods. In the process of this embodiment, we also develop a reflexive self that is always expressed through embodiment. Our selfhood is reflected in the peculiarities of our own embodiment; our eccentricity is articulated through these practices and our habitus. Two processes—embodiment and “enselfment”— express the idea that mind and body are never separated. Who we are is a social process that is always constructed in terms of a particular experience of embodiment. Suffering (a loss of dignity) and pain (a loss of comfort, which we need in order to feel secure and confident) are always intertwined, and so vulnerability is both a physical and spiritual condition. Finally, our experience of the everyday world involves a particular place, a location within which experiences of the body and of our dependency on other humans unfold. The notion of emplacement is taken from Martin Heidegger’s account of Being and Time (1962), in which the concept Dasein, literally “there-being” specifies the temporality of being in space. Heidegger’s philosophy of being-in-time conceptualized the inevitable contingency of human existence. Given that contingency, emplacement is crucial to our sense of identity, security, and continuity. Human rights abuses disconnect and destroy the conditions that make embodiment, enselfment, and emplacement possible. They typically involve some attack on the body through torture and deprivation, an assault on the dignity of the sell through psychological threat, and some disruption to place through exclusion —imprisonment, deportation, seizure of land, or exile. (Elaine Scarry’s The Body in Pain [1985] not only explains the relationship between political power and bodily afflictions but also details the consequences of the disconnection of sell, body, and place through oppression and torture.) The vulnerability of our everyday world is connected to a sociological understanding of the precarious nature of institutions. We need to comprehend the social world in terms of the relationship between the processes of embodiment and institutionalization. In sociological theory, “institutions” replace “instincts,” because human beings do not have many ready-made instinctual responses to their environment. (Human instincts are malleable, minimal, and nonspecific.) Human society involves building an infinite number of “institutions,” patterns of social interaction that are sustained by customs and sanctions— for example, courtship, the family, religion, rituals, eating patterns, sleeping arrangements, and political ceremonials. We create institutions to reduce our vulnerability and attain security, but these institutional patterns are always imperfect, inadequate, and precarious. Learning to live in society means learning how these institutions work or fail to work. This discussion of vulnerability and rights has to be located within a global social system. where the hybridity and fragmentation of culture bring into question our capacity to sustain solidarity in the everyday world.</span><br />

<strong>The aff is a discursive resistance to the politics of vulnerability that allows us to reconceptualize what it means to be human</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In western discourse the notion of the contagious, the unclean or the contaminated is never just a neutral descriptor but carries the weight of all that stands against—and paradoxically secures—the categories of normative ontology and epistemology. Set against the ideal closure and invulnerability of the self’s “clean and proper body,” this paper investigates the condition of disability as a potentially contaminatory threat. But the given precarious psychic constitution of the subject, and the ontological insecurity of self performativity, can we reconﬁgure vulnerability not as a term of weakness, but as the very possibility of becoming? Several months ago in Dublin, whilst I was researching representational forms of the monstrous, I visited the highly regarded Gallery of Photography to see a new exhibition by Karl Grimes. Still Life records the chance visit by Grimes to the specimen room of an Italian hospital at which he was working on a different project. The exhibition comprised several dozen large photographic portraits of late foetal and neonatal infant bodies with gross congenital deformities, most of whom were preserved in vast glass containers, in some cases after partial dissection. There were several concorporate twins, and many bodies with hydrocephalic disorders, exposed spines, or other gaping oriﬁces, their corporeal borders dis-integrated. In clinical terms they would be classed as monsters, in lay terms as freaks. The collection was deeply disturbing; it touched me and many others who saw it. As might be expected, some of the press reviews constructed the staging of Still Life as exploitative, voyeuristic, as something that should not be put on public show. It was as though the aw(e)ful vulnerability of those bodies put us, the viewers, at risk, as though they were contagious. But that was and is to miss the point. The encounter with the others who deﬁne our own boundaries of normality must inevitably disturb, for they are both irreducibly strange and disconcertingly familiar, both opaque and reﬂective. They enable us to recognise ourselves; they are our own abject. As Grimes (1998) himself notes, “Images of what we have denied turn towards us.” And once the initial shock of confronting what is usually excluded had passed, I found myself not repulsed, but moved to tears by the unaccountable beauty of the bodies. Beyond the marks of a violent and violating science that were evident in their conﬁnement, both materially to specimen jars and discursively to the category of abnormality, it was possible to acknowledge a siblingship which claims us all. Is it possible, then, to theorise these autobiographical moments in the interlocking context of vulnerability and contagion without betraying the shock of recognition? Among the several meanings of the word “contagion,” all of which are deeply negative in their import, is the notion of a disease process spread by touch, or even by proximity. We understand that a contaminated object is one to be avoided or kept at a safe distance, lest we too become affected. Our well-being, our very lives, are dependent then on the maintenance of a self-protective detachment, an interval not only between ourselves and evidently dangerous others, be they microbes, parasites, or infected human bodies, but also between ourselves and the mere potential of risk. Public health relies, in large part, on the success of epidemiological measures designed not simply to control, but also to avoid the threat of an other that would expose our underlying vulnerability. Thus the prophylactic strategies of, for example, the vaccination of children, anti-malarial drug regimes for travellers, or the practice of safe sex for us all, make good sense. The probability that any one threat might materialise may be extremely low, but nonetheless our well-being is seen to be enhanced by the erection of protective barriers. There is nothing particularly contentious in any of this, except perhaps in the calculation of risk, but I want both to move away from the notion of contagion as a material effect in order to consider its wider discursive import, and to explore more closely the implications of covering over the vulnerability of human bodies, and indeed of human beings. Far from being a simple matter of prudent protection, what is at stake in our vulnerability to non-self factors is an ethics of relationship. My argument is that in western discourse, the notion of the diseased, the unclean or the contaminated is never just an empirical or supposedly neutral descriptor, but carries the weight of all that stands against—and of course paradoxically secures—the normative categories of ontology and epistemology. As postmodernist theory makes clear, the self’s clean and proper body, to use Julia Kristeva’s term, is not a given, but instead an unstable construct under constant threat. On the one hand there is the potential of internal leakage and loss of form, while on the other, there is a risk from the circulation of all those dangerous bodies—women, racial others, the sick, the monstrous—who both occupy the place of the other and serve to deﬁne by difference the self’s own parameters. In this paper, I shall look in particular at the condition of disability 3 as the site of modernist discourses that ﬁgure the human body, or at least the white male body, as ideally closed and invulnerable. From historical archival material through to present day research into the genetic manipulation of potential congenital abnormalities, the stress has been on controlling the conditions of vulnerability as though science could settle ontology. But what, precisely, is at stake in the western imaginary with its dream of containment, and what marks the disabled body as a threat, as though it could contaminate? My concern is to suggest new ways of conceptualising disability that demand a deconstruction of existing ethical parameters in the light of an always already vulnerability as the condition not only of all bodies, but of all embodied selves. I want ﬁrst to set out the ground on which, at least in western modernity, vulnerability is ﬁgured as a shortcoming, an impending failure both of form and function; a predicate that marks its subject as potentially beyond normative standards of being. It is not exactly that vulnerability is denied in and by the normative subject, but that the “proper” unfolding of human life, and the exercise of selfhood, is taken to overcome such dangers. Those who too readily admit or who succumb to vulnerability are either weak or unfortunate, beset by either or both moral and material failure. Although the heroic narrative of individual transcendence over corporeal adversity—the triumph of mind over matter—is highly familiar, and constitutes the greater part of auto/biographical accounts of illness and disability (Couser, 1997), its claim to our admiration exists alongside contrary tendencies. More usually vulnerability is feared as a condition of both mind and body, an ontological as well as physical state, an embodied being in which those familiar mind/body distinctions enacted by post-Enlightenment thought are suspended. Instead, the compromised body may invite the assumption of intellectual insufﬁciency—those with physical disabilities are all too commonly denied access to standard education as children and ﬁnd themselves spoken for as adults—or alternatively as the sign of an inner deﬁciency of will, or prior moral dereliction (Longmore, 1997). And while the ﬁrst of those more negative responses might be evidence of the unsettling dis-ease occasioned by the non-normative body such that engagement is avoided, the latter speaks to a sense of moral superiority in the face of the other’s vulnerability. That unusual bodily form has a long history of provoking both fear and condemnation is widely evidenced in a variety of western texts. I do not suggest that this is the only response, but rather that whatever other explanations and interests are predominant at any particular time and cultural location, there seems to be a continuous thread of anxiety. In fact, the elision of ethical and physical affronts to the norms of human being has its roots in classical antiquity. If Aristotelian virtue is that which strikes the harmonious balance between the vices of excess and deﬁciency, the very same characteristics by which he deﬁnes monstrosity, then it is a simple step to corporeal disorder inviting moral condemnation. Transhistorically, the most widely accepted deﬁnition of the physically monstrous cites excess, deﬁciency or displacement as necessary properties, and we might note in passing that for Aristotle, the female form was an intrinsic deformity. That is not to imply that Aristotle advocated the destruction of female newborns, or indeed other deviant forms, but there is nevertheless a long tradition in which corporeal difference has invoked institutional erasure. In his history of the so-called monstrous races, for example, Friedman (1981) cites customary Roman Law which states that “a father shall immediately put to death a son recently born, who is a monster, or who has a form different from that of members of the human race” (p. 179). For medieval Christianity with its belief in human descent from the perfection of the single prelapsarian man, bodily difference represented the corruption of the species either by miscegenation, or as a result of divine punishment for a variety of other sins. The same beliefs in divine retribution for misdeeds already past—or alternatively in heavenly warnings or omens of evils yet to come—provided the most common explanatory models of monstrosity right through until the early modern period. And although a subsequent turn toward more scientiﬁc forms of knowledge is evident, those exist alongside a persistent belief that non-normative bodies of all kinds are marked by moral deﬁciency. The inference that people with disease or disabilities are paying for sins in their past, for example, is clearly evident in the initial widespread public reception of AIDS as a gay plague from which blameless heterosexuals were exempt. It is not my suggestion that our response to disabling conditions is always as crude, or sets up so blatant a division between the categories of the “normal” and the deviant, between the supposedly whole-bodied and those whose bodily boundaries have in some way been breached or distorted. Similarly “healthy” bodies are not viewed as uniformly invulnerable: for infants and children whose bodily wellbeing is largely dependent on others, for older people facing the ﬁnitude of death and bodily decay, and for women whose intrinsic leakiness marks a body that is always already breached, the ideal of a closed, powerful and self-deﬁned corporeal schema is already compromised. Nonetheless, at the beginning of a new millennium in which evermore detailed biomedical accounts of the body are passing into lay usage, and in which we are invited to marvel at the capacities of biomedical technologies to remake the body, reminders of uncontrolled corporeal vulnerability are highly unwelcome. The cultural theorist Rosemarie Garland Thomson recounts her own shock at being given a copy of Robert Bogdan’s (1988) scholarly study Freak Show: “ ‘Freak’ disturbingly summarized the accusation I had most dreaded my entire life.” She later describes how owning her personal very visible physical disability was akin to coming out, adding that “indeed, pressures to deny, ignore, normalize, and remain silent about one’s own disability are both compelling and seductive in a social order intolerant of deviations from the bodily standards enforced by a quotidian matrix of economic, social and political forces” (Thomson, 1997, p. xvii). What I would want to add to Thomson’s matrix is the power of psychic and ontological anxiety that must itself be denied. Where the fully self-present sovereignty of the modernist subject is taken for granted, there is an expectation, and indeed biomedical discourse encourages us to believe, that our bodies are similarly under control, predictable, determinate, and above all independent in form and function. The mapping of the human genome, which promises both a measure of individual uniqueness and a template for enhanced control and manipulation, signals that the perfect body, marked by its consistency, predictability and self-transparency, is available to all. Such a standard serves to deny corporeal vulnerability, and, as many commentators have already pointed out, further strengthens the othering of those whose bodies fall short. The more we believe that we can control our bodies, the greater the anxiety that is generated by the evidence of vulnerability, whether as the result of the accident of disabling conditions, both chronic and acute, or in the form of those routine biological processes of change in which the feminine is over-determined. Although feminism has from the start challenged masculinist values with regard to embodiment as part of its general project to revalue women, it is somewhat ironic, as Wendell (1996) points out, that in contesting the traditional identiﬁcation between women and their supposedly unruly bodies, it has itself often displayed a certain somataphobia. The noticeable paucity of academic interest, both within feminism and elsewhere, in disability studies 4 may look like indifference, but I suggest it plays into the wider issue of our perception of non-normative corporeality. The disabled body, the body that resists the conscious control of the will, that is effectively out of control, may carry no infectious agents, and yet regardless of gender investments, it is treated as though it were contaminatory. Although such a potentially dangerous entity must be kept at a distance, beyond the capacity to touch, it is nonetheless a privileged object of the gaze. What is evoked at worst is a kind of revulsion and dehumanisation, characterised historically by the public display of human “monsters,” both dead and alive, in the freak shows, for example, of the 19th and early 20th century, or today, as Dennett (1997) suggests, by the enfreakment of corporeal extremes, especially of the “fattest” or “heaviest” variety, on many American television talk shows. What is striking about such spectacles, however, is that they may elicit the contradictory responses both of horriﬁed disengagement, and of fascination and recognition. The present day staging of disability may seek to avoid the offensive excesses of the past under a banner of education or social concern, but like the freak show barker’s pitch, the introduction appeals, more or less explicitly, to the model of the abnormal viewed from a safe distance. In his fascinating analysis of U.S. charity telethons in aid of various illnesses and disabilities, Longmore (1997) demonstrates both the distancing effect of the gaze, and the way in which the apparently altruistic structure of the events authorises the contemporary equivalent of ﬁnger pointing. In such orgies of public “compassion,” Longmore sees as the prime motivation the conspicuous display, not of links of sameness, but of difference. As he puts it, “People with disabilities are ritually deﬁned as dependent on the moral ﬁtness of nondisabled people” (p. 136). Although agreeing with the outlines of his analysis, I believe the relationships are more complicated than Longmore allows. Where he would see vulnerability, which he characterises in terms of dependency, as ﬁxed by the gaze of the differentiated other, the underlying anxiety of the encounter with corporeal anomaly needs further explanation. It is of course precisely the failure of the monstrous body to observe a material and metaphorical cordon sanitaire, its failure to wholly occupy the place of the other that grounds anxiety. For example, thinking of the negative responses to the pictures in the Still Life exhibition, it is evident that the triple conﬁnement of the unruly foetuses in death, in glass containers, and in the photographic image, was nonetheless insufﬁcient to allay the uncomfortable feeling that there was risk of contagion in the encounter itself. In its operation, the putative fear of contamination mirrors the pyschic structure of phobia in general in that what is feared marks the site of projection for an intrinsic vulnerability. Although the ascribed content of that vulnerability may vary from one psychoanalytic interpretation to another, 5 what is consistent is that the self’s own vulnerability cannot be spoken. And even when at best there may be compassion and an attempt at empathy with the corporeally deviant, that empathy is about trying to smooth out differences, to ﬁnd the grounds of sameness, but it is clearly not about opening oneself—becoming vulnerable—to an encounter with irreducible strangeness. Indeed, insofar as the gaze remains operative, we might say that no real encounter takes place, for the emphasis is not on exchange in which mutual transformation might occur, but precisely on forestalling such a move. Monstrously embodied selves are, then, fundamentally disturbing in that they cannot be accounted for within the binary parameters of sameness and difference, in which the latter is measured in terms of the former. Instead, they transgress boundaries in being simultaneously too close, too recognisable (threatening merging, indifference), and in being excessive, in being irreducibly other to the binary itself. Before going on to theorise that in more clearly postmodernist terms, I want to trace the aporias within modernism itself. What is really unsettling about nonnormative embodiment is not simply the reminder of the empirical instability of all bodies, but the intuition that despite the privileging of mind in western discourse, our embodied selfhood is a matter of complex interweaving. Far from maintaining a Cartesian belief that our selves remain untouched by the vicissitudes of the ﬂesh, we are obsessed with changes to our bodies, particularly insofar as they deviate from normative ideals. Whenever the body is at risk, it is the stability of the self that is threatened. In short, corporeal and ontological anxiety are inseparable. From a phenomenological point of view this is hardly surprising, for there the structure of the self is fully imbricated with its corporeal capacities. But although the transcendent split between mind and body may be problematised by our phenomenological experience of being-in-the-world, we do still see our bodies almost as though they were suits of armour protecting a core self. We are not surprised or embarrassed by references to the “real me” inside. Any breach in the ideal impregnability of the surface ﬂesh signals potential contamination, an openness to the assault of the other. Moreover, the post-Enlightenment ideal of autonomous subjectivity and agency relies on a spacing, an interval between self and other that covers over the putative threat of engulfment by the other. As we know too well, the transhistorical hostility toward the feminine expresses a fear of, and revulsion for, bodies that appear unable to maintain the distinction and deﬁnition required by the sovereign self. As we would anticipate, the dominant systems of western ethics, and here I’m thinking particularly of bioethics, reﬂect that ideal of distinction and separation and characterise individual bodies primarily as the property of autonomous selves. The rights I hold in my own body are both protective and must be protected against the incursions of others. In such a system the interaction between subjects is mediated by an implicit contract that assumes the independence of each. In principle, biomedical law and ethics, even though constituted in part to secure the rights of persons at points of self-evident vulnerability, devolve on the assumption of autonomy, as is evident in a landmark judgment of the sixties: “Anglo-American law starts with the premise of thoroughgoing self-determination. It follows that each man is considered to be master of his own body” (Natanson v. Kline, 1960). As a corollary of such formulations, vulnerability is positioned not as an existential state, but as a contingent physical dependency. In practice that dependency is often taken to justify paternalism6 towards those in ill-health. Moreover, there appears to be a whole class of others—the very young and old, those who are mentally ill, people with disabilities, pregnant women, and so on—who are in any case deemed incapable of fully autonomous agency, and in whom vulnerability is intrinsic. Moreover, alongside a mainstream bio/ethical discourse saturated with the notion of vulnerability as the property of the other, where vulnerability signals dependency (and in ethical terms a claim on the duties of beneﬁcence and non-maleﬁcence), it is paradoxical that both biomedical and lay discourse see the normatively embodied self as vulnerable to contamination by proximity to those same others. Insofar as what we characterise as disability as opposed to disease is not in itself literally contagious, then could it be that the desire to deter the approach of those who are thus labelled, through limiting access, through isolation and silencing, speaks not to the reality of an external threat so much as to a simultaneous apprehension and denial of our own inherent vulnerability? 7 It is not a vulnerability to some(thing) other, but rather the incommon vulnerability of self-becoming. Few such ontological reﬂections or psychic complications trouble the persistence of binary models of understanding, and vulnerability remains positioned as some kind of falling short which is attributed to others—in one strand at least—by virtue of their devalued embodiment. Accordingly the dominant ethical response is to suppose that those who are in any degree unable to fulﬁll normative standards of self-care, may for that reason have special claims for care from others. Curiously, such claims arising from a perceived vulnerability may serve not to alleviate but rather to mark the position more clearly relative to the other. As Goodin puts it, “You are always vulnerable to, and dependent upon, some individual or group who have it within their power to help or harm you in some respect(s)” (1998, p. 79). Although Goodin goes on to acknowledge some degree of vulnerability in us all, he nevertheless has in mind an intrinsically asymmetrical model in which some are called upon to protect the vulnerability of others. It is precisely this kind of binary thinking which supports existing power relations that I want to unsettle. There are, of course, already within the terms of conventional discourse, strategies implicitly resistant to such reductionist thinking, one such being the claim that we are all just temporarily able-bodied (TAB) in the sense that disabling illness, accident and old age are the possible or certain fate of all. Useful though such accounts are in challenging the stigma of disability, however, they remain locked into a positivist account of embodiment that may itself be disturbed by reading the body and vulnerability through a postconventional perspective. In such a spirit, Megan Boler’s critical consideration of the supposedly radical call for an empathy with the other—a kind of caring for the other by the effort of putting oneself in her place—more adequately breaks with the convention (Boler, 1997). Unlike many other feminist ethicists who work within a liberal humanist framework and see such ethical responses very positively, Boler concludes that empathetic identiﬁcation remains trapped within a self/other binary that ultimately consumes and annihilates the other. Instead she prefers a testimonial response that requires the encounter with vulnerability to rest on an openness to the unpredictably strange and excessive, an openness that renders the self vulnerable. This seems to me an altogether more fruitful approach that acknowledges both that the self and the other are mutually engaged, and yet are irreducible the one to the other. What meaning, then, would vulnerability have if we stepped back from the relentless binaries of western epistemology that set health against illness, conformity against disparity, the perfect against the imperfect, the self against the other? What would it mean in other words to address the issue of vulnerability not without recourse to normative standards, but with a critique that exposed not simply the limits set by the cultural speciﬁcity of normativity (as opposed to the claim of a general if not universal validity), but more radically yet that the dichotomous structure is itself unstable? One immediate effect would be to place less emphasis on vulnerability as the dependency of others, and more on the notion of vulnerability as the risk of ontological uncertainty for all of us. And what if the question of contagion, of contamination were found to reside not in the supposed materialities of bodies, but in the structure of discourse itself? I propose to reread the body as a discursive construction, by now a widely familiar move to poststructuralists, but one that still often seems to stymie those who work in the health care disciplines. The problem is that aside from a thoroughgoing deconstruction of the discourses of sexuality, such as Judith Butler’s work on queer bodies (Butler, 1993), and a relatively small number of speciﬁc studies like Cathy Walby’s book on AIDS (Walby, 1996) or some of my own previous work with Janet Price on disability (Price &amp; Shildrick, 1998; Shildrick &amp; Price, 1996), it is hard to ﬁnd many postmodernist texts that address the body not just as a concept, but the body as it is lived, in pain as well as pleasure. What is called for is a rethinking that challenges the conventional opposition of the material to the discursive, and marks them as fundamentally intertwined. It is a matter of mutually constitutive modes of becoming, where “the ﬂesh and blood givenness of the physical body is not a passive surface, but the site of sensation and libidinal desire: : : : in continuous interaction with textual practices” (Shildrick, 1997, p. 178). For me, the importance of the move is not just whether we can successfully retheorise the taken-for-grantedness of bodies, for clearly feminist theory in particular has generated many such reconﬁgurations, but whether those can be carried forward to make a difference in practice. The project is, I think, ultimately an ethical one of being enabled to act differently because we can also think differently.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">3.2 Sociocultural contexts, mobility, and corporeal `dys-appearance' Disabled people's identities are closely connected to their mobility and movement through particular social and cultural settings. As Paterson and Hughes (1999, page 605) suggest, the bodies of people with particular types of impairments disappear <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:08:``both functionally and aesthetically, when faced with [socially] produced embodied norms of communication''. For some respondents, the social and cultural coding or signification associated with their bodies was identified as a source of their inability to move with ease from one place to another. As a respondent said: `` -->both functionally and aesthetically, when faced with [socially] produced embodied norms of communication''. For some respondents, the social and cultural coding or signification associated with their bodies was identified as a source of their inability to move with ease from one place to another. As a respondent said: <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:08 -->Lots of visually impaired people won't use a cane because they feel vulnerable with itöit is a sign and a signal. I have a dog now and it gives me more confidence. When you go around town you often get your cane kicked out from under your hand and you lose grip. It's being done deliberately. Who does itöwe don't know.'' Others concurred in highlighting how they often feel unwelcome when they visit public places: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:09:``the shops are terrible here, full of clutter and I've had to move shoe boxes in one shop to get around and they gave me dirty looks. I've gone into River Island in my wheelchair and they've looked at me in a disgusting way as though `you can't wear our clothes'. I just had to get out of my wheelchair to look around and try and blend in.'' In particular, pressures to conform to nonimpaired corporeal forms, or what are seen as `legitimate' modes of mobility and movement, were recounted by a number of people. For one person: `` -->the shops are terrible here, full of clutter and I've had to move shoe boxes in one shop to get around and they gave me dirty looks. I've gone into River Island in my wheelchair and they've looked at me in a disgusting way as though `you can't wear our clothes'. I just had to get out of my wheelchair to look around and try and blend in.'' In particular, pressures to conform to nonimpaired corporeal forms, or what are seen as `legitimate' modes of mobility and movement, were recounted by a number of people. For one person: <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:09 -->if you've no legs you've got no brains ... if I stand up people treat me as an equal but not if I'm in a wheelchairömost disabled people are not in a wheelchair. Most disabled people are short distance walkers and most want to stay out of them [wheelchairs]öit's a stigma to have to go into a chair, a real label which everyone can see. Going into a wheelchair means you're a failure, a freak, and not normal. Even people who are in them from childhoodöthey want to get out as everyone else is walking.'' Many respondents recalled experiences where they felt they were out of place and ought not to be there. As an interviewee commented: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:010:``people tend to talk with my wife and not me, I've only lost my legs and not my brain, I'm not a doll being pushed about and we need to enlighten people. Able- bodied people get very embarrassed and just try and ignore me.'' Hughes (1999, page 157) suggests that such feelings are part of modernity and its `` -->people tend to talk with my wife and not me, I've only lost my legs and not my brain, I'm not a doll being pushed about and we need to enlighten people. Able- bodied people get very embarrassed and just try and ignore me.'' Hughes (1999, page 157) suggests that such feelings are part of modernity and its <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:010 -->pervasive capacity to produce strangers ...who disturb its fragile cognitive, moral and aesthetic boundaries and challenge its rather overbearing sense of order''. A range of respondents related to this in recalling reactions to their presence in a public bar or a shop. For instance, for one wheelchair user: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:011:``if you go into one of the local pubs around here it's almost impossible to get served. The bar is way above you and the last time I was in the bar staff kept walking past me saying they would serve me in a minute ... well they didn't and finally I had to bang an ashtray loudly on the counter to get served'' (Imrie and Kumar, 1998, page 365). Likewise for another respondent who noted: `` -->if you go into one of the local pubs around here it's almost impossible to get served. The bar is way above you and the last time I was in the bar staff kept walking past me saying they would serve me in a minute ... well they didn't and finally I had to bang an ashtray loudly on the counter to get served'' (Imrie and Kumar, 1998, page 365). Likewise for another respondent who noted: <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:011 -->I was in my wheelchair on my own in the supermarket and I joined the check-out queue and people just didn't see me and walked right by in front of me. When they'd all gone the assistant started to pack up and I said, `what about me' and she turned around and said, `I thought you were with someone'.'' Others recalled similar experiences, with a wheelchair user referring to his (in)visibility in trying to catch the attention of a taxi. As he said: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:012:``lots of taxis don't want to take wheelchairs ... they say it is expensive, and if I hang around on the street and try and get a cab they'll never stop for me, one look at the chair and they're off.'' Such situations reaffirm, in part, Paterson and Hughes's (1999, pages 606 ^ 607) obser- vation that judgments are `` -->lots of taxis don't want to take wheelchairs ... they say it is expensive, and if I hang around on the street and try and get a cab they'll never stop for me, one look at the chair and they're off.'' Such situations reaffirm, in part, Paterson and Hughes's (1999, pages 606 ^ 607) obser- vation that judgments are <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:012 -->based, primarily, on aesthetic evidence as if (somehow) appearance is an omnipotent guide to competence''. For some vision-impaired people, the initial problem, in seeking to combat such aesthetic aversions or a rejection of their corporeal status, is developing the self- motivation to take on the hassles and hurdles involved in negotiating their way around the built environment. As a respondent noted: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:013:``you need an awful lot of motivation to go out when you are visually impairedöall involves stress and strategies. All these different types of tactile pavements, you have to concentrate so hard ... people hate it really.'' Others agreed with some reference to the hostility they encounter from people on the streets: `` -->you need an awful lot of motivation to go out when you are visually impairedöall involves stress and strategies. All these different types of tactile pavements, you have to concentrate so hard ... people hate it really.'' Others agreed with some reference to the hostility they encounter from people on the streets: <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:013 -->Usually the visually impaired won't go out at night. I got mugged and beaten to pulp a few months ago. Three youths who did it, and they found them but didn't prosecute them. There are loads of attacks against us and they've now appointed a Vulnerable Persons Officer in the council.'' Another vision-impaired person suggested that verbal and physical abuse was an everyday threat and a disincentive to moving around: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:014:``My friend Tony was walking along and heard a gang of girls saying that they were going to turn him overöthis was overheard by a gang of West Indian lads who came over and escorted him all the way homeöit doesn't make you want to go out though. RNIB never mention attacks but they're [attacks] regular. People are also patronising towards us, about how wonderful we are.We also get loads of insults in the streets.'' For others, such encounters evoke self-conscious feelings of their defective corpor- eality which they seek to manage through a variety of avoidance tactics or behaviour, which, potentially, can inhibit their mobility and movement. As one person noted: `` -->My friend Tony was walking along and heard a gang of girls saying that they were going to turn him overöthis was overheard by a gang of West Indian lads who came over and escorted him all the way homeöit doesn't make you want to go out though.

For others, such encounters evoke self-conscious feelings of their defective corpor- eality which they seek to manage through a variety of avoidance tactics or behaviour, which, potentially, can inhibit their mobility and movement. As one person noted: <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:014 -->there are disabled people who are scared of going to able-bodied places and don't feel they can compete ... so we started a sports club, bowls, chess, and archery, for disabled people and able-bodied are not allowed in.'' Disabled people's mobility is also challenged and constrained by the prejudices, assumptions, and practices of service providers who, arguably, do little to understand the specific or personal needs of disabled people. For one respondent: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:015:``everywhere I go attention is drawn to my body and what I can't do.'' The hegemony of the mobile body seeks to reaffirm discourses of health, vigour, and bodily competence and, for most respondents, moving around tended to highlight their inabilities to move with ease and independence. In short, their bodily incompetence was the issue. As one person said: `` -->everywhere I go attention is drawn to my body and what I can't do.'' The hegemony of the mobile body seeks to reaffirm discourses of health, vigour, and bodily competence and, for most respondents, moving around tended to highlight their inabilities to move with ease and independence. In short, their bodily incompetence was the issue. As one person said: <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:015 -->it is taken for granted that a person in a wheelchair won't go out on their own, we're always seen as a person who will be pushed and not able to do it for ourselves.'' Reminders of bodily (in)competence were highlighted time and again by respondents, from the subtle innuendoes to direct insults or remarks and the `back door' treatment which is ever present. As a respondent noted: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:016:``often we have to use a goods lift in shops, it shouldn't be like this but you get lulled into the attitude that this is how it is, you get used to using it.'' In particular, the dominance of nonimpaired corporeality was evident in relation to particular modes of mobility and impairment. For instance, trying to book an airline ticket is a significant hurdle for many disabled people because many operators rein- force forms of dependence by their unwillingness to let people, such as wheelchair users, travel on their own. As a respondent commented: `` -->often we have to use a goods lift in shops, it shouldn't be like this but you get lulled into the attitude that this is how it is, you get used to using it.''

For instance, trying to book an airline ticket is a significant hurdle for many disabled people because many operators rein- force forms of dependence by their unwillingness to let people, such as wheelchair users, travel on their own. As a respondent commented: <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:016 -->I can get in and out of this thing and look after myself and I only need it for long distances. I go everywhere on my own but when I tried to get a flight to Portugal all of the operators bar one wouldn't let me on without an escort.Well, who's going to escort me and pay for it?'' Others recalled similar experiences with airlines which are often unwilling to `take risks' with what are regarded as uncontrollable and polluting bodies. One person, in recounting a humiliating moment, remarked: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:017:``one of my friends has muscular dystrophy and she tried to book a flight to go to America and they said they would only take her as long as she had incontinence pads, they wouldn't let her go otherwise. It's something you never think about and, well, you wouldn't and she found it humiliating.'' The primacy of the mobile body is also reflected in the absence of any means or mechanisms for disabled people to facilitate their mobility without some recourse to help or being placed in a situation where they are dependent on a third party. A typical situation was described by another wheelchair user: `` -->one of my friends has muscular dystrophy and she tried to book a flight to go to America and they said they would only take her as long as she had incontinence pads, they wouldn't let her go otherwise. It's something you never think about and, well, you wouldn't and she found it humiliating.'' The primacy of the mobile body is also reflected in the absence of any means or mechanisms for disabled people to facilitate their mobility without some recourse to help or being placed in a situation where they are dependent on a third party. A typical situation was described by another wheelchair user: <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:017 -->the local bank have a ramp, but just try and get up it: no chance. So they've given me a servicecall transmitteröI press it outside and a buzzer goes off inside and staff come and get me, so this is instead of having electronic doors and a decent rampöwhat a waste.'' Bodily `incompetence' is, for many respondents, reaffirmed by their dependence on particular support structures or services to facilitate their mobility. For one wheelchair user: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:018:``any distance and I have a problem ... I must always have someone with me and it's really hilly around here. It's difficult to get around the shopping streets and dangerous to get across the roads.'' For another wheelchair user, his mobility is wholly dependent on the wheelchair. As he commented: `` -->any distance and I have a problem ... I must always have someone with me and it's really hilly around here. It's difficult to get around the shopping streets and dangerous to get across the roads.'' For another wheelchair user, his mobility is wholly dependent on the wheelchair. As he commented: <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:018 -->I feel I'm at a dead loss when my chair's out for repair and there's no one to give a shout about it. If my motor goes [in my wheelchair] I stay at home and this happened recently for two weeks.'' For wheelchair users, however, the wheelchair is a paradoxical object, simultane- ously a signifier of their (impaired) corporeal status or `bodily incompetence', but also a prosthetic device, or what Le Corbusier (1925) refers to as a `limb-object', that is, an extension of the body. It is <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:019:``the thing which gets me around'' and a mechanism for restoring a sense of independence of mobility and movement. For this person, the chair `` -->the thing which gets me around'' and a mechanism for restoring a sense of independence of mobility and movement. For this person, the chair <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:019 -->gets me to where I want to go'' but, as he suggested, the variety of intercorporeal encounters where the visibility of the chair is paramount tends to reinforce socio- cultural attitudes about his <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:020:``body as incompetent''. As the respondent said: `` -->body as incompetent''. As the respondent said: <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:020 -->people are horrified you have a life and you're out and about ... it seems better to stay at home or go where you're accepted ... on the streets they always stare at me but never directly, as though I'm not there'' (Imrie and Kumar, 1998, page 362). Such situations are, as Paterson and Hughes (1999, page 605) note, illustrative of the idea that <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:021:``oppression is not an abstract structure ... it is felt in the flesh and bones. It erupts in the body as the body dys-appears''. 4 Conclusions Disabled people's mobility and movement are highly circumscribed by sociocultural attitudes, practices, and the related design of the built environment. From the micro- architecture of urban streetscapes, to the discontinuous nature of transportation infrastructure and networks, one can agree with Paterson and Hughes (1999, page 605) who suggest that it is `` -->oppression is not an abstract structure ... it is felt in the flesh and bones. It erupts in the body as the body dys-appears''. 4 Conclusions Disabled people's mobility and movement are highly circumscribed by sociocultural attitudes, practices, and the related design of the built environment. From the micro- architecture of urban streetscapes, to the discontinuous nature of transportation infrastructure and networks, one can agree with Paterson and Hughes (1999, page 605) who suggest that it is <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:021 -->hegemonic bodies that are culturally formative of the codes and idioms'' which condition the norms of movement and mobility (also, see Corker, 1998; 1999; Hughes, 1999). Such norms revolve around conceptions of the bodily incompetence of people with physical and mental impairments, while propagat- ing welfare policies and procedures which seek to discipline disabled people into a state (and status) of nonimpaired carnality. For disabled people, then, their immobility is their own fault or the consequences of a deviant corporeality which requires medical care and rehabilitation or, failing that, the application of charitable works. Law (1999, page 583) suggests that an excavation of the <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:022:``practices and meanings related to mobility should not detract us from the politics of mobility''. For disabled people, a politics of mobility is, however, not divisible from broader challenges to, and reformulations of, the hegemonic values and practices of a society which, as Paterson and Hughes (1999, page 609) note, serves to maintain a hierarchy of identities. Such hierarchies essentialise conceptions of disability (as impairment of a particular type), with the effect that the complexities of disabled people's corporeality and experiences (of mobility and movement) are rarely described, acknowledged, nor understood (see, for example, Corker, 1998; 1999; Gleeson, 1999; Hine, 1999; Hine and Mitchell, 2001; Imrie, 1996; 2000b). Not surprisingly, as some respondents intimated, the shift- ing, indeterminate, and incoherent corporealities of disability are often at odds with the static categories and practices of, for example, producers and providers of transporta- tion services. Such services treat disabled people as `different' and `special' or even as `burden- some'. As Corker (1998, page 82) suggests, the ascription of `` -->practices and meanings related to mobility should not detract us from the politics of mobility''. For disabled people, a politics of mobility is, however, not divisible from broader challenges to, and reformulations of, the hegemonic values and practices of a society which, as Paterson and Hughes (1999, page 609) note, serves to maintain a hierarchy of identities.

Not surprisingly, as some respondents intimated, the shift- ing, indeterminate, and incoherent corporealities of disability are often at odds with the static categories and practices of, for example, producers and providers of transporta- tion services. Such services treat disabled people as `different' and `special' or even as `burden- some'. As Corker (1998, page 82) suggests, the ascription of <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:022 -->difference'' to disabled people is often used to distinguish them <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:023:``as persons who can justifiably be treated unequally''. For Corker (1998, page 82), the unequal treatment of (disabled) people, in relation to `` -->as persons who can justifiably be treated unequally''. For Corker (1998, page 82), the unequal treatment of (disabled) people, in relation to <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:023 -->the distribution of benefits and burdens, and in the absence of any justification, is a paradigm of injustice''. Arguably, these injustices require a politics of mobility in which liberal conceptions of mobility and freedom are reassessed to destabilise the efficacy of `the mobile body'. Given liberalism's abstract universality and individualism, and its preoccupation with the sameness of treatment of subjects, alternative frameworks are required, so some argue, which seek to develop <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:024:``a recogni- tion of difference and responsiveness to individuated needs, as well as the protection of the rights of difference'' (Gould, 1996, page 180). A politics of movement and mobility, then, ought to enable us to think about, and respond to `` -->a recogni- tion of difference and responsiveness to individuated needs, as well as the protection of the rights of difference'' (Gould, 1996, page 180). A politics of movement and mobility, then, ought to enable us to think about, and respond to <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:024 -->the diversity of mobility, networks and access required by diverse groups in their daily lives'' (Huxley, 1997, page 2). These ideas are core to a politics of disability which is premised on the eradication of ascribed needs, or processes whereby policy experts and professionals assess dis- abled people's needs and ascribe the relevant policy prescriptions (for example, the provision of special transport or equipment to facilitate mobility). For Oliver (1990), ascribed needs reinforce the power of professional experts, such as transportation planners, to determine the quality of disabled people's lives. This, according to Oliver, maintains disabled people's dependence on others and does little to create the condi- tions for disabled people's self-determination. In contrast, Oliver (1996) notes that a politics of disability ought to work from a position of self-defined needs as a basis for rights claims (also, see Handley, 2000). As Oliver (1996, page 74) suggests, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:025:``it is rights to appropriate their own self defined needs that disabled people are demanding, not to have their needs defined and met by others''. In relation to mobility and movement, disabled people are increasingly seeking to assert their self-defined needs in relation to their claim that they have the right to equality of opportunity in moving from one place to another. This, though, is far from an unproblematic position and process (Handley, 2000). As Handley notes, `` -->it is rights to appropriate their own self defined needs that disabled people are demanding, not to have their needs defined and met by others''. In relation to mobility and movement, disabled people are increasingly seeking to assert their self-defined needs in relation to their claim that they have the right to equality of opportunity in moving from one place to another. This, though, is far from an unproblematic position and process (Handley, 2000). As Handley notes, <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:025 -->if everyone is demanding the satisfaction of their self-defined needs by right, then how are we to sort out the inevitable conflicts that this will generate? How are we to prioritise all of these competing claims, and who will arbitrate between them?'' (page 318). This is the crux of seeking to politicise movement and mobility with reference to `individuated' claims to rights, or through a framework which is potentially oblivious to the points of conflict and the possible need for compromise, or even an acceptance on particular limits to, and limitations of, a person's mobility and movement. Indeed, although one might accept that disabled, and other, people have the moral right to movement and mobility, the issue becomes more difficult in thinking about how this might be translated into practical or legal terms or into a set of policies underpinned by legal rights. As Handley (2000, page 319) suggests, should such rights be ones which last in perpetuity, that is, civil or political rights, or should they be `special' or compensatory in form? How should limits to right's claims be assessed or gauged and how far should one respond to Ramsey's observation that <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:026:``needs cannot be inferred from what people say they need or from what people actually do''? (1998, page 229; also quoted in Handley, 2000, page 321). Moreover, how does one deal with Beiner's claim that `` -->needs cannot be inferred from what people say they need or from what people actually do''? (1998, page 229; also quoted in Handley, 2000, page 321). Moreover, how does one deal with Beiner's claim that <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:026 -->part and parcel of rights discourse is a tendency towards forms of social life that are exclusively adversarial, litigious, and geared towards modes of self assertion?'' (1992, page 147; also quoted in Handley, 2000, pages 321 ^ 322). There are no easy answers nor programmatic or prescriptive resolutions to these questions and it is only through the development of a `politics of mobility' that such questions can come to the fore as the basis for developing new perspectives and political programmes in relation to disabled people's movement and mobility. This, though, is a long way from realisation. Disabled people lack rudimentary levels of participation and involvement in civil society and a precondition for transforming their mobility and movement is, I would argue, increases in opportunities for partici- pation in what Gould terms <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:027:``the discourse and associations of the public sphere'' (1996, page 181). This ought to be more than just the installation of deliberative democratic fora or procedural enactments that potentially do little to transform the social and institutional fixities of disablist attitudes and practices. In particular, discourses of movement and mobility ought to move beyond just public-sector participative networks towards the development and propagation of private-sector or corporate-sector responsibilities. Ultimately, the configuration of political debates and movements around mobility and movement will depend on particular combinations of contextual factors, including the social, political, and institutional structures of local (geographical) environments (see Imrie, 2000a). However, such environments ought to be enabling or, as Gleeson (1999, page 149) suggests, aiming `` -->the discourse and associations of the public sphere'' (1996, page 181).

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The federal government has a long-established special relationship with Native Americans characterized by their status as governmentally independent entities, dependent on the United States for support and protection. In exchange for land and in compensation for forced removal from their original homelands, the government promised through laws, treaties, and pledges to support and protect Native Americans. However, funding for programs associated with those promises has fallen short, and Native people continue to suffer the consequences of a discriminatory history. Federal efforts to raise Native American living conditions to the standards of others have long been in motion, but Native Americans still suffer higher rates of poverty, poor educational achievement, substandard housing, and higher rates of disease and illness. Native Americans continue to rank at or near the bottom of nearly every social, health, and economic indicator. Small in numbers and relatively poor, Native Americans often have had a difficult time ensuring fair and equal treatment on their own. Unfortunately, relying on the goodwill of the nation to honor its obligation to Native Americans clearly has not resulted in desired outcomes. Its small size and geographic apartness from the rest of American society induces some to designate the Native American population the “invisible minority.” To many, the government’s promises to Native Americans go largely unfulfilled. Thus, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, through this report, gives voice to a quiet crisis. Over the last 10 years, federal funding for Native American programs has increased significantly. However, this has not been nearly enough to compensate for a decline in spending power, which had been evident for decades before that, nor to overcome a long and sad history of neglect and discrimination. Thus, there persists a large deficit in funding Native American programs that needs to be paid to eliminate the backlog of unmet Native American needs, an essential predicate to raising their standards of living to that of other Americans. Native Americans living on tribal lands do not have access to the same services and programs available to other Americans, even though the government has a binding trust obligation to provide them.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Surface transportation in Indian Country involves thousands of miles of roads, bridges, and highways, and connects and serves both tribal and non-tribal communities. Millions of Americans and eight billion vehicles travel reservation roads annually. Despite being the principal transportation system for all residents of and visitors to tribal communities, reservation roads are still the most underdeveloped road network in the nation. Currently, there are over 140,000 miles of Indian reservation roads with multiple owners, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs, American Indian tribes, states, and counties. Construction of transportation systems that allow for safe travel and promote economic expansion will help strengthen tribal communities, while also making valuable contributions to much of the surrounding rural America. Maintenance and enhancement of transportation infrastructure is critical to economic development, job creation, and improving living conditions for individuals and families throughout Indian Country. Deficient transportation infrastructure is a barrier which impedes economic development in Native communities. Tribal governments are working to improve public safety, education, health care, and housing, and generate jobs through economic development. These worthy objectives are more difficult to achieve when transportation infrastructure in Indian Country continues to lag behind the rest of the nation. Tribal nations require sustained and adequate federal transportation appropriations to address the large backlog of deferred road and bridge construction and road maintenance needs. Investing in tribal transportation will create jobs and make Native economies stronger. Key Recommendations DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill Indian Reservation Roads (IRR) Programs • Provide $500 million for the Indian Reservation Roads Programs. • Provide $20 million for the Indian Reservation Roads Bridge Program. The officials at the Departments of the Interior and Transportation have recognized that transportation systems within Indian Country are suffering from a nearly $40 billion construction backlog. An equally daunting backlog exists for deferred maintenance for tribal transportation facilities. Rising construction inflation rates continue to diminish the purchasing power of the limited federal funds currently provided to the IRR Program and other tribal transportation programs. Even solid tribal roads and bridges fall into disrepair and require costly reconstruction years before the end of their design life due to a lack of more cost-effective maintenance funding. Under any assessment, tribal transportation programs remain severely underfunded and the construction and maintenance funding backlog will only get worse without significant funding increases during the next highway reauthorization period.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For years, a lack of transportation options has held Native Americans captive. Without access to services and employment, this subset of the population has a history of high unemployment, poor health, and a lack of education. Public transit is viewed as a way to address this mobility challenge; however, many barriers to the provision of tribal transit exist. This paper examines the current state of transit on reservations through historical and environmental contexts, discusses the necessity of transit for Native Americans, examines case studies, and describes funding and legislative frameworks with the goal of presenting ideas on how Native Americans might overcome the barriers to transit provision. Native Americans have long faced a limited number of mobility options, and these limited options have adversely affected their quality of life through a lack of access to employment centers, health care, education, and other necessary services. The federal government has recently become involved in providing funding for mass transit on reservations, with much of the responsibility for the transportation system focused on the tribes. American Indians face many difficulties while attempting to provide transit for their communities. This paper, in part, examines the current state of tribal transportation and the nature of some of those difficulties. The survival of Native Americans has been linked to mobility for centuries. From crisscrossing the Great Plains in search of buffalo to traversing the Great Lakes country in search of fur, the need for transportation has been essential for the sustainability of these indigenous peoples. Before the arrival of the colonialist Europeans, Native American tribes were able to traverse the land in search of safety and sustenance. The continued immigration of Europeans put increasing pressure on Native Americans to retain their heritage and way of life. The creation of the reservations has isolated Native Americans from vital services. Today, the need for mobility is no less important to the survival and quality of life of American Indians; however, the environment in which they exist has greatly changed. No longer are tribes able to ride through the countryside or migrate along riverbeds. As automobiles became the mode of choice, land use development followed, leading to sprawling cities and towns, creating even more reliance on the automobile. Unable to access an automobile because of either inadequate funds or a lack of history with this mode, many Native Americans must rely on transit services for their basic mobility needs. Paratransit or scheduled vans, buses, and personal vehicles are the types of transit services offered through the transportation system to move the public. Although the demand for a transit service might be present, the supply is not. This paper examines tribal transit by discussing the historical context, the need for transit, current practice, barriers to providing transit, legislation and funding, and suggestions for increased transit planning implementation. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE To understand the current transportation situation that Native Americans ﬁnd themselves in today, one must explore the evolution of policy and legislation that continues to color their environment. As post– colonial America grew and expanded, the conﬂict between the indigenous peoples and the former Europeans grew ever more intense. President Andrew Jackson spearheaded the Indian Removal Act of 1830 as a way to separate American Indians from the white population and eventually assimilate them into the new white American culture (1). This act permitted the forcible removal of Native Americans from their land and sent them westward; more than 70,000 people were removed during the ﬁrst 10 years (1). The movement west brought famine, disease, and humiliation to the Cherokee, Choctaw, and many other tribes that later found themselves prisoners on isolated reservations. Even today, reservations are usually far away from central city employment, education, and other services, contributing to the high rates of unemployment and the poor health displayed by this population. DEMOGRAPHICS The 2000 U.S. Census reported 2,475,956 people of American Indian and Alaska Native racial background alone, not in combination with another race (2). Individuals within this population are counted as either a member of a federally recognized tribe or a member of a tribe with no federal recognition. The focus of this paper is on federally recognized tribes. Documentation about tribal transit is difficult to ﬁnd, and most of it is exclusively about federally recognized tribes. Many federal programs offer assistance in the form of funds, technical assistance and support, and consultation for tribes that choose to implement transportation plans. This paper focuses on the deficiency of access to public transportation for those Native Americans living on rural reservation lands. The national poverty level in 1999 was 12.4% for the general population, but it was 24.5% for Native Americans (3, 4). This difference results from the high rates of unemployment present on Indian reservations. The unemployment rate for all reservations is 13.6%, which is signiﬁcantly higher than recent national unemployment ﬁgures. Yet, on some reservations, like the Rosebud and Pine Ridge Lakota Indian Reservations in South Dakota, unemployment ﬁgures are cited at 80% (5). It is difficult for individuals to effect positive changes in their economic status without employment. Access to public transportation could be a source of empowerment through access to jobs. Education levels also indicate the poor socioeconomic status of Native Americans. Of all Native Americans ages 18 to 24 years, 63.2% have graduated from high school, whereas the national average high school graduation rate is 76.5% (1). For Native Americans 25 years and older, “9.4 percent have completed four or more years of college, compared with 20.3 percent nationally” (1). A college education is not necessary for employment; however, it often leads to higher-paying employment. Many young Native Americans who leave reservations to attend college do not return. The tribes lose the education, leadership skills, and other benefits that their children have acquired. Non-Native American people may ﬁll positions left in tribal management, which does little to elevate the overall socioeconomic status of reservation residents. Low levels of education limit Native Americans to low-income jobs. Recent trends have leaned toward the service sector because of the introduction of casinos and accompanying businesses like hotels and restaurants. These trends further exacerbate the relegation of Native Americans to low incomes. Service jobs are an essential link to a higher standard of living, yet some remain a link to low-income status. In America, an education remains one of the most viable means to employment at positions that pay better than minimum wage. CURRENT STATE OF RESERVATION TRANSIT Currently, only 18 of the 562 federally recognized tribes have public transportation systems that receive any form of public monies from FTA’s Section 18 program (6). The Section 18 program provides funding for both capital and operating assistance. Section 18 funding requires a 20% local match for capital funds and a 50% local match for operating funds (7). It is likely that this requirement of a local matching contribution is a signiﬁcant reason that tribes seeking to establish, continue, or expand tribal transit programs have limited access to self-funding sources. Existing transit systems are often merely extensions of human service provisions, like Head Start or a health services program. In recent years, tribes have been able to increase their public transit offerings through the Tribal Transit Technical Assistance Program, which is funded through the Rural Business Cooperative Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Reservations are forced to provide minimal services with vehicles that are often shared. Providing transit in this fashion truly is better than nothing, but it does little for conveying a sense of permanence and reliability in the local transit program. In 1995, the Community Transportation Association of America published the document Transportation in Indian Country: Getting Started as a means of assisting tribes operating public transportation systems (7). That document suggests that the first step for tribes is to take a vehicle inventory. Tribes are encouraged to consider a “wide range of possibilities” for shared vehicles for use by tribal transportation providers. They are advised to “look at programs such as: Head Start, senior centers, job training programs, rehabilitation, education, and health care facilities. Talk with the people who administer these programs and ﬁnd out how participants reach their services” (7). These suggestions encourage Native Americans to assemble a menagerie of vehicles rather than establish a recognizable ﬂeet of transit vehicles. There are rural areas of America that serve the members of their community in much the same fashion, yet many rural communities have uniformed drivers who operate uniquely identiﬁable vehicles. WHY TRANSIT IS NEEDED Stunning Statistics • Native Americans have a lower life expectancy and are “more than twice as likely as the general population to face hunger” (8). • The Rosebud and Pine Ridge Lakota Indian Reservations are in two of the poorest counties in the United States, with 80% unemployment (5). • The federal government spends 60% less per capita on health care for Native Americans than for the average American and 50% less for Native Americans than for Medicaid recipients or prisoners (8). • The fatality rate on reservation roads is four times the annual national average, as of 1999 (9). According to Lorenzo Black Lance, a Brule Sioux who runs the Native American Heritage Association (NAHA) in Rapid City, South Dakota, “Transportation is one of the most critical needs for our people. It’s right up there with food, clothing, and heat. Transportation unlocks opportunity” (5). Improved mobility allows access to employment, medical treatment, and education. Meeting these essential needs increases the population’s economic vitality. With a better economy, there will be an increase in job opportunities, creating an ability to pay for education, medical needs, groceries, bills, and yes, transportation.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">American Indians have suffered from systematic genocide within Western society, in the forms of government-sanctioned physical onslaughts and confrontations, murder, land theft, forced removal and relocation, economic deprivation, incarceration, environmental racism, devastation of tribal sovereignty, and as a result of continued economic dependency. Acts of genocide committed against Indian people are founded on and legitimated by Western constructions of abject Otherness. Over five hundred years of social, political, and economic domination, Western society enforced its cultural codes of Otherness upon American Indians to gain our complicity in the power structure. Through formal Western education, conversion to Christianity, and assimilation into Euro-American culture and the capitalist economy, tribal people learned to speak the language and to interpret and reproduce the meanings of our oppressors; our own meanings, languages, and cultures were simultaneously devastated. American Indian participation in the construction and reproduction of Western language and meaning ensured our complicity in patriarchal power and aided Euro-American exploitation of our lands, resources, and labor. Like colonized groups throughout the world, American Indian people learned and internalized the discursive practices of the West—the very codes that created, reflected, and reproduced our oppression. As American Indians participate in, create, and reproduce Western cultural forms, we internalize Western meanings of difference and abject Otherness, viewing ourselves within and through the constructs that defined us as racially and culturally subhuman, deficient, and vile. As Western constructions of abject difference are both forced upon and accepted by American Indians, we define ourselves through these constructions and subsequently participate in the reproduction of these codes. For, as we assume the dominant subject position, we often take upon ourselves definitions of the objectified, abject Other as (portions of) our own identities and act them out in flat, one-dimensional caricatures that mirror the dominant culture’s representations. Moreover, as we buy into these codes, we not only apply them to our individual selves but also to those within our own marginalized group(s)—our loved ones and community members. Virtually nonexistent in traditional tribal communities prior to European invasion, contemporary American Indian communities struggle with devastating social ills including alcoholism, family violence, incest, sexual assault, fetal-alcohol syndrome, homicide, and suicide at startling rates similar to and sometimes exceeding those of white society. In their groundbreaking works, authors Maria YellowHorse BraveHeart and Lemyra DeBruyn (1995; 1996a; 1996b) understand the widespread social ills plaguing American Indians as manifestations of internalized oppression. The authors assert that experiences of racism and internalized oppression contribute to current social ills among Indians as a result of Western imperialism, assimilation, and Indian identifocation with the dominate culture’s codes (BraveHeart and DeBruyn 1996b). In describing causal factors leading to social problems, they state, “We contend that the high rates of depression . . . suicide, homicide, domestic violence and child abuse among American Indians can also be attributed to [the] processes of internalized oppression and identification with the aggressor” (1996b, 6). Through five hundred years of assimilation and acculturation, American Indians have internalized Western discursive practices and so we often view ourselves in ways mirroring the dominant subject position. However, Indian people also live in a sort of cultural double consciousness, as portions of our traditional subjective identities persist in the preserved beliefs of our ancestors practiced today. Through the telling of our experiences and stories in a continued oral tradition and through the preservation of traditional ways, many Indian people resist the dominant culture’s subject position, knowing that we, like our Grandmothers and Grandfathers, have not deserved a history of violence and genocide. Moreover, our oral traditions preserved many stories recounting the subjugation of our ancestors and these stories were passed along through generations creating an alternative interpretation, or knowledge, of the harms inflicted by white society. American Indians’ knowledge of our historical and continued oppression is experienced as a profound anguish. As Shirley Hill Witt explains, “Among Native Americans, the memory of genocide and tribal extinction is a raw unhealing wound” (1974, 35). This pain is described by Duran and Duran as a “soul wound” (1995, 27). The authors contend the genocidal efforts of Western imperialism have “inflict[ed] a wound to the soul of Native American people that is felt in agonizing proportions to this day” (Duran and Duran 1995, 27). Our experiences of colonization and disempowerment under patriarchal capitalism are silenced by white society. The perpetration of cultural genocide is whitewashed by the dominant culture in the master narrative of “discovery” and “manifest destiny.” Like the knowledges and stories of Others under patriarchal oppression, American Indian people’s pain is not recognized nor validated by the dominant culture. Instead, white society uses negative constructions of Indians as subhuman and lacking a full range of human qualities and emotions in order to justify our disempowerment. BraveHeart and DeBruyn elaborate upon this contention, asserting that American Indians have been socially constructed as incapable of experiencing emotional responses to pain and suffering. They contend, “[T]he historical view of American Indians as being stoic and savage contributed to a belief on the part of the dominant society that Indian people were incapable of having feelings. This belief system intimates that Indians had no capacity to mourn and, subsequently, no need or right to grieve” (BraveHeart and Debruyn 1996b, 11). Drawing upon the literature on Nazi concentration camp survivors, BraveHeart and DeBruyn assert that American Indians today experience a phenomenon the authors label “Historical Unresolved Grief Syndrome” resulting from the “historical trauma” 1 experienced under cultural and economic imperialism. The authors contend that social problems such as alcohol abuse experienced by Indian people are symptomatic of the past and present traumas we experience, and also symptomatic of the dominant culture’s denial of the harms in1 icted upon tribal people and from the invalidation of Indian pain (BraveHeart 1995; BraveHeart and DeBruyn 1996a; 1996b).</span><br />

<strong>The plan’s engagement with Otherness is the creation of a holy community that leaves us open to the transformative impact of difference; the alternative to this ethical stance is nuclear apocalypse</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Fasching 93</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">– Darrell J. Fasching is a dude of religious studies of the University of South Florida in Tampa where he has been a member of the faculty since 1982. (“The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima: Apocalypse or Utopia?” 1993, pp 5-8)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The best way to describe the &quot;style&quot; of the theology of culture proposed in these books is to suggest that it is a &quot;decentered&quot; or &quot;alienated theology&quot;. Alienated theology is the opposite of apologetic theology. Apologetic theology typically seeks to defend the &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;superiority&quot; of one's own tradition against the &quot;false,&quot; &quot;inferior,&quot; and &quot;alien&quot; views of other traditions. Alienated theology, by contrast, is theology done &quot;as if&quot; one were a stranger to one's own narrative traditions, seeing and critiquing one's own traditions from the vantage point of the other's narrative traditions. It is my conviction that alienated theology is the appropriate mode for theology in an emerging world civilization—a civilization tottering in the balance between apocalypse and utopia. There are two ways to enter world history, according to the contemporary author John Dunne: you can be dragged in by way of world war or you can walk in by way of mutual understanding. By the first path, global civilization emerges as a totalitarian project of dominance that risks escalating into nuclear apocalypse. By the second path, we prevent the rise of the first, creating global civilization through an expansion of our understanding of what it means to be human. This occurs when we pass over to another's religion and culture and come back with new insight into our own. Ghandi is an example, passing over to the Sermon on the Mount and coming back to the Hindu Bhagavad Gita to gain new insight into it as a scripture of nonviolence. Ghandi never seriously considered becoming a Christian but his Hinduism was radically altered by his encounter with Christianity. One could say the same (reversing the directions) for Martin Luther King Jr., who was deeply influenced by Ghandi's understanding of nonviolent resistance in the Gita. When we pass over (whether through travel, friendship, or disciplined study and imagination) we become &quot;strangers in a strange land&quot; as well as stangers to ourselves, seeing ourselves through the eyes of another. Assuming the perspective of a stranger is an occasion for insight and the sharing of insight. Such cross-cultural interactions build bridges of understanding and action between persons and cultures that make cooperation possible and conquest unnecessary. &quot;Passing over&quot; short circuits apocalyptic confrontation and inaugurates utopian new beginnings—new beginnings for the &quot;postmodern&quot; world of the coming third millennium. Ghandi and King are symbols of a possible style for postmodern alienated theology. To be an alien is to be a stranger. To be alienated is to be a stranger to oneself. We live in a world of ideological conflict in which far too many individuals (whether theists or a-theists) practice a “centered” theology” in which they are too sure of who they are and what they must do. Such a world has far too many answers and not nearly enough questions and self-questioning. A world divided by its answers is headed for an inevitable apocalyptic destiny. However, when we are willing to become strangers to ourselves (or when we unwillingly become so), new possibilities open up where before everything was closed and hopeless. At the heart of my position is the conviction that the kairos of our time calls forth the badly neglected ethic of “welcoming the outcast” that underlies the Buddhist tradition. This care for the stranger and the outcast, I shall argue, provides the critical norm for identifying authentic transcendence as self-transcendence. Centered theologies, whether sacred or secular, theist or a-theist, are ethnocentric theologies that can tolerate the alien or other, if at all, only as a potential candidate for conversion to sameness. Centered theologies are exercises in narcissism that inevitably lead down apocalyptic paths like those that led to Auschwitz and Hiroshima. Why? Because such theologies, whether sacred or “secular,” cannot permit there to be others in the world whose way of being might, by sheer contrast, cause self-doubt and self-questioning. When as a student I read Paul Tillich, I found it hard to believe him when he said that the questions were more important than the answers. I was so taken with his answers that I was sure he was just trying to be modest. What really mattered were the answers. Since then, I have come to realize that answers always seem more important and more certain to those who have come by them without wrestling with the questions. I know now that Tillich was quite serious and quite right—the questions are indeed more important. I have come to find afullness in the doubts and questions of my life, which I once thought could be found only in the answers. After Auschwitz and Hiroshima, I distrust all final answers—all final solutions. Mercifully, doubts and questions have come to be so fulfilling that I find myself suspicious of answers, not because they are necessarily false or irrelevant, but because even when relevant and true they are, and can be, only partial. It is doubt and questioning that always lures me on to broader horizons and deeper insights through an openness to the infinite that leaves me contentedly discontent. Alienated theology understands doubt and the questions that arise from it as our most fundamental experience of the infinite. For, our unending questions keep us open to the infinite, continually inviting us to transcend our present horizon of understanding. In a like manner, the presence of the stranger continuously calls us into question and invites us to transcend the present horizon of the egocentric and ethnocentric answers that structure our personal and cultural identities. An alienated theology understands that only a faith which requires one to welcome the alien or stranger is truly a utopian faith capable of transforming us into “new beings” who are capable of creating a new world of pluralistic human interdependence. To put it in terms closest to home for myself, as a Christian who seeks to come to grips with Aushwitz in the light the history of Christan anti-Judaism, I cannot be a Christian except as I am prepared to welcome Jews (and analogously Buddhists or secular humanists, etc.) into my life. The very attempt to convert them would be to destroy the authenticity of my own faith by robbing me of the chance to welcome the stranger (the one who is different from me and a permanent witness of the Wholly Other in my life) who is given to me as an invitation to self-transcendence. For the literal meaning of transcendence is &quot;to go beyond&quot;—to go beyond ourselves (individually and communally) as we are to become something more and something new. To be human is to have a utopian capacity to create new worlds. When we deny ourselves that possibility, we set in motion the seeds of our apocalyptic self-destruction. The tragedy of human existence revealed by Auschwitz and Hiroshima is that we have continued to misread our situation. Given the opportunity for selftranscendence, the opportunity to be carried beyond ourselves into a new global human community, we have instead insisted on a technological solution&quot; a MAD (mutual assured destruction) solution. This at best, leads to a global stalemate between cultures and at worst an attempt at global conquest. In either case we place ourselves under the dark and threatening cloud of a nuclear apocalypse that such a path risks.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">These FY 2013 budget recommendations represent necessary elements for a strong economic foundation in Indian Country. For instance, education is fundamental to long-term economic opportunities. Investments in tribal infrastructure must be made to address the inadequate roads, housing, and broadband that are all essential to commerce. Bolstering public safety is also a prerequisite for long-term economic development. Finally, support for energy and industry must be ramped up; although tribal lands contain a vast amount of the nation’s conventional and renewable energy resources, tribal governments face an array of challenges in developing those energy resources. All of these investments hold immense promise to contribute to regional economies, which serves to strengthen the American economy and build a better future for all Americans. The United States is facing serious fiscal challenges caused largely by the imbalance between revenues and rising costs in the health care system. Over the next decade, federal budget deficits are projected to grow primarily due to the economic downturn, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and war spending. Decision-makers in Congress and the Administration are focused on the goal of reducing deficits sufficiently to stabilize the debt relative to the size of the economy. Last year, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which includes binding limits on annual appropriations that reduce projected funding for discretionary programs by about $1 trillion through 2021. Under these caps, discretionary spending will shrink from about 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011 to 6.2 percent in 2021, well below the 8.7 percent average over the past 40 years. Indian Country recognizes the state of the economy, the pressures on government at all levels, and the related challenges for job seekers. Tribes have been doing more with less for generations, and we propose the following general recommendations to help our communities, our neighbors, and the United States as a whole. As Congress and the Administration consider ways to address the deficit, tribal leaders urge them to sustain funding for human programs as a central part of the trust responsibility. The foregoing FY 2013 tribal budget program requests have been compiled in collaboration with tribal leaders, Native organizations, and tribal budget consultation bodies. Tribes respectfully request that these recommendations be included in the appropriations process.</span><br />

<strong>Federal government affirmation of the Trust Doctrine is necessary to spill over and protect native rights at all levels of government</strong><br />

Knight Professor of Law Faculty Director, Environmental and Natural Resources Law Program at the University of Oregon.

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">B. The Modern Role of the Trust Doctrine The duty of protection so central to the sovereign trust paradigm two centuries ago is arguably just as important today. In the earlier periods, federal protection was needed to secure retained native lands against intruding white settlers; today, federal protection is increasingly needed to shield Indian Country from environmental threats both to the tribal land base and to shared resources such as water and wildlife. Abating pollution which threatens reservation lands, managing timber resources for perpetual yield, or sustaining wildlife at levels adequate to support continued treaty harvest, are objectives inherent in the federal government’s duty of protection. Notably, modern environmental threats to native separatism are occurring within a radically altered legal regime from that which prevailed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and this new regime invites redirected attention to the trust doctrine as a legal tool to protect native rights. Federal-Indian relations are increasingly becoming the province of executive branch agencies. The burgeoning administrative state presents a formidable legal infrastructure within which, as a practical matter, much federal-tribal interaction takes place. While the BIA has always dominated tribal life, now other agencies operate programs or implement regulations which have a tremendous effect on the environment so integral to native separatism.t49 Unfortunately, many of these agencies routinely carry out statutory mandates without due regard to the special obligations owed to native nations. In this new context, the trust doctrine is an. important legal tool to protect native rights against adverse agency action. Statutory standards developed to serve the interests of a majority society often do not address native needs.15’ Nor do the treaties, which are binding on agencies, address many modern issues that arise with respect to environmental conflicts; furthermore, not all tribes have treaties. The trust doctrine transcends specific treaty promises and embodies a clear duty to protect the native land base and the ability of tribes to continue their ways of life. In short, the doctrine provides a judicial avenue for developing standards more protective of native separatism.’52 The trust responsibility remains a focal point for tribes in their efforts to gain federal protection of native lands and resources. For example, over the past few years the Columbia River Basin tribes that have treaty rights to harvest salmon have urged federal agencies to fulfill their trust responsibility by restoring salmon populations, controlling water pollution, and conserving water in streams.’53 The trust responsibility is gaining renewed attention in the Clinton administration as well. In an historic meeting on April 29, 1994, with over 300 tribal leaders, the President made a pledge to fulfill his trust responsibility.’54 Several agencies within the executive branch are now developing trust policies to guide their actions affecting tribes.’55 But despite the growing need for enforcing the federal responsibility owed to native nations, and a corresponding tribal reliance upon the trust doctrine to support demands for protection of natural resources, the trust doctrine remains encumbered by its past association with plenary power in the Kagama case.’ Because it is often still characterized as emanating from a “guardian-ward” relationship, the trust responsibility is blemished by policies from past eras which supported federal dominion over tribes and assimilation of native people. Accordingly, it is sometimes rejected as a tool to protect native rights’57 Rejecting the trust doctrine as a corollary to plenary power may work a real disservice to tribes. The outright dismissal of the trust responsibility effectively drowns any continuing special federal obligation toward tribes. It forecloses a potentially effective judicial avenue for requiring agencies to protect native lands and resources. Stripped of trust responsibility claims, tribes are often left with only constitutional or statutory grounds to challenge agency action. Neither source contains standards which adequately protect uniquely native sovereignty concerns. Therefore, any effort to “decolonize” federal Indian law by dismantling the notion of plenary power should not correspondingly destroy the notion of continuing federal obligations which benefit the tribes. Indeed, tribal leaders who invoke the trust responsibility to argue for federal protection of their way of life often readily distinguish and disassociate the doctrine from plenary power.1 The trust responsibility should be recognized as a doctrine of federal restraint, not permissîon,’ and as an important source of protection for Indian rights. Generally, the trust doctrine holds more force when used to challenge federal agency action rather than congressional action. Even in the agency context, however, the doctrine has not been applied consistently to achieve its full theoretical potential. The following two sections briefly explore the trust doctrine in the congressional and agency contexts and evaluate its potential for use in future litigation.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Outsiders to contest debating have remarked simply that too many policy debate arguments end in all-out nuclear war; consequently, they categorize the activity as foolish. How many times have educators had contest debaters in a classroom discussion who strung out an extended mini-max argument to the jeers and guffaws of their classmates? They cannot all be wrong. Frighteningly enough, most of us agree. We should not ignore Charles Richet’s adage: “The stupid man is not the one who does not understand something — but the man who understands it well enough yet acts as if he didn’t” (Tabori 6). Regrettably, mini-max arguments are not the exclusive domain of contest debating. “Policies driven by the consideration of low risk probabilities will, on the whole, lead to low investment strategies to prevent a hazard from being realized or to mitigate the hazard’s consequences. By comparison, policies driven by the consideration of high consequences, despite low probabilities, will lead to high levels of public investment” (‘Nehnevajsa 521). Regardless of their persuasiveness, Bashor and others have discovered that mini-max claims are not useful in resolving complex issues. For example, in his assessment of low probability, potentially high-consequence events such as terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction, Bashor found simple estimates of potential losses added little to contingency planning. While adding little to policy analysis, extended arguments using mini-max reasoning remain powerful determinants of resource allocation. As such, they need to be debunked. Experts agree. For example, Slovic advocates a better understanding of all risk analysis since it drives much of our public policy. “Whoever controls the definition of risk controls the rational solution to the problem at hand. If risk is defined one way, then one option will rise to the top as the most cost-effective or the safest or the best. If it is defined another way, perhaps incorporating qualitative characteristics or other contextual factors, one will likely get a different ordering of action solutions. Defining risk is thus an exercise in power” (699). When probability assessments are eliminated from risk calculi, as is the case in mini-max risk arguments, it is a political act, and all political acts need to be scrutinized with a critical lens. This essay intends to examine some of the problems associated with extended arguments using mini-max reasoning. First, extended arguments will be examined in respect to logical problems associated with causality, corroboration, and equivocation. Second, mini-max reasoning will be examined in an attempt to debunk its persuasiveness. Finally, I will introduce three criteria for assessing the probative value of mini-max extended arguments. The strength of the relationship between the claims in extended arguments rests on the probability of the causation between and among the simple claims. The relationship between each claim in an extended argument is moderated by its probability. Probability is challenging to define. Many scientists and members of the risk assessment community “have not as yet come to grips with the foundational issue about the meaning of probability and the various interpretations that can be attached to the term probability. This is extremely important, for it is how one views probability that determines one attitude toward a statistical procedure” (Singpurwalla 182). We employ the notion of probability when we do not know a thing with certainty. But our uncertainty is either purely subjective (we do not know what will take place. but someone else may know) or objective (no one knows, and no one can know). Subjective probability is a compass for an informational disability. . . . Probability is, so to speak, a cane for a blind man; he uses it to feel his way. If he could see, he would not need the cane, and if I knew which horse was the fastest, I would not need probability theory. (Lem 142) In simple arguments, “risks are simply the product of probability and consequence’ (Thompson &amp; Parkinson 552). Thompson and Parkinson found a difficulty in risk assessment associated with mini-max arguments that they identified as the problem of risk tails. “Risk tails are the segments of the standard risk curve which approach the probability and consequence axes. The tails represent high-consequence low-probability risk and low. consequence high-probability risk” (552). This region, especially the high-consequence low-probability tail, is the site of mini-max computation. The complex probabilities of extended arguments are problematic. For example, too much reliance is given an extended link story when each step in the link exhibits a probability that is geometrically self-effacing. According to the traditional multiplication theorem, if a story is drawn from AcaBaCaD, the probabilities of AcaB and BaC and COED are multiplied. “The probability that two subsequent events will both happen is a ratio compounded of the probability of the 1st. and the probability of the 2nd in the supposition the 1st happens” (Bayes 299). If the probability of AaB is .10 and the probability of BaC is also .10, then the probability of AaC is .01. If the probability of CaD is also .10. then the probability of AaD is .001. If all we had to do to determine probability involved multiplying fractions, calculating probabilities would be easy. Unfortunately, such is not the case. An interesting caveat involves conditional probability. “It’s expository holds that we should not concern ourselves with absolute probabilities, which have no relevance to things as they are, but with conditional probabilities the chances that some event will occur when some set of previous conditions exists” (Krause 67). Conditional probabilities are most often associated with calculations involving variables that may be even remotely associated, such as phenomena in international relations. If one considers the probability of many separate events occurring, one must also consider whether or not they are correlated — that is, whether or not they are truly independent. If they are correlated, simply multiplying individual probabilities will not give you the correct estimate, and the final probability may actually be much larger than one will predict if one makes this error. For example, the probability that I will utter an obscenity at any given instance may be small (although it is certainly not zero). The probability that I will hit my funny bone at any given instant is also small. However, the probability that I will hit my funny bone and then utter an obscenity is not equal to the product of the probabilities, since the probability of swearing at a given instant s correlated to the probability of hurting myself at a given instant. (Krause 67) Hence, “if we calculate a priori the probability of the occurred event and the probability of an event composed of that one and a second one which is expected, the second probability divided by the first will be the probability of the event expected, drawn from the observed event” (Laplace IS). Another complication of extended causal chains is the corroboration principle. “There are cases in which each testimony seems unreliable (i.e., has less than 0.5 probability) on its own, even though the combination of the two testimonies is rather persuasive. . . [I]f both testimonies are genuinely independent and fully agree with one another, we are surely going to be inclined to accept them” (Cohen 72). When we are uncertain about a probability, we might try to engage multiple sources making the same or same-like claim. We feel it is less likely that two or more sources are incorrect than that a single source will be. While corroboration seems valid, it is a persuasive pipe-dream. If we use this calculus to draw our claims, errors are likely to be shared and replicated. Witness some of the problems associated with realism in international relations literature. As such, the multiplication theorem has been subverted by conditional probabilities and undercut by corroboration, but contest debaters and policy makers have not risen to the challenge. While contest debating has borrowed heavily from policymaking and systems analysis, it has not resolved the causality issues any better than have policy studies experts. The grand calculus used in systems analysis is as simplistic as it is in contest debating. Lichtman and Rohrer described what happens to systems analysis in a contest debate two decades ago. “To determine the level of net benefits achieved by a policy system when multiple outcomes are considered, policy makers simply sum, for all anticipated results, the product of their probabilities and values” (238).</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are occasions when decisions are influenced by worries about possible dangers although we have only a vague idea about what these dangers might look like. Recent debates on biotechnology are an example of this. Specific, identified risks have had only a limited role in these debates. Instead, the focus has been on vague or unknown dangers such as the creation of new life-forms with unforeseeable properties. It is easy to find examples in which many of us would be swayed by considerations of unknown dangers. Suppose, for instance, that someone proposes the introduction of a genetically altered species of earthworm that will aerate the soil more efficiently. If introduced in nature, it will ultimately replace the common earthworm. For the sake of argument we may assume that all concrete worries have been neutralized. The new species can be shown not to induce more soil erosion, not to be more susceptible to diseases, etc. Still, it would not be irrational to say: &quot;Yes, but there may be other negative effects that we have not been able to think of. Therefore, the new species should not be introduced.&quot; Similarly, if someone proposed to eject a chemical substance into the stratosphere for some good purpose or other, it would not be irrational to oppose this proposal solely on the ground that it may have unforeseeable consequences, and this even if all specified worries can be neutralized. However, it would not be feasible to take such possibilities into account in all decisions that we make. In a sense, any decision may have catastrophic unforeseen consequences. If far-reaching indirect effects are taken into account, then – given the unpredictable nature of actual causation – almost any decision may lead to a disaster. In order to be able to decide and act, we therefore have to disregard many of the more remote possibilities. Cases can also easily be found in which it was an advantage that far-fetched dangers were not taken seriously. One case in point is the false alarm on so-called polywater, an alleged polymeric form of water. In 1969, the prestigious scientific journal Nature printed a letter that warned against producing polywater. The substance might &quot;grow at the expense of normal water under any conditions found in the environment,&quot; thus replacing all natural water on earth and destroying all life on this planet. (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v9n2/hansson.html#donahoe" rel="nofollow">Donahoe 1969</a> ) Soon afterwards, it was shown that polywater is a non-existent entity. If the warning had been heeded, then no attempts would had been made to replicate the polywater experiments, and we might still not have known that polywater does not exist. In cases like this, appeals to the possibility of unknown dangers may stop investigations and thus prevent scientific and technological progress. We therefore need criteria to determine when the possibility of unknown dangers should be taken seriously and when it can be neglected. This problem cannot be solved with probability calculus or other exact mathematical methods. The best that we can hope for is a set of informal criteria that can be used to support intuitive judgement. The following list of four criteria has been proposed for this purpose. (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v9n2/hansson.html#hansson" rel="nofollow">Hansson 1996</a>) 1. Asymmetry of uncertainty: Possibly, a decision to build a second bridge between Sweden and Denmark will lead through some unforeseeable causal chain to a nuclear war. Possibly, it is the other way around so that a decision not to build such a bridge will lead to a nuclear war. We have no reason why one or the other of these two causal chains should be more probable, or otherwise more worthy of our attention, than the other. On the other hand, the introduction of a new species of earthworm is connected with much more uncertainty than the option not to introduce the new species. Such asymmetry is a necessary but insufficient condition for taking the issue of unknown dangers into serious consideration. 2. Novelty: Unknown dangers come mainly from new and untested phenomena. The emission of a new substance into the stratosphere constitutes a qualitative novelty, whereas the construction of a new bridge does not. An interesting example of the novelty factor can be found in particle physics. Before new and more powerful particle accelerators have been built, physicists have sometimes feared that the new levels of energy might generate a new phase of matter that accretes every atom of the earth. The decision to regard these and similar fears as groundless has been based on observations showing that the earth is already under constant bombardment from outer space of particles with the same or higher energies. (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v9n2/hansson.html#ruthen" rel="nofollow">Ruthen 1993</a>) 3. Spatial and temporal limitations: If the effects of a proposed measure are known to be limited in space or time, then these limitations reduce the urgency of the possible unknown effects associated with the measure. The absence of such limitations contributes to the severity of many ecological problems, such as global emissions and the spread of chemically stable pesticides. 4. Interference with complex systems in balance: Complex systems such as ecosystems and the atmospheric system are known to have reached some type of balance, which may be impossible to restore after a major disturbance. Due to this irreversibility, uncontrolled interference with such systems is connected with a high degree of uncertainty. (Arguably, the same can be said of uncontrolled interference with economic systems; this is an argument for piecemeal rather than drastic economic reforms.) It might be argued that we do not know that these systems can resist even minor perturbations. If causation is chaotic, then for all that we know, a minor modification of the liturgy of the Church of England may trigger a major ecological disaster in Africa. If we assume that all cause-effect relationships are chaotic, then the very idea of planning and taking precautions seems to lose its meaning. However, such a world-view would leave us entirely without guidance, even in situations when we consider ourselves well-informed. Fortunately, experience does not bear out this pessimistic worldview. Accumulated experience and theoretical reflection strongly indicate that certain types of influences on ecological systems can be withstood, whereas others cannot. The same applies to technological, economic, social, and political systems, although our knowledge about their resilience towards various disturbances has not been sufficiently systematized.</span><br />

<strong>The prior question is whether the plan affirms a worthy ethical principle. To void this obligation in the name of future consequences is literally an absurd notion — it fails to establish any coherent moral framework, makes your decision impossible, and destroys value to life</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To choose an act which in itself simply (or primarily) damages a basic good is thereby to engage oneself willy-nilly (but directly) in an act of opposition to an incommensurable value (an aspect of human personality) which one treats as if it were an object of measurable worth that could be outweighed by commensurable objects of greater (or cumulatively greater) worth. To do this will often accord with our feelings, our generosity, our sympathy, and with our commitments and projects in the forms in which we undertook them. But it can never be justified in reason. We must choose rationally (and this rational judgment can often promote a shift in our perspective and consequently a realignment of initial feelings and thus our commitments and projects). Reason requires that every basic value be at least respected in each and every action. If one could ever rightly choose a single act which itself damages and itself does not promote some basic good, then one could rightly choose whole programmes and institutions and enterprises that themselves damage and do not promote basic aspects of human well-being, for the sake of their 'net beneficial consequences’. Now we have already seen that consequences, even to the extent that they can be 'foreseen as certain', cannot be commensurably evaluated, which means that 'net beneficial consequences' is a literally absurd general object or criterion. It only remains to note that a man who thinks that his rational responsibility to be always doing and pursuing good is satisfied by a commitment to act always for best consequences is a man who treats every aspect of human personalitv (and indeed, there, treats himself) as a utensil. He holds himself ready to do anything (and thus makes himself a tool for all those willing to threaten sufficiently bad consequences if he does not cooperate with them). But the objection I am making to such is not that programmes of mass killing, mass deception, etc. would then be morally eligible (though they would) and indeed morally required (though they would), but that no sufficient reason can be found for treating any act as immune from the only direction which we have, viz. the direction afforded by the basic practical principles. These each direct that a form of good is to be pursued and done' and each of them bears not only on all our large-scale choices of projects (in which attainment of the objective will indeed be the good consequence of successful deployment of effective means), but also on each and every choice of an act which itself is a complete act (whether or not it is also a step in a plan or a phase in a project). The incommensurable value of an aspect of personal full-being (and its corresponding primary principle) can never be rightly subordinated to any project or commitment. But such an act of subordination inescapably occurs at least whenever a distinct choice-of-act has in itself no meaning save that of damaging that basic value (thus violating that primary principle). Such, in highly abstract terms, is the seventh requirement, the principle on which alone rests (as we shall later see) the strict inviolability of basic human rights: VIII.7. There is no human right that will not be overridden if feelings (whether generous and unselfish, or mean and self-centered) are allowed to govern choice, or if cost-benefit considerations are taken outside their appropriate technical sphere and allowed to govern one's direct engagement (whether at the level of commitment, project, or individual act) with basic goods. And the perhaps unfamiliar formulation which we have been considering should not obscure the fact that this 'seventh requirement' is well recognized, in other formulations: most loosely as `the end does not justify the means'; more precisely, though still ambiguously, as 'evil may not be done that good might follow therefrom'; and with a special Enlightenment flavour, as Kant's 'categorical imperiative;: Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only'.12</span><br />

<strong>Attention to isolated instances of warfare ignores the daily horrors of exclusion and discriminatory violence – a shift toward structural violence is necessary to address the root cause of war</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In &quot;Gender and `Postmodern' War,&quot; Robin Schott introduces some of the ways in which war is currently best seen not as an event but as a presence (Schott 1995). Schott argues that postmodern understandings of persons, states, and politics, as well as the high-tech nature of much contemporary warfare and the preponderance of civil and nationalist wars, render an event based conception of war inadequate, especially insofar as gender is taken into account. In this essay, I will expand upon her argument by showing that accounts of war that only focus on events are impoverished in a number of ways, and therefore feminist consideration of the political, ethical, and ontological dimensions of war and the possibilities for resistance demand a much more complicated approach. I take Schott's characterization of war as presence as a point of departure, though I am not committed to the idea that the constancy of militarism, the fact of its omnipresence in human experience, and the paucity of an event-based account of war are exclusive to contemporary postmodern or postcolonial circumstances.(1) Theory that does not investigate or even notice the omnipresence of militarism cannot represent or address the depth and specificity of the everyday effects of militarism on women, on people living in occupied territories, on members of military institutions, and on the environment. These effects are relevant to feminists in a number of ways because military practices and institutions help construct gendered and national identity, and because they justify the destruction of natural nonhuman entities and communities during peacetime. Lack of attention to these aspects of the business of making or preventing military violence in an extremely technologized world results in theory that cannot accommodate the connections among the constant presence of militarism, declared wars, and other closely related social phenomena, such as nationalistic glorifications of motherhood, media violence, and current ideological gravitations to military solutions for social problems. Ethical approaches that do not attend to the ways in which warfare and military practices are woven into the very fabric of life in twenty-first century technological states lead to crisis-based politics and analyses. For any feminism that aims to resist oppression and create alternative social and political options, crisis-based ethics and politics are problematic because they distract attention from the need for sustained resistance to the enmeshed, omnipresent systems of domination and oppression that so often function as givens in most people's lives. Neglecting the omnipresence of militarism allows the false belief that the absence of declared armed conflicts is peace, the polar opposite of war. It is particularly easy for those whose lives are shaped by the safety of privilege, and who do not regularly encounter the realities of militarism, to maintain this false belief. The belief that militarism is an ethical, political concern only regarding armed conflict, creates forms of resistance to militarism that are merely exercises in crisis control. Antiwar resistance is then mobilized when the &quot;real&quot; violence finally occurs, or when the stability of privilege is directly threatened, and at that point it is difficult not to respond in ways that make resisters drop all other political priorities. Crisis-driven attention to declarations of war might actually keep resisters complacent about and complicitous in the general presence of global militarism. Seeing war as necessarily embedded in constant military presence draws attention to the fact that horrific, state-sponsored violence is happening nearly all over, all of the time, and that it is perpetrated by military institutions and other militaristic agents of the state. Moving away from crisis-driven politics and ontologies concerning war and military violence also enables consideration of relationships among seemingly disparate phenomena, and therefore can shape more nuanced theoretical and practical forms of resistance. For example, investigating the ways in which war is part of a presence allows consideration of the relationships among the events of war and the following: how militarism is a foundational trope in the social and political imagination; how the pervasive presence and symbolism of soldiers/warriors/patriots shape meanings of gender; the ways in which threats of state-sponsored violence are a sometimes invisible/sometimes bold agent of racism, nationalism, and corporate interests; the fact that vast numbers of communities, cities, and nations are currently in the midst of excruciatingly violent circumstances. It also provides a lens for considering the relationships among the various kinds of violence that get labeled &quot;war.&quot; Given current American obsessions with nationalism, guns, and militias, and growing hunger for the death penalty, prisons, and a more powerful police state, one cannot underestimate the need for philosophical and political attention to connections among phenomena like the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; the &quot;war on crime,&quot; and other state-funded militaristic campaigns. I propose that the constancy of militarism and its effects on social reality be reintroduced as a crucial locus of contemporary feminist attentions, and that feminists emphasize how wars are eruptions and manifestations of omnipresent militarism that is a product and tool of multiply oppressive, corporate, technocratic states.(2) Feminists should be particularly interested in making this shift because it better allows consideration of the effects of war and militarism on women, subjugated peoples, and environments. While giving attention to the constancy of militarism in contemporary life we need not neglect the importance of addressing the specific qualities of direct, large-scale, declared military conflicts. But the dramatic nature of declared, large-scale conflicts should not obfuscate the ways in which military violence pervades most societies in increasingly technologically sophisticated ways and the significance of military institutions and everyday practices in shaping reality. Philosophical discussions that focus only on the ethics of declaring and fighting wars miss these connections, and also miss the ways in which even declared military conflicts are often experienced as omnipresent horrors. These approaches also leave unquestioned tendencies to suspend or distort moral judgement in the face of what appears to be the inevitability of war and militarism.</span><br />

<strong>The state needs ethics and ethics needs the state</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For instance, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">ethics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which is a manifestation of the saying, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">has been subordinated by politics, a manifestation of the said. Ethics must be resuscitated to check the political</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">the political should not be abandoned</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, because it is needed by the ethical. The politics of suspicion Levinas begins Totality and Inﬁnity by asking whether or not we are duped by morality. 27 Considering the unchanging conditions of man making war on man, the century of genocide in which we live, and the repeated atrocities, is morality not meaningless? According to Levinas, morality can only have meaning when it has its own justiﬁcation, when it is not absorbed by ontology and politics, when it exists outside of the violence of ontology and politics. In the terms of Totality and Inﬁnity, ethics will have meaning ‘only if the certitude of peace dominates the evidence of war’. 28 Levinas responds that we are not duped by morality. He ﬁnds the certitude of peace in the non-ontological saying, in proximity, and in the an-archical responsibility for the Other. The primordial relationship with the Other is originally peaceful. Ethics has its own justiﬁcation. On equal footing is the question: </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">are we duped by politics?</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Is it worthwhile to theorize about politics, or is the existent regime, the one that is the strongest, always the best regime? </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Can there be another foundation for politics or does politics carry its own justiﬁcation?</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In Levinasian terms, is it possible to construct a politics which maintains the ethical relationship with the Other, one which does not reduce the Other, but preserves alterity? To paraphrase Levinas, the crucial question is not ‘To be or not to be?’ but rather: How can the state be justiﬁed in the face of the Other? Despite the importance of the political question, Levinas very rarely discusses politics at length. This neglect is best understood in relation to his suspicion of traditional ethics. Levinas is acknowledged to be one of the foremost ethical thinkers of our century. Yet, as Robert Bernasconi pointed out in a recent essay, Levinas rarely confronts traditional ethical thought, including the ethics of Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, or Hegel. 29 Like many other 19th- and 20th-century philosophers (Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Foucault and Derrida come to mind), Levinas harbors a deep suspicion toward traditional ethical theories. Why would such a highly regarded philosopher of ethics choose largely to ignore the ethical tradition? Levinas disregards most of the tradition because his critique of ethics is radical, that is, he attacks the roots of the tradition. Levinas claims that the ethical tradition subordinates ethics to ontology; ethics is derived from an eminent being or the contemplation of an autonomous individual. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Levinas, on the other hand, provides ethics with a justiﬁcation beyond ontology. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Thus, he confronts the ontological foundations of traditional ethical theories, but rarely the theories themselves. Levinas, the great ethical thinker of our century, is more of a metaphysician than an ethicist. Levinas’ attitude toward traditional political thought parallels his attitude toward traditional ethical thought. Levinas rarely confronts the great thinkers of the Western political tradition. For example, he never discusses, at length, such prominent political thinkers as Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, or Rousseau. And when he discusses thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Spinoza and Hegel, he emphasizes their metaphysical theories instead of their extensive political thought. Just as he attacks the foundations of Western ethical thought, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Levinas attacks the underlying presupposition of Western political thought; namely, that political thought begins with the self.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Levinas’ critique of Western political thought is best applied to modern political thinkers such as Hobbes, Spinoza and Locke, who base their political thought on self-preservation. For instance, Hobbes claims that men’s actions are determined by desires and the highest desire is self-preservation, or, in Spinoza’s terminology, the conatus essendi, the effort to exist. According to Hobbes, to ensure self-preservation, men desire security and its corollary, power. To ensure power, men must have more power. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Since other men also ceaselessly desire power, each is an enemy to the others. In such a world there can be no science, no knowledge, no arts, ‘no Society; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and danger of violent death</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.’ 30 To ameliorate this war of all against all, a social contract is agreed upon, under which individuals lay down their rights to ensure peace. Politics is established to preserve self-interest. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Levinas argues that any politics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as Hobbes’, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">which begins with self-preservation, subordinates ethics to politics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Instead of the originary peace necessary for ethics, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is an originary war which is not destroyed by the social contract, but is only concealed.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As Pascal wrote: They have used concupiscence as best as they could for the general good; but it is nothing but pretense and a false image of charity; for at bottom it is simply a form of hatred. Men have contrived and extracted from concupiscence excellent rules of administration, morality and justice. But in reality this vile bedrock of man, this ﬁgmentum malum, is only covered, not removed. 31 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Levinas’ critique of the foundations of political thought changes the very nature of politics. A politics based on the battle between autonomous selves</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, like Hobbes’, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">is a negative politics whose primary purpose is to constrain individual desires. Levinas,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on the other hand, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">insists that politics must have a positive role. Politics must serve ethics.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The occidental ethic always proceeds from the fact that the other is a limitation for me. Hobbes says you can come directly to philosophy from this mutual hatred. Thus we could attain a better society without love for the other, in which the other is taken into account. That would be a politics that could lead to ethics. I believe, on the contrary, that </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">politics must be controlled by ethics: the other concerns me.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 32 Although </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Levinas is suspicious of the Western political tradition</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">his thought is not apolitical as some have charged</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">His philosophy begins and ends with politics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, Peperzak argues that ‘the point of orientation and the background of all other questions’ in Totality and Inﬁnity is ‘</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">the question of how the violence that seems inherent to all politics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (and thus also to history) </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">can be overcome by true peace’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 33 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">Politics is</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">a necessary step that Levinas’ ethical thought must take</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Just as the an-archical saying requires the ontological said, an-archical ethics requires politics. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">The mutually interdependent relationship between the saying and the said serves as the paradigm for the relationship between ethics and politics. Ethics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which is a manifestation of the saying, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">has been traditionally subordinated by politics, a manifestation of the said. A resuscitation of the ethical is needed to check the political. However, the political should not be abandoned. Ethics requires the political to be universalized into laws and institutions.</span><br />

<strong>Nuclear war won’t cause extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Nyquist 99</strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (J.R., Defense Analyst, Worldnetdaily.com, May 20, 1999)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As I write about Russia's nuclear war preparations, I get some interesting mail in response. Some correspondents imagine I am totally ignorant. They point out that nuclear war would cause &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; and everyone would die. Since nobody wants to die, nobody would ever start a nuclear war (and nobody would ever seriously prepare for one). Other correspondents suggest I am ignorant of the world-destroying effects of nuclear radiation. I patiently reply to these correspondents that nuclear war would not be the end of the world. I then point to studies showing that &quot;nuclear winter&quot; has no scientific basis, that fallout from a nuclear war would not kill all life on earth. Surprisingly, few of my correspondents are convinced. They prefer apocalyptic myths created by pop scientists, movie producers and journalists. If Dr. Carl Sagan once said &quot;nuclear winter&quot; would follow a nuclear war, then it must be true. If radiation wipes out mankind in a movie, then that's what we can expect in real life. But Carl Sagan was wrong about nuclear winter. And the movie &quot;On the Beach&quot; misled American filmgoers about the effects of fallout. It is time, once and for all, to lay these myths to rest. Nuclear war would not bring about the end of the world, though it would be horribly destructive. The truth is, many prominent physicists have condemned the nuclear winter hypothesis. Nobel laureate Freeman Dyson once said of nuclear winter research, &quot;It's an absolutely atrocious piece of science, but I quite despair of setting the public record straight.&quot; Professor Michael McElroy, a Harvard physics professor, also criticized the nuclear winter hypothesis. McElroy said that nuclear winter researchers &quot;stacked the deck&quot; in their study, which was titled &quot;Nuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear Explosions&quot; (Science, December 1983). Nuclear winter is the theory that the mass use of nuclear weapons would create enough smoke and dust to blot out the sun, causing a catastrophic drop in global temperatures. According to Carl Sagan, in this situation the earth would freeze. No crops could be grown. Humanity would die of cold and starvation. In truth, natural disasters have frequently produced smoke and dust far greater than those expected from a nuclear war. In 1883 Krakatoa exploded with a blast equivalent to 10,000 one-megaton bombs, a detonation greater than the combined nuclear arsenals of planet earth. The Krakatoa explosion had negligible weather effects. Even more disastrous, going back many thousands of years, a meteor struck Quebec with the force of 17.5 million one-megaton bombs, creating a crater 63 kilometers in diameter. But the world did not freeze. Life on earth was not extinguished. Consider the views of Professor George Rathjens of MIT, a known antinuclear activist, who said, &quot;Nuclear winter is the worst example of misrepresentation of science to the public in my memory.&quot; Also consider Professor Russell Seitz, at Harvard University's Center for International Affairs, who says that the nuclear winter hypothesis has been discredited. Two researchers, Starley Thompson and Stephen Schneider, debunked the nuclear winter hypothesis in the summer 1986 issue of Foreign Affairs. Thompson and Schneider stated: &quot;the global apocalyptic conclusions of the initial nuclear winter hypothesis can now be relegated to a vanishingly low level of probability.&quot; OK, so nuclear winter isn't going to happen. What about nuclear fallout? Wouldn't the radiation from a nuclear war contaminate the whole earth, killing everyone? The short answer is: absolutely not. Nuclear fallout is a problem, but we should not exaggerate its effects. As it happens, there are two types of fallout produced by nuclear detonations. These are: 1) delayed fallout; and 2) short-term fallout. According to researcher Peter V. Pry, &quot;Delayed fallout will not, contrary to popular belief, gradually kill billions of people everywhere in the world.&quot; Of course, delayed fallout would increase the number of people dying of lymphatic cancer, leukemia, and cancer of the thyroid. &quot;However,&quot; says Pry, &quot;these deaths would probably be far fewer than deaths now resulting from ... smoking, or from automobile accidents.&quot; The real hazard in a nuclear war is the short-term fallout. This is a type of fallout created when a nuclear weapon is detonated at ground level. This type of fallout could kill millions of people, depending on the targeting strategy of the attacking country. But short-term fallout rapidly subsides to safe levels in 13 to 18 days. It is not permanent. People who live outside of the affected areas will be fine. Those in affected areas can survive if they have access to underground shelters. In some areas, staying indoors may even suffice. Contrary to popular misconception, there were no documented deaths from short-term or delayed fallout at either Hiroshima or Nagasaki. These blasts were low airbursts, which produced minimal fallout effects. Today's thermonuclear weapons are even &quot;cleaner.&quot; If used in airburst mode, these weapons would produce few (if any) fallout casualties. On their side, Russian military experts believe that the next world war will be a nuclear missile war. They know that nuclear weapons cannot cause the end of the world. According to the Russian military writer, A. S. Milovidov, &quot;There is profound error and harm in the disoriented claims of bourgeois ideologues that there will be no victor in a thermonuclear world war.&quot; Milovidov explains that Western objections to the mass use of nuclear weapons are based on &quot;a subjective judgment. It expresses mere protest against nuclear war.&quot; Another Russian theorist, Captain First Rank V. Kulakov, believes that a mass nuclear strike may not be enough to defeat &quot;a strong enemy, with extensive territory enabling him to use space and time for the organizations of active and passive defense. ...&quot; Russian military theory regards nuclear war as highly destructive, but nonetheless winnable. Russian generals do not exaggerate the effects of mass destruction weapons. Although nuclear war would be unprecedented in its death-dealing potential, Russian strategists believe that a well-prepared system of tunnels and underground bunkers could save many millions of lives. That is why Russia has built a comprehensive shelter system for its urban populace. On the American side as well, there have been studies which suggest that nuclear war is survivable.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The federal government has a long-established special relationship with Native Americans characterized by their status as governmentally independent entities, dependent on the United States for support and protection. In exchange for land and in compensation for forced removal from their original homelands, the government promised through laws, treaties, and pledges to support and protect Native Americans. However, funding for programs associated with those promises has fallen short, and Native people continue to suffer the consequences of a discriminatory history. Federal efforts to raise Native American living conditions to the standards of others have long been in motion, but Native Americans still suffer higher rates of poverty, poor educational achievement, substandard housing, and higher rates of disease and illness. Native Americans continue to rank at or near the bottom of nearly every social, health, and economic indicator. Small in numbers and relatively poor, Native Americans often have had a difficult time ensuring fair and equal treatment on their own. Unfortunately, relying on the goodwill of the nation to honor its obligation to Native Americans clearly has not resulted in desired outcomes. Its small size and geographic apartness from the rest of American society induces some to designate the Native American population the “invisible minority.” To many, the government’s promises to Native Americans go largely unfulfilled. Thus, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, through this report, gives voice to a quiet crisis. Over the last 10 years, federal funding for Native American programs has increased significantly. However, this has not been nearly enough to compensate for a decline in spending power, which had been evident for decades before that, nor to overcome a long and sad history of neglect and discrimination. Thus, there persists a large deficit in funding Native American programs that needs to be paid to eliminate the backlog of unmet Native American needs, an essential predicate to raising their standards of living to that of other Americans. Native Americans living on tribal lands do not have access to the same services and programs available to other Americans, even though the government has a binding trust obligation to provide them.</span><br />

<strong>Improving transportation infrastructure is critical to meaningful improvements in quality of life on native lands</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Surface transportation in Indian Country involves thousands of miles of roads, bridges, and highways, and connects and serves both tribal and non-tribal communities. Millions of Americans and eight billion vehicles travel reservation roads annually. Despite being the principal transportation system for all residents of and visitors to tribal communities, reservation roads are still the most underdeveloped road network in the nation. Currently, there are over 140,000 miles of Indian reservation roads with multiple owners, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs, American Indian tribes, states, and counties. Construction of transportation systems that allow for safe travel and promote economic expansion will help strengthen tribal communities, while also making valuable contributions to much of the surrounding rural America. Maintenance and enhancement of transportation infrastructure is critical to economic development, job creation, and improving living conditions for individuals and families throughout Indian Country. Deficient transportation infrastructure is a barrier which impedes economic development in Native communities. Tribal governments are working to improve public safety, education, health care, and housing, and generate jobs through economic development. These worthy objectives are more difficult to achieve when transportation infrastructure in Indian Country continues to lag behind the rest of the nation. Tribal nations require sustained and adequate federal transportation appropriations to address the large backlog of deferred road and bridge construction and road maintenance needs. Investing in tribal transportation will create jobs and make Native economies stronger. Key Recommendations DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill Indian Reservation Roads (IRR) Programs • Provide $500 million for the Indian Reservation Roads Programs. • Provide $20 million for the Indian Reservation Roads Bridge Program. The officials at the Departments of the Interior and Transportation have recognized that transportation systems within Indian Country are suffering from a nearly $40 billion construction backlog. An equally daunting backlog exists for deferred maintenance for tribal transportation facilities. Rising construction inflation rates continue to diminish the purchasing power of the limited federal funds currently provided to the IRR Program and other tribal transportation programs. Even solid tribal roads and bridges fall into disrepair and require costly reconstruction years before the end of their design life due to a lack of more cost-effective maintenance funding. Under any assessment, tribal transportation programs remain severely underfunded and the construction and maintenance funding backlog will only get worse without significant funding increases during the next highway reauthorization period.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For years, a lack of transportation options has held Native Americans captive. Without access to services and employment, this subset of the population has a history of high unemployment, poor health, and a lack of education. Public transit is viewed as a way to address this mobility challenge; however, many barriers to the provision of tribal transit exist. This paper examines the current state of transit on reservations through historical and environmental contexts, discusses the necessity of transit for Native Americans, examines case studies, and describes funding and legislative frameworks with the goal of presenting ideas on how Native Americans might overcome the barriers to transit provision. Native Americans have long faced a limited number of mobility options, and these limited options have adversely affected their quality of life through a lack of access to employment centers, health care, education, and other necessary services. The federal government has recently become involved in providing funding for mass transit on reservations, with much of the responsibility for the transportation system focused on the tribes. American Indians face many difficulties while attempting to provide transit for their communities. This paper, in part, examines the current state of tribal transportation and the nature of some of those difficulties. The survival of Native Americans has been linked to mobility for centuries. From crisscrossing the Great Plains in search of buffalo to traversing the Great Lakes country in search of fur, the need for transportation has been essential for the sustainability of these indigenous peoples. Before the arrival of the colonialist Europeans, Native American tribes were able to traverse the land in search of safety and sustenance. The continued immigration of Europeans put increasing pressure on Native Americans to retain their heritage and way of life. The creation of the reservations has isolated Native Americans from vital services. Today, the need for mobility is no less important to the survival and quality of life of American Indians; however, the environment in which they exist has greatly changed. No longer are tribes able to ride through the countryside or migrate along riverbeds. As automobiles became the mode of choice, land use development followed, leading to sprawling cities and towns, creating even more reliance on the automobile. Unable to access an automobile because of either inadequate funds or a lack of history with this mode, many Native Americans must rely on transit services for their basic mobility needs. Paratransit or scheduled vans, buses, and personal vehicles are the types of transit services offered through the transportation system to move the public. Although the demand for a transit service might be present, the supply is not. This paper examines tribal transit by discussing the historical context, the need for transit, current practice, barriers to providing transit, legislation and funding, and suggestions for increased transit planning implementation. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE To understand the current transportation situation that Native Americans ﬁnd themselves in today, one must explore the evolution of policy and legislation that continues to color their environment. As post– colonial America grew and expanded, the conﬂict between the indigenous peoples and the former Europeans grew ever more intense. President Andrew Jackson spearheaded the Indian Removal Act of 1830 as a way to separate American Indians from the white population and eventually assimilate them into the new white American culture (1). This act permitted the forcible removal of Native Americans from their land and sent them westward; more than 70,000 people were removed during the ﬁrst 10 years (1). The movement west brought famine, disease, and humiliation to the Cherokee, Choctaw, and many other tribes that later found themselves prisoners on isolated reservations. Even today, reservations are usually far away from central city employment, education, and other services, contributing to the high rates of unemployment and the poor health displayed by this population. DEMOGRAPHICS The 2000 U.S. Census reported 2,475,956 people of American Indian and Alaska Native racial background alone, not in combination with another race (2). Individuals within this population are counted as either a member of a federally recognized tribe or a member of a tribe with no federal recognition. The focus of this paper is on federally recognized tribes. Documentation about tribal transit is difficult to ﬁnd, and most of it is exclusively about federally recognized tribes. Many federal programs offer assistance in the form of funds, technical assistance and support, and consultation for tribes that choose to implement transportation plans. This paper focuses on the deficiency of access to public transportation for those Native Americans living on rural reservation lands. The national poverty level in 1999 was 12.4% for the general population, but it was 24.5% for Native Americans (3, 4). This difference results from the high rates of unemployment present on Indian reservations. The unemployment rate for all reservations is 13.6%, which is signiﬁcantly higher than recent national unemployment ﬁgures. Yet, on some reservations, like the Rosebud and Pine Ridge Lakota Indian Reservations in South Dakota, unemployment ﬁgures are cited at 80% (5). It is difficult for individuals to effect positive changes in their economic status without employment. Access to public transportation could be a source of empowerment through access to jobs. Education levels also indicate the poor socioeconomic status of Native Americans. Of all Native Americans ages 18 to 24 years, 63.2% have graduated from high school, whereas the national average high school graduation rate is 76.5% (1). For Native Americans 25 years and older, “9.4 percent have completed four or more years of college, compared with 20.3 percent nationally” (1). A college education is not necessary for employment; however, it often leads to higher-paying employment. Many young Native Americans who leave reservations to attend college do not return. The tribes lose the education, leadership skills, and other benefits that their children have acquired. Non-Native American people may ﬁll positions left in tribal management, which does little to elevate the overall socioeconomic status of reservation residents. Low levels of education limit Native Americans to low-income jobs. Recent trends have leaned toward the service sector because of the introduction of casinos and accompanying businesses like hotels and restaurants. These trends further exacerbate the relegation of Native Americans to low incomes. Service jobs are an essential link to a higher standard of living, yet some remain a link to low-income status. In America, an education remains one of the most viable means to employment at positions that pay better than minimum wage. CURRENT STATE OF RESERVATION TRANSIT Currently, only 18 of the 562 federally recognized tribes have public transportation systems that receive any form of public monies from FTA’s Section 18 program (6). The Section 18 program provides funding for both capital and operating assistance. Section 18 funding requires a 20% local match for capital funds and a 50% local match for operating funds (7). It is likely that this requirement of a local matching contribution is a signiﬁcant reason that tribes seeking to establish, continue, or expand tribal transit programs have limited access to self-funding sources. Existing transit systems are often merely extensions of human service provisions, like Head Start or a health services program. In recent years, tribes have been able to increase their public transit offerings through the Tribal Transit Technical Assistance Program, which is funded through the Rural Business Cooperative Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Reservations are forced to provide minimal services with vehicles that are often shared. Providing transit in this fashion truly is better than nothing, but it does little for conveying a sense of permanence and reliability in the local transit program. In 1995, the Community Transportation Association of America published the document Transportation in Indian Country: Getting Started as a means of assisting tribes operating public transportation systems (7). That document suggests that the first step for tribes is to take a vehicle inventory. Tribes are encouraged to consider a “wide range of possibilities” for shared vehicles for use by tribal transportation providers. They are advised to “look at programs such as: Head Start, senior centers, job training programs, rehabilitation, education, and health care facilities. Talk with the people who administer these programs and ﬁnd out how participants reach their services” (7). These suggestions encourage Native Americans to assemble a menagerie of vehicles rather than establish a recognizable ﬂeet of transit vehicles. There are rural areas of America that serve the members of their community in much the same fashion, yet many rural communities have uniformed drivers who operate uniquely identiﬁable vehicles. WHY TRANSIT IS NEEDED Stunning Statistics • Native Americans have a lower life expectancy and are “more than twice as likely as the general population to face hunger” (8). • The Rosebud and Pine Ridge Lakota Indian Reservations are in two of the poorest counties in the United States, with 80% unemployment (5). • The federal government spends 60% less per capita on health care for Native Americans than for the average American and 50% less for Native Americans than for Medicaid recipients or prisoners (8). • The fatality rate on reservation roads is four times the annual national average, as of 1999 (9). According to Lorenzo Black Lance, a Brule Sioux who runs the Native American Heritage Association (NAHA) in Rapid City, South Dakota, “Transportation is one of the most critical needs for our people. It’s right up there with food, clothing, and heat. Transportation unlocks opportunity” (5). Improved mobility allows access to employment, medical treatment, and education. Meeting these essential needs increases the population’s economic vitality. With a better economy, there will be an increase in job opportunities, creating an ability to pay for education, medical needs, groceries, bills, and yes, transportation.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">American Indians have suffered from systematic genocide within Western society, in the forms of government-sanctioned physical onslaughts and confrontations, murder, land theft, forced removal and relocation, economic deprivation, incarceration, environmental racism, devastation of tribal sovereignty, and as a result of continued economic dependency. Acts of genocide committed against Indian people are founded on and legitimated by Western constructions of abject Otherness. Over five hundred years of social, political, and economic domination, Western society enforced its cultural codes of Otherness upon American Indians to gain our complicity in the power structure. Through formal Western education, conversion to Christianity, and assimilation into Euro-American culture and the capitalist economy, tribal people learned to speak the language and to interpret and reproduce the meanings of our oppressors; our own meanings, languages, and cultures were simultaneously devastated. American Indian participation in the construction and reproduction of Western language and meaning ensured our complicity in patriarchal power and aided Euro-American exploitation of our lands, resources, and labor. Like colonized groups throughout the world, American Indian people learned and internalized the discursive practices of the West—the very codes that created, reflected, and reproduced our oppression. As American Indians participate in, create, and reproduce Western cultural forms, we internalize Western meanings of difference and abject Otherness, viewing ourselves within and through the constructs that defined us as racially and culturally subhuman, deficient, and vile. As Western constructions of abject difference are both forced upon and accepted by American Indians, we define ourselves through these constructions and subsequently participate in the reproduction of these codes. For, as we assume the dominant subject position, we often take upon ourselves definitions of the objectified, abject Other as (portions of) our own identities and act them out in flat, one-dimensional caricatures that mirror the dominant culture’s representations. Moreover, as we buy into these codes, we not only apply them to our individual selves but also to those within our own marginalized group(s)—our loved ones and community members. Virtually nonexistent in traditional tribal communities prior to European invasion, contemporary American Indian communities struggle with devastating social ills including alcoholism, family violence, incest, sexual assault, fetal-alcohol syndrome, homicide, and suicide at startling rates similar to and sometimes exceeding those of white society. In their groundbreaking works, authors Maria YellowHorse BraveHeart and Lemyra DeBruyn (1995; 1996a; 1996b) understand the widespread social ills plaguing American Indians as manifestations of internalized oppression. The authors assert that experiences of racism and internalized oppression contribute to current social ills among Indians as a result of Western imperialism, assimilation, and Indian identifocation with the dominate culture’s codes (BraveHeart and DeBruyn 1996b). In describing causal factors leading to social problems, they state, “We contend that the high rates of depression . . . suicide, homicide, domestic violence and child abuse among American Indians can also be attributed to [the] processes of internalized oppression and identification with the aggressor” (1996b, 6). Through five hundred years of assimilation and acculturation, American Indians have internalized Western discursive practices and so we often view ourselves in ways mirroring the dominant subject position. However, Indian people also live in a sort of cultural double consciousness, as portions of our traditional subjective identities persist in the preserved beliefs of our ancestors practiced today. Through the telling of our experiences and stories in a continued oral tradition and through the preservation of traditional ways, many Indian people resist the dominant culture’s subject position, knowing that we, like our Grandmothers and Grandfathers, have not deserved a history of violence and genocide. Moreover, our oral traditions preserved many stories recounting the subjugation of our ancestors and these stories were passed along through generations creating an alternative interpretation, or knowledge, of the harms inflicted by white society. American Indians’ knowledge of our historical and continued oppression is experienced as a profound anguish. As Shirley Hill Witt explains, “Among Native Americans, the memory of genocide and tribal extinction is a raw unhealing wound” (1974, 35). This pain is described by Duran and Duran as a “soul wound” (1995, 27). The authors contend the genocidal efforts of Western imperialism have “inflict[ed] a wound to the soul of Native American people that is felt in agonizing proportions to this day” (Duran and Duran 1995, 27). Our experiences of colonization and disempowerment under patriarchal capitalism are silenced by white society. The perpetration of cultural genocide is whitewashed by the dominant culture in the master narrative of “discovery” and “manifest destiny.” Like the knowledges and stories of Others under patriarchal oppression, American Indian people’s pain is not recognized nor validated by the dominant culture. Instead, white society uses negative constructions of Indians as subhuman and lacking a full range of human qualities and emotions in order to justify our disempowerment. BraveHeart and DeBruyn elaborate upon this contention, asserting that American Indians have been socially constructed as incapable of experiencing emotional responses to pain and suffering. They contend, “[T]he historical view of American Indians as being stoic and savage contributed to a belief on the part of the dominant society that Indian people were incapable of having feelings. This belief system intimates that Indians had no capacity to mourn and, subsequently, no need or right to grieve” (BraveHeart and Debruyn 1996b, 11). Drawing upon the literature on Nazi concentration camp survivors, BraveHeart and DeBruyn assert that American Indians today experience a phenomenon the authors label “Historical Unresolved Grief Syndrome” resulting from the “historical trauma” 1 experienced under cultural and economic imperialism. The authors contend that social problems such as alcohol abuse experienced by Indian people are symptomatic of the past and present traumas we experience, and also symptomatic of the dominant culture’s denial of the harms in1 icted upon tribal people and from the invalidation of Indian pain (BraveHeart 1995; BraveHeart and DeBruyn 1996a; 1996b).</span><br />

<strong>The plan’s engagement with Otherness is the creation of a holy community that leaves us open to the transformative impact of difference; the alternative to this ethical stance is nuclear apocalypse</strong><br />

Fasching is a dude of religious studies of the University of South Florida in Tampa where he has been a member of the faculty since 1982. (“The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima: Apocalypse or Utopia?” 1993, pp 5-8) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The best way to describe the &quot;style&quot; of the theology of culture proposed in these books is to suggest that it is a &quot;decentered&quot; or &quot;alienated theology&quot;. Alienated theology is the opposite of apologetic theology. Apologetic theology typically seeks to defend the &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;superiority&quot; of one's own tradition against the &quot;false,&quot; &quot;inferior,&quot; and &quot;alien&quot; views of other traditions. Alienated theology, by contrast, is theology done &quot;as if&quot; one were a stranger to one's own narrative traditions, seeing and critiquing one's own traditions from the vantage point of the other's narrative traditions. It is my conviction that alienated theology is the appropriate mode for theology in an emerging world civilization—a civilization tottering in the balance between apocalypse and utopia. There are two ways to enter world history, according to the contemporary author John Dunne: you can be dragged in by way of world war or you can walk in by way of mutual understanding. By the first path, global civilization emerges as a totalitarian project of dominance that risks escalating into nuclear apocalypse. By the second path, we prevent the rise of the first, creating global civilization through an expansion of our understanding of what it means to be human. This occurs when we pass over to another's religion and culture and come back with new insight into our own. Ghandi is an example, passing over to the Sermon on the Mount and coming back to the Hindu Bhagavad Gita to gain new insight into it as a scripture of nonviolence. Ghandi never seriously considered becoming a Christian but his Hinduism was radically altered by his encounter with Christianity. One could say the same (reversing the directions) for Martin Luther King Jr., who was deeply influenced by Ghandi's understanding of nonviolent resistance in the Gita. When we pass over (whether through travel, friendship, or disciplined study and imagination) we become &quot;strangers in a strange land&quot; as well as stangers to ourselves, seeing ourselves through the eyes of another. Assuming the perspective of a stranger is an occasion for insight and the sharing of insight. Such cross-cultural interactions build bridges of understanding and action between persons and cultures that make cooperation possible and conquest unnecessary. &quot;Passing over&quot; short circuits apocalyptic confrontation and inaugurates utopian new beginnings—new beginnings for the &quot;postmodern&quot; world of the coming third millennium. Ghandi and King are symbols of a possible style for postmodern alienated theology. To be an alien is to be a stranger. To be alienated is to be a stranger to oneself. We live in a world of ideological conflict in which far too many individuals (whether theists or a-theists) practice a “centered” theology” in which they are too sure of who they are and what they must do. Such a world has far too many answers and not nearly enough questions and self-questioning. A world divided by its answers is headed for an inevitable apocalyptic destiny. However, when we are willing to become strangers to ourselves (or when we unwillingly become so), new possibilities open up where before everything was closed and hopeless. At the heart of my position is the conviction that the kairos of our time calls forth the badly neglected ethic of “welcoming the outcast” that underlies the Buddhist tradition. This care for the stranger and the outcast, I shall argue, provides the critical norm for identifying authentic transcendence as self-transcendence. Centered theologies, whether sacred or secular, theist or a-theist, are ethnocentric theologies that can tolerate the alien or other, if at all, only as a potential candidate for conversion to sameness. Centered theologies are exercises in narcissism that inevitably lead down apocalyptic paths like those that led to Auschwitz and Hiroshima. Why? Because such theologies, whether sacred or “secular,” cannot permit there to be others in the world whose way of being might, by sheer contrast, cause self-doubt and self-questioning. When as a student I read Paul Tillich, I found it hard to believe him when he said that the questions were more important than the answers. I was so taken with his answers that I was sure he was just trying to be modest. What really mattered were the answers. Since then, I have come to realize that answers always seem more important and more certain to those who have come by them without wrestling with the questions. I know now that Tillich was quite serious and quite right—the questions are indeed more important. I have come to find afullness in the doubts and questions of my life, which I once thought could be found only in the answers. After Auschwitz and Hiroshima, I distrust all final answers—all final solutions. Mercifully, doubts and questions have come to be so fulfilling that I find myself suspicious of answers, not because they are necessarily false or irrelevant, but because even when relevant and true they are, and can be, only partial. It is doubt and questioning that always lures me on to broader horizons and deeper insights through an openness to the infinite that leaves me contentedly discontent. Alienated theology understands doubt and the questions that arise from it as our most fundamental experience of the infinite. For, our unending questions keep us open to the infinite, continually inviting us to transcend our present horizon of understanding. In a like manner, the presence of the stranger continuously calls us into question and invites us to transcend the present horizon of the egocentric and ethnocentric answers that structure our personal and cultural identities. An alienated theology understands that only a faith which requires one to welcome the alien or stranger is truly a utopian faith capable of transforming us into “new beings” who are capable of creating a new world of pluralistic human interdependence. To put it in terms closest to home for myself, as a Christian who seeks to come to grips with Aushwitz in the light the history of Christan anti-Judaism, I cannot be a Christian except as I am prepared to welcome Jews (and analogously Buddhists or secular humanists, etc.) into my life. The very attempt to convert them would be to destroy the authenticity of my own faith by robbing me of the chance to welcome the stranger (the one who is different from me and a permanent witness of the Wholly Other in my life) who is given to me as an invitation to self-transcendence. For the literal meaning of transcendence is &quot;to go beyond&quot;—to go beyond ourselves (individually and communally) as we are to become something more and something new. To be human is to have a utopian capacity to create new worlds. When we deny ourselves that possibility, we set in motion the seeds of our apocalyptic self-destruction. The tragedy of human existence revealed by Auschwitz and Hiroshima is that we have continued to misread our situation. Given the opportunity for selftranscendence, the opportunity to be carried beyond ourselves into a new global human community, we have instead insisted on a technological solution&quot; a MAD (mutual assured destruction) solution. This at best, leads to a global stalemate between cultures and at worst an attempt at global conquest. In either case we place ourselves under the dark and threatening cloud of a nuclear apocalypse that such a path risks.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">These FY 2013 budget recommendations represent necessary elements for a strong economic foundation in Indian Country. For instance, education is fundamental to long-term economic opportunities. Investments in tribal infrastructure must be made to address the inadequate roads, housing, and broadband that are all essential to commerce. Bolstering public safety is also a prerequisite for long-term economic development. Finally, support for energy and industry must be ramped up; although tribal lands contain a vast amount of the nation’s conventional and renewable energy resources, tribal governments face an array of challenges in developing those energy resources. All of these investments hold immense promise to contribute to regional economies, which serves to strengthen the American economy and build a better future for all Americans. The United States is facing serious fiscal challenges caused largely by the imbalance between revenues and rising costs in the health care system. Over the next decade, federal budget deficits are projected to grow primarily due to the economic downturn, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and war spending. Decision-makers in Congress and the Administration are focused on the goal of reducing deficits sufficiently to stabilize the debt relative to the size of the economy. Last year, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which includes binding limits on annual appropriations that reduce projected funding for discretionary programs by about $1 trillion through 2021. Under these caps, discretionary spending will shrink from about 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011 to 6.2 percent in 2021, well below the 8.7 percent average over the past 40 years. Indian Country recognizes the state of the economy, the pressures on government at all levels, and the related challenges for job seekers. Tribes have been doing more with less for generations, and we propose the following general recommendations to help our communities, our neighbors, and the United States as a whole. As Congress and the Administration consider ways to address the deficit, tribal leaders urge them to sustain funding for human programs as a central part of the trust responsibility. The foregoing FY 2013 tribal budget program requests have been compiled in collaboration with tribal leaders, Native organizations, and tribal budget consultation bodies. Tribes respectfully request that these recommendations be included in the appropriations process.</span><br />

<strong>Federal government affirmation of the Trust Doctrine is necessary to spill over and protect native rights at all levels of government</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">B. The Modern Role of the Trust Doctrine The duty of protection so central to the sovereign trust paradigm two centuries ago is arguably just as important today. In the earlier periods, federal protection was needed to secure retained native lands against intruding white settlers; today, federal protection is increasingly needed to shield Indian Country from environmental threats both to the tribal land base and to shared resources such as water and wildlife. Abating pollution which threatens reservation lands, managing timber resources for perpetual yield, or sustaining wildlife at levels adequate to support continued treaty harvest, are objectives inherent in the federal government’s duty of protection. Notably, modern environmental threats to native separatism are occurring within a radically altered legal regime from that which prevailed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and this new regime invites redirected attention to the trust doctrine as a legal tool to protect native rights. Federal-Indian relations are increasingly becoming the province of executive branch agencies. The burgeoning administrative state presents a formidable legal infrastructure within which, as a practical matter, much federal-tribal interaction takes place. While the BIA has always dominated tribal life, now other agencies operate programs or implement regulations which have a tremendous effect on the environment so integral to native separatism.t49 Unfortunately, many of these agencies routinely carry out statutory mandates without due regard to the special obligations owed to native nations. In this new context, the trust doctrine is an. important legal tool to protect native rights against adverse agency action. Statutory standards developed to serve the interests of a majority society often do not address native needs.15’ Nor do the treaties, which are binding on agencies, address many modern issues that arise with respect to environmental conflicts; furthermore, not all tribes have treaties. The trust doctrine transcends specific treaty promises and embodies a clear duty to protect the native land base and the ability of tribes to continue their ways of life. In short, the doctrine provides a judicial avenue for developing standards more protective of native separatism.’52 The trust responsibility remains a focal point for tribes in their efforts to gain federal protection of native lands and resources. For example, over the past few years the Columbia River Basin tribes that have treaty rights to harvest salmon have urged federal agencies to fulfill their trust responsibility by restoring salmon populations, controlling water pollution, and conserving water in streams.’53 The trust responsibility is gaining renewed attention in the Clinton administration as well. In an historic meeting on April 29, 1994, with over 300 tribal leaders, the President made a pledge to fulfill his trust responsibility.’54 Several agencies within the executive branch are now developing trust policies to guide their actions affecting tribes.’55 But despite the growing need for enforcing the federal responsibility owed to native nations, and a corresponding tribal reliance upon the trust doctrine to support demands for protection of natural resources, the trust doctrine remains encumbered by its past association with plenary power in the Kagama case.’ Because it is often still characterized as emanating from a “guardian-ward” relationship, the trust responsibility is blemished by policies from past eras which supported federal dominion over tribes and assimilation of native people. Accordingly, it is sometimes rejected as a tool to protect native rights’57 Rejecting the trust doctrine as a corollary to plenary power may work a real disservice to tribes. The outright dismissal of the trust responsibility effectively drowns any continuing special federal obligation toward tribes. It forecloses a potentially effective judicial avenue for requiring agencies to protect native lands and resources. Stripped of trust responsibility claims, tribes are often left with only constitutional or statutory grounds to challenge agency action. Neither source contains standards which adequately protect uniquely native sovereignty concerns. Therefore, any effort to “decolonize” federal Indian law by dismantling the notion of plenary power should not correspondingly destroy the notion of continuing federal obligations which benefit the tribes. Indeed, tribal leaders who invoke the trust responsibility to argue for federal protection of their way of life often readily distinguish and disassociate the doctrine from plenary power.1 The trust responsibility should be recognized as a doctrine of federal restraint, not permissîon,’ and as an important source of protection for Indian rights. Generally, the trust doctrine holds more force when used to challenge federal agency action rather than congressional action. Even in the agency context, however, the doctrine has not been applied consistently to achieve its full theoretical potential. The following two sections briefly explore the trust doctrine in the congressional and agency contexts and evaluate its potential for use in future litigation.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Outsiders to contest debating have remarked simply that too many policy debate arguments end in all-out nuclear war; consequently, they categorize the activity as foolish. How many times have educators had contest debaters in a classroom discussion who strung out an extended mini-max argument to the jeers and guffaws of their classmates? They cannot all be wrong. Frighteningly enough, most of us agree. We should not ignore Charles Richet’s adage: “The stupid man is not the one who does not understand something — but the man who understands it well enough yet acts as if he didn’t” (Tabori 6). Regrettably, mini-max arguments are not the exclusive domain of contest debating. “Policies driven by the consideration of low risk probabilities will, on the whole, lead to low investment strategies to prevent a hazard from being realized or to mitigate the hazard’s consequences. By comparison, policies driven by the consideration of high consequences, despite low probabilities, will lead to high levels of public investment” (‘Nehnevajsa 521). Regardless of their persuasiveness, Bashor and others have discovered that mini-max claims are not useful in resolving complex issues. For example, in his assessment of low probability, potentially high-consequence events such as terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction, Bashor found simple estimates of potential losses added little to contingency planning. While adding little to policy analysis, extended arguments using mini-max reasoning remain powerful determinants of resource allocation. As such, they need to be debunked. Experts agree. For example, Slovic advocates a better understanding of all risk analysis since it drives much of our public policy. “Whoever controls the definition of risk controls the rational solution to the problem at hand. If risk is defined one way, then one option will rise to the top as the most cost-effective or the safest or the best. If it is defined another way, perhaps incorporating qualitative characteristics or other contextual factors, one will likely get a different ordering of action solutions. Defining risk is thus an exercise in power” (699). When probability assessments are eliminated from risk calculi, as is the case in mini-max risk arguments, it is a political act, and all political acts need to be scrutinized with a critical lens. This essay intends to examine some of the problems associated with extended arguments using mini-max reasoning. First, extended arguments will be examined in respect to logical problems associated with causality, corroboration, and equivocation. Second, mini-max reasoning will be examined in an attempt to debunk its persuasiveness. Finally, I will introduce three criteria for assessing the probative value of mini-max extended arguments. The strength of the relationship between the claims in extended arguments rests on the probability of the causation between and among the simple claims. The relationship between each claim in an extended argument is moderated by its probability. Probability is challenging to define. Many scientists and members of the risk assessment community “have not as yet come to grips with the foundational issue about the meaning of probability and the various interpretations that can be attached to the term probability. This is extremely important, for it is how one views probability that determines one attitude toward a statistical procedure” (Singpurwalla 182). We employ the notion of probability when we do not know a thing with certainty. But our uncertainty is either purely subjective (we do not know what will take place. but someone else may know) or objective (no one knows, and no one can know). Subjective probability is a compass for an informational disability. . . . Probability is, so to speak, a cane for a blind man; he uses it to feel his way. If he could see, he would not need the cane, and if I knew which horse was the fastest, I would not need probability theory. (Lem 142) In simple arguments, “risks are simply the product of probability and consequence’ (Thompson &amp; Parkinson 552). Thompson and Parkinson found a difficulty in risk assessment associated with mini-max arguments that they identified as the problem of risk tails. “Risk tails are the segments of the standard risk curve which approach the probability and consequence axes. The tails represent high-consequence low-probability risk and low. consequence high-probability risk” (552). This region, especially the high-consequence low-probability tail, is the site of mini-max computation. The complex probabilities of extended arguments are problematic. For example, too much reliance is given an extended link story when each step in the link exhibits a probability that is geometrically self-effacing. According to the traditional multiplication theorem, if a story is drawn from AcaBaCaD, the probabilities of AcaB and BaC and COED are multiplied. “The probability that two subsequent events will both happen is a ratio compounded of the probability of the 1st. and the probability of the 2nd in the supposition the 1st happens” (Bayes 299). If the probability of AaB is .10 and the probability of BaC is also .10, then the probability of AaC is .01. If the probability of CaD is also .10. then the probability of AaD is .001. If all we had to do to determine probability involved multiplying fractions, calculating probabilities would be easy. Unfortunately, such is not the case. An interesting caveat involves conditional probability. “It’s expository holds that we should not concern ourselves with absolute probabilities, which have no relevance to things as they are, but with conditional probabilities the chances that some event will occur when some set of previous conditions exists” (Krause 67). Conditional probabilities are most often associated with calculations involving variables that may be even remotely associated, such as phenomena in international relations. If one considers the probability of many separate events occurring, one must also consider whether or not they are correlated — that is, whether or not they are truly independent. If they are correlated, simply multiplying individual probabilities will not give you the correct estimate, and the final probability may actually be much larger than one will predict if one makes this error. For example, the probability that I will utter an obscenity at any given instance may be small (although it is certainly not zero). The probability that I will hit my funny bone at any given instant is also small. However, the probability that I will hit my funny bone and then utter an obscenity is not equal to the product of the probabilities, since the probability of swearing at a given instant s correlated to the probability of hurting myself at a given instant. (Krause 67) Hence, “if we calculate a priori the probability of the occurred event and the probability of an event composed of that one and a second one which is expected, the second probability divided by the first will be the probability of the event expected, drawn from the observed event” (Laplace IS). Another complication of extended causal chains is the corroboration principle. “There are cases in which each testimony seems unreliable (i.e., has less than 0.5 probability) on its own, even though the combination of the two testimonies is rather persuasive. . . [I]f both testimonies are genuinely independent and fully agree with one another, we are surely going to be inclined to accept them” (Cohen 72). When we are uncertain about a probability, we might try to engage multiple sources making the same or same-like claim. We feel it is less likely that two or more sources are incorrect than that a single source will be. While corroboration seems valid, it is a persuasive pipe-dream. If we use this calculus to draw our claims, errors are likely to be shared and replicated. Witness some of the problems associated with realism in international relations literature. As such, the multiplication theorem has been subverted by conditional probabilities and undercut by corroboration, but contest debaters and policy makers have not risen to the challenge. While contest debating has borrowed heavily from policymaking and systems analysis, it has not resolved the causality issues any better than have policy studies experts. The grand calculus used in systems analysis is as simplistic as it is in contest debating. Lichtman and Rohrer described what happens to systems analysis in a contest debate two decades ago. “To determine the level of net benefits achieved by a policy system when multiple outcomes are considered, policy makers simply sum, for all anticipated results, the product of their probabilities and values” (238).</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are occasions when decisions are influenced by worries about possible dangers although we have only a vague idea about what these dangers might look like. Recent debates on biotechnology are an example of this. Specific, identified risks have had only a limited role in these debates. Instead, the focus has been on vague or unknown dangers such as the creation of new life-forms with unforeseeable properties. It is easy to find examples in which many of us would be swayed by considerations of unknown dangers. Suppose, for instance, that someone proposes the introduction of a genetically altered species of earthworm that will aerate the soil more efficiently. If introduced in nature, it will ultimately replace the common earthworm. For the sake of argument we may assume that all concrete worries have been neutralized. The new species can be shown not to induce more soil erosion, not to be more susceptible to diseases, etc. Still, it would not be irrational to say: &quot;Yes, but there may be other negative effects that we have not been able to think of. Therefore, the new species should not be introduced.&quot; Similarly, if someone proposed to eject a chemical substance into the stratosphere for some good purpose or other, it would not be irrational to oppose this proposal solely on the ground that it may have unforeseeable consequences, and this even if all specified worries can be neutralized. However, it would not be feasible to take such possibilities into account in all decisions that we make. In a sense, any decision may have catastrophic unforeseen consequences. If far-reaching indirect effects are taken into account, then – given the unpredictable nature of actual causation – almost any decision may lead to a disaster. In order to be able to decide and act, we therefore have to disregard many of the more remote possibilities. Cases can also easily be found in which it was an advantage that far-fetched dangers were not taken seriously. One case in point is the false alarm on so-called polywater, an alleged polymeric form of water. In 1969, the prestigious scientific journal Nature printed a letter that warned against producing polywater. The substance might &quot;grow at the expense of normal water under any conditions found in the environment,&quot; thus replacing all natural water on earth and destroying all life on this planet. (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v9n2/hansson.html#donahoe" rel="nofollow">Donahoe 1969</a> ) Soon afterwards, it was shown that polywater is a non-existent entity. If the warning had been heeded, then no attempts would had been made to replicate the polywater experiments, and we might still not have known that polywater does not exist. In cases like this, appeals to the possibility of unknown dangers may stop investigations and thus prevent scientific and technological progress. We therefore need criteria to determine when the possibility of unknown dangers should be taken seriously and when it can be neglected. This problem cannot be solved with probability calculus or other exact mathematical methods. The best that we can hope for is a set of informal criteria that can be used to support intuitive judgement. The following list of four criteria has been proposed for this purpose. (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v9n2/hansson.html#hansson" rel="nofollow">Hansson 1996</a>) 1. Asymmetry of uncertainty: Possibly, a decision to build a second bridge between Sweden and Denmark will lead through some unforeseeable causal chain to a nuclear war. Possibly, it is the other way around so that a decision not to build such a bridge will lead to a nuclear war. We have no reason why one or the other of these two causal chains should be more probable, or otherwise more worthy of our attention, than the other. On the other hand, the introduction of a new species of earthworm is connected with much more uncertainty than the option not to introduce the new species. Such asymmetry is a necessary but insufficient condition for taking the issue of unknown dangers into serious consideration. 2. Novelty: Unknown dangers come mainly from new and untested phenomena. The emission of a new substance into the stratosphere constitutes a qualitative novelty, whereas the construction of a new bridge does not. An interesting example of the novelty factor can be found in particle physics. Before new and more powerful particle accelerators have been built, physicists have sometimes feared that the new levels of energy might generate a new phase of matter that accretes every atom of the earth. The decision to regard these and similar fears as groundless has been based on observations showing that the earth is already under constant bombardment from outer space of particles with the same or higher energies. (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v9n2/hansson.html#ruthen" rel="nofollow">Ruthen 1993</a>) 3. Spatial and temporal limitations: If the effects of a proposed measure are known to be limited in space or time, then these limitations reduce the urgency of the possible unknown effects associated with the measure. The absence of such limitations contributes to the severity of many ecological problems, such as global emissions and the spread of chemically stable pesticides. 4. Interference with complex systems in balance: Complex systems such as ecosystems and the atmospheric system are known to have reached some type of balance, which may be impossible to restore after a major disturbance. Due to this irreversibility, uncontrolled interference with such systems is connected with a high degree of uncertainty. (Arguably, the same can be said of uncontrolled interference with economic systems; this is an argument for piecemeal rather than drastic economic reforms.) It might be argued that we do not know that these systems can resist even minor perturbations. If causation is chaotic, then for all that we know, a minor modification of the liturgy of the Church of England may trigger a major ecological disaster in Africa. If we assume that all cause-effect relationships are chaotic, then the very idea of planning and taking precautions seems to lose its meaning. However, such a world-view would leave us entirely without guidance, even in situations when we consider ourselves well-informed. Fortunately, experience does not bear out this pessimistic worldview. Accumulated experience and theoretical reflection strongly indicate that certain types of influences on ecological systems can be withstood, whereas others cannot. The same applies to technological, economic, social, and political systems, although our knowledge about their resilience towards various disturbances has not been sufficiently systematized.</span><br />

<strong>The prior question is whether the plan affirms a worthy ethical principle. To void this obligation in the name of future consequences is literally an absurd notion — it fails to establish any coherent moral framework, makes your decision impossible, and destroys value to life</strong><br />
<strong>Finnis, 1980</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (John, Professor of Law and Legal Philosophy at Oxford, Natural Law and Natural Rights, 120-122)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To choose an act which in itself simply (or primarily) damages a basic good is thereby to engage oneself willy-nilly (but directly) in an act of opposition to an incommensurable value (an aspect of human personality) which one treats as if it were an object of measurable worth that could be outweighed by commensurable objects of greater (or cumulatively greater) worth. To do this will often accord with our feelings, our generosity, our sympathy, and with our commitments and projects in the forms in which we undertook them. But it can never be justified in reason. We must choose rationally (and this rational judgment can often promote a shift in our perspective and consequently a realignment of initial feelings and thus our commitments and projects). Reason requires that every basic value be at least respected in each and every action. If one could ever rightly choose a single act which itself damages and itself does not promote some basic good, then one could rightly choose whole programmes and institutions and enterprises that themselves damage and do not promote basic aspects of human well-being, for the sake of their 'net beneficial consequences’. Now we have already seen that consequences, even to the extent that they can be 'foreseen as certain', cannot be commensurably evaluated, which means that 'net beneficial consequences' is a literally absurd general object or criterion. It only remains to note that a man who thinks that his rational responsibility to be always doing and pursuing good is satisfied by a commitment to act always for best consequences is a man who treats every aspect of human personalitv (and indeed, there, treats himself) as a utensil. He holds himself ready to do anything (and thus makes himself a tool for all those willing to threaten sufficiently bad consequences if he does not cooperate with them). But the objection I am making to such is not that programmes of mass killing, mass deception, etc. would then be morally eligible (though they would) and indeed morally required (though they would), but that no sufficient reason can be found for treating any act as immune from the only direction which we have, viz. the direction afforded by the basic practical principles. These each direct that a form of good is to be pursued and done' and each of them bears not only on all our large-scale choices of projects (in which attainment of the objective will indeed be the good consequence of successful deployment of effective means), but also on each and every choice of an act which itself is a complete act (whether or not it is also a step in a plan or a phase in a project). The incommensurable value of an aspect of personal full-being (and its corresponding primary principle) can never be rightly subordinated to any project or commitment. But such an act of subordination inescapably occurs at least whenever a distinct choice-of-act has in itself no meaning save that of damaging that basic value (thus violating that primary principle). Such, in highly abstract terms, is the seventh requirement, the principle on which alone rests (as we shall later see) the strict inviolability of basic human rights: VIII.7. There is no human right that will not be overridden if feelings (whether generous and unselfish, or mean and self-centered) are allowed to govern choice, or if cost-benefit considerations are taken outside their appropriate technical sphere and allowed to govern one's direct engagement (whether at the level of commitment, project, or individual act) with basic goods. And the perhaps unfamiliar formulation which we have been considering should not obscure the fact that this 'seventh requirement' is well recognized, in other formulations: most loosely as `the end does not justify the means'; more precisely, though still ambiguously, as 'evil may not be done that good might follow therefrom'; and with a special Enlightenment flavour, as Kant's 'categorical imperiative;: Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only'.12</span><br />

<strong>Attention to isolated instances of warfare ignores the daily horrors of exclusion and discriminatory violence – a shift toward structural violence is necessary to address the root cause of war</strong><br />
<strong>Cuomo 1996</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">– PhD, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Department of Philosophy, University of Cincinnati (Chris, Hypatia Fall 1996. Vol. 11, Issue 3, pg 30)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In &quot;Gender and `Postmodern' War,&quot; Robin Schott introduces some of the ways in which war is currently best seen not as an event but as a presence (Schott 1995). Schott argues that postmodern understandings of persons, states, and politics, as well as the high-tech nature of much contemporary warfare and the preponderance of civil and nationalist wars, render an event based conception of war inadequate, especially insofar as gender is taken into account. In this essay, I will expand upon her argument by showing that accounts of war that only focus on events are impoverished in a number of ways, and therefore feminist consideration of the political, ethical, and ontological dimensions of war and the possibilities for resistance demand a much more complicated approach. I take Schott's characterization of war as presence as a point of departure, though I am not committed to the idea that the constancy of militarism, the fact of its omnipresence in human experience, and the paucity of an event-based account of war are exclusive to contemporary postmodern or postcolonial circumstances.(1) Theory that does not investigate or even notice the omnipresence of militarism cannot represent or address the depth and specificity of the everyday effects of militarism on women, on people living in occupied territories, on members of military institutions, and on the environment. These effects are relevant to feminists in a number of ways because military practices and institutions help construct gendered and national identity, and because they justify the destruction of natural nonhuman entities and communities during peacetime. Lack of attention to these aspects of the business of making or preventing military violence in an extremely technologized world results in theory that cannot accommodate the connections among the constant presence of militarism, declared wars, and other closely related social phenomena, such as nationalistic glorifications of motherhood, media violence, and current ideological gravitations to military solutions for social problems. Ethical approaches that do not attend to the ways in which warfare and military practices are woven into the very fabric of life in twenty-first century technological states lead to crisis-based politics and analyses. For any feminism that aims to resist oppression and create alternative social and political options, crisis-based ethics and politics are problematic because they distract attention from the need for sustained resistance to the enmeshed, omnipresent systems of domination and oppression that so often function as givens in most people's lives. Neglecting the omnipresence of militarism allows the false belief that the absence of declared armed conflicts is peace, the polar opposite of war. It is particularly easy for those whose lives are shaped by the safety of privilege, and who do not regularly encounter the realities of militarism, to maintain this false belief. The belief that militarism is an ethical, political concern only regarding armed conflict, creates forms of resistance to militarism that are merely exercises in crisis control. Antiwar resistance is then mobilized when the &quot;real&quot; violence finally occurs, or when the stability of privilege is directly threatened, and at that point it is difficult not to respond in ways that make resisters drop all other political priorities. Crisis-driven attention to declarations of war might actually keep resisters complacent about and complicitous in the general presence of global militarism. Seeing war as necessarily embedded in constant military presence draws attention to the fact that horrific, state-sponsored violence is happening nearly all over, all of the time, and that it is perpetrated by military institutions and other militaristic agents of the state. Moving away from crisis-driven politics and ontologies concerning war and military violence also enables consideration of relationships among seemingly disparate phenomena, and therefore can shape more nuanced theoretical and practical forms of resistance. For example, investigating the ways in which war is part of a presence allows consideration of the relationships among the events of war and the following: how militarism is a foundational trope in the social and political imagination; how the pervasive presence and symbolism of soldiers/warriors/patriots shape meanings of gender; the ways in which threats of state-sponsored violence are a sometimes invisible/sometimes bold agent of racism, nationalism, and corporate interests; the fact that vast numbers of communities, cities, and nations are currently in the midst of excruciatingly violent circumstances. It also provides a lens for considering the relationships among the various kinds of violence that get labeled &quot;war.&quot; Given current American obsessions with nationalism, guns, and militias, and growing hunger for the death penalty, prisons, and a more powerful police state, one cannot underestimate the need for philosophical and political attention to connections among phenomena like the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; the &quot;war on crime,&quot; and other state-funded militaristic campaigns. I propose that the constancy of militarism and its effects on social reality be reintroduced as a crucial locus of contemporary feminist attentions, and that feminists emphasize how wars are eruptions and manifestations of omnipresent militarism that is a product and tool of multiply oppressive, corporate, technocratic states.(2) Feminists should be particularly interested in making this shift because it better allows consideration of the effects of war and militarism on women, subjugated peoples, and environments. While giving attention to the constancy of militarism in contemporary life we need not neglect the importance of addressing the specific qualities of direct, large-scale, declared military conflicts. But the dramatic nature of declared, large-scale conflicts should not obfuscate the ways in which military violence pervades most societies in increasingly technologically sophisticated ways and the significance of military institutions and everyday practices in shaping reality. Philosophical discussions that focus only on the ethics of declaring and fighting wars miss these connections, and also miss the ways in which even declared military conflicts are often experienced as omnipresent horrors. These approaches also leave unquestioned tendencies to suspend or distort moral judgement in the face of what appears to be the inevitability of war and militarism.</span><br />

<strong>Prefer our impacts – probability neglect means their impacts and internal links are exaggerated</strong><br />
<strong><span class="AuthorYear">Sunstein 01</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - Cass Sunstein is an American legal scholar, particularly in the fields of constitutional law, administrative law, environmental law, and law and behavioral economics, who was the Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama administration; taught at UChicago. (“Probability Neglect: Emotions, Worst Cases, and Law”, University of Chicago, 11/20/2001, pdf)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Drawing on and expanding this evidence, I will emphasize a single phenomenon here. Sometimes people focus on the worst possible case, which triggers strong emotions. When this is so, people fail to inquire into the probability that the worst case will occur. In such cases, emotions lead to what I will call probability neglect, which is properly treated as a form of quasirationality. 17 From the normative point of view, it is not fully rational to treat a 1% chance of X as equivalent, or nearly equivalent, to a 99% chance of X, or even a 10% chance of X. Because people suffer from probability neglect, and because neglecting probability is not fully rational, the phenomenon I identify casts additional doubt on the widespread idea that ordinary people have a kind of “richer rationality” superior to that of experts.18 Most of the time, experts are concerned principally with the number of lives at stake, and for that reason they will be closely attuned, as ordinary people are not, to the issue of probability. It is not at all clear how the law should respond to this form of quasirationality. I will suggest that at a minimum, an understanding of probability neglect will help to understand how government and law might accomplish shared social goals. If government wants to insulate itself from probability neglect, it will create institutions designed to ensure that genuine risks, rather than tiny ones, receive the most concern. Such institutions will not require agencies to discuss the worst-case scenario.20 And if government is attempting to increase public concern with a genuine danger, it should not emphasize statistics and probabilities, but should instead draw attention to the worst case scenario. An understanding of probability neglect will also help us to make better predictions about the public “demand” for law. When a bad outcome is highly salient and triggers strong emotions, government will be asked to do something about it, even if the probability of the bad outcome is low. For law, the most difficult questions seem to be normative in character. Should government respond to intense fears that involve statistically remote risks? When people suffer from probability neglect, should law and policy do the same thing? I suggest that if it can, government should attempt to educate and inform people, rather than capitulating to unwarranted public fear. On the other hand, public fear, however unwarranted, may be intractable, in the sense that it is impervious to efforts at reassurance. And if public fear is intractable, it will cause serious problems, because fear is itself extremely unpleasant, and because fear is likely to influence conduct, producing (for example) wasteful and excessive private precautions. If so, a governmental response, via regulatory safeguards, would appear to be justified if the benefits, in terms of fear reduction, justify the costs. III. Probability Neglect: The Basic Phenomenon Many experiments suggest that when it comes to risk, a key question is whether people can imagine or visualize the “worst case” outcome.21 When the worst case produces intense fear, little role is played by the stated probability that that outcome will occur.22 An important function of strong emotions is thus to drive out quantitative judgments, including judgments about probability, by making the best case or the worst case seem highly salient.23 By way of preface, however, it is important to note that a great deal of evidence shows that whether or not emotions are involved, people are relatively insensitive to differences in probabilities, at least when the relevant probabilities are low.</span><br />

<strong>Nuclear war won’t cause extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Nyquist 99</strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (J.R., Defense Analyst, Worldnetdaily.com, May 20, 1999)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As I write about Russia's nuclear war preparations, I get some interesting mail in response. Some correspondents imagine I am totally ignorant. They point out that nuclear war would cause &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; and everyone would die. Since nobody wants to die, nobody would ever start a nuclear war (and nobody would ever seriously prepare for one). Other correspondents suggest I am ignorant of the world-destroying effects of nuclear radiation. I patiently reply to these correspondents that nuclear war would not be the end of the world. I then point to studies showing that &quot;nuclear winter&quot; has no scientific basis, that fallout from a nuclear war would not kill all life on earth. Surprisingly, few of my correspondents are convinced. They prefer apocalyptic myths created by pop scientists, movie producers and journalists. If Dr. Carl Sagan once said &quot;nuclear winter&quot; would follow a nuclear war, then it must be true. If radiation wipes out mankind in a movie, then that's what we can expect in real life. But Carl Sagan was wrong about nuclear winter. And the movie &quot;On the Beach&quot; misled American filmgoers about the effects of fallout. It is time, once and for all, to lay these myths to rest. Nuclear war would not bring about the end of the world, though it would be horribly destructive. The truth is, many prominent physicists have condemned the nuclear winter hypothesis. Nobel laureate Freeman Dyson once said of nuclear winter research, &quot;It's an absolutely atrocious piece of science, but I quite despair of setting the public record straight.&quot; Professor Michael McElroy, a Harvard physics professor, also criticized the nuclear winter hypothesis. McElroy said that nuclear winter researchers &quot;stacked the deck&quot; in their study, which was titled &quot;Nuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear Explosions&quot; (Science, December 1983). Nuclear winter is the theory that the mass use of nuclear weapons would create enough smoke and dust to blot out the sun, causing a catastrophic drop in global temperatures. According to Carl Sagan, in this situation the earth would freeze. No crops could be grown. Humanity would die of cold and starvation. In truth, natural disasters have frequently produced smoke and dust far greater than those expected from a nuclear war. In 1883 Krakatoa exploded with a blast equivalent to 10,000 one-megaton bombs, a detonation greater than the combined nuclear arsenals of planet earth. The Krakatoa explosion had negligible weather effects. Even more disastrous, going back many thousands of years, a meteor struck Quebec with the force of 17.5 million one-megaton bombs, creating a crater 63 kilometers in diameter. But the world did not freeze. Life on earth was not extinguished. Consider the views of Professor George Rathjens of MIT, a known antinuclear activist, who said, &quot;Nuclear winter is the worst example of misrepresentation of science to the public in my memory.&quot; Also consider Professor Russell Seitz, at Harvard University's Center for International Affairs, who says that the nuclear winter hypothesis has been discredited. Two researchers, Starley Thompson and Stephen Schneider, debunked the nuclear winter hypothesis in the summer 1986 issue of Foreign Affairs. Thompson and Schneider stated: &quot;the global apocalyptic conclusions of the initial nuclear winter hypothesis can now be relegated to a vanishingly low level of probability.&quot; OK, so nuclear winter isn't going to happen. What about nuclear fallout? Wouldn't the radiation from a nuclear war contaminate the whole earth, killing everyone? The short answer is: absolutely not. Nuclear fallout is a problem, but we should not exaggerate its effects. As it happens, there are two types of fallout produced by nuclear detonations. These are: 1) delayed fallout; and 2) short-term fallout. According to researcher Peter V. Pry, &quot;Delayed fallout will not, contrary to popular belief, gradually kill billions of people everywhere in the world.&quot; Of course, delayed fallout would increase the number of people dying of lymphatic cancer, leukemia, and cancer of the thyroid. &quot;However,&quot; says Pry, &quot;these deaths would probably be far fewer than deaths now resulting from ... smoking, or from automobile accidents.&quot; The real hazard in a nuclear war is the short-term fallout. This is a type of fallout created when a nuclear weapon is detonated at ground level. This type of fallout could kill millions of people, depending on the targeting strategy of the attacking country. But short-term fallout rapidly subsides to safe levels in 13 to 18 days. It is not permanent. People who live outside of the affected areas will be fine. Those in affected areas can survive if they have access to underground shelters. In some areas, staying indoors may even suffice. Contrary to popular misconception, there were no documented deaths from short-term or delayed fallout at either Hiroshima or Nagasaki. These blasts were low airbursts, which produced minimal fallout effects. Today's thermonuclear weapons are even &quot;cleaner.&quot; If used in airburst mode, these weapons would produce few (if any) fallout casualties. On their side, Russian military experts believe that the next world war will be a nuclear missile war. They know that nuclear weapons cannot cause the end of the world. According to the Russian military writer, A. S. Milovidov, &quot;There is profound error and harm in the disoriented claims of bourgeois ideologues that there will be no victor in a thermonuclear world war.&quot; Milovidov explains that Western objections to the mass use of nuclear weapons are based on &quot;a subjective judgment. It expresses mere protest against nuclear war.&quot; Another Russian theorist, Captain First Rank V. Kulakov, believes that a mass nuclear strike may not be enough to defeat &quot;a strong enemy, with extensive territory enabling him to use space and time for the organizations of active and passive defense. ...&quot; Russian military theory regards nuclear war as highly destructive, but nonetheless winnable. Russian generals do not exaggerate the effects of mass destruction weapons. Although nuclear war would be unprecedented in its death-dealing potential, Russian strategists believe that a well-prepared system of tunnels and underground bunkers could save many millions of lives. That is why Russia has built a comprehensive shelter system for its urban populace. On the American side as well, there have been studies which suggest that nuclear war is survivable.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In addition, the means cannot be judged only by the purpose they serve because the means, as any facts, have other consequences that could be bad although the end is good. For instance, it could be argued that euthanasia is a means of eradicating certain genetic diseases from a community. It is good that genetic diseases disappear; therefore, euthanasia is a good fact. Such reasoning does not include other consequences of euthanasia that might not be good; in this case, euthanasia ceases to be good from a consequentialist perspective. Consequentialism encounters the issue of infinite regression 3 : namely, a fact is right if it has good consequences but consequences are right if they themselves have good consequences, and so forth. The only way to break regression is to admit a multitude of facts as being good in themselves. These facts are said to form a moral basis, and the set of sentences that presuppose these facts form an ethical code. In this way, a moral system consists of the sum of judgments regarding the ethical values of facts in relation to a moral basis. Thus, the strategy of consequentialism necessarily leads to accepting an ethical code.</span><br />

<strong>Util kills human agency and value to life</strong><br />
<strong><span class="AuthorYear">Donnelly 85</span></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Jack, College of the Holy Cross, The Concept of Human Rights, 1985, p. 55-58)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Basic moral and political rights are not just weighting factors in utilitarian calculations that deal with an undifferentiated 'happiness'. Rather, they are demands and constraints of a different order, grounded in an essentially substantive judgement of the conditions necessary for human development and flourishing. They also provide means - rights - for realising human potentials. The neutrality of utilitarianism, its efforts to assure that everyone counts 'equally', results in no-one counting as a person; as Robert E. Goodin puts it, people drop out of utilitarian calculations, which are instead about disembodied preferences (1981:95; compare Dworkin 1977:94-100, 232-8, 274 ff.). In Aristotelian terms, utilitarianism errs in basing its judgements on 'numerical' rather than 'proportional' equality. For our purposes, such differences should be highlighted. Therefore, let us consider utilitarianism, whether act or rule, as an alternative to rights in general, and thus human rights as well. In particular, we can consider utility and human rights as competing strategies for limiting the range of legitimate state action. Once again, Bentham provides a useful focus for our discussion. While Bentham insists on the importance of limiting the range of legitimate state action (1838:11, 495, VIII, .557 ff.), he also insists that (natural) rights do not set those limits. In fact, he argues that construed as limits on the state, natural rights 'must ever be, - the rights of anarchy', justifying insurrection whenever a single right is violated (1838:11, 522, 496, 501, 506). For Bentham, natural rights are absolute rights, and thus inappropriate to the real world of political action. In fact, though, no major human rights theorist argues that they are absolute. For example, Locke holds that the right to revolution is reserved by society, not the individual (1967: para. 243). Therefore, individual violations of human rights per se do not justify revolution. Furthermore, Locke supports revolution only in cases of gross, persistent and systematic violations of natural rights (1967: paras 204, 207, 225), as does Paine. The very idea of absolute rights is absurd from a human rights perspective, since logically there can be at most one absolute right, unless we (unreasonably) assume that rights never come into conflict. A more modest claim would be that human rights are 'absolute' in the sense that they override all principles and practices except other human rights. Even this doctrine, however, is rejected by most if not all major human rights theorists and documents. For example, Article I of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man, after declaring that 'men are born, and always continue, free and equal in respect of their rights', adds that 'civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility', thus recognising restrictions on the continued complete equality of rights. Similarly, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 29) permits such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and free- doms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights includes a similar general limiting proviso (Article 4) as well as particular limitations on most of the enumerated rights. Rights ordinarily 'trump' other considerations, but the mere presence of a right - even a basic human right - does not absolutely and automatically determine the proper course of action, all things considered. In certain exceptional circumstances, needs, utility, interests or righteousness may override rights. The duties correlative to rights, and even the trumping force of rights, are prima facie only. But other principles also have prima facie moral force. Sometimes this will be sufficient to overcome even the special entrenched priority of rights. The obligations arising from such rights therefore ought not to be discharged, all things considered. In such cases, we can speak of the right being 'infringed', since the (prima facie) obligation correlative to the right is not discharged, but it would be seriously misleading to say that it had been 'violated' (Thomson 1976, 1977). But if even basic human rights can be justifiably infringed, aren't rights ultimately subservient to utility? If recalcitrant political realities sometimes require subordinating natural rights, aren't we simply suggesting that human rights are merely utopian aspirations inappropriate to a world in which dirty hands are often a requirement of political action - and thus where utility is the only reasonable guide? Such a response misconstrues the relationship between rights and utility and the ways in which rights are overridden. Consider a very simple case, involving minor rights that on their face would seem to be easily overridden. If A promises to drive B and C to the movies but later changes his mind, in deciding whether to keep his promise (and discharge his rights-based obligations). A must consider more than the relative utilities of both courses of action for all the parties affected; in most cases, he ought to drive them to the movies even if that would reduce overall utility. At the very least he must ask them to excuse him from his obligation, this requirement (as well as the power to excuse) being a reflection of the right-holder's control over the rights relationship. Utility alone usually will not override even minor rights; we require more than a simple calculation of utility to justify infringing rights. The special priority of rights/titles, as we have seen, implies that the quality, not just the quantity, of the countervailing forces (utilities) must be taken into consideration. For example, if, when the promised time comes, A wants instead to go get drunk with some other friends, simply not showing up to drive B and C to the movies will not be justifiable even if that would maximise utility; the desire for a drunken binge is not a consideration that ordinarily will justifiably override rights. But if A accompanies an accident victim to the hospital, even if A is only one of several passers-by who stopped to offer help, and his action proves to be of no real benefit to the victim, usually this will be a sufficient excuse, even if utility would be maximised by A going to the movies. Therefore, even recasting rights as weighted interests (which would seem to be the obvious utilitarian 'fix' to capture the special priority of rights) still misses the point, because it remains essentially quantitative. Rights even tend to override an accumulation of comparable or parallel interests. Suppose that sacrificing a single innocent person with a rare blood factor could completely and permanently cure ten equally innocent victims of a disease that produces a sure, slow and agonising death. Each of the eleven has the 'same' right to life. Circumstances require, however, that a decision be made as to who will live and who will die. The natural rights theorist would almost certainly choose to protect the rights of the one individual - and such a conclusion, when faced with the scapegoat problem, is one of the greatest virtues of a natural rights doctrine to its advocates. This conclusion rests on a qualitative judgement that establishes the right, combined with the further judgement that it is not society's role to infringe such rights simply to foster utility, a judgement arising from the special moral priority of rights. Politically, such considerations are clearest in the case of extremely unpopular minorities. For example, plausible arguments can be made that considerations of utility would justify persecution of selected religious minorities (e.g. Jews for centuries in the West, Mormons in nineteenth-century America, Jehovah's Witnesses in contemporary Malawi), even giving special weight to the interests of members of these minorities and considering the precedents set by such persecutions. None the less, human rights demand that an essentially qualitative judgement be made that such persecutions are incompatible with a truly human life and cannot be allowed - and such judgements go a long way to explaining the relative appeal of human rights theories. But suppose that the sacrifice of one innocent person would save not ten but a thousand, or a hundred thousand, or a million people. All things considered, trading one innocent life for a million, even if the victim resists most forcefully, would seem to be not merely justifiable but demanded. Exactly how do we balance rights (in the sense of 'having a right'), wrongs (in the sense of 'what is right') and interests? Do the numbers count? If so, why, and in what way? If not, why not? Ultimately the defender of human rights is forced back to human nature, the source of natural or human rights. For a natural rights theorist there are certain attributes, potentialities and holdings that are essential to the maintenance of a life worthy of a human being. These are given the special protection of natural rights; any 'utility' that might be served by their infringement or violation would be indefensible, literally inhuman - except in genuinely extraordinary circumstances, the possibility of which cannot be denied, but the probability of which should not be overestimated. Extraordinary circumstances do force us to admit that, at some point, however rare, the force of utilitarian considerations builds up until quantity is transformed into quality. The human rights theorist, however, insists on the extreme rarity of such cases. Furthermore, exotic cases should not be permitted to obscure the fundamental difference in emphasis (and in the resulting judgements in virtually all cases) between utility and (human) rights. Nor should they be allowed to obscure the fact that on balance the flaws in rights-based theories and practices seem less severe, and without a doubt less numerous, than those of utility-based political strategies.</span><br />

<strong>Util is irrelevant – all matter is inherently valuable and interconnected – the aff’s ethics are a prerequisite to action</strong><br />
<strong><span class="AuthorYear">Henning 9</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">– associate professor of philosophy at Gonzaga University (Brian, ‘Trusting in the Efficacy of Beauty: A Kalocentric Approach to Moral Philosophy’, Ethics and the Environment)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Final truths (whether in religion, morality, or science) are unattainable not only due to the finitude and fallibility of human inquirers, but because we live in what the theologian John F. Haught calls an &quot;unfinished universe&quot; (2004). The notion that one could achieve anything like a final or absolute formulation in any field of study presupposes that one's object is static. Thankfully, we do not live in such a universe. Over the last century scientists have consistently discovered that the universe is not a plenum of lifeless, valueless facts mechanistically determined by absolute laws. Rather, we live in a processive cosmos that is a dynamic field of events organized in complex webs of interdependence, rather than a collection of objects interacting via physical laws. The intuition that the universe is fundamentally a clockwork machine successfully guided science in the wake of Newton's inspirational formulation of the laws of mechanics, but this metaphor proved increasingly inadequate as Newton's work was supplanted in the early 20th century by both general relativity and quantum mechanics. Even at its peak, the [End Page 107] mechanical metaphor created difficulties for thinking about human beings, who were never effectively illuminated by the assumption that they were complex machines. At the level of elementary particles, quantum mechanics disclosed a world of wave-like particles spread out in space and inextricably entangled with other particles in the local environment. The notion of autonomous &quot;individual&quot; particles disappeared. Although all metaphors are misleading to some degree, the metaphor of the world as an evolving organism has become more helpful than the old mechanical model of the world as a clock. This, in a sense, is the founding insight of Whitehead's &quot;philosophy of organism,&quot; which took as its starting point the view that individuals—particles, plants, and people—are not discrete facts walled off from each other but parts of complex and intersecting wholes. Conceived of as an organic process, every individual is inextricably intertwined and interconnected with every other. The fundamental reality is no longer individual entities but rather the ongoing processes by which they interact and create novel structures. Once we recognize that every individual—from a subatomic event to a majestic sequoia—brings together the diverse elements in its world in just this way, just here, and just now, we see that nothing is entirely devoid of value and beauty. This process whereby many diverse individuals are brought together into the unity of one new individual, which will eventually add its energy to future individuals, characterizes the most basic feature of reality and is what Whitehead calls the &quot;category of creativity.&quot; On this view, reality is best characterized not as an unending march of vacuous facts, but as an incessant &quot;creative advance&quot; striving toward ever-richer forms of beauty and value. Noting its emphasis on interdependence and interrelation, many scholars have rightly noted that Whitehead's metaphysics is uniquely suited to provide a basis for making sense of our relationship to the natural world.10 Decades before modern ecologists taught us about ecosystems, Whitehead was describing individuals as interrelated societies of societies. No individual, Whitehead insisted, can be understood apart from its relationship to others.11 Indeed, whereas ecologists only explain how it is that macroscopic individuals are related in interdependent systems, Whitehead's organic metaphysics of process provides a rich account of how individuals at every level of complexity—from subatomic events to ecosystems, and from oak trees to galaxies—arise and are perpetuated.12 [End Page 108] What is more, Whitehead's philosophy of organism places a premium on an individual's dependence on and relationship to the larger wholes of which it is a part without making the mistake of subsuming the individual into that larger whole.13 With the philosophy of organism we need not choose between either the one or the many, &quot;the many become one and are increased by one&quot; (Whitehead [1929] 1978, 21). By providing a robust alternative to the various forms of reductive physicalism and destructive dualism that currently dominate many branches of science and philosophy, the philosophy of organism is an ideal position from which to address the complex social and ecological challenges confronting us. First, if who and what I am is intimately and inextricably linked to everyone and everything else in the universe, then I begin to recognize that my own flourishing and the flourishing of others are not independent. Not only do I intimately and unavoidably depend on others in order to sustain myself, with varying degrees of relevance, how I relate to my environment is constitutive of who and what I am. As we are quickly learning, we ignore our interdependence with our wider environment at our own peril. Moreover, in helping us to recognizing our connection to and dependence on our larger environment, an organic model forces us to abandon the various dualisms that have for too long allowed us to maintain the illusion that we are set off from the rest of nature. Adopting an organic metaphysics of process forces us finally to step down from the self-constructed pedestal from which we have for millennia surveyed nature and finally to embrace the lesson so compellingly demonstrated by Darwin: humans are not a singular exception to, but rather a grand exemplification of, the processes at work in the universe.14 In this way we ought finally to reject not only the materialisms of contemporary science, but also the dualisms that often undergird our religious, social, political, and moral understandings of ourselves and our relationship to the natural world. As John Dewey concisely put it, &quot;man is within nature, not a little god outside&quot; (1929, 351). Until we shed our self-deluding arrogance and recognize that who and what we are as a species is fundamentally bound up in and dependent on the wider scope of events unfolding in the universe, the ecological crisis will only deepen. Taken seriously, our understanding of reality as composed of vibrant, organically interconnected achievements of beauty and value, has a dramatic effect on how we conceive [End Page 109] of ourselves, of nature, and of our moral obligations—morality can no longer be limited merely to inter-human relations. In rejecting modernity's notion of lifeless matter, we come to recognize that every form of actuality has value in and for itself, for others, and for the whole. In aiming at and achieving an end for itself, every individual—no matter how ephemeral or seemingly insignificant—has intrinsic value for itself and in achieving this self-value it thereby becomes a value for others and for the whole of reality. Every individual, from the most fleeting event in deep space to centuries old redwoods, has value for itself, for others, and for the whole of reality and it is from this character of reality that our moral obligations derive (Whitehead 1938, 111). Given that every individual in our universe, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, has some degree of value, the scope of our direct moral concern15 can exclude nothing. Thus, in rather sharp contrast to the invidious forms of anthropocentrism that characterize much of western moral thought, our scope of direct moral concern cannot be limited to humans, to sentient beings, or even to all living beings. Morality is not anthropocentric, but neither is it sentientcentric or biocentric. In affirming the value of every individual, we must begin to recognize that every relation is potentially a moral relation. As Whitehead vividly puts it, &quot;The destruction of a man, or of an insect, or of a tree, or of the Parthenon, may be moral or immoral.… Whether we destroy or whether we preserve, our action is moral if we have thereby safeguarded the importance [or value] of experience so far as it depends on that concrete instance in the world's history&quot; (1938, 14–15). Morality is not merely about how we ought to act toward and among other human beings, other sentient beings, or even other living beings. Morality is fundamentally about how we comport ourselves in the world, how we relate to and interact with every form of existence.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">I have no quarrel with Cornell's and Spivak's claim that &quot;what is missing in a literary text or historical narrative leaves its mark through the traces of its expulsion.&quot; For that seems simple to say that any text will presuppose the existence of people, things, and institutions that it hardly mentions. So the readers of a literary text will always be able to ask themselves questions such as: &quot;Who prepared the sumptuous dinner the lovers enjoyed?&quot; &quot;How did they get the money to afford that meal?&quot; The reader of a historical narrative will always be able to wonder about where the money to finance the war came from and about who got to decide whether the war would take place. &quot;Expulsion,&quot; however, seems too pejorative a term for the fact that no text can answer all possible questions about its own background and its own presuppositions. Consider Captain Birch, the agent of the East Indian Company charged with persuading the Rani of Sirmur not to commit suicide. Spivak is not exactly &quot;expelling&quot; Captain Birch from her narrative by zeroing in on the Rani, even though she does not try to find out much about Birch's early days as a subaltern, nor about the feelings of pride or shame or exasperation he may have experienced in the course of his conversations with the Rani. In the case of Birch, Spivak does not try to &quot;gently blow precarious ashes into their ghostly shape,&quot; nor does she speculate about the possible sublimity of his career. Nor should she. S.ivak has her own fish to and her own witness to bear just as Kipling had his when he spun tales of the humiliations to which newly arrived subalterns were subjected in the regimental messes of the Raj. So do all authors of literary texts and historical narratives, and such texts and narratives should not alwa s be read as disin enuous exercises in repression. They should be read as one version of a story that could have been told, and should be told, in many other ways.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*JAR = Justice as Restoration = GBTL*</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Still, while JAR is the most normatively attractive of the three theoretical clusters, JAR theory is not the final stop on the theoretical journey to justice for Indians. JAR theory is susceptible to criticism on several grounds. As compelling as the argument that non-Indian land owners are obligated to vacate their entitlements in favor of the descendants of their Indian predecessors-in-title may be, principles of equity, as JAS theory is quick to assert, should proscribe the wholescale evacuation of millions of acres of land and the forced relocation of innocent and newly-homeless non-Indians to places uncertain. Even if equity alone is not sufficient to counsel prudence, the prospect that non-Indians threatened in the security of their property interests might organize to induce political action resulting in further abridgement of Indian resources and rights° must be accounted for in any theory of Indian justice. If the only remedy for a past injustice is a present injustice, a perpetual cycle of bloody conflict over land is inevitable 341 However, the most radical of JAR theorists are practically oblivious to the broad externalities the restorative clement of their philosophy might spawn: despite warnings that it is now much too late to “give back Manhattan,” some insist that nothing short of the dissolution of the U.S. will suffice if we are to “takfc] seriously. . . morality and justice.” If politics is the art of the possible, a theory that insists on the dismemberment of the modem-day U.S. or other forms of “radical social surgery” is too fantastic to be given serious consideration as a political proposal.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*JAI = Justice as Indigenism*</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The final stage of JAI theory is distinguished from the preceding stages in that it imposes a duty not upon the U.S., but upon Indian people. The execution of the first six stages of JAI will “portend changes in power and well-being”77 for some non-Indians, and may well compromise the universalist approach to conceiving of, promoting, and protecting rights. JAI will therefore invite contestation over its form, pace, and scope.479 However, if the U.S. acknowledges, recognizes responsibility for, and repairs the gross injustices suffered by Indians over the course of its creation and expansion, JAI obligates Indians to find it in their hearts and minds to forgive. If the U.S. restores a meaningful measure of land to Indian tribes and amends its legal and political order to ensure respect for and protection of fundamental Indian rights to self- determination, a new regime of peace and justice worthy of emulation and export must be rewarded with the most precious gift Indians can bestow: forgiveness. By forgiving the U.S. and all its people in a solemn ceremony48° broadcast globally to symbolize the dawn of the new relationship, Indians will finally be allowed to heal, and all Americans will be released from the chains of history and freed to forge a better tomorrow. The U.S. and Indian tribes are not only intertwined geographically and historically, they are interdependent. Indian autonomy and prosperity on the one hand, and U.S. legitimacy and global leadership on the other, are inseverable, with each a necessary condition for the lull realization of the other.48 1 Just as the political and economic development of its “domestic dependent nations” is tied to U.S. leadership of the global political economy, so also is the moral legitimacy of the U.S. linked to its respect and promotion of the rights of Indians to self-determine. If U.S.-Indian relationships advance on the basis of a recognition of, and respect for, mutual sovereignties, with disputes resolved not by coercion and domination, but by negotiation and harmonization, a new era of just peace, worthy of emulation and export, will follow.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*JAI = Justice as Indigenism*</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">One of the most difficult stages in applying JAI theory will be the process of land restoration. Scholars have posited that the diffusion of transnational rights- based arguments claiming the sanctity of private property and objections to unjust enrichment may have generated a more favorable political and legal climate for restitution of Indian Lands.41o However, even if preceding stages in JAI commit the U.S. and its people in theory to do “justice,” it will prove far more difficult in practice to reach an agreement with Indian tribes as to what measures must be implemented to yield a “just” result, and still more difficult to cobble together legislation implementing agreed-upon measures without catalyzing opposition. For much of the non-Indian majority, a land restoration agenda resonates not as the legal obligation of a constitutional republic descended heavily upon prior sovereigns but rather as an existential threat. Indeed, non-Indians are Americans too, and they have nowhere to go if transformations in land tenure regimes evict them from their homes. Broaching the subject of land restoration with a non-Indian can trigger defensive backlash: as a white businessman huffed, “I didn’t persecute anybody at Plymouth Rock... This is the 1990’s. We didn’t do anything to them, and we don’t owe them anything.”</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">According to a long-standing view in the movement, it is not possible. The character of the new society can only be concretized by practice alone, in the course of trying to remake society. Yet if this is true, we are faced with a vicious circle from which there seems to be no escape, because acceptance of TINA is creating barriers in practice. In the perceived absence of an alternative, practical struggles have proven to be self-limiting at best. They stop short of even trying to remake society totally – and for good reason. As Bertell Ollman has noted (Introduction to Market Socialism: The Debate among Socialists, Routledge, 1998, p. 1), “People who believe [that there is no alternative] will put up with almost any degree of suffering. Why bother to struggle for a change that cannot be? … people [need to] have a good reason for choosing one path into the future rather than another.” Thus the reason of the masses is posing a new challenge to the movement from theory. When masses of people require reasons before they act, a new human society surely cannot arise through spontaneous action alone. And exposing the ills of existing society does not provide sufficient reason for action when what is at issue is the very possibility of an alternative. If the movement from theory is to respond adequately to the challenge arising from below, it is necessary to abandon the presupposition – and it seems to me to be no more than a presupposition – that the vision of the new society cannot be concretized through the mediation of cognition. We need to take seriously Raya Dunayevskaya’s (Power of Negativity [PON], p. 184) claim in her Hegel Society of America paper that “There is no trap in thought. Though it is finite, it breaks through the barriers of the given, reaches out, if not to infinity, surely beyond the historic moment” (RD, PON, p. 184). This, too, is a presupposition that can be “proved” or “disproved” only in the light of the results it yields. In the meantime, the challenges from below require us to proceed on its basis.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">From this perspective, we see how Almanac of the Dead is perhaps the perfect example of a contemporary novel rethinking class struggle and reconceptualizing class, in short rethinking Marxism and the American Marxist literary tradition. Silko's work features peasant uprisings, industrial strikes, militant homeless organizing, prison riots, and organizing of the unemployed. All of this political action, however, is organized around the central Third World nationalist anti-imperialist movement led by the Hopi leader, a holistic healer whose title signifies his ability to think in terms of totality: &quot;One strategy the Hopi had emphasized had been the 'international coordinated effort.' The Hopi had traveled to Africa and Asia; he had been around the world to meet with indigenous tribal people&quot; (731). Politically, Silko puts into a fuller domestic and [End Page 173] global context the significance and necessity of Native American and Third World cultural national struggle in relation to the global class struggle. While she stresses that &quot;a nation is coming! a nation is coming!&quot; (724), this national liberation movement is not separate from the uninterrupted class struggle but is simply a necessary and integrated phase. Indeed, the Hopi's vision is a deeply class vision, as we see in his disagreement with the character Calabazas: &quot;Calabazas had been stubborn. They were crazy, he said; they had seen too many Hollywood movies. The minute there were prison riots and unrest in the cities the battle lines would fall along skin color. No, the Hopi had explained patiently, if anything happened, it would be more like the haves, whatever colors they were, killing the have-nots&quot; (738). Silko is firmly situated here in the rhetorical terrain of Marx and Engels's famous opening to The Communist Manifesto where they weave that single narrative of the history of class struggle between the haves and have-nots. Silko's narrative of class struggle, however, is one much broader and one written from a distinctly Native American Marxist perspective that privileges the agency of Third World peoples and the necessity of national struggle as a phase in the international class struggle. Silko's vision is much more comprehensive of the specific historical conditions and available historical agencies and cultural resources. Just as &quot;Marx had been working desperately to seize the story of each child-victim and to turn the story away from the brutal endings the coroners and factory inspectors used to write for the children of the poor&quot; (520), so Silko is seizing new stories and Marxist narratives to lead us into the twenty-first century. Overcoming Alienation: Native Americans as the Matrix of Class Liberation Just as Silko re-envisions class struggle from a Third World perspective and reconceptualizes a heightened class consciousness premised in a more complex or totalizing mapping of the global colonial system, so Simon Ortiz also fosters a more comprehensive version of class consciousness as he develops an historical materialist narrative of the dispossession of Native Americans and their subsequent dependence on wage labor under U.S. capitalism. But what is also striking about his [End Page 174] writings is the way in which he centrally refocuses alienation as the defining experience of capitalist exploitation, the overcoming of which must be the premise of any narrative of class struggle and liberation. Though not self-identified as a Marxist in his writings, Ortiz nonetheless importantly realigns us with a Marxist humanist emphasis on alienation in his narrative rendering of the materialist dialectic, an emphasis too often forgotten. As the Third World Marxist Samir Amin reminds us, &quot;alienation of labor is no less basic than its exploitation in our analysis of social classes in the modern world. To go beyond capitalism, therefore, requires not merely a 'rectified apportionment of value' (which would lead only to an imaginary 'capitalism without capitalists') but rather the liberation of mankind from economic alienation&quot; (54). In his manifestolike tract of prose and poetry titled &quot;Our Homeland, A National Sacrifice Area&quot;--the second section of the larger volume of poetry and prose &quot;Fight Back: For the Sake of the People, For the Sake of the Land&quot; collected in Woven Stone--Ortiz stresses that a genuine liberation characterized by social, individual, and environmental wholeness and health--in short a world in which the free and full development of each is the precondition for the free and full development of all--cannot be achieved at the point of distribution, by merely redistributing wealth so that everyone's basic physical needs are satisfied. Instead, a qualitative transformation of, rather than a quantitative legerdemain of reallocation within, capitalism itself must take place to reinvent social relationships and to restore a proper relationship with the land. &quot;It is not a matter of higher incomes for Indians because there will be higher incomes as inflation goes higher,&quot; he writes, &quot;It is not a matter of a higher standard of living which we are led to seek as the only possible alternative. It is survival that is at stake and it is the quality of life that is at stake&quot; (360). Here Ortiz underlines and attempts to correct the impoverishment of our imagination which leaves us with little sense of options or alternatives outside the capitalist rationality of seeking higher wages or more material comforts. This alternative does not remedy the central condition of alienation that results from wage labor nor does it foster responsible and more productive use of resources to ensure our survival and longevity. We have become so alienated from ourselves, defined our humanity in such isolated and narrow ways, Ortiz suggests, that we no longer even contemplate the interdependence of our lives [End Page 175] with the ecology in which we live. Thus we labor under the illusion that when we work for others and create profit we are producing wealth, when we are in fact destroying the basis of our existence, the ecology.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Modernity is a culturally specific, historical construct, yet the concept remains stubbornly reified as some sort of natural historical phenomenon. As Joseph Gusfield described in 1967, “We cannot easily separate modernity and tradition from some specific tradition and some specific modernity, some version which functions ideologically as a directive. The modern comes to the traditional society as a particular culture with its own traditions.” 39 The use of universal categories of capitalist development defines a particular kind of historical narrative. Theoretical paradigms that posit subsistence ways of life against proletarian experiences and the traditional versus the modern render historically invisible economic systems that do not fit within those dualistic parameters. Recognizing the coexistence of modernity and tradition within the same historical time and space and refusing to think of culture as purely a terrain of resistance reveals a much more complicated and compelling story. As historian Kathy Walker suggests from her study of Chinese peasants, “Alternative pasts indicate a counter-appropriation of history that simply cannot be reduced to a logic of capitalist development or universalized modernity. They must be explained on their own terms.” 40 Reaching for historical specificity does not mean ignoring the bigger picture or abandoning the work of capitalist theory. On the contrary, moving beyond the “discourse of development,” to use Arturo Escobar’s term, means creating new theoretical models to help make sense out of the multiple histories that are bound to emerge once we remove the paradigmatic blinders. American historians can learn a great deal from scholars studying the ways rural peoples in the Third World have shaped and been shaped by capitalist development. Peasant and subaltern studies scholars have chipped away at assumptions that had previously characterized peasant societies as undifferentiated, or “traditional,” and peasant uprisings as reactive and conservative. In effect, they opened Marx’s “sack of potatoes” to look inside. What they found were complex societies divided along wealth, gender, and age hierarchies and united by kinship and other socially constructed identities. Third World social scientists found that peasants, a social category once defined as “precapitalist,” existed within capitalist structures as well as on the periphery of the world system. These scholars wondered how the internal dynamics of peasant cultures mediated their interactions with the world economy, how they resisted absorption into the capitalist market, as well as how they accommodated to it. This type of scholarship produced a nuanced view that expanded definitions of resistance beyond collective uprising and revolution to oppositional popular culture, nationalism, gender antagonism, and subtle subversion encoded in “hidden transcripts.” 41 Still, revealing the agency of historical actors does not necessarily shed light on the power structures within which they operate. However, these types of studies revealed how complex the dance between power structures and historical agents can be. 42 NATIVE PATHWAYS: COMMERCIAL INCORPORATION The capitalist market has taken its toll on American Indian communities, particularly since incorporation has usually meant a devastating loss of land and other natural resources—elements of central economic and cultural significance. Yet the way indigenous communities recovered in the twentieth century shows a creative engagement with the market. By contesting the terms of incorporation, either as laborers or as tribal capitalists, American Indians are challenging the cultural assumptions of modernity itself. Native Pathways reflects much of the exciting scholarship done by Third World scholars since the mid-1980s. This volume helps to flesh out what historian Florencia Mallon has described as “that skeleton historians call the development of capitalism.” She examines how Andean peasants used “traditional relationships” to shape their villages’ transition to a capitalist economy, and in the process those “weapons of the weak” transformed the villagers and their communities. 43 Paul Rosier’s chapter on Blackfeet oil leasing demonstrates the importance of understanding the “culture of political economy” implicit in the incorporation of indigenous societies into the capitalist market economy. Even though American Indians do not dictate the terms of their incorporation, they may in fact shape its impact. For example, Rosier shows that the revenue earned from oil leasing did not necessarily subvert Blackfeet culture. Instead, tribal members incorporated it into their established cultural practices, such as giveaways, which helped to “mitigate against incipient class conflict” through a redistribution of tribal income. Cultural practices changed, but they remained no less Blackfeet in their reincarnation. Whereas cultural practices might temper the effects of incorporation, Tressa Berman describes ways informal women’s networks served as a buffer against the surrounding capitalist market, helping to “spread the risks of survival across households.” American Indian women on the Fort Berthold Reservation intermixed their production for the market with ceremonial use so that those realms have become interdependent. Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara women pooled resources such as commodity food issued by the federal government, wages, or star quilts and redistributed them for ceremonial purposes or to aid kin who were in need. As a result, Berman states, “[in] both their structural adaptation and their community-based resistance the core cultural life remains intact, such that new strategies emerge from the maintenance of traditional practices.”</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But I snapped out of it, the gloves came off, and I began pounding away. It dawned on me that the main reason Indians must participate in American politics is not to “scrap for votes, lobby politicians, and make political contributions,”217 but to try — against all odds, against all hope — to awaken “the American dream” to its own unrealized conscience. To try to do that, if it can be done at all, and even if it can ‘t be done, means we must enter the ring, we must stand and fight, we must “kick at the darkness ‘til it bleeds daylight” — and not run away when the darkness starts kicking back. “It requires defense and offense, and a strategy to win.”219 For those who come after, we must try to do what those who came before tried to do — and did — for us. We must, says a wise Dakota elder, step in “the footprints of our ancestors who fought wars and signed treaties so that we could live.”220 Like our ancestors, we must do battle for the rights of our tribes, for our survival as Indian nations and Indian people. Like they did, we must wage war on every front where our rights are threatened. American politics is one such battleground — a vast one, an important one, perhaps the most important one. If we retreat from that theater, can we survive the Armageddon that will then be upon us? America without conscience is Indian Apocalypse Now. Shall we throw in the towel, sit this one out, preach to the choir, rest in the belly of that Great Beast? No way.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are several different issues that I’m thinking of when I use the term “sustainable.” One is that it is hard to imagine that a break with capitalism will emerge throughout the world all at once. This presents a very serious problem of sustainability, since history has shown, I believe, that socialism in one country is indeed impossible. What can be done to defend the break with capitalism in the meantime, against both the inevitable attempt at counter-revolution and capitalism’s totalizing tendency, its tendency to swallow up and incorporate everything within itself? I do not know. I do not know anyone who knows. But I do know that this is a question that needs to be thought through with extreme care – and now. It cannot be put off until “after the revolution.” To assume that there will be time, at that point, to think it through or time to work it out through experimentation, is wishful thinking at best. It is quite hard to believe that there will be any time at all before the counter-revolution and the tentacles of the capitalist system go to work. In referring to “sustainability,” I also have several economic problems in mind that must be confronted. If the emergent new society does not “deliver the goods,” and if it does not move towards elimination of alienated labor and reduction of working time, there will be no popular mandate for it – and indeed, no reason for its continued existence. At this point, it could be kept alive only through force, through suppression of mass opposition, so it would turn into its opposite</span><br />

<strong>Ethics obligate us to act. We present the story of Harry Ramos, trapped in the inferno of the World Trade Center during 9/11, as a metaphor for our position when faced with unending suffering and impending death.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">On September 11,</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> 2001, terrorism touched down in the United States. While millions of us were immobilized and left speechless by what we witnessed live on television, thousands of others in the World Trade Center towers, at the Pentagon, and on three airplanes had no such luxury. They were confronted with a reality few could have ever imagined. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">One man </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">inside World Trade Center One </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">demonstrates that ethics is a lived response </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">of the type Levinas describes. He was not alone, however. Without advance preparation or rules of conduct to follow, the men and women trapped by evil deeds remind us that </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ethics is a response to the call of the other. Harry Ramos</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">, forty-six, had just returned to work at his office on the eighty-seventh floor after a week.s absence. Within minutes, the building was shaking violently; he braced himself in a doorway for stability. As light fixtures plummeted to the floor and smoke filled the office, Harry had no idea that a jetliner had just crashed into his building, floors above him. However, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">he knew </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">enough to know that </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the survival of his office staff was at stake.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> Harry, the head trader for a small investment bank, the May Davis Group, was in the throes of pandemonium. Yet, he had to act. With the company’s chief financial officer, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Harry marshaled the </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">twelve </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">employees </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">in the office to the stairwell </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">to begin the descent down</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> eighty-seven floors, one step at a time. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Harry stationed himself at the end of theline, making sure no one was left behind</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">. .Nine floors down, the stairwell ended. Emerging into a hallway to look for the next flight of stairs, the group saw wires dangling from the cracked ceilings. Sparks popped. Small fires burned everywhere. Office workers were milling in confusion. The smoke was thickening . (Walsh 2001, 1). The scene was not promising. As the group continued down, Harry convinced the stragglers to keep moving. Along the way, Harry also stopped to help strangers make their way into the stairwell. At the fifty-third </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">floor, Harry found Victor who,</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> because of his large size or perhaps his profound </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">fear, found it difficult to move.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> Together with another May Davis employee, they made it to the thirty-ninth floor by way of stairs and a short elevator ride.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">At one point, Harry let go of Victor, to</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> walk ahead and survey the situation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. .Victor cried out in fear. &quot;Harry, please help,&quot; he begged. &quot;Don't worry, we’re not leaving you,&quot; Mr. Ramos said</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">. (Walsh 2001, 1).Stopping to rest, the building sadistically shook again, and so the trio picked themselves up and walked down further, to the thirty-sixth floor. There, an exhausted Victor proclaimed his energy was spent, that his legs could not carry his frame another step. A firefighter rushing by yelled at Harry to leave Victor behind and run. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But Harry did not move, assuring the large stranger, &quot;Victor, don.t worry. I'm with you</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; Moments later, on television sets tuned in to the scene from all over the world, we saw the avalanche of cement and glass crush to the ground as the World Trade Center towers came tumbling down. As the buildings collapsed, so did thousands of lives. What the ordinary men and women like </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Harry Ramos left behind </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">was not only a memory of good deeds, but </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">also a glimpse</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">into ethics</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">and communication </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">that compels us to answer the call of the other. Harry Ramos demonstrates for us the detectable evidence of the saying in everyday discourse</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">. In Harry's response, we begin to recognize something compelling that makes possible the saying, what Levinas refers to as .the trace.. The trace signifies presence in absence, like how we feel someone's company even after they have left the room or when the amputee continues to experience the ache of a phantom limb. And, there is the trace of God who has &quot;walked the earth&quot; though is no longer directly visible. For Levinas, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the trace is the vestige of the infinite</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">. The Levinasian trace is nonphenomenological, signifying without manifesting anything (Peperzak 1997). As such, it resists our attempts to analyze it or identify it conclusively. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yet we continue to search for it in the saying,</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> in the human face, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and in responsibility. This quest</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">, says Levinas,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> a worthy one</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="StyleBoldUnderline">indicative of an ethical life. </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">The trace itself challenges logic and rationality; the trace resists comprehension as it .disturbs the order of the world. (1996b, 62). The difficulty of talking about the trace arises from its &quot;enigmatic, equivocal&quot; features that elude our attempts to name it. Levinas explains, &quot;The infinite then cannot be tracked down like game by a hunter. The trace left by the infinite is not the residue of a presence; its very glow is ambiguous. (1998, 12). The trace, then, is not a sign or a concrete feature but a paradoxical function of sociality (Bergo 1999). The trace is palpable yet not tangible, within our reach yet out of our grasp. David Michael Levin describes Levinas's phenomenology as<em>tracework,</em> an obsession-sustained meditation on an admittedly hopeless search for the traces .of primordial responsiveness. .</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The project is hopeless, but not futile</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">; Levin offers, .</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">since the effort</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">, the attempt itself, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">carries enormous moral merit</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">. (1998, 349). These are powerful ideas.an ethical subject whose ethics are lodged in a place otherwise than being</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; an ethic that can be conceived as the condition for dialogue</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> in the saying to another; </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and the possibility of that saying, overwritten in ontology by the said, coming through still as a trace in discourse </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">.like an unheard question. (Bergo 1999, 155). &quot;Harry, please help me,&quot; is surely the call of conscience from one terrified and helpless man to a stranger who befriended him. &quot;Don't worry, we're not leaving you,&quot; is just as surely the .here I am.. But the repeat at the end</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, &quot;Don't worry, I'm with you,&quot; turns the &quot;here I am&quot; into a deeply exposed and singular commitment. It</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> is no longer &quot;we&quot; but &quot;I&quot; who will be <em>with</em> the man who is not going anywhere in the heart of an inferno.</span><br />

<strong>Permutation do both – changing the world and celebrating life are necessary parts of one another</strong><br />
<strong>May 2005</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Todd May, prof @ Clemson. “To change the world, to celebrate life,” Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism 2005 Vol 31 nos 5–6 pp. 517–531)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To change the world and to celebrate life. This, as the theologian Harvey Cox saw, is the struggle within us. It is a struggle in which one cannot choose sides; or better, a struggle in which one must choose both sides. The abandonment of one for the sake of the other can lead only to disaster or callousness. Forsaking the celebration of life for the sake of changing the world is the path of the sad revolutionary. In his preface to Anti-Oedipus, Foucault writes that one does not have to be sad in order to he revolutionarv. The matter is more urgent than that, however. One cannot be both sad and revolutionary lacking a sense of the wondrous that is already here, among us, one who is bent upon changing the world can only become solemn or bitter. He or she is focused only on the future; the present is what is to be overcome. The vision of what is not but must come to be overwhelms all else, and the point of change itself becomes lost. The history of the left in the 20th century offers numerous examples of this, and the disaster that attends to it should be evident to all of us by now. The alternative is surely not to shift one’s allegiance to the pure celebration of life, although there are many who have chosen this path. It is at best blindness not to see the misery that envelops so many of our fellow humans, to say nothing of what happens to sentient nonhuman creatures. The attempt to jettison world-changing for an uncritical assent to the world as it is requires a self-deception that I assume would be anathema for those of us who have studied Foucault. Indeed, it is anathema for all of us who awaken each day to an America whose expansive boldness is matched only by an equally expansive disregard for those we place in harm’s way. This is the struggle, then. The one between the desire for life celebration and the desire for world-changing. The struggle between reveling in the contingent and fragile joys that constitute our world and wresting it from its intolerability. I am sure it is a struggle that is not foreign to anyone who is reading this. I am sure as well that the stakes for choosing one side over another that I have recalled here are obvious to everyone. The question then becomes one of how to choose both sides at once. III Maybe it happens this way. You walk into a small meeting room at the back of a local bookstore. There are eight or ten people milling about. They’re dressed in dark clothes, nothing fancy, and one or two of them have earrings or dreadlocks. They vary in age. You don’t know any of them. You’ve never seen them before. Several of them seem to know one another. They are affectionate, hugging, letting a hand linger on a shoulder or an elbow. A younger man, tall and thin, with an open face and a blue baseball cap bearing no logo, glides into the room. Two others, a man and a woman, shout, ‘Tim!’ and he glides over to them and hugs them, one at a time. They tell him how glad they are that he could make it, and he says that he just got back into town and heard about the meeting. You stand a little off to the side. Nobody has taken a seat at the rectangle of folding tables yet. You don’t want to be the first to sit down. Tim looks around the room and smiles. Several other people filter in. You’re not quite sure where to put your hands so you slide them into your jean pockets. You hunch your shoulders. Tim’s arrival has made you feel more of an outsider. But then he sees you. He edges his way around several others and walks up to you and introduces himself. You respond. Tim asks and you tell him that this is your first time at a meeting like this. He doesn’t ask about politics but about where you’re from. He tells you he has a friend in that neighborhood and do you know . . . ? Then several things happen that you only vaguely notice because you’re talking with Tim. People start to sit down at the rectangle of tables. One of them pulls out a legal pad with notes on it. She sits at the head of the rectangle; or rather, when she sits down there, it becomes the head. And there’s something you don’t notice at all. You are more relaxed, your shoulders have stopped hunching, and when you sit down the seat feels familiar. The woman at the head of the table looks around. She smiles; her eyes linger over you and a couple of others that you take to be new faces, like yours. She says, ‘Maybe we should begin.’ IV I can offer only a suggestion of an answer here today. It is a suggestion that brings together some thoughts from the late writings of Maurice Merleau-Ponty with those of Foucault, in order to sketch not even a framework for thought, but the mere outlines of a framework. It is not a framework that would seek to find the unconscious of each in the writings of the other. Neither thinker finishes or accomplishes the other. (Often, for example regarding methodology, they do not even agree.) Rather, it is a framework that requires both of them, from their very different angles, in order to be able to think it. My goal in constructing the outlines of this framework is largely philosophical. That is to say, the suggestion I would like to make here is not one for resolving for each of us the struggle of life-celebration and world-changing, but of offering a way to conceive ourselves that allows us to embrace both sides of this battle at the same time. Given the thinkers I have chosen as reference points, it will be no surprise when I say that that conception runs through the body. Let me start with Merleau-Ponty. In his last writings, particularly in The Visible and the Invisible, he offers a conception of the body that is neither at odds nor even entangled with the world, but is of the very world itself. His concept of the flesh introduces a point of contact that is also a point of undifferentiation. The flesh, Merleau-Ponty writes, ‘is the coiling over of the visible upon the seeing body, of the tangible upon the touching body, which is attested in particular when the body sees itself, touches itself seeing and touching the things, such that, as tangible it descends among them’.2 We must recall this economy of the flesh before we turn to Foucault. There is, for Merleau-Ponty, a single Being. Our world is of that Being, and we are of our world. We are not something that confronts the world from outside, but are born into it and do not leave it. This does not mean that we cannot remove ourselves from the immediacy of its grasp. What it means is that to remove ourselves from that immediacy is neither the breaking of a bond nor the discovery of an original dichotomy or dualism. What is remarkable about human beings is precisely our capacity to confront the world, to reflect upon it, understand it, and change it, while still being of a piece with it. To grasp this remarkable character, it is perhaps worth recalling Gilles Deleuze’s concept of the fold. The world is not composed of different parts; there is no transcendent, whether of God or of subjectivity. The world is one. As Deleuze sometimes says, being is univocal. This oneness is not, however, inert or inanimate. Among other things, it can fold over on itself, creating spaces that are at once insides and outsides, at once different from and continuous with one another. The flesh is a fold of Being in this sense. It is of the world, and yet encounters it as if from a perceptual or cognitive distance. It is a visibility that sees, a tangible that touches, an audible that hears. Merleau- Ponty writes: There is vision, touch when a certain visible, a certain tangible, turns back upon the whole of the visible, the whole of the tangible, of which it is a part, or when suddenly it finds itself surrounded by them, or when between it and them, and through their commerce, is formed a Visibility, a Tangible in itself, which belong properly neither to the body qua fact nor to the world qua fact . . . and which therefore form a couple, a couple more real than either of them.3 For Merleau-Ponty, thought and reflection do not attach themselves to this flesh from beyond it, but arise through it. As our body is of this world, our thought is of our bodies, its language of a piece with the world it addresses. ‘[I]f we were to make completely explicit the architectonics of the human body, its ontological framework, and how it sees itself and hears itself, we would see the possibilities of language already given in it.’4 This conception of the body as flesh of the world is not foreign to Foucault, although of course the terms Merleau-Ponty uses are not his. We might read Foucault’s politics as starting from here, inaugurated at the point of undifferentiation between body and world. The crucial addition he would make is that that point of undifferentiation is not historically inert. The body/world nexus is inscribed in a history that leaves its traces on both at the same time, and that crosses the border of the flesh and reaches the language that arises from it, and the thought that language expresses. How does this work?V Maybe it doesn’t happen that way. Maybe it happens another way. Maybe you walk into a room at a local community center. The room is large, but there aren’t many people, at least yet. There’s a rectangular table in the center, and everyone is sitting around it. A couple of people look up as you walk in. They nod slightly. You nod back, even more slightly. At the head of the table is someone with a legal pad. She does not look up. She is reading the notes on the pad, making occasional marks with the pen in her right hand. Other people come in and take places at the table. One or two of them open laptop computers and look for an outlet. Eventually, the table fills up and people start sitting in chairs behind the table. Your feel as though you’re in an inner circle where you don’t belong. You wonder whether you should give up your chair and go sit on the outside with the others who are just coming in now. Maybe people notice you, think you don’t belong there. At this moment you’d like to leave. You begin to feel at once large and small, visually intrusive and an object of scrutiny. You don’t move because maybe this is OK after all. You just don’t know. The room is quiet. A couple of people cough. Then the woman seated at the head of the table looks up. She scans the room as if taking attendance. She says, ‘Maybe we should begin.’ VI Merleau-Ponty’s discussion of the body as flesh is an ontological one. Although he does not see the body as remote from its historical inscription, his discussion does not incorporate the role such inscription plays. For a body to be of the world is also for it to be temporal, to be encrusted in the continuous emerging of the world over time. And this emerging is not abstract; rather, it is concrete. The body/world nexus evolves during particular historical periods. This fold of the flesh, this body, is not nowhere and at any time. It is there, then; or it is here, now. A body is entangled within a web of specific events and relations that, precisely because it is of this world, are inescapably a part of that body’s destiny. As Merleau-Ponty tells us in Phenomenology of Perception, ‘our open and personal existence rests on an initial foundation of acquired and stabilized existence. But it could not be otherwise, if we are temporality, since the dialectic of acquisition and future is what constitutes time.’5 The medium for the body’s insertion into a particular net of events and relations is that of social practices. Our bodies are not first and foremost creatures of the state or the economy, no more than they are atomized wholes distinct from the world they inhabit. Or better, they are creatures of the state and the economy inasmuch as those appear through social practices, through the everyday practices that are the ether of our lives. Social practices are the sedimentation of history at the level of the body. When I teach, when I write this article, when I run a race or teach one of my children how to ride a bicycle, my body is oriented in particular ways, conforming to or rejecting particular norms, responding to the constraints and restraints of those practices as they have evolved in interaction with other practices over time. Through its engagement in these practices, my body has taken on a history that is not of my making but is nevertheless part of my inheritance. It is precisely because, as Merleau-Ponty has written, the body and the world are not separate things but rather in a chiasmic relation that we can think this inheritance. And it is because of Foucault’s histories that we can recognize that this inheritance is granted through specific social practices. And of course, as Foucault has taught us, social practices are where the power is. It is not, or not simply, at the level of the state or the modes of production where power arises. It is, as he sometimes puts it, at the capillaries. One of the lessons of Discipline and Punish is that, if the soul is the prison of the body, this is because the body is inserted into a set of practices that create for it a soul. These practices are not merely the choices of an individual whose thought surveys the world from above, but instead the fate of a body that is of a particular world at a particular time and place. Moreover, these practices are not merely in service to a power that exists outside of them; they are mechanisms of power in their own right. It is not because Jeremy Bentham disliked the prison population that the Panopticon became a grid for thinking about penal institutions. It is instead because the evolution of penal practices at that time created an opening for the economy of visibility that the Panopticon represented. When Foucault writes that . . . the soul has a reality, it is produced permanently around, on, within the body by the functioning of a power that is exercised on those punished – and, in a more general way, on those one supervises, trains and corrects, over madmen, children at home and at school, the colonized, over those who are stuck at a machine and supervised for the rest of their lives6 his claim is informed by four other ones that lie behind it: that bodies are of a piece with the world, that the body/world nexus is a temporal one, that the medium of that corporeal temporality is the practices a body is engaged in, and that that medium is political as well as social. The last three claims are, of course, of the framework of Foucault’s thought. The first one is the ontological scaffolding provided by Merleau-Ponty. And it is by means of all four that we can begin to conceive things so as to be able to choose both world-changing and lifecelebrating at the same time. VII It could happen yet another way. Increasingly, it does. There is no meeting. There are no tables and no legal pads. Nobody sits down in a room together, at least nobody sits down at a place you know about. There may not even be a leaflet. Maybe you just got an email that was forwarded by someone you know slightly and who thought you might be interested. At the bottom there’s a link, in case you want to unsubscribe. If you don’t unsubscribe you get more notices, with petitions to sign or times and places for rallies or teach-ins or marches. Maybe there’s also a link for feedback or a list for virtual conversations or suggestions. If you show up, it’s not to something you put together but to something that was already in place before you arrived. How did you decide on this rally or teach-in? You sat in front of your computer screen, stared at it, pondering. Maybe you emailed somebody you know, asking for their advice. Is it worth going? If it’s on campus you probably did. It matters who will see you, whether you have tenure, how much you’ve published. There are no Tims here. You’ve decided to go. If it’s a teach-in, you’ve got plausible deniability; you’re just there as an observer. If it’s a rally, you can stand to the side. But maybe you won’t do that. The issue is too important. You don’t know the people who will be there, but you will stand among them, walk among them. You will be with them, in some way. Bodies at the same time and place. You agree on the issue, but it’s a virtual agreement, one that does not come through gestures or words but through sharing the same values and the same internet connections. As you march, as you stand there, nearly shoulder to shoulder with others of like mind, you’re already somewhere else, telling this story to someone you know, trying to get them to understand the feeling of solidarity that you are projecting back into this moment. You say to yourself that maybe you should have brought a friend along. There are many ways to conceive the bond between world-changing and life-celebrating. Let me isolate two: one that runs from Merleau-Ponty to Foucault, from the body’s chiasmic relation with the world to the politics of its practices; and the other one running back in the opposite direction. The ontology Merleau-Ponty offers in his late work is one of wonder. Abandoning the sterile philosophical debates about the relation of mind and body, subject and object, about the relation of reason to that which is not reason, or the problem of other minds, his ontology forges a unity of body and world that puts us in immediate contact with all of its aspects. No longer are we to be thought the self-enclosed creatures of the philosophical tradition. We are now in touch with the world, because we are of it. Art, for example, does not appeal solely to our minds; its beauty is not merely a matter of the convergence of our faculties. We are moved by art, often literally moved, because our bodies and the work of art share the same world. As Merleau-Ponty says, ‘I would be at great pains to say where is the painting I am looking at. For I do not look at it as I do a thing; I do not fix it in its place. My gaze wanders in it as in the halos of Being. It is more accurate to say that I see according to it, or with it, than that I see it.’7 It is only because my body is a fold of this world that art can affect me so. But this affection is also a vulnerability. As my look can happen according to a work of art, so it can happen according to a social practice. And even more so in proportion as that social practice and its effects are suffused through the world in which I carry on my life, the world my body navigates throughout the day, every day. I do not have a chance to look according to a painting by Cezanne very often; but I do encounter the effects of normalization as it has filtered through the practices of my employment, of my students’ upbringing, and of my family’s expectations of themselves and one another. The vulnerability of the body, then, is at once its exposure to beauty and its opening to what is intolerable. We might also see things from the other end, starting from politics and ending at the body. I take it that this is what Foucault suggests when he talks about bodies and pleasures at the end of the first volume of the History of Sexuality. If we are a product of our practices and the conception of ourselves and the world that those practices have fostered, so to change our practices is to experiment in new possibilities both for living and, inseparably, for conceiving the world. To experiment in sexuality is not to see where the desire that lies at the core of our being may lead us; that is simply the continuation of our oppression by other means. Rather, it is to construct practices where what is at issue is no longer desire but something else, something that might go by the name of bodies and pleasures. In doing so, we not only act differently, we think differently, both about ourselves and about the world those selves are inseparable from. And because these experiments are practices of our bodies, and because our bodies are encrusted in the world, these experiments become not merely acts of political resistance but new folds in the body/ world nexus. To construct new practices is to appeal to aspects or possibilities of the world that have been previously closed to us. It is to offer novel, and perhaps more tolerable, engagements in the chiasm of body and world. Thus we might say of politics what Merleau-Ponty has said of painting, that we see according to it. Here, I take it, is where the idea of freedom in Foucault lies. For Foucault, freedom is not a metaphysical condition. It does not lie in the nature of being human, nor is it a warping, an atomic swerve, in the web of causal relations in which we find ourselves. To seek our freedom in a space apart from our encrustation in the world is not so much to liberate ourselves from its influence as to build our own private prison. Foucault once said: There’s an optimism that consists in saying that things couldn’t be better. My optimism would consist rather in saying that so many things can be changed, fragile as they are, bound up more with circumstances than with necessities, more arbitrary than self-evident, more a matter of complex, but temporary, historical circumstances than with inevitable anthropological constraints . . .8 That is where to discover our freedom. And what happens from there? From the meetings, from the rallies, from the petitions and the teach-ins? What happens next? There is, after all, always a next. If you win this time – end aid to the contras, divest from apartheid South Africa, force debt-forgiveness by technologically advanced countries – there is always more to do. There is the de-unionization of workers, there are gay rights, there is Burma, there are the Palestinians, the Tibetans. There will always be Tibetans, even if they aren’t in Tibet, even if they aren’t Asian. But is that the only question: Next? Or is that just the question we focus on? What’s the next move in this campaign, what’s the next campaign? Isn’t there more going on than that? After all, engaging in political organizing is a practice, or a group of practices. It contributes to making you who you are. It’s where the power is, and where your life is, and where the intersection of your life and those of others (many of whom you will never meet, even if it’s for their sake that you’re involved) and the buildings and streets of your town is. This moment when you are seeking to change the world, whether by making a suggestion in a meeting or singing at a rally or marching in silence or asking for a signature on a petition, is not a moment in which you don’t exist. It’s not a moment of yours that you sacrifice for others so that it no longer belongs to you. It remains a moment of your life, sedimenting in you to make you what you will become, emerging out of a past that is yours as well. What will you make of it, this moment? How will you be with others, those others around you who also do not cease to exist when they begin to organize or to protest or to resist? The illusion is to think that this has nothing to do with you. You’ve made a decision to participate in world-changing. Will that be all there is to it? Will it seem to you a simple sacrifice, for this small period of time, of who you are for the sake of others? Are you, for this moment, a political ascetic? Asceticism like that is dangerous. Freedom lies not in our distance from the world but in the historically fragile and contingent ways we are folded into it, just as we ourselves are folds of it. If we take Merleau-Ponty’s Being not as a rigid foundation or a truth behind appearances but as the historical folding and refolding of a univocity, then our freedom lies in the possibility of other foldings. Merleau-Ponty is not insensitive to this point. His elusive concept of the invisible seems to gesture in this direction. Of painting, he writes: the proper essence of the visible is to have a layer of invisibility in the strict sense, which it makes present as a certain absence . . . There is that which reaches the eye directly, the frontal properties of the visible; but there is also that which reaches it from below . . . and that which reaches it from above . . . q where it no longer participates in the heaviness of origins but in free accomplishments.9 Elsewhere, in The Visible and the Invisible, he says: if . . . the surface of the visible, is doubled up over its whole extension with an invisible reserve; and if, finally, in our flesh as the flesh of things, the actual, empirical, ontic visible, by a sort of folding back, invagination, or padding, exhibits a visibility, a possibility that is not the shadow of the actual but its principle . . . an interior horizon and an exterior horizon between which the actual visible is a partitioning and which, nonetheless, open indefinitely only upon other visibles . . .10 What are we to make of these references? We can, to be sure, see the hand of Heidegger in them. But we may also, and for present purposes more relevantly, see an intersection with Foucault’s work on freedom. There is an ontology of freedom at work here, one that situates freedom not in the private reserve of an individual but in the unfinished character of any historical situation. There is more to our historical juncture, as there is to a painting, than appears to us on the surface of its visibility. The trick is to recognize this, and to take advantage of it, not only with our thoughts but with our lives. And that is why, in the end, there can be no such thing as a sad revolutionary. To seek to change the world is to offer a new form of life-celebration. It is to articulate a fresh way of being, which is at once a way of seeing, thinking, acting, and being acted upon. It is to fold Being once again upon itself, this time at a new point, to see what that might yield. There is, as Foucault often reminds us, no guarantee that this fold will not itself turn out to contain the intolerable. In a complex world with which we are inescapably entwined, a world we cannot view from above or outside, there is no certainty about the results of our experiments. Our politics are constructed from the same vulnerability that is the stuff of our art and our daily practices. But to refuse to experiment is to resign oneself to the intolerable; it is to abandon both the struggle to change the world and the opportunity to celebrate living within it. And to seek one aspect without the other – life-celebration without world-changing, world-changing without life-celebration – is to refuse to acknowledge the chiasm of body and world that is the wellspring of both. If we are to celebrate our lives, if we are to change our world, then perhaps the best place to begin to think is our bodies, which are the openings to celebration and to change, and perhaps the point at which the war within us that I spoke of earlier can be both waged and resolved. That is the fragile beauty that, in their different ways, both Merleau- Ponty and Foucault have placed before us. The question before us is whether, in our lives and in our politics, we can be worthy of it. So how might you be a political body, woven into the fabric of the world as a celebrator and as a changer? You went to the meeting, and then to the demonstration. How was it there? Were the bodies in harmony or in counterpoint? Did you sing with your feet, did your voice soar? Did your mind come alive? Did you see possibilities you had not seen before? Were there people whose words or clothes, or even the way they walked hand in hand (how long has it been since you’ve walked hand in hand with someone out in public?) offer you a possibility, or make you feel alive as well as righteous? And how about those people off to the side, the ones on the sidewalk watching? Maybe they just stared, or maybe nodded as you went past. Or maybe some of them shouted at you to stop blocking the streets with your nonsense. Did you recoil within yourself, see yourself as in a mirror, or as the person at Sartre’s keyhole who’s just been caught? Did you feel superior to them, smug in your knowledge? Or did they, too, show you something you might learn from? Are they you at another moment, a moment in the past or in the future? Are they your parents that you have not explained to, sat down beside, or just shared a meal with? That one over there, the old man slightly stooped in the long overcoat: whom does he remind you of? What message might he have unwittingly brought for you? And why does it have to be a demonstration? You go to a few meetings, a few more demonstrations. You write some letters to legislators. You send an email to the President. And then more meetings. The next thing you know, you’re involved in a political campaign. By then you may have stopped asking why. This is how it goes: demonstrations, meetings with legislators, internet contacts. Does it have to be like this? Are demonstrations and meetings your only means? Do they become, sooner or later, not only means but ends? And what kinds of ends? In some sense they should always be ends: a meeting is a celebration, after all. But there are other ends as well. You go to the meeting because that fulfills your obligation to your political conscience. Does it come to that? There are other means, other ends. Other means/ends. Some people ride bicycles, en masse, slowly through crowded urban streets. You want environmentalism? Then have it. The streets are beautiful with their tall corniced buildings and wide avenues. To ride a bike through these streets instead of hiding in the armor of a car would be exhilarating. If enough of you do it together it would make for a pleasant ride, as well as a little lived environmentalism. Would you want to call it a demonstration? Would it matter? There are others as well who do other things with their bodies, more dangerous things. Some people have gone to Palestine in order to put their bodies between the Palestinians and the Israeli soldiers and settlers who attack them. They lie down next to Palestinians in front of the bulldozers that would destroy homes or build a wall through a family’s olive orchard. They feel the bodies of those they are in solidarity with. They smell the soil of Palestine as they lay there. Sometimes, they are harmed by it. A young woman, Rachel Corrie, was deliberately crushed by a US bulldozer operated by an Israeli soldier as she kneeled in front of a Palestinian home, hoping to stop its demolition. To do politics with one’s body can be like this. To resist, to celebrate, is also to be vulnerable. The world that you embrace, the world of which you are a part, can kill you too. And so you experiment. You try this and you try that. You are a phenomenologist and a genealogist. You sense what is around you, attend to the way your body is encrusted in your political involvements. And you know that that sensing has its own history, a history that often escapes you even as it envelops you. There is always more to what you are, and to what you are involved in, than you can know. So you try to keep vigilant, seeking the possibilities without scorning the realities. It’s a difficult balance. You can neglect it if you like. Many do. But your body is there, woven into the fabric of all the other bodies, animate and inanimate. Whether you like it or not, whether you recognize it or not. The only question is whether you will take up the world that you are of, or leave it to others, to those others who would be more than willing to take your world up for you.</span><br />

<strong>Suffering is not inevitable – it is the exception, not the rule</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">From the basic Buddhist tenet that life is suffering to Medieval Christian idea that we suffer on Earth to receive rewards in heaven, the idea of suffering as the human condition is an accepted cliché in many areas of religion and philosophy. Some even go so far as to say that suffering is a universal human condition; that it is both inevitable and we should accept it. This, as I see it, is a problem. First, let’s explore the idea of suffering as being the universal human condition. What does this mean? Well, the adjectives “universal” and “human” suggest that suffering is something that everyone experiences. The term “condition” implies that suffering is something chronic and enduring. In other words, stating that suffering is the universal human condition means that everybody suffers, and implies that suffering is the essential aspect of being human. This assertion seems to be spurious on face. While memories and experiences of suffering can be intense and enduring, they are this way precisely because they are the exception, and not the rule. If suffering were endemic to human existence, it would be almost unnoticed, since it would be experienced all the time. To use a somewhat applicable analogy, there are oftentimes when one thinks that a certain song is going to be played on the radio, and it is. An event such as this is often remembered. However, in remembering the one incident, it is unlikely that one would remember the numerous occasions in which one predicted that the radio would play a certain song, and it did not. In the same way, suffering is memorable, not because always present, but because it is the exception in one’s life. It is important to note, however, that this is a generalization. There are undoubtedly human beings whose life consisted of, on balance, more suffering than non-suffering. This does not disprove the point, though. The fact that many people can examine the suffering of others with a great intensity of feeling underscores the point that for most people, suffering is a relatively rare event. As the existential philosopher William Hasker notes, most of us would say that our lives have been, on the whole, good, and that we are glad that we exist.</span><br />

<strong>But viewing it as inevitable kills VTL</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">We mentioned above that optimism is correlated with higher wellbeing, and it is worthwhile to go deeper into this subject, because Schopenhauer believed that superficial optimism would render people vulnerable to depression. He advised people not to be too optimistic, because the worst is yet to come. Research however shows that optimism is also a positive trait in challenging circumstances. It helps people to see the negative in perspective: by seeing the future as enjoyable, you are more likely to see negative events as temporary. Optimism gives people the strength to deal with the negative, because it helps people to focus on aspects of a given situation that are within their personal control, so they can make the best of adversities. Optimism correlates positively with well being (Scheier et al., 2001).</span><br />

<strong>They’re just wrong – Nietzscheans can’t account for pity because they just don’t get poverty – you can’t rise above it stoically when you’re totally screwed, and that’s what deprives life of all value.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="AuthorYear">Nussbaum ‘94</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Martha, David Benedict Professor, Professor of Philosophy and Classics, and Adjunct Professor of Comparative Literature at Brown University, Nietzsche, Genealogy, Morality: Essays on Nietzsche’s On the Genealogy of Morals, ed. Richard Schacht, p. 158-59<em>GBS-JV]</em></span><br />
<br />
<em><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">We now turn to the heart of the matter, the role of “external goods” in the good human life. And here we encounter a rather large surprise. There is no philosopher in the modern Western tradition who is more emphatic than Nietzsche is about the central importance of the body, and about the fact that we are bodily creatures. Again and again he charges Christian and Platonist moralities with making a false separation between our spiritual and our physical nature; against them, he insists that we are physical through and through. The surprise is that, having said so much and with such urgency, he really is very loathe to draw the conclusion that is naturally suggested by his position: that human beings need worldly goods in order to function.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In all of Nietzsche’s rather abstract and romantic praise of solitude and asceticism, we find no grasp of the simple truth that a hungry person cannot think well; that a person who lacks shelter, basic health care, and the basic necessities of life, is not likely to become a great philosopher or artist, no matter what her innate equipment. The solitude Nietzsche describes is comfortable bourgeois solitude,</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> whatever its pains and loneli¬ness. Who are his ascetic philosophers? “Heraclitus, Plato, Descartes, Spi¬noza, Leibniz, Kant, Schopenhauer”—none a poor person, none a person who had to perform menial labor in order to survive. And because Nietzschedoes not grasp the simple fact that if our abilities are physical abilities they have physical necessary conditions, he does not understand what the democratic and socialist movements of his day were all about. The pro-pity tradition, from Homer on, understood that one functions badly if one is hungry, that one thinks badly if one has to labor all day in work that does not involve the fully human use of one’s faculties. I have suggested that such thoughts were made by Rousseau the basis for the modern development of democratic-socialist thinking. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Since Nietzsche does not get the basic idea, he does not see what socialism is trying to do. Since he probably never saw or knew an acutely hungry person, or a person performing hard physical labor, he never asked how human self-command is affected by such forms of life. And thus he can proceed as if it does not matter how people live from day to day, how they get their food. Who provides basic welfare support for Zarathustra? What are the “higher men” doing all the day long? The reader does not know and the author does not</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> seem to care. Now Nietzsche himself obviously was not a happy man. He was lonely, in bad health, scorned by many of his contemporaries. And yet, there still is a distinction to be drawn between the sort of vulnerability that Nietzsche’s life contained </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and the sort we find if we examine the lives of truly impov¬erished and hungry people. We might say, simplifying things a bit, that there are two sorts of vulnerability: what we might call bourgeois vulnerabil¬ity—for example, the pains of solitude, loneliness, bad reputation, some ill health, pains that are painful enough but still compatible with thinking and doing philosophy—and what we might call basic vulnerability, which is a deprivation of resources so central to human functioning that thought and character are themselves impaired or not developed. Nietzsche, focus¬ing on the first sort of vulnerability, holds that it is not so bad; it may even be good for the philosopher.49The second sort, I claim, he simply neglects—believing, apparently, that even a beggar can be a Stoic </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">hero, if only socialism does not inspire him with weakness.</span></em><br />

<em><strong>A Nietzschean view destroys value to life – responses key to emotions like joy</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Wymore 92</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [John, “Nietzsche, Von Hildebrand, and Human Fulfillment” ALETHEIA] </span></em>/ bp<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In order to develop my criticism of Nietzsche, that a Nietzschean view of value would empty the world of the meaning necessary by which a full and affective life is possible, I want to draw upon Dietrich von Hildebrand's insight into &quot;categories of importance&quot; developed especially in his Ethics. Von Hildebrand there elucidates three &quot;categories of importance&quot;*: the category of the &quot;important in itself,&quot; that is, the intrinsically valuable or precious; that of the &quot;subjectively satisfying&quot;; and that of the importance of the &quot;objective good for the person.&quot; (1) The important in itself is that which ought to exist because of its intrinsic worth, such as the preferring of truth over error. (2) That which derives its importance because it pleases us makes up the category of the subjectively satisfying. (3) Air, shelter, food, and medicine are all important as objective goods for the person. They act beneficently for and upon man. All these &quot;moments&quot; of importance draw things out of neutrality. They are the motivation by which things take on interest for us. Love may emerge from neutrality, significant, because it is pleasurable to me; hence it is subjectively satisfying. Or it may emerge from neutrality because love produces truly beneficial elements in persons; hence, it is an objective good for the person. Or, finally, one can have insight into the essence of love itself and see it to be entirely precious in virtue of its immanent nature. Love emerges from neutrality and is significant, above all else, because of its own essence not because it does something beneficial or because it brings about my pleasure, but because of what it is in itself. It is good that love qua love exist rather than not exist. It is precious in and of itself, and its existence adds a priceless treasure to living. Nietzsche completely denies the category of importance that we term the important in itself, or the intrinsically valuable. He claims that objective reality is value neutral. In Nietzsche's mind there is nothing intrinsically precious which can, of its own nature or act, be the reason for its being lifted out of neutrality. Value is never discovered; it is only created</span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Hence, we enter at birth into a world which has no pre given meaning, and it is up to the individual to create significance by a fiat of the will. It is on the basis of this denial of the important in itself that a completely Nietzschean view would render a fully human life impossible insofar as life is experienced strictly along the lines Nietzsche declares. This is because human life in order to be full and vital depends upon the experience of things which have the power, that is, the sufficient weight and grandeur of being, capable of eliciting responses such as we have mentioned. Gratitude, deep joy, reverence, humility, awe, admiration, and love come about from our contacts with values for which we can be grateful, about which we can feel joy, before which we can experience reverence, humility, awe, or admiration, or to which we may give ourselves in love. All these affective states presuppose conscious objects of knowedge, prior to any act of the will, to which we respond or by which we are moved. For instance, we respond with admiration to great honesty or courage, or with thanksgiving for a precious gift, or with appreciation and gratitude to the loyalty of a friend. We respond to these things in the way that we do because of the knowledge of their significance, the experience of their ontological and qualitative weight, especially to their intrinsic beauty. According to von Hildebrand: &quot;there exist certain affective responses which are essentially value responses, that is, are motivated only by values. Such, for instance, are esteem, veneration, and admiration&quot; (Ethics, p. 211). Nietzsche seems to miss entirely the fact that a joyful life depends upon the existence of intrinsically precious objects and qualities which are capable of engendering our response of joy. Von Hildebrand wrote: &quot;those things endowed with value possess a capacity of bestowing delight&quot; (p. 36). What Nietzsche fails to note is that joy and thanksgiving, as well as many other feelings consciously related to their objects, do not arise from knowing objects or acts which are, in themselves, value neutral. The world, insofar as it is perceived as value neutral, could only engender negligence, boredom, and indifference</span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is precisely because of this that a man [person] blinded to objective value, holding a thoroughly Nietzschean outlook cannot by that very fact experience the preciousness and goodness of life. All external reality, in itself, is neutral for him. The Nietzschean man necessarily lives in a world, that in terms of significance, is dull and flat because all objectivities are equally neutral in his eyes. Prior to the Nietzschean fiat by which anything meaningful exists, nothing has meaning; and in this context the only due responses are ones such as we have said, negligence, boredom, and indifference. Nor does the human will have the power to generate affective responses of the sort we have mentioned from objects which are given as neutral prior to a subject's act of willing or constituting. Despite Nietzsche's declaration of human potential, the power of one's will is limited. Specifically, the Nietzschean fiat is a myth in reference to affective states. While the will is free and in our immediate control, affective responses are not. Quoting von Hildebrand: &quot;we never can engender any affective response by a fiat, nor can we command it by our will as we can any activity. Love, for instance, is always granted to us as a gift&quot; (p. 203). Were we to decide a neutral thing shall have importance, and then try to will it so, e.g., a rock, it would be absurd to speak of our newly created state of love, or esteem, or awe, or reverence for the rock. The Nietzscheanman [person]finds</span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> himself </span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[herself] in the predicament of being faced with the perception of a value neutral world and then having to do the impossible and will affective responses of joy, esteem, and gratitude. It cannot be done</span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></strong><br />

<strong>Death and suffering are bad because they take away the choice for people to live or die and give value to their own lives</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In determining whether a life is worth living or not, attention should be focused upon an array of ‘interests’ of the person, and these, for the competent patient at least, are going to vary considerably, since they will be informed by the patient’s underlying dispositions, and, for the incompetent, by a minimal quality threshold. It follows that for competent patients, a broad-ranging assessment of quality of life concerns is the trump card as to whether or not life continues to be worthwhile. Different patients may well decide differently. That is the prerogative of the patient, for the only unpalatable alternative is to force a patient to stay alive. For Harris, life can be judged valuable or not when the person assessing his or her own life determines it to be so. If a person values his or her own life, then that life is valuable, precisely to the extent that he or she values it. Without any real capacity to value, there can be no value. As Harris states, ‘. . . the value of our lives is the value we give to our lives’. It follows that the primary injustice done to a person is to deprive the person of a life he or she may think valuable. Objectivity in the value of human life, for Harris, essentially becomes one of negative classification (ruling certain people out of consideration for value), allied positively to a broad range of ‘critical interests’; interests worthy of pursuing — friendships, family, life goals, etc. — which are subjected to de facto self-assessment for the further determination of meaningful value. Suicide, assisted suicide, and voluntary euthanasia, can therefore be justified, on the grounds that once the competent nature of the person making the decision has been established, the thoroughgoing commensuration between different values, in the form of interests or preferences, is essentially left up to the individual to determine for himself or herself.</span><br />
