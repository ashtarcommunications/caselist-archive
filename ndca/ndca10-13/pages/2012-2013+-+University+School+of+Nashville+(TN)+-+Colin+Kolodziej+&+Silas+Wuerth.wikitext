=Affirmative= 
===Contention 1 is Inherency=== 
====Although the ARRA allocated money towards high speed rail, the current eight billion dollar commitment is well short of the program~’s needs and isn~’t used for the correct projects====

<span style="font-size: 9pt;">~~[Joshua Rogers, NOTE: THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY: HOW STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION MAY HAVE DERAILED AN AMERICAN HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM, University of Illinois Journal of Law, Technology %26 Policy, Spring, 2011~~]</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">3. Does ARRA Funding Provide a Sufficient Beginning for U.S. High Speed Rail?</span>
AND
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Therefore,</span> it appears significantly unlikely that ARRA provides sufficient funding to even begin a U.S. high speed rail network.

====The link to their DA’s are non-unique – although it hasn’t been passed Obama is going to push hard for HSR throughout 2013==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Washington Post 12/6</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">(Ashley Halsey III,December 06, 2012, "Obama pushes ahead with high-speed rail plan," http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-06/local/35673787_1_high-speed-rail-public-money-first-project)</span>
Undaunted by the<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> looming </span>fiscal crisis
AND
including a number of Republicans who have expressed<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> varying degrees of </span>skepticism about high-speed rail in the past.

===Contention 2 is The Economy=== 
====Rail is facing collapse—but the plan boosts competitiveness and creates growth—dedicated funding sources are key====

The rail systems in America offer traveler passage between our nation~’s most populated metropolitan centers
AND
and ultimately offer Americans transportation choices through a reinvigorated and improved rail industry.

====Talk about a recovery is wrong- the US economy is continuing to decline==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">EBENSTEIN DECEMBER 31st</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Lanny Ebenstein- professor of economics at UCSB. Fox News: "The current economic recovery is a fraud" http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/12/29/current-economic-recovery-is-fraud/</span>
Long term economic growth—and even growth in the short run—depends on an expanding labor force
AND
while the use of social services is increasing and real earnings are declining.

====We’ll isolate 3 internal links==== 
====First is stimulus—the plan boosts the economy in the short term and secures the long term—our models are better==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">MPI 10</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">—</span> economic think tank<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Martin Prosperity Institute at the U of Toronto~’s Rotman School of Management (date last cited, "High Speeds, High Costs, Hidden Benefits: A Broader Perspective on High-Speed Rail", Martin Prosperity Insights, [[http://martinprosperity.org/images/stories/jmc/cache/mpi-high-speeds-high-costs-hidden-benefits-a-broader-perspective-on-high-speed-rail.pdf-http://martinprosperity.org/images/stories/jmc/cache/mpi-high-speeds-high-costs-hidden-benefits-a-broader-perspective-on-high-speed-rail.pdf]], AL)</span>

Thus the benefits of high-speed rail are usually conceived as lowering costs and
AND
help(s) facilitate another wave of productivity-driven economic growth.
====The plan is uniquely key—other stimuli fail==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Tierney 12</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">—professor of geography at U of North Texas, PhD in geography from U of Denver, MA in geography from Arizona State University (Sean, 2/28/2012, "High-speed rail, the knowledge economy and the next growth wave", Journal of Transport Geography 22, p. 285-287, p. science direct, AL)</span>

For all the controversy surrounding the 2009 stimulus bill, one of its noteworthy flaws
AND
well suited to strengthen the competitive advantages of those places that are winning.

====Second is jobs - Investment in high speed rail spurs economic growth in multiple ways – empirical support and studies prove.====

High-speed rail~’s ability to promote economic growth is grounded in its capacity to
AND
This interactive process creates net economic gains in addition to<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span>other economic benefits<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> described here.</span>

====And, job creation is the biggest internal link to the economy—outweighs cutting the deficit==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Tyson 11</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">-Professor @ the Haas School of Business of UC-Berkeley, PhD in Economics @ MIT, BA Summa Cum Laude in Economics @ Smith College, former Chair of the US President~’s Council of Economic Advisers, served as the Director of the National Economic Council ~~[Laura, The Washington Post, "What it will take for President Obama and big business to bring back American jobs," 9/18/2011, [[http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/for-president-obama-and-american-business-fixing-the-us-jobs-deficit/2011/08/18/gIQAhW8ZNJ_story.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/for-president-obama-and-american-business-fixing-the-us-jobs-deficit/2011/08/18/gIQAhW8ZNJ_story.html]], DKP~~]</span>

The immediate crisis confronting the U.S. economy is the jobs deficit,
AND
create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs in the next few years
====And, high-speed rail is uniquely key to the growth of mega-regions—shortcomings in status quo transportation infrastructure stunt development.====

Building a modern passenger rail network will be a boost to America~’s economy. Besides
AND
rail needs to be a central focus of this new wave of investment.

====Economic decline triggers multiple scenarios for war- strong statistical support====

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.</span>

Almost as informative as the decline in warfare has been where this decline is occurring
AND
the consolidating forces of prosperity prevail, that war becomes a durable anachronism.

===Contention 3 is Climate Leadership=== 
====Reducing emissions now is key to prevent runaway warming====

In early 2007, at the time of the publication of WG1 of AR4
AND
next five to ten years, reaching near zero well within this century.

In a similar inversion of normal practice, most climate deniers avoid scrutiny by
AND
troubling ethical questions arise from examination of the public record surrounding contrarian papers.

There are many representatives who do not share Obama~’s enthusiasm for environmental issues

U.S. environmental leadership can still be the beacon it needs to be with a strong message from our lawmakers.

adaptation to these extremes would mean profound social, cultural and political changes.

Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as
AND
United States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet

===Thus the plan:=== 
====The United States federal government should increase its public-private partnership investment in high speed rail in the United States.====
