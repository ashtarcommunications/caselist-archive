Contention One is Hegemony
We’ll isolate two internal links:
1. First is aerospace – the U.S. aerospace industrial base is deteriorating – lack of funding and procurement hamstrings R&D

=1AC – Environment= 
Contention Two is the Environment
We’ll isolate two internal links:
1. First is warming – it’s anthropogenic – our evidence represents the scientific consensus

2. Runaway warming will make adaption impossible – emission cuts now are key

4. Independently, warming causes extinction
