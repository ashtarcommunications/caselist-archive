<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Daily explosions in Iraq, massacres in Sudan, the Koreas smakestaring at each other through artillery barrels, a Hobbesian war of all against all in eastern Congo--combat plagues human society as it has, perhaps, since our distant forebears realized that a tree limb could be used as a club. But here is something you would never guess from watching the news: War has entered a cycle of decline. Combat in Iraq and in a few other places is an exception to a significant global trend that has gone nearly unnoticed--namely that,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">for</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">about</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">15 years, there have been steadily fewer armed conflicts</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">worldwide</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">If major interstate war is predominantly a product of a synergy between a potential nondemocratic aggressor and an absence of effective deterrence, what is the role of the many traditional "causes" of war? Past, and many contemporary, theories of war have focused on the role of specific disputes between nations, ethnic and religious differences, arms races, poverty or social injustice, competition for resources, incidents and accidents, greed, fear, and perceptions of "honor," or many other such factors. Such factors may well play a role in motivating aggression or in serving as a means for generating fear and manipulating public opinion. The reality, however, is that while some of these may have more potential to contribute to war than others,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">there maywell be an infinite set of motivating factors, or human wants, motivating aggression.</span>
