**<span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"> Text: The United States federal government should substantially increase its civil space situational awareness by creating a Space Guard.</span>**

**<span style="color: red; font-size: 12pt;">Contention 1: Crisis Stability</span>**
**<span style="color: black;">US space assets are currently vulnerable-multiple different adversaries with different military doctrines invite attack</span>**
**<span style="color: black;">Rendleman, 10</span>**<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> - Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)</span>

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">"The 11 January 2007 test of a Chinese...robust enough to counter now 21st Century adversary attack capabilities."</span>

**<span style="color: black;">Only increasing SSA can reduce vulnerability – failure guarantees instability</span>**

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">"Our space assets are exposed and fragile...more frequent space collisions and growing instability in space."</span>

**<span style="color: black;">Increasing vulnerability creates first strike incentives that make escalation more probable</span>**

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">"One characteristic of too many wars...space instability seems high and likely to grow."</span>

**<span style="color: black;">This will cause crises to go nuclear</span>**

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">"One of the striking features of the outer space...what the judge said about pornography - the US will know it when it sees it."</span>

**<span style="color: black;">The US military isn’t trusted by international actors – only a Space Guard provides the balance of civil and military involvement necessary to foster SSA data sharing</span>**

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">"An organizational home for non-military SSA data functions...discussion and study of this concept is merited."</span>

**<span style="color: red; font-size: 12pt;">Contention 2: Space debris</span>**

**<span style="color: black;">First, All Qualified experts agree – Orbital debris is at the tipping point – failure to control it collapses our space assets</span>**
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">The Telegraph 11 (Heidi Blake, staffwriter, “Space so full of junk that a satellite collision could destroy communications on Earth,” February, pg online @ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/8295546/Space-so-full-of-junk-that-a-satellite-collision-could-destroy-communications-on-Earth.html) np</span>

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">"The volume of abandoned rockets...switch the television to watch the World Cup next month in Johannesburg."</span>

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">"Recent events have underscored the reality...distrustful of the USAF as a collaborative partner."</span>

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">"In the meantime, space actors must...ensure that no collisions happen."</span>

**<span style="color: black;">Without effective space debris control, US space assets which are crucial to US hegemony are put at risk</span>**
