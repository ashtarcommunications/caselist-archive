**Despite 84 % of the population living in metropolitan areas, federal support for mass transit infrastructure is declining, as funds continue to support highways and roads**

**This is part of a broader neoliberal re-structuring of the urban economy. Decreasing federal support forces localities to generate revenue through increased privatization of public goods.**

**Public transportation is a lynchpin of this neoliberal strategy-by controlling the movement and structure of the urban environment, privatized infrastructure exacerbates fragmentation and inequality.**

**This continued transfer of transportation from the public to the private is a form of accumulation by dispossession-it is a contraction of the democratic public sphere in the name of expanding private capital**

**The deregulation of public goods has led to the perpetual attack of democracy and has unleashed the dehumanizing armies of capitalism that allow neoliberalism to wage its war on the public**

==Plan== 

**The United States federal government should fully fund public development of fare-free public transit in all metropolitan areas in the United States.**


==Observation 2: Solvency== 

**The plan solves: free-fare transportation systems return mobility to the peoples as a public good. This improves all transportation infrastructure and opens up new spaces which can resist neoliberal control.**

**Free mass transit is the key to developing a broad-based anti-neoliberalism movement—rejecting commodification of public goods creates genuine political dialogues and offers concrete visions for how to transform material conditions of oppression for the poor.**

**Neoliberalism is entrenched in the political dialogue behind infrastructure resulting in a realignment of social and spatial relations and increasing the marginalization of the poor and dispossessed- Engaging in the discourse is key to unmasking the system**
