==CP Quarters of Greenhill vs. Westminster== 

**Text: The President of the United States should publically retract the July 2011 deadline for initiating troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and end the Washington Israel-Palestine summit. The United States federal government should end stop-loss of military personnel. The United States federal government should offer large cash bonuses to new recruits, substantially increase the number of its military recruiters, and increase the pay of troops and provide necessary support to deployed troops. The United States federal government should implement a “bottom-up” district-level strategy as detailed in our Clukey evidence.**
