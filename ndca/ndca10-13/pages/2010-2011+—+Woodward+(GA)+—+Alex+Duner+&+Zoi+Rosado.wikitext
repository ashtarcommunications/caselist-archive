We have debated together at various points over the year but have not compiled a comprehensive wiki page. For cites and off case positions see Woodward SS's wiki page [[2010-2011 — Woodward (GA) — Rahim Shakoor & Jason Sigalos|here]]; it should have all of the off case positions that we have read as a team over the course of the season.

==1AC for the UGA Tournament== 
===The Plan=== 
**We begin with the plan:**
The United States federal government should draw down the population-centric counterinsurgency presence of its military in Afghanistan to 68,000 or less troops conducting counterterrorism operations by October 2011 and 30,000 or less troops conducting counterterrorism operations by July 2012.
We’ll clarify.

===Contention 1—The Status Quo=== 
__<span style="line-height: 0px; overflow: hidden;">**﻿**</span>__**First, we’re not buying what the Obama Administration is selling: the war in Afghanistan is a colossal failure and evidence to the contrary is military fiction.**

Michael A. **Cohen**, former Senior Research Fellow at the New America Foundation, B.A. in International Relations from American University and M.A. in International Relations from Columbia University, served in the Department of State as chief speechwriter for U.S. Representative to the United Nations Bill Richardson and Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, currently serves on the board of the National Security Network and has taught at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, **12-29-2010** (“The White House's Growing 'Credibility Gap' on Afghanistan,” Democracy Arsenal—an international relations blog published by the Center for American Progress and the Century Foundation's Security and Peace Initiative, December 29th, Available Online at http://progressiverealist.org/blogpost/white-houses-growing-credibility-gap-afghanistan, Accessed 01-03-2011)
//A couple of months ago I wrote an article for Foreign Policy that argued only the US military is optimistic about the situation in Afghanistan…To be blunt, it's becoming increasingly difficult to take anything the White House or the military says about the war in Afghanistan seriously.//

===Contention 2—Military Power=== 

**The counterinsurgency mission in Afghanistan is undermining the strength of U.S. military power—we’ll introduce several internal links.**

**First, dogmatic commitment to COIN creates an expectations gap and ensures serial policy failure.**
Gian P. **Gentile**, Assistant Professor of History and Director of the Military History Program at the United States Military Academy, Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army who has served two tours of duty in Iraq, Visiting Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, **2010** (“Freeing the Army from the Counterinsurgency Straightjacket,” Joint Force Quarterly, Issue 58, July, Available Online at http://ndu.edu/press/counterinsurgency-straightjacket.html, Accessed 08-31-2010)
//Carl von Clausewitz said that a center of gravity is something to be discovered, and it could vary depending on the aims of the war being fought…Perhaps the Army needs to find the time to do it now.//

**Second, COIN operations in Afghanistan have crippled overall readiness by eliminating training exercises, crowding out preparation for major conflicts, impoverishing equipment inventories, and depleting U.S. strategic reserves.**
David **Wood**, Chief Military Correspondent for Politics Daily, has worked as a war reporter for 30 years, was named a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his reporting on conflict, national security, and foreign affairs, has won the Gerald Ford Prize for Distinguished Reporting on National Defense and the Headliners Club award for his reporting on Iraq, has lectured at the Marine Staff College, the Joint Forces Staff College, and the Army's Eisenhower Fellows conference, **12-27-2010** (“Busy With Afghanistan, the U.S. Military Has No Time to Train for Big Wars,” Politics Daily, December 27th, Available Online at http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/12/27/busy-with-afghanistan-the-u-s-military-has-no-time-to-train-fo/print/, Accessed 01-03-2011)
//The painful story of Task Force Smith is once again being told amid growing anxiety that the United States is so focused on today's missions that it has neglected to prepare for what may come next...Senior Marine officers often lament that a decade into counterinsurgency operations, the Corps has midcareer officers and non-commissioned officers who have never been on a ship, let alone learned the complex art of amphibious operations, the Marines' central mission.//

**Third, COIN narrows the gap between the U.S. and its peer competitors—this negates the benefits of strong military power.**
Bernard I. **Finel**, Professor of Military Strategy and Operations at the U.S. National War College, former Executive Director of the Security Studies Program and the Center for Peace and Security Studies at Georgetown University, **2010** (“An alternative to COIN,” Armed Forces Journal, February, Available Online at http://www.afji.com/2010/02/4387134, Accessed 10-12-2010)
//The U.S. military is a dominant fighting force, capable of rapid global power projection and able to defeat state adversaries quickly and at relatively low cost in American lives and treasure…Asymmetric “threats” are self-limited and should be largely ignored, and by doing so, the U.S. could free itself to apply military power more effectively in the types of conflict where American forces excel.//


**The impact is the breakdown of the international system—only a strong U.S. military can deter hostile global rivals and prevent global conflict.**
Alvin S. **Felzenberg**, Professorial Lecturer at The Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University, Presidential Historian and Adjunct Faculty Member at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, former Fellow at the Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, served as Principal Spokesman for the 9/11 Commission, holds a Ph.D. in Politics from Princeton University, **and** Alexander B. **Gray**, Student at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University and the War Studies Department of King’s College, London, **01-03-2011** (“The New Isolationism,” The National Review, January 3rd, Available Online at http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/print/256150, Accessed 01-03-2011)
//Anything Reps. Ron Paul (R., Tex.) and Barney Frank (D., Mass.) both support should give the rest of us pause…Congress and the president would do well to reflect on those lessons and remember their duty to provide a dominant American military presence on land, at sea, and in the air.//

**A strong military is crucial to spur the international cooperation needed to address emerging threats—failure to do so makes global conflict inevitable.**
**The Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel**—a bipartisan congressional panel charged with conducting an assessment of the assumptions, strategy, findings, and risks described in the Department of Defense’s Quadrennial Defense Review, **2010** (“The QDR in Perspective: Meeting America’s National Security Needs In the 21st Century,” The Final Report of the Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel, Released on July 29th, Available Online at http://www.usip.org/files/qdr/qdrreport.pdf, Accessed 11-12-2010, p. 28-29)
//These five trends frame a range of choices for U.S. government and Department of Defense planners…It will simply lead to an increasingly unstable and [end page 28] unfriendly global climate and, eventually, to conflicts America cannot ignore, which we must prosecute with limited choices under unfavorable circumstances—and with stakes that are higher than anyone would like.//

**Prioritize this impact—great power conflict is the only existential risk.**
Paul K. **Chisholm**, foreign policy and international relations scholar based in Kenya, holds a University Degree in Sociology and Diploma in Human Resources, **2005** (“Terrorism, the Threat in Perspective and Great Power Conflict,” Free World Syndicate, April, Available Online at http://www.synd.org/opinion-columns-chisholm/terrorism.html, Accessed 09-08-2010)
//We've heard much about terrorism since the 9/11 attacks…Diplomacy should be redirected to head off a full scale arms race and potential conflicts between nuclear parties.//

**And, the plan is vital to reorient U.S. foreign and defense policy—a drawdown in Afghanistan will shore up American power.**
Richard N. **Haass**, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, **12-30-2010** (“Endgames in Iraq and Afghanistan,” The Japan Times, December 30th, Available Online at http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20101230a2.html, Accessed 01-03-2011)
//And it is difficult to be optimistic about Afghanistan, given the Taliban's resilience, the weakness and corruption that plague the government, and the reality that Pakistan will continue to be a sanctuary for the Taliban and other armed groups seeking to gain a foothold (or more) in Afghanistan…There is now an opportunity to reorient American foreign policy to concentrate on what matters most. It is in the interest of the U.S. and the world that this opportunity not be missed.//

**Finally, the plan is the best way to maintain American hegemony—it maximizes deterrence while abandoning foolish and ineffective adventurism.**
Christopher **Layne**, Associate Professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University and Research Fellow with the Center on Peace and Liberty at The Independent Institute, **2006** (“America cannot rely on power alone,” Financial Times, August 24th, Available Online at http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f7bb5fb2-330c-11db-87ac-0000779e2340.html, Accessed 04-12-2007)
//Hegemony, however, is not omnipotence…If the US is to be perceived as powerful rather than powerless, it must refrain from intervening abroad in pursuit of unrealisable goals, and will have to learn that the intricacies of international politics cannot be reduced to a simplistic Manichean struggle between good and evil.//

**And, the plan avoids all disadvantages to precipitous withdrawal—our “Counterterrorism Plus” approach doesn’t cut and run and bolsters the fight against al Qaeda.**
C. Christine **Fair**, an assistant professor at Georgetown University and the author of Cuisines of the Axis of Evil and Other Irritating States, **1-11-2011** (“False choices in Afghanistan”, January 11th, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/11/false_choices_in_afghanistan]]</span>)
//Advocates of the current U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan deploy false choices and flawed assumptions to defend the status quo. …He wants the COIN campaign to end, but he needs U.S. assistance, fears al-Qaeda, and resents the sanctuaries in Pakistan.//
