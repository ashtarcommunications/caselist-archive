Coming out of a steep recession, <span class="TitleChar">the economy should be experiencing robust output</span>, or GDP, growth. Output growth of 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 helped bring the unemployment rate down. <span class="TitleChar">However</span>, the government's announcement that output <span class="TitleChar">growth fell to 2.2</span> percent in the first quarter of 2012 should give policy makers pause. <span class="TitleChar">The economy </span>//needs to grow//<span class="TitleChar"> by at least 2.5 percent just to keep unemployment from rising</span>. Thus <span class="TitleChar">this latest figure</span> on GDP growth <span class="TitleChar">does not auger well for the job market,</span> which has seen a steady rise over the last few weeks in initial unemployment claims. In the face of weaker demand, Investment <span class="TitleChar">spending by business is slowing. Cutbacks in government spending</span> at the federal as well as state and local levels <span class="TitleChar">are already hurting</span> GDP <span class="TitleChar">growth</span>. In the absence of federal revenue sharing with the states--the first time the federal government has not had such a program when unemployment is above 7 percent--state and local government expenditures have fallen for seven consecutive quarters. [See a collection of political cartoons on the economy.] <span class="TitleChar">With the U.S. economy slowing and job growth still </span>//very weak//<span class="TitleChar">, what should the government do? Continued calls for government belt tightening, fiscal consolidation, and austerity are out-of-step with economic realities.

There is, however, the distinct possibility that the United States can end up like the United Kingdom</span>. [Read: Government Economic Intervention Made America Great.] Almost two years ago the U.K. put in place a coalition government led by George Osborne that implemented an austerity program that cut government spending and public services and was supposed to give British businesses the confidence to invest and boost economic growth. The outcome has fallen far short of these expectations. The U.K. is experiencing the slowest growth in a century, with GDP still 4.3 percent below its peak reached four years ago. Output has grown just 0.4 percent in two years under the Osborne government, and now--with two back-to-back quarters of declining GDP--the British economy has officially slipped back into a double-dip recession. Confidence has not returned to U.K. businesses; indeed lending to businesses fell sharply in March despite the fact that banks had cash available to lend out. Meanwhile, the toll on the British people as government services are cut has become more severe. The charitable trust that operates a network of food banks in the United Kingdom reported that the number of people turning to food banks to feed themselves and their children doubled over the past 12 months. The <span class="TitleChar">wounds to the U.K. economy are self-imposed</span>. Unlike Greece or Spain, the United Kingdom did not come under pressure from the E.U. Neither was there pressure from the bond markets; interest rates and borrowing costs were quite low. <span class="TitleChar">British politicians chose to slash spending and impose austerity</span> on the British economy. <span class="TitleChar">The lesson should not be lost on America's political leaders</span>. Like the United Kingdom, <span class="TitleChar">the United States has control over its economic policies. It </span>//should not choose//<span class="TitleChar"> austerity</span>.</span>

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">The ports' argument that more money needs to be spent on dredging to create jobs and boost trade also is gaining traction on the front line of congressional funding allocations</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">Under the latest House energy and water appropriations bill, ports in fiscal 2013 would get $1 billion for maintenance dredging. That's the largest single annual federal award for dredging and about $170 million more than the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers received last time around. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">"This is a significant development. It wasn't so long ago that (the corps) only received $750 million," said Paul Bea, principal of PHB Public Affairs, a maritime consulting firm. </span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">Ports will actually get less dredging help in the next fiscal year</span></span>__<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";"> than in fiscal 2012</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">however</span></span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">, said Barry Holliday, executive director of Dredging Contractors of America. Funding tied to military project dredging and disaster relief pushed total maintenance dollars to about $1.1 billion in fiscal 2012.</span> __<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">The latest appropriation shows a congressional willingness to spend more, even if the full allocation of HMTF dollars would fall short in tackling port needs</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">, </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">Holliday said. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The Realize America's Maritime Promise Act, or RAMP Act, has been the major driver in convincing Congress the HMTF needs reform and more spending is needed. The legislation was included in the House's 90-day extension, which paved the way for the chamber to begin conferencing with the Senate on the surface transportation bill. The Senate has similar but less forceful language in its two-year, $109 billion plan. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">This boosts the chances that HMTF reform language will make it in the final version of the transportation bill, but it's just the first step in blocking appropriators from shifting money out of the fund for non-dredging purposes. Even if the RAMP Act language is adopted, it's not a mandate. Supporters would have to call a point of order in appropriation committees to slap the hands of would-be siphoners, Bea said. </span>
__<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">Despite the positive signs for <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">ports</span>, they <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are still stifled in getting authorization and funding for </span></span>__//<span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; mso-highlight: yellow;">new</span>//__<span style="background: yellow; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-highlight: yellow;"> major navigation projects</span>____<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">. </span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">Historically, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the Water Resources Development Act has been the vehicle for ports to get authorization for such projects</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">, and funding is granted separately through the annual appropriations process. The last WRDA was in 2007, and </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is no new version on the horizon</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">. Even if there were, it's unclear how it would proceed under the House's ban on earmarks and the Senate's similar stance. Not only do the earmarks allow legislators to include language relating to their home ports, but they also provide impetus for representatives and senators to back the bill. </span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">The federal uncertainty hits the East Coast particularly hard, because only a few ports have the funding and approval necessary to deepen their channels. Ports</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">such as Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">need deeper harbors to handle larger ships able to pass through the expanded Panama Canal in 2015</span></span>__<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">.</span>__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">That supporters of Charleston and Savannah are preparing to take on the deepening expenses themselves reflects just how little optimism there is for federal help. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">Bea said maritime advocates and legislators are attempting to figure out how they can get projects funded and authorized in new ways. One such approach is by Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., to create a national assessment of which ports should be deepened. Plans to create a program for prioritization in authorization and funding come with their own set of problems, however, Holliday said. "When you start prioritizing ports, you begin picking winners and losers," he said. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">Aside from skepticism of the government's ability to discern champions from laggards,</span> __<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">prioritization sidesteps the issue </span>__that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">most, if not all, ports need funding to maintain their infrastructure and grow. Such a prioritization process could dampen efforts to boost overall port spending</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman";">. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">That could, unfortunately, fit too well with Congress's history of favoring easy short-term fixes over harder, more meaningful long-term decisions. </span>

<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Since the birth of our nation, U.S. seaports and waterways that connect them have served as a vital economic lifeline by bringing goods and services to people around the world and by delivering prosperity to our nation.</span> U.S. seaports are responsible for moving more than 99 percent of our country’s overseas cargo. Today, international trade accounts for more than a quarter of Americas Gross Domestic Product. Americas seaports support the employment of 13.3 million U.S. workers, and seaport- related jobs account for $649 billion in annual personal income. For every $1 billion in exports shipped through seaports, 15,000 U.S. jobs are created. Seaports facilitate trade and commerce, create jobs, help secure our borders, support our military and serve as stewards of valuable coastal environmental resources.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Ports are dynamic, vibrant centers of trade and commerce, but what is most important to understand is that seaports rely on partnerships. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">Seaports invest more than $2.5 billion every year to maintain and improve their infrastructure</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. In recent years, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">however, this commitment has not been adequately matched by the federal government</span></span><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">Federal funding for dredging federal navigation channels has slowed and decreased, </span></span>//<span style="background: aqua; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; mso-highlight: aqua;">especially for new construction</span>//<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Further, maintenance dredging is sorely underfunded, despite a more than $6 billion and growing surplus in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. Landside improvements have also been too low a priority, with little of the highway funds going to freight transportation projects. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The only bright light has been the newly created TIGER grants, although not enough of this funding benefited ports</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Virginia Port Authority received a TIGER grant for its heartland project. As we look to the future, we do know that there are challenges and opportunities. As we recover from this economic downturn, we must make investments today to address the trade realities of the future. Here are some the challenges and we have to ask: are we ready?</span>

And many of the goods used by this population will flow through seaports.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">So are we ready? </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">While ports are planning for the future, the federal government has not kept pace with the industry or our international competitors</span></span><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">The federal government has a unique Constitutional responsibility to maintain and improve the infrastructure that enables the flow of commerce</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, and much of that infrastructure in and around seaports have been neglected for too long. Many of our land and water connections are insufficient and outdated, affecting the ports' ability to move cargo efficiently into and out of the U.S. This hurts U.S. business, hurts U.S. workers and hurts our national economy. Port projects take decades to plan and build and we cannot wait. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">Federal investments in seaports are</span> an <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">essential and effective</span> utilization of limited resources</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, paying dividends through increased trade and commerce, long-term job creation, secure borders, military support, environmental stewardship, and more than $200 billion in federal, state and local tax revenue. Earlier this month, the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness made an urgent plea for improvements in the nation's transportation infrastructure, including landside and waterside access to seaports. We cannot wait. </span>

<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Just like the nation itself, </span>__our maritime industry is facing a multitude of challenges__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> like flooding in the Midwest, silting of our major shipping arteries, and the need for recapitalization for our lock and dam infrastructure, to name a few. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">But </span>__these challenges and the solutions to them must be viewed as investments in the future of our nation itself because <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">without a strong, reliable marine transportation industry, we simply cannot competitively sell our export products in the world marketplace. </span>__//<span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; mso-highlight: yellow;">Those countries that buy from America do so because we are a dependable supplier of products at a competitive price</span>//__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">thanks</span></span>__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">in no small part </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> the existence of </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">our enviable transportation system.</span></span>__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> If that system becomes compromised, those </span>__//<span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; mso-highlight: yellow;">foreign buyers will simply shop elsewhere</span>//__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> and that will further impact the</span> U__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">tates' </span>__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">precarious economic recovery</span>.__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Witness the dredging situation on the Lower Mississippi River. This year, we have seen unprecedented levels of high water on the Mississippi River carrying millions of tons of silt and debris to the mouth of the River. This silting has resulted in restrictions being imposed for ships and vessels that rely on this passageway to export products to the world market, as well as import goods competitively, via ports in south Louisiana. In the past the Corps of Engineers has been able to manage silting issues with funding for dredging that sometimes required the reprogramming of funds to be sure shortfalls did not occur. </span><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">This year the Corps has said it can no longer reprogram funds and that a funding shortfall indeed exists on this vital part of the system. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Throughout this country's great history</span>__, the federal government's role is in part to ensure that the inland navigation system__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, including the Mississippi River, </span>__remains open to transport products such as grain, coal, steel, petroleum and aggregate materials. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The federal government now needs to take necessary steps to provide funding</span> for our national transportation asset__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and to allow the Lower Mississippi River </span>__to remain fully open for commerce__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. We urge the White House to immediately submit an emergency request for supplemental funds to Congress, and we ask that Congress expeditiously process that request for Emergency Supplemental Appropriations funding. All of us who are responsible for managing money have faced times when cutting costs have become necessary, yet those who are successful rarely focus on reducing costs if it results in an even greater loss in the revenue stream. Again, dredging this critical artery should be viewed as an investment, not a cost, in the future of our inland waterways transportation system.</span>

====Seaport competitiveness is the vital internal link to US economic growth – seaports represent a quarter of US GDP and contribute __over 3 trillion__ to the economy==== 
**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Nagle, 11</span>** --- president and chief executive officer of the American Association of Port Authorities (December 2011, Kurt, Industry Today, “Association: American Association of Port Authorities; Port-Related Infrastructure Investments Can Reap Dividends,” vol. 14, no. 3, [[@http://www.industrytoday.com/article_view.asp?ArticleID=F370]])
It seems <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">willingly allows infrastructure to crumble as other countries – particularly the BRICs – bolster the physical support systems that foster economic growth</span>. The American Association of Port Authorities is concerned over the state of America’s aged transportation infrastructure so it’s urging investments in both landside and waterside connections with ports.
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">The burning question</span></span> on the mind of many US lawmakers, administration officials and others <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">is how best to stimulate the economy and spur job creation</span></span><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The answer lies in focusing scarce federal resources in areas that will have the greatest impact on economic growth, immediate and long-term job creation, national security, and our current and future competitiveness in the global economy</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Enhancements in seaport-related infrastructure should be a high priority</span></span> among the limited investment options.
For centuries, US seaports – and the connecting waterways – have served as a vital economic lifeline, bringing goods and services to people around the world and delivering prosperity to our nation. They facilitate trade and commerce, create jobs, secure our borders, support our military and serve as stewards of valuable coastal environmental resources.
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">Seaports are the primary gateway for overseas trade. They’re essential to economic security</span></span>. As such<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">federal funding for infrastructure in and around ports pays dividends</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Deep-draft coastal and Great Lakes ports are the nexus of critical transportation infrastructure that connects America’s exporters with markets overseas</span></span>, and they provide access for imports of raw materials, components and consumer goods that are a key part of US manufacturing and help define our standard of living.
Investments in America’s port infrastructure and the intermodal connections that serve seaports – both land and waterside – foster prosperity and provide an opportunity to bolster the country’s economic and employment recovery.
ECONOMIC IMPACT: HUGE
Currently, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">international trade accounts for more than a quarter of America’s GDP</span></span> (gross domestic product). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">Oceangoing vessels that load and unload cargo at US seaports move 99.4 percent of the nation’s overseas trade</span></span> by volume and 65.5 percent by value. Further, customs collections from seaport cargo provide tens of billions of dollars a year to the federal government, including $23.2 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2007, $24.1 billion in FY 2008, $20.3 billion in FY 2009 and $22.5 billion in FY 2010.
The latest economic impacts analyses conducted in 2007 indicated that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">US seaport activities generated $3.15 trillion</span> in annual economic output, with $3.8 billion worth of goods moving in and out of seaports every day. Impact extends far beyond seaport communities. On average, any given state uses the services of 15 different ports around the country to handle its imports and exports. Also, seaports are a proven job creator.
In addition to handling international trade, US seaports – and the waterways that serve them – represent important transportation modes for the movement of domestic freight. Greater utilization of America’s coastal and inland water routes for freight transportation complements other surface transportation modes – providing a safe and secure alternative for cargo while offering significant energy savings and traffic congestion relief.
VIEW FROM WATERSIDE
As US investment in its waterways infrastructure is trending downward, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">countries like India, Brazil and the U</span></span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">K</span></span>ingdom <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">commit the equivalent of billions of US dollars to port and channel modernization. The expansion of the Panama Canal</span> slated for completion in 2014</span> – the first major expansion in more than a century – <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">is driving ports around the world to deepen navigation channels and improve harbor facilities</span>.</span> Look at what’s happening:
India plans to invest $60 billion – including both public and private funds – to create seven new major ports by 2020. Expect this to have a substantial impact: It will handle the anticipated rapid expansion of merchandise exports, forecasted to triple by 2017.
Brazil expects tonnage at its coastal ports to more than double (to 1.7 billion tons) by 2022. In response, the nation is committing $17 billion to port improvements (including $14 billion from the private sector).
In Great Britain, DP World (the world’s fourth-largest marine terminal operator) plans to spend $2.5 billion on London’s Deep-Water Gateway, the country’s first such development in the last 20 years.
Meanwhile, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">public funding for new navigation channel improvements has all but dried up</span>. Lawmakers focus on reducing the deficit and eliminating appropriation “earmarks” that have traditionally funded federal navigation deepening projects. At the same time, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">funding for projects already approved and underway is slow, incremental and insufficient</span>.
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Insufficient appropriations make it impossible to maintain most federal navigation channels at their authorized and required dimensions</span>. The US Army Corps of Engineers has been commissioned with the responsibility of improving and maintaining the nation’s water access to ports. But while this charge comes from the US government, the federal government is less than supportive. It spends only about half of the tax that it collects specifically directed toward deep-draft channel maintenance. The rest – more than $6 billion since 1986 – has essentially been “disappeared” into the US Treasury while serious dredging needs remain neglected.
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This is unfortunate at a crucial juncture. <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">Projects to maintain these critical waterways would create jobs immediately</span></span><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;"> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and would provide transportation savings to benefit US businesses</span></span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">With decreases in the cost of freight transportation, these sectors can enhance their global competitiveness and create more jobs</span></span>. The American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) has continually and strongly urged Congress to take action to ensure that 100-percent of the annual amount collected from the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is utilized to maintain federal navigation channels.

<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">America´s deep-draft navigation system is at a crossroads, with a future that can be bright or bleak. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Our waterways</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">´ ability to support the Nation?s continuing growth in trade and in the defense of our Nation, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">hinges on much-needed Federal attention to unresolved funding needs that are derailing critical channel maintenance and deep-draft construction projects of the water highways to our ports</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Because most ports do not have naturally deep harbors, they must be regularly dredged to allow ships to move safely through Federal navigation channels</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Also, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as modern vessels increase in size, navigation channel depths must increase accordingly</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if we are to continue to be a player on the international marketplace</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. A recent U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study reports that almost 30 percent of the 95, 550 vessel calls at U.S. ports are constrained due to inadequate channel depths. Ladies and gentlemen, these are the things that cause port directors nightmares.</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Without a channel dredged to its authorized depth</span>//, nothing else comes into play//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Attracting new customers, dealing with labor issues, environmental concerns, and the public - all go away - because <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">without a properly-dredged channel, business goes away</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Public ports are at a critical state in keeping their channels open for business. <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">We are losing existing business</span> and potential new business to ports outside of the U</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">nited </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">tates ? and once lost, it is rarely regained. </span>
//<span style="background: aqua; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; mso-highlight: aqua;">Dredging can literally make or break our industry</span>//<span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">and a lack of dredging is an issue throughout the U</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">nited </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">S</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">tates. In fact, it is not an overstatement to say that in many parts of the United States, we face a dredging crisis. On the Great Lakes, as Chairman James L. Oberstar of this Committee and Chairman David R. Obey of the Appropriations Committee well know, decades of inadequate funding for dredging have left a backlog of 18 million cubic yards of sediment. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates removing the backlog will cost more than $230 million on the Great Lakes alone. In some cases, ports on the Great Lakes have actually shutdown due to inadequate dredging. There are similar examples of dredging problems in ports and harbors on all coasts of our Nation. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">In many cases, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">vessels must</span></span><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;"> ?</span>//<span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">load light</span>//<span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">? </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">because of dredging shortfalls</span></span><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">The economic implications of light loading are enormous</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. On the Great Lakes, for example, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">vessels lose between 50 to 270 tons of cargo for each inch they must reduce their draft</span> a</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">nd, in some areas, the lost draft is measured in feet, not inches. Light loading because of inadequate dredging impacts everyone. A ship that is light-loaded reduces its efficiencies in the same way that a commercial airplane that is required to set aside seats with no passengers would quickly lose its efficiencies. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The Harbor Maintenance Tax and the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund were established in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1986. The Trust Fund (HMTF) applies a 0.125 percent ad valorem tax on the value of commercial cargo loaded or unloaded on vessels using Federally-maintained channels. The tax is only assessed on imports and domestic cargo, as it was ruled as an unconstitutional assessment on exports in a 1998 Supreme Court ruling. This Fund - that you, members of Congress - established, was authorized to be utilized to recover 100 percent of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers eligible Operations and Maintenance (O&M) expenditures for commercial navigation, along with 100 percent of the O&M cost of the St. Lawrence Seaway, certain costs of NOAA, and the costs to Customs to collect the tax. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Fixing the Problem</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Ladies and gentleman - would it surprise you to know that this utilization has not been honored? HMTF revenues exceed transfers for authorized activities by an increasing margin. Yet, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">our Federal channels are not being maintained at authorized depths</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The Fund is being held hostage to paper balance the budget - interestingly, not one of its legal uses. In 2007, the HMTF began with a $3.3 billion surplus and collected an additional $1.4 billion - resulting in a $4.7 billion surplus, while only $751 million was utilized for maintenance dredging. That is incredible. I would ask that you consider this analogy offered by my colleague in a Gulf Coast port: "What would you say to a toll booth operator who took your money to use the toll road only to then tell you that the road was unusable?"? </span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">That is what is happening to shippers who pay this tax every day. We must solve this problem. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">We must draft legislation that mandates that the Fund be utilized for its intended purpose - the maintenance dredging of Federal ports and harbors</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. There are a number of ways to address this problem. As you know, other modes of transportation - surface transportation and aviation ? have faced similar problems in the past decade. Although we are in the early stages of addressing this problem, our Coalition believes Congress should consider an approach similar to that taken with the Highway Trust Fund in 1998 and with the Airport and Airway Trust Fund in 2000. In those cases, Congress legislatively enacted "firewalls" around the Trust Funds ? essentially guaranteeing minimum levels of spending that could only be used to support eligible projects. Although there are some variations between the Highway, Aviation, and Harbor Maintenance Trust, the point of a firewall in each case is the same - ensuring that monies from a tax would be used for their intended purpose and not merely for deficit reduction.</span>

The continuation of these two trends could lead to a shift from American primacy toward a multi-polar global system, leading in turn to increased geopolitical rivalry and even war among the great powers</span></span><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The current recession is the result of a deep </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">[[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/259024/economy-and-national-security-zalmay-khalilzad|financial crisis]]</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, not a mere fluctuation in the business cycle. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Recovery is likely to be protracted</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The crisis was preceded by the buildup over two decades of enormous amounts of debt throughout the U.S. economy — ultimately totaling almost 350 percent of GDP — and the development of credit-fueled asset bubbles, particularly in the housing sector. When the bubbles burst, huge amounts of wealth were destroyed, and unemployment rose to over 10 percent. The decline of tax revenues and massive countercyclical spending put the U.S. government on an unsustainable fiscal path. Publicly held national debt rose from 38 to over 60 percent of GDP in three years.</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Without faster economic growth</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and actions to reduce deficits, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">publicly held national debt is projected to reach dangerous proportions</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. If interest rates were to rise significantly, annual </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">[[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/259024/economy-and-national-security-zalmay-khalilzad|interest payments]]</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> — which already are larger than the defense budget — would crowd out other spending or require substantial </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">[[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/259024/economy-and-national-security-zalmay-khalilzad|tax increases]]</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> that would undercut economic growth. Even worse, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if unanticipated events trigger what economists call a “sudden stop” in credit markets for U.S. debt, the U</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">nited </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">tates </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would be unable to roll over its outstanding obligations, precipitating a sovereign-debt crisis that would almost certainly compel a radical retrenchment</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> of the United States </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">internationally.</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">Such scenarios would reshape the international order. It was the economic devastation of Britain and France during World War II</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, as well as the rise of other powers, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">that led both countries to relinquish their empires</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. In the late 1960s, British leaders concluded that they lacked the economic capacity to maintain a presence “east of Suez.” Soviet economic weakness, which crystallized under Gorbachev, contributed to their decisions to withdraw from Afghanistan, abandon Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, and allow the Soviet Union to fragment. If the U.S. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">[[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/259024/economy-and-national-security-zalmay-khalilzad|debt problem]]</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> goes critical, the United States would be compelled to retrench, reducing its military spending and shedding international commitments.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">We face this domestic challenge while other major powers are experiencing rapid economic growth. Even though </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">countries</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> such as China, India, and Brazil have profound political, social, demographic, and economic problems, their </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: aqua; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">economies are growing faster than ours, and this could alter the global distribution of power.

__The__ emergence of shale gas has caused __natural gas prices in North America to drop to the lowest levels seen in decades__.

As recently as 2007, __North America was looking at a significant gas shortage and more than sixty LNG import projects were proposed__. Just five years later, the implementation of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has led North America to a sizable excess of gas supply. __The latest <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">figures from the</span> U.S.__ [[http://www.forbes.com/energy/|Energy]] Information Agency (//<span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; mso-highlight: yellow;">EIA) indicate that natural gas supply could exceed demand by 2016</span>////<span style="font-family: "Georgia","serif";">, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">enabling North America to become a net exporter of LNG</span>. </span>//__The rapid increase in natural gas production has had a substantial impact on gas pricing in North America__. While gas prices in North America are not directly correlated to oil prices, up until late 2008, natural gas prices generally matched oil price trends. Since the increase in shale gas production was first identified in Navigant’s groundbreaking North American Natural Gas Supply Assessment in 2008, natural gas prices have headed downwards from $5.00 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) to approximately $2.50 per mmBtu in May 2012. However,//<span style="font-family: "Georgia","serif";"> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">although natural gas prices decreased, crude oil prices increased</span> during the same period.</span>// While the EIA indicates that long term North American natural gas prices will rise to $4.00 to $6.00 per mmBtu, natural gas will continue to trade at a sizable discount to oil on an energy equivalent basis.

As long-time China watchers know, these fears are central to understanding China's policies.__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Herberg made this point in his testimony when he stated, "</span>__For a regime that increasingly stakes its political right to rule on economic performance and living standard, the threat of economic stagnation could threaten the continued political monopoly of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)."__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Herberg's USCC testimony pointed out what he calls </span>__China's "energy nationalism__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">"; namely, as he describes it, "an energy version of economic nationalism and mercantilism prevalent in Asia". He believes that China's fears - one he suggests are shared by other regional players who have similar concerns about access to oil and natural gas - are critical to understand why China acts as it does in pursuit of natural resources internationally. Beyond how China's rapid modernization impacts the world's supply of natural resources, </span>__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Beijing's efforts to</span> not only <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">secure supply</span> but ensure safety during transportation into the country <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are making waves in the South China Sea</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.

According to Dr Economy, "More than 40 mid- to large-sized cities in Northern China, such as Beijing and Tianjin, boast crisis-level water shortages." Water shortages due to depletion are not the only problem. As she shared last week, "over 90% of groundwater [in China] is polluted by urban sewage, refuse and industrial waste." This means that, according to research by Jon Bowermaster that Dr Economy referenced, "estimates are that 400,000 people are driven from their homes annually as a result of lack of water". As with many challenges the Chinese government must face, this is another that poses a threat to the country's social stability. In many ways, China's pursuit of each of these natural resources is understandable and should be seen as an inevitable outgrowth of the massive economic gains experienced across the country over the last several decades. The US Congress has at least three fears, as evidenced by last week's hearing. First, whether China can be convinced to join the developed West in ostracizing countries like Iran specifically, or whether China's pursuit of natural resources will take precedent. Second, Washington fears that China's model for obtaining natural resources through its national oil companies (NOC) and their "go-out" strategy may be locking up resources to which Western countries will also need access. Because the NOC approach is built on a state-to-state relationship, in many cases it prevents private operators in the West from competing. China can, and has, brought to bear more than a simple commercial transaction for oil; rather, the NOC can weave together government-sponsored loans, infrastructure projects and other amenities to convince a foreign government to work with China. Washington thus far does not have a good answer to this. Third, and perhaps most pernicious, is Washington's fear that </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">China's pursuit of natural resources will destabilize the region</span>__</span>**__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">,</span> whether intentionally or accidentally. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">This fear might be made real by a **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">military confrontation in the crowded South China Sea</span>**</span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">, where multiple borders and territorial disputes still exist, or</span>** this fear could be realized **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">if China's modernization causes it to damn waterways</span>** that nourish the many river deltas throughout Southeast Asia.__

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The region has become a source of renewed interstate rivalries because the issue has become closely associated with</span> interrelated <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">issues of energy</span>, territorial, maritime and military security. Every claimant in the SCS has started strengthening their civilian and military presence</span> in their occupied areas to establish their presence and thereby strengthen their sovereign claims. Claimants have also increased building infrastructure and other developments in their occupied areas to affirm their claims. Cumulatively, these factors have augmented the maritime dilemma of powers involved in the dispute. <span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶ </span>Recently, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">there have been massive defense acquisitions by the Southeast Asian countries. Vietnam</span>,</span> which is hardly known for its naval prowess, talked about its maritime traditions. During the fiftieth anniversary of the Ho Chi Mihn Trail they talked about their maritime tradition. They also displayed models of vessels purchased from Russia along with the romanticized poster depicting a steely-eyed sailor with a bayonet poised to defend the Spratlys (Economic Times, 2011). It already <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">has 2 Gepard class frigates</span> from Russia.</span> In October 2009 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Malaysia acquired 2 Scorpene Class submarines</span></span> to strengthen its capability to guard its waters (Defence Industry Daily, 2012<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">). <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Indonesia is</span> also <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">planning to construct 12 additional submarines</span></span> by 2024 and considering the Chanbogo Class submarines from South Korea or Kilo Class submarines from Russia. Unlike Malaysia or Vietnam, the Philippines military does not possess any real capability to fight in the disputed area. The Philippines relies on the Mutual Defense Treaty with the US to protect Filipino interests in the area (Snyder, 2004). <span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">These nations are no equivalent to China’s</span> military <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">power.</span></span> The maritime forces throughout Southeast Asia are small or medium in size in regard to both capability and total number of ships and aircraft. The main task of these forces has been that of policing the EEZ and dealing with low level non-traditional threats (Synder, 2004). <span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">This has further encouraged major players to react. Australia</span></span> which is not party to the dispute, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">has been drawn into the</span> SCS <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">issue</span></span>. In 2009, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the Defense White Paper stated, that China’s</span> military <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">might is a serious regional security concern</span>. It supported the US in reiterating its long standing position that the security situation in the SCS is vital for the freedom of navigation. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">It held joint naval exercises with Japan</span></span><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the US</span></span> in the SCS<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">It sent a clear message to China</span> and ASEAN <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">that it supports America’s ‘push back’ policy</span></span> vis-a vis China and that it will support America if China “pushes back” in turn (Babbage, 2011).

<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Massive, 10-story-high cranes, each shaped like an upside down "U," lift tractor-trailer-size containers onto and off cargo ships at dockside.

<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The freight moving through here touches the lives of people in 15 states, some 44% of the nation's population.</span>
__Even more critically, as <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the USA seeks to double exports in the next five years</span>, this is one of the nation's few major ports with a higher percentage of exports than imports.__
__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Those exports</span> – such as kaolin clay from Sandersville, Ga.; poultry from around the region; grain from the Midwest; automobiles from Southeast plants, and chemicals from around the nation – <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">accounted for</span> nearly <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">one-eighth of the USA's</span> containerized <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">exports</span> in 2010__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.</span>

"**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Other countries</span>** </span>throughout the world **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are looking at what is necessary in terms of their own (shipping) infrastructure to be competitive</span></span>** in world trade__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">," says Kurt Nagle, president and CEO of the American Association of Port Authorities. "</span>__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">It's something the U.S.</span> really <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">needs to be doing. The</span> general concern is the **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">U.S. is behind the curve</span></span>** and really at the stage of needing to play catch-up."__
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Officials say the Panama Canal expansion will mean some ships that previously had to deliver their freight to the generally deeper ports of the West Coast, where goods are moved mainly by rail across the nation, will be able to deliver goods more efficiently via all-water routes directly to East Coast ports. Officials such as Page Siplon, executive director of Georgia's Center of Innovation for Logistics, say there could be a 25% to 30% shift in freight shipping.</span>
__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">A long-sought Port of Savannah channel-deepening project would result in 15% to 20% cheaper shipping costs</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, says Chris Cummiskey, Georgia's commissioner of economic development.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Consumers across the Southeast could see a direct impact from the project.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">"Exporters will have lower costs of getting their goods to the world," says Billy Birdwell, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, which will deepen Savannah's port channel once it's approved. "Therefore, they are saving money, able to hire more people, able to do more work. Goods coming in will cost less to ship in, which will ultimately be passed on to consumers."</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Ambitions to expand</span>
__In his 2010 State of the Union address, President <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Obama announced the goal of doubling the nation's exports in the next five years. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The nation cannot</span>**</span> meet that goal – or **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">compete successfully in an increasingly global economy – without modern ports capable of handling the biggest ships</span></span>**<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span>__
**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">"Trade is going to grow significantly, and we need</span>__</span>** __to be able to have the **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">infrastructure to accommodate it</span></span>**,__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">" Nagle says. "</span>__To be able to do that, we really need an infrastructure to enable us to trade our goods, our coal, our grain__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">."</span>
__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Officials</span> here <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">say their port is a critical component in those efforts</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.</span>
__Most of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the Port of Savannah's business</span>, 84%, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is</span> truck-size containers, which are used to ship products and goods around the world. It's <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the second-busiest container port in the nation for the export of U.S. goods</span>, behind only Los Angeles; <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">it's one of the only major ports in the nation that exports more goods than it imports</span>__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">– 52.2% to 47.8% last year.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Officials here boast that 8.6% of all containerized goods that move in or out of the USA come through here; the port handles 12.4% of all containerized exports.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Savannah's port is a vital cog in Georgia's economy, second only to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport as an economic driver. It's responsible for 7% of the state's total employment, sustaining nearly 300,000 full- and part-time jobs, directly and indirectly. It also generates $61.7 billion in annual sales, worth $2.6 billion in state and local taxes.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">But </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the port's role in the</span>__</span>** __regional and **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">national economy is even more vital</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, says executive director Curtis Foltz.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">"Well </span>__over 95% of the cargo that moves through this port doesn't come from Savannah and isn't destined for Savannah__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">," he says. "</span>__Ports are conduits__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. We're shipping to and from central Florida, Texas, the lower Midwest, the Middle Tennessee Valley, North Carolina. Our port serves almost 45% of the U.S. population. </span>__The economic development and prosperity doesn't stop at the state border."__
__Now, the state is rushing headlong to ensure it holds onto that development and prosperity, trying to complete the harbor deepening as close as possible to 2014.__
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Marooned at low tide</span>
__Savannah's channel is just 42 feet deep, making it one of the shallowest major ports on the East Coast. Officials here say that some vessels already have to wait for high tide before they can traverse the channel – an expensive undertaking.__
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">"</span>__We're already seeing exports being left on the docks__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> because there is not sufficient water capacity to get those export containers onto the vessels," says port spokesman Robert Morris. "Close to 80% of the vessels are restrained by tide. Those vessels having to sit in a port or out at sea causes costs to rise."</span>
__The channel-deepening is especially important for exports,__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> officials say, because goods exported through Savannah are typically much heavier: forest products, kaolin clay, poultry, grain and automobiles, for instance. Imported goods tend to be lighter items such as socks, clothing, transistor radios and iPods.</span>
__The Port of Savannah formally asked the federal government to consider studying a deepening of the harbor in 1996. Congress authorized a federally funded study in 1999, and began multiple rounds of environmental, cost-benefit and engineering studies, coupled with multiple rounds of public comment.__
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">A long process</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">It typically takes about 10 years from the beginning of the study phase to a decision on such projects – essentially, approval from four federal agencies, the secretaries of Commerce, Interior and the Army, and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to begin construction. Some frustrated officials here gripe that this is one of the longest-studied federal projects in history.</span>
__"It should have already been done," Foltz says. "Failing that, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">it has to be done as quickly as possible, or commerce in the U.S. is going to suffer.</span></span>** There's no doubt, it's got to get done."__
__No one seems sure when that might happen, though.__
__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Funding for the</span> $569 million **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is required to be split, about one-third from the state, two-thirds from the federal government</span></span>**<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">. Georgia already has allocated</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> most of </span>__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">its share</span>; the state also has completed upgrades to several roads that link the port and nearby interstate highways.__
__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">But officials</span> here <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">were disappointed when</span> President **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Obama's proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 included just $600,000 for the project</span></span>**__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, for pre-construction engineering and design </span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">but no money for construction</span>__</span>**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The Corps of Engineers' Birdwell says </span>__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the project</span> now <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">faces</span> another <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">delay</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. "We had anticipated that the decision would be made midyear 2012," he says. "However, we recently undertook additional analysis that may delay the final decision."</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">A boon to consumers</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The Corps of Engineers projects that </span>__the Savannah port expansion will generate an annual net benefit of $116 million to $125 million for the state__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and those who use the port, Birdwell says.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">One of the nation's largest importers, Home Depot, imports about 20% of its goods through Savannah, says Mark Holifield, supply chain senior vice president. "</span>__<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The deepening of the ports creates efficiency and lowers the cost of doing business</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">," he says. "We don't just try to save money to raise our margins. We try to save money at the Home Depot so we can pass the savings on to our customers. We typically roll cost savings into prices."</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">AJC International, a major exporter of beef, pork and poultry, exports 100 container loads of poultry through Savannah each week, says Eric Joiner, vice chairman and co-founder.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">He compares the harbor expansion project with a major airport lengthening a runway to handle new, larger passenger jets.</span>
__"It becomes an economic issue and a service issue," he says. "The steamship companies are going to go to those ports that can accommodate their ships. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">This will keep us very competitive</span>."__
