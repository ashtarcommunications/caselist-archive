Unstable funding is delaying Air Force acquisition of new infra-red warning satellites<br />
<strong><u>Defense Industry Daily ‘11</u></strong> (“Despite Problems, SBIRS-High Moves Ahead,” 6-28-2011, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2309:http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Despite-Problems-SBIRS-High-Moves-Ahead-With-3rd-Satellite-Award-05467/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Despite-Problems-SBIRS-High-Moves-Ahead-With-3rd-Satellite-Award-05467/" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Despite-Problems-SBIRS-High-Moves-Ahead-With-3rd-Satellite-Award-05467/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2309 -->)<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The Space Based Infrared System</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> (SBIRS)-High satellite program <strong>is a key component of the</strong> USA’s <strong>future missile alert system</strong>, designed to give maximum warning and monitoring of ballistic missile launches anywhere in the world</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The new satellites will replace the existing Defense Support Program (DSP) fleet. Their infrared sensors have 2 times the revisit rate and 3 times the sensitivity of DSP, while providing better persistent coverage. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Unfortunately, the program has been beset by massive cost overruns on the order of 400%, technical challenges that continue to present problems, and uncertain performance. Despite these problems, the U.S. Air Force is proceeding with the program, even as it terminates potential alternatives and supplements</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. SBIRS – High: Current State Contracts and Key Events [updated] Additional Readings SBIRS – High: Current State The SBIRS team is led by the Infrared Space Systems Directorate at the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA. Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Sunnyvale, CA is the SBIRS prime contractor. Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems in Azusa, CA as the payload subcontractor, and Lockheed Martin Information Systems &amp; Global Services in Boulder, CO is the ground system subcontractor. SBIRS-High GEO are satellites. SBIRS-High HEO (High Elliptical Orbit) are payloads hosted on spacecraft with classified launch dates. At present, 2 HEO are in service, and a 3rd HEO payload is prepping for launch. The first SBIRS High HEO payload was declared operational in November 2008. The first SBIRS-High GEO satellite was expected to launch in 2010, after significant delays. SBIRS GEO-1 wasn’t delivered to Cape Canaveral until March 2011, and the launch won’t take place until May 2011 at the earliest. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">According to US GAO auditors, <strong>the SBIRS program has suffered from</strong> immature technologies, unclear requirements, <strong>unstable funding</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, underestimated software complexity, poor oversight, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">and other problems <strong>that have resulted in billions of dollars in cost overruns and years in schedule delays</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The cost of the program has ballooned from an original $4 billion estimate to over $17 billion. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Normally, this</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> kind of performance would produce program cancellation, but</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> <strong>the USAF had no alternatives for</strong></span></u><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> a mission that must be carried out: early ballistic missile detection</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><br />

Advance appropriations are key – buying the full constellation now is essential to reduce program costs and avoid production breaks<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">Deficit reduction doesn't always mean hard choices. Sometimes it's easy, if politicians are willing to rethink how the government goes about pursuing its goals. Perhaps that's what Pentagon policymakers had in mind when they decided to name </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">a new approach to purchasing satellites</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> EASE. The official name </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">is &quot;Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">,&quot; but the acronym says it all. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Budget analysts have figured out a way of <strong>saving billions of dollars on space systems without having to give up anything</strong>. And unlike initiatives such as the F-35 alternate engine that require up-front investments to save money later, the EASE concept starts saving money right away</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">It's an amazingly simple idea. <strong>All Congress needs to do is agree to buy more than one satellite at a time, and then spread the appropriations out over several budget years</strong>. <strong>That's not what the government does today</strong>. <strong>Instead, it buys one costly satellite</strong> in a constellation <strong>at a time, and then waits years to buy the next one -- even though legislators know they will eventually need to buy several satellites of any given type</strong> to complete a constellation. <strong>And because satellites are bought one-at-a-time with all the money appropriated in a single year, staffers can't find the money to buy another satellite for years and contractors can't manage their production processes efficiently</strong>. So <strong>each satellite ends up costing a lot more than it needs to</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Here's an example. The Pentagon is buying Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) communications satellites that will allow warfighters all over the world to communicate securely even in adverse circumstances. That's an essential capability and military planners expect to buy several of the satellites over the coming decade. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Now, <strong>if Congress buys the next two satellites separately with full funding of each in the year it's requested, the cost for both will be about $4 billion</strong>. <strong>If it buys them in a &quot;block&quot;</strong> (together) <strong>and then spaces the money out over several years as EASE proposes, the two satellites will cost $3.1 billion</strong>. <strong>About $900 million is saved just by doing business differently, without giving anything up</strong>. <strong>And the same approach can be applied to</strong> any other satellite constellation where the government plans to buy more than one satellite of the same design, whether it's for <strong>missile warning or weather reports</strong> or whatever</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. You can't really call EASE a breakthrough, because </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the N</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">ational <strong>R</strong>econnaissance <strong>O</strong>ffice <strong>has been buying its spy satellites this way for a long time</strong>. <strong>But</strong> most of the military satellites the government buys aren't for spying, and <strong>all the other spacecraft are currently being bought one-at-a-time at very high cost</strong>. <strong>By switching to incremental funding of multi-satellite buys, the government can start saving billions of dollars in fiscal 2012</strong>. <strong>It can also help military planners and contractors to start thinking more coherently about how to introduce necessary upgrades into later versions of current satellites</strong>, since we know constellations like AEHF are going to be operating for decades to come. But <strong>the real savings come from being able to use workers and facilities more efficiently</strong>, because when the government commits to buying multiple satellites of the same type in a single &quot;block&quot; <strong>the work can be sequenced to make sure each employee with specialized skills is working every day, rather than waiting around for the next satellite to be funded</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">This isn't a budgeting gimmick and there are no catches</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. <strong>Congress can begin saving billions of dollars on military satellites in 2012 without killing any programs</strong> or closing any facilities. <strong>All it needs to do is agree to</strong> what staffers call &quot;<strong>advanced appropriations</strong>,&quot; which is technical language for agreeing to fund satellites over several budget years rather than setting aside all the money in a single year. Once it does that, budgeting for military space will become easier and savings will begin accumulating that can be applied to other purposes such as deficit reduction</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Of course, somebody somewhere will probably complain about Congress changing the way it does business. But when you're borrowing $4 billion per day from lenders like China, change is indicated. </span><br />

<u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Space is essential</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> for modern life and </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">for a modern military, but getting satellites built and on orbit is</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> not easy and </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">not cheap.

What are the problems and how do they get fixed?

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">It was a big relief to U.S. defense officials in May when the first geosynchronous satellite in </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the Space Based Infrared System</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> (</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">SBIRS</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">) successfully reached orbit. The new spacecraft </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">is equipped with sensors that will provide the first indication of hostile missile launches, nuclear explosions</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> and other heat-generating events</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> around the globe relevant to national security. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Such information is <strong>essential to nuclear deterrence, which</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> as currently practiced </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">requires the</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> nation’s </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">strategic <strong>arsenal to be capable of</strong> surviving an attack and then <strong>retaliating in a controlled and proportionate manner</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">If</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> news of enemy missile launches is not received quickly, the ability of U.S. forces to respond effectively might be so uncertain as to impair the entire structure of deterrence</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">There isn’t much doubt that the SBIRS constellation will be a big improvement over existing</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> Defense Support Program </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">satellites</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Each of the four geosynchronous satellites positioned about 36,000 kilometers above the equator will carry a scanning sensor with three times the sensitivity and twice the revisit rate of legacy sensors, plus a staring sensor that can provide persistent, higher-resolution coverage of specific areas (like Iran or North Korea). </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The sensitivity and timeliness of information generated by the new satellites will also enable the SBIRS constellation to provide valuable reconnaissance for the nation’s ballistic missile defense system, conventional warfighters and intelligence analysts. But the</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> core </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">mission</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, the one </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">that matters most, is assuring sufficient warning of hostile missile launches so that the nation’s nuclear arsenal can credibly deter aggression</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">What many observers don’t grasp is how tenuous the existing missile warning system has become</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The first and most vital line of defense</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> in that system </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">since 1970 has been the legacy satellites that SBIRS will replace</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Prime contractor Northrop Grumman has introduced numerous upgrades to the Defense Support Program satellites that have improved their reliability, sensitivity and survivability. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">However</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, a review of the program’s launch history indicates that </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the Air Force has managed to</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> successfully launch only one</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> of the <strong>satellite</strong>s <strong>in the last 10 years</strong> — which is <strong>very worrisome when</strong> you consider that <strong>the</strong> nominal <strong>design life</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> for the latest versions of Defense Support Program satellites </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">is only five years</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Fortunately, the satellites typically exceed their design life by 250 percent, and some have lasted even longer. But there’s a reason engineers specify conservative design lives, so </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the fact that the last successful launch of a legacy satellite occurred in 2004 means that <strong>America’s missile warning network is living on borrowed time</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Under the original SBIRS development plan, there was little danger of a gap in missile warning. The new spacecraft were supposed to begin reaching orbit in 2002, providing plenty of time to transition from the legacy constellation to the new one. But a variety of hardware and software problems delayed the program by many years, and then in 2008 the last</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> (and most recently launched) </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">D</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">efense </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">upport </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">P</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">rogram </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">spacecraft mysteriously failed in orbit</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">It was the unforeseen combination of <strong>SBIRS delays and a legacy satellite failure</strong> that <strong>got policymakers scrambling to identify options for filling a potential gap in missile warning</strong>. <strong>What they learned to their dismay is that there weren’t any viable alternatives to</strong> stretching out the performance of the D</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">efense </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">upport </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">P</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">rogram </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">and <strong>straining to get SBIRS into orbit as soon as possible</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. There are a number of possibilities for squeezing more life out of the Defense Support Program satellites, from reducing the fuel margins required for boosting them into retirement orbits to working around the failure of specific components in an architecture designed for redundancy. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">But <strong>at this point</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> some of </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the satellites in use must be “single string” spacecraft</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">, meaning <strong>there are no backups for key functions</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, because the most recent Defense Support Program satellites still believed to be functioning were launched in 2000, 2001 and 2004. That’s a long time to be operating continuously in space without any repairs. The launch of SBIRS sensors on two National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) satellites in highly elliptical polar orbits beginning in 2006 has somewhat diminished the danger while bolstering confidence in the sensors to be carried on the more capable geosynchronous birds. But the sensors hosted by NRO can’t provide the coverage afforded by near-circular equatorial orbits at geosynchronous distances, so </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">there’s no alternative to fielding the full SBIRS architecture</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Policymakers appear to believe that the legacy constellation will be viable through 2013, after which SBIRS will have to assume most of the missile warning mission</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Thus, a lot is riding on the success of the GEO-1 satellite that reached orbit in May. With solar panels and antennas deployed, operators are testing the twin sensors and other on-board equipment to make sure they meet performance specifications. SBIRS has been an uncommonly controversial program that began during a period of turmoil in space acquisition and was saddled with more requirements than any satellite should have to meet (three times too many, the Defense Science Board said in 2003). But the most capable part of the system has now reached orbit with all of its “key performance parameters” intact, which is a major achievement for prime contractor Lockheed Martin and payload integrator Northrop Grumman. It is also a big victory for the U.S. Air Force, which stuck with the SBIRS architecture despite years of criticism. Its leaders understood the urgency of replacing legacy missile warning satellites before they failed. However, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">it will still be some time before the constellation is fully deployed, so the danger has not passed</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The bottom line on nuclear deterrence is that it isn’t likely to work unless U.S. leaders have reliable information about what other nuclear powers are doing, and right now SBIRS is the only solution that can meet that need in a timely fashion</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><br />

Yet, the United States may be contemplating further exacerbating this threat by deploying missile interceptors in space. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Both</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> the U</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">and Russia rely on space-based systems to provide early warning of a nuclear attack</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. If deployed, however, U.S. space-based missile defense interceptors could eliminate the Russian early warning satellites quickly and without warning. So, just the existence of U.S. space weapons could make Russia’s strategic trigger fingers itchy. The potential protection space-based defenses might offer the United States is swamped therefore by their potential cost: </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">a failure of</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> or false signal from <strong>a component of the</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> Russian </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">early warning system could lead to a disastrous reaction and accidental nuclear war</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">There is no conceivable missile defense</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, space-based or not, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">that would offer protection in the event that the Russian nuclear arsenal was launched at the U</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates. Nor are the Russians or other countries likely to stand still and watch the United States construct space-based defenses. These states are likely to respond by developing advanced anti-satellite weapon systems.[1] These weapons, in turn, would endanger U.S. early warning systems, impair valuable U.S. weapons intelligence efforts, and increase the jitteriness of U.S. officials. The Dangers of Failed Early Warning Systems The Russian early warning system is in serious disrepair. This system consists of older radar systems nearing the end of their operational life and just three functioning satellites, although the Russian military has plans to deploy more. The United States has 15 such satellites. Ten years ago, on January 25, 1995, this aging early warning network picked up a rocket launch from Norway. The Russian military could not determine the nature of the missile or its destination. Fearing that it might be a submarine-launched missile aimed at Moscow with the purpose of decapitating the Russian command and control structure, the Russian military alerted President Boris Yeltsin, his defense minister, and the chief of the general staff. They immediately opened an emergency teleconference to determine whether they needed to order Russia’s strategic forces to launch a counterattack. The rocket that had been launched was actually an atmospheric sounding rocket conducting scientific observations of the aurora borealis. Norway had notified Russia of this launch several weeks earlier, but the message had not reached the relevant sections of the military. In little more than two minutes before the deadline to order nuclear retaliation, the Russians realized their mistake and stood down their strategic forces. Thus, 10 years ago, when the declining Russian early warning system was stronger than today, it read this single small missile test launch as a U.S. nuclear missile attack on Russia. The alarm went up the Russian chain of command all the way to the top. The briefcase containing the nuclear missile launch codes was brought to Yeltsin as he was told of the attack. Fortunately, Yeltsin and the Russian leadership made the correct decision that day and directed the Russian strategic nuclear forces to stand down. Obviously, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">nothing should be done in any way further to diminish the reliability of the space-based components of U.S.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> and Russian </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">ballistic missile early warning systems</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. <strong>A decline in confidence in such</strong></span></u><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> early warning systems</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> caused by the deployment of weapons in space </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">would enhance the risk of an accidental nuclear weapons attack</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Yet, as part of its plans for missile defense, the Pentagon is calling for the development of a test bed for space-based interceptors as well as examining a number of other exotic space weapons. In an interview published in Arms Control Today, Lt. Gen. Henry Obering, director of the Missile Defense Agency, touted what he said was “a very modest and moderate test-bed approach to launch some experiments.” Obering said the Pentagon would only deploy a handful of interceptors: “We are talking about onesies, twosies in terms of experimentation.”[2] </span><br />

Extinction<br />
<strong><u>Morgan ‘9</u></strong> (Dennis Ray Morgan, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, South Korea, “World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race,” Futures, 41(10), December 2009, ScienceDirect)<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question “Is Nuclear War Inevitable??” [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what most terrorists obviously already know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange. As Moore points out, all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian “dead hand” system, “where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,” it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States” [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal “Samson option” against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even “anti-Semitic” European cities [10]. In that case, of course, Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on. <strong>Any</strong> accident, mistaken communication, <strong>false signal</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> or “lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">could, in a matter of</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> a few <strong>minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons</strong>, and <strong>once a weapon is used</strong>, then <strong>the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is</strong> actually <strong>less probable</strong> since <strong>each country would act under the “use them or lose them” strategy</strong> and psychology; <strong>restraint by one power would be interpreted as</strong> a <strong>weakness</strong> by the other, <strong>which could be exploited as a window of opportunity</strong> to “win” the war</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. In other words, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">once Pandora's Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, “everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self-determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors” In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">once even just one is used, it is very likely that</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> many, if not <strong>all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of</strong> much of <strong>human civilization</strong> while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />

<u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Presidents were </span></u><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">innocent victims of the prevailing overarching principle of deterrence based on second-strike retaliation, never the wiser to the thorough-going engineering of the complex early warning and command system operations so as to deny them any semblance of wartime options aligned with that very principle</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Almost no senior civilian official, let alone president, ever caught on to the egregious deception that kept them in the dark about their true options in wartime. One exception was former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. His close scrutiny of nuclear affairs, combined with a keen intellect, led him to realize that the United States long ago adopted a strategy of launch on warning (LOW) – that is ordering and carrying out U.S. missile launches after early warning sensors indicate an incoming nuclear missile strike but before enemy missiles hit their targets on American soil. He came to this realization quite independently, </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">without helpful testimony from strategic nuclear commanders who doggedly denied their reliance on LOW in public, and virtually all private, fora. The official dogma they expressed was that the U</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">had the capability to launch on warning and a potential adversary should not assume that a U.S. attack would be ridden out, but that the U</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">did not rely on LOW</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. For Nunn, however, </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">it was clear that the apparatus of nuclear control and release was geared to do just that</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. If it looked, sounded, and walked like a LOW duck, then call it a LOW duck. Nunn declared it a duck, understood that this duck carried serious risks of starting a nuclear war by accident, and proceeded to call for a relaxation of the nuclear hair-trigger on both U.S. and Russian missiles in order to alleviate this danger. Nunn almost certainly 0064id not fully grasp the commitment to LOW embodied in the nuclear operational world, however. Only the most senior nuclear generals understood the imperative, and they simply refused to admit it, owing to their justifiable apprehension that such an admission would stir enormous public controversy and almost certainly force them to revise operational practices in ways that would put the viability of the U.S. SIOP in jeopardy. </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">My efforts to expose the hair-trigger status of U.S. and Russian nuclear forces and their reliance on LOW have been met with vigorous denials from the nuclear brass. The efforts have been well-grounded in personal experience, confidences with senior U.S. nuclear generals, facts and analysis assembled in articles and books</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> – notably, Strategic Command and Control (Brookings, 1985), The Logic of Accidental Nuclear War (Brookings, 1993), and Global Zero Alert for Nuclear Forces (Brookings, 1995</span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">). But neither this body of work nor any other clarion call from any quarter succeeded in engendering a national debate and reckoning. And the nuclear brass never stepped forward to testify candidly about the true state of affairs – about the illusory nuclear flexibility of the president. </span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">To his great credit, one senior general spoke candidly of the matter soon after retiring from his exhalted position as commander in chief of the Strategic Command in 1994. Former Air Force Gen. George Lee Butler gave an interview in which the truth was finally laid bare for all to read. Here are some excerpts: “Part of the insidiousness of the evolution of this system … is the unfortunate fact that, whatever might have been intended by the policymakers (who, incidentally, had very little insight into the mechanisms that underpinned the simple words that floated onto a blank page at the level of the White House), in reality, </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">at the operational level, the requirements of deterrence proved impracticable</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">…. </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The consequence was a move in practice to a system structured to drive the president invariably toward a decision to launch under attack</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">…. </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Launch under attack means that you believe you have incontrovertible proof that warheads actually are on the way</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">….. </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Our policy was premised on being able to accept the first wave of attacks. We</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> never said publicly that we were committed to launch on warning or launch under attack. Yet </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">at the operational level it was never accepted that if the presidential decisions went to a certain tick of the clock, we would lose a major portion of our force</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">s… Notwithstanding the intention of deterrence as it is expressed at the policy level – as it is declared and written down – at the level of operations those intentions got turned on their head, as the people who are responsible for actually devising the war plan faced the dilemmas and blind alleys of concrete practice. Those mattered absolutely to the people who had to sit down and try to frame the detailed guidance to exact destruction of 80 percent of the adversary’s nuclear forces. When they realized that they could not in fact assure those levels of damage if the president chose to ride out an attack, what then did they do? They built a construct that powerfully biased the president’s decision process toward launch before the arrival of the first enemy warhead.” (Jonathan Schell, The Gift of Time, Metropolitan Books, 1998, pp. 191-194).</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">MICAH ZENKO: Well, let me take the last one first. I mean, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">there are a buffet of further steps in U.S.-Russian</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> nuclear and conventional force reductions and <strong>agreements that could be reached in 2011</strong>, 2012 <strong>and after</strong> the presidential election in both countries. <strong>But if there is not</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> a formal agreement or </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">understanding on</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> the future way forward on <strong>missile defense, none of these will likely happen</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Medvedev said</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> very recently, <strong>either we come to an agreement on missile defense, or</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> there is -- </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">there will be a resumption of the arms race</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. I know </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">it's a very threatening, maximalist position, but <strong>this a primary concern for a lot of Russian officials and strategic thinkers</strong>. It comes up over and over again</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The primary Russian concern is not the system which currently protects the United States from limited numbers of ballistic missile launches. The United States has roughly 24 interceptors in Alaska, six in California. These are intended to cover the entirety of the continental United States from a rogue launch from North Korea, say, or an unauthorized launch from Russia. But in the summer of -- or in the fall of 2009, the Obama administration introduced what's called the European Phased Adaptive Approach policy, which is a policy to create a missile defense shield over all of Europe in four stages: 2011, 2015, 2018 and 2020. There are some Russians who perceive that that system will put at risk its ICBM force, so it could not have a reliable second strike against the United States. The administration, to be fair, has done a lot -- a very good job through the presidential bilateral working group at the NATO-Russia Council to explain that these systems will not threaten Russia's ICBM force. Technical experts in Russia get this, but whether the policymakers get it -- get it (received ?) that's another question. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">There is still more that the U</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">can do internally to provide some transparency</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> about what the out-phases, specifically the 2018 and 2020 stages of missile defense -- of this missile defense for Europe will look like. We don't know what this looks like yet. The missile that will be in place in 2018 and 2020 is still in the design stages. Even the earlier missiles, which would be based upon ships in the Mediterranean, that has not been tested yet. So we're still at the early stages for this, and the perception that this could threaten its force in the future scares Russia. And then the final issue is, as Rose hinted at -- to quote Secretary Gates, or to paraphrase him, in June -- the Russians hate missile defense. They hate it. They've hated it since the late '60s. And as the secretary said, there can be no meeting of the minds on missile defense. I don't think that's the case. In light of the NATO-Russia Council meetings in November, President Medvedev came out with an early proposal for what joint missile defense could look like, which I would call sincere but not serious. It has these three principles. One is, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Russia wants</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> to be a full-fledged partner in missile defense</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Second, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">they want <strong>to have shared early-warning data</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, shared intercept -- not shared intercept -- shared really-warning data, shared radar, shared sensors, with two buttons -- a two-button principle. One would be covering Russia, one would be covering NATO. And then the third is what they call sector-based defense, assigning zones of responsibility for protection against ballistic missile defense. And when you talk to military planners in the United States, this is not going to fly. The (poll ?) did not come in for NATO to be protected from ballistic missiles from the Persian Gulf by -- on behalf of the Russians. There's also the slight issue that Russia does not have a missile-defense system presently covering its territory. There is a new air-defense system called the S-500, which has never been presented or tested, which they claim will be operational for missile defense by 2020. But </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">I think <strong>there can be an agreement</strong>, and this is being worked in these groups -- the working groups and NATO-Russia Council -- about joint threat assessments</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, what does the threat look like. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">And that's being done right now</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. There can</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> also <strong>be a shared early-warning of all ballistic missile launches</strong>. There was this -- people in history remember the JDEC, which was this Joint Data Exchange Center in Moscow, that was going to be a place where Russian and U.S. officials sort of watched ballistic missile launches from various parts of the world and then they could both agree that they came from these countries and not from each other</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">So</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> I think </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">there can be cooperation on shared early warning threat assessments</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> and on potentially shared radars, which includes integrating some of the Russian radar capabilities in southern Russia into the U.S. phased adaptive approach missile defense system for Europe. GOTTEMOELLER: I'd just like to add, on this missile defense cooperation point, some of you may have seen that Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov gave a press conference in Moscow today, a very extensive press conference, and he commented at the pace at which we're getting off the ground on our discussions in the working groups: the presidential commission working group, that deals with cooperation on nuclear security, missile defense matters, chaired by my boss, Undersecretary Tauscher; and also some military-to-military discussions as well. So there's a very, very fast pace of activity. And I do think that both Moscow and Washington are really intent, as are our NATO allies, in getting off the ground quickly and completing these joint threat assessments and then in moving on to look at joint concepts and really trying to figure out how to put all these pieces together. PIFER: I think that's actually really good news, because I think </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">if you look at the next negotiation, <strong>if the Russians are insistent on something on missile defense, and we've seen the Senate reaction and the limitations on missile defense, there's something of a trap there</strong>. <strong>And missile defense cooperation may be the way to get out of that box, which could otherwise be a major obstacle</strong> in the next round of strategic offensive arms reductions</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">&quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">There are some <strong>Cold War issues</strong> that <strong>continue to return to the front of the agenda, and</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> missile defenses, and </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">how we interact on missile defenses, is</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, I would say, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">at the top of the list</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot; That was Rose Gottemoeller, the assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, speaking before the Council on Foreign Relations last week on the next steps in U.S.-Russian nuclear cooperation. As Gottemoeller pointed out, Moscow's concern with missile defense is &quot;nothing new,&quot; having been revealed during the days of President Ronald Reagan's &quot;Star Wars&quot; plan almost 30 years ago. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The Russians last year insisted that the preamble to</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">New START) contain language that recognizes &quot;the existence of the interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot; Of course, that preamble has no legal effect on U.S. missile-defense planning, as U.S. negotiators made clear in their unilateral statement attached to the treaty. Nonetheless, Republicans insisted on saying that more directly in the Senate ratification resolution. Last week, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the Russian Duma, during its ratification process, added its own understanding</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> to its resolution, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">which calls for Moscow to withdraw from the treaty if the U.S. unilaterally deploys missile-defense systems</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> that endanger Russia's national security. It, like the preamble and Senate language, has no legal effect. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">What will have an impact is</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> if Moscow and Washington can work together on</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> several missile-defense activities now underway</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Before the November NATO-Russia Council meetings in Lisbon, Russian President Dmitry </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Medvedev asserted</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> three principles for a shared NATO missile-defense agreement: Russia would be a full partner, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">there would be <strong>shared early-warning data</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> (such as shared sensors), and there would be assigned zones of responsibility for protection. Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations described it as a &quot;sincere but not serious&quot; proposal that U.S. military planners said &quot;would not fly&quot; in part because the Russians do not have a missile-defense system to protect their own territory nor a sector of NATO countries in the 2015-2020 time frame. Nonetheless, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">NATO working groups and the NATO-Russia Council are studying</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> what the threat looks like, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the prospect of shared early-warning data</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> and potentially shared radars, including those operated by Russia, Gottemoeller said. &quot;There's a very, very fast pace of activity,&quot; she said, &quot;and I do think that both Moscow and Washington are really intent, as are our NATO allies, in getting off the ground quickly and completing these joint threat assessments and then in moving on to look at joint concepts and really trying to figure out how to put all these pieces together.&quot; At his annual news conference last week reviewing world affairs, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov agreed that his country's creation of a common missile shield with Europe was key to improving relations with the West. &quot;I am convinced that creating a common missile shield is the real and more important test for the sincerity of statements that security is indivisible,&quot; he said. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Behind</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> this new talk of cooperation, the Russians have planted the threat of withdrawal if they are not treated as equal partners</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. <strong>Medvedev told</strong></span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> the NATO-Russia Council: &quot;<strong>Either we</strong> are fully involved, <strong>share information</strong>, are responsible for solving certain problems, <strong>or we do not participate at all</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot; For emphasis he added, &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">But if we do not participate at all, for obvious reasons, we will be forced to defend ourselves</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot; </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Lavrov also made it clear that the Senate's second post-START goal - negotiating within a year to deal with Russia's major advantage in tactical nuclear weapons - may not be met</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. He brought up the traditional Moscow position that all U.S. tactical nuclear weapons - some 200 bombs stored in five European countries - would have to be taken back to the continental United States as part of any negotiation over Russia's several thousand tactical nuclear-missile warheads, artillery shells, bombs and antiaircraft weapons. Lavrov suggested that talks on tactical nuclear weapons wouldn't happen quickly. &quot;Before talking about any further steps in the sphere of nuclear disarmament,&quot; he cautioned, &quot;it's necessary to fulfill the New START agreement.&quot; If he meant that the two sides cutting their strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550 each, down from the current ceiling of 2,200, that would mean at least half a dozen years. &quot;Then it will become clear what further steps must be taken to strengthen global security and strategic stability,&quot; Lavrov said. Gottemoeller agreed that tactical weapons as the next phase of nuclear arms control is going to be complicated &quot;because we will be grappling with these smaller objects that are more difficult to address in terms of monitoring and verification [of their] elimination.&quot; But she said discussions are taking place inside and outside both governments. She noted one paper that said there could be an overall nuclear weapons number that matched Russia's advantage in tactical, or non-strategic, nuclear weapons to the similar U.S. advantage in non-deployed, or stored, long-range weapons. Another complicating issue tossed out by Lavrov: He said other nuclear-armed nations must take part in future talks and the agenda must include weapons in space, strategic missiles equipped with conventional explosives and other weapons. Gottemoeller disclosed that a conference of the original five nuclear powers - the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain - already had taken place in London, where verification and transparency cooperation were discussed. She said a second session was scheduled for Paris within the next few months. Gottemoeller summed up: &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">It's little noticed, but, in fact, <strong>our relationship with Russia has undergone some great strengthening in</strong> the last couple of years</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot; </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Beyond <strong>arms control</strong>, she mentioned a &quot;little noticed&quot; <strong>agreement on nuclear cooperation and</strong> an arrangement to transport material through Russia to U.S. and coalition troops in <strong>Afghanistan</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">These assurances are manifestly untrue and, coming from U.S. officials, editorialists, an scholars, inexplica­bly myopic and irresponsible. Even leaving aside post­Soviet Russia's enormou stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons,“</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">all of the major fault line of nuclear danger are growing</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">,</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">&quot; as we learn from a num­ber of largely unheeded experts, and U.S. policy &quot;simply has not kept up with the expansion of nuclear dangers inside Russia.&quot;The truth may not be politically correct or palatable, but the breakup of the Soviet state and Russia's &quot;transition&quot; have made us immeasurably less safe than we have ever been. To understand how unsafe, we must explore more fully a generalization made earlier in this book: What does it mean for our security when a nuclear-laden nation state is, depending on how we choose to charac­terize Russia s condition today, disintegrating, collaps­ing, or merely &quot;highly unstable&quot;?40 The short answer is, no one fully knows, because it has never happened before, which itself means that compared with the rel­ative predictability of the Soviet system and the Cold War, we now live in an era of acute nuclear uncertain­ty. The longer answer is that </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">any significant degree of disintegration, instability, or civil warfare, all of which exist in Russia today, creates</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> not one but </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">several unprecedented nuclear dangers</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The most widely acknowledged</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, almost to the point of obscuring the others,</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">is proliferation</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">-the danger that some of Russia's vast accumulation of nuclear weapons, components, or knowledge might be acquired by non-nuclear states or terrorist groups</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">through theft</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">and black-market transactions, scientific </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">brain drain, or a decision by</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> a money-starved </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Moscow</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> regime </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">to sell them</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">.</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">The threat derives primarily from Russia's decade­ long economic collapse. The government has lacked suf­ficient funds to safeguard storehouses of nuclear materials properly or to pay maintenance personnel and scientists adequately, even regularly. (Nuclear workers actually went out on strike over unpaid wages several times in the 1990s and again in 2000, even though it is against Russian law.) Almost all of the existing U.S. programs to reduce nuclear threats inside Russia focus on proliferation. But even here, according to their official sponsors and other experts, the programs are &quot;woefully inadequate&quot; if we are &quot;to prevent a catastrophe.&quot; By the end of 2000, for example, barely one-sixth of Russia's weapons-usable materials will be considered secure, and the &quot;risks of `loose nukes' are larger today&quot; than they were when the programs began. Moreover, Moscow seems to have no full inventory 0f such materials or perhaps even of its thousands of tactical nuclear weapons, and thus no sure way of knowing whether or not something is missing.*' Proliferation is the pinup of Russia's nuclear dangers, the subject of Western novels and movies, but it may not be the most serious. If a nuclear explosion is wait­ing to happen, it is probably somewhere among Russia's scores of Soviet-era reactors at electrical power stations and on decommissioned submarines. Reactors, we are told, can be no less dangerous than nuclear weapons. And as the Senate's leading expert informed his col­leagues in 1999, Russia's &quot;reactors suffer from defi­ciences in design, operator training, and safety procedures.&quot; Indeed, according to a Russian specialist, &quot;none of our nuclear stations can be considered safe.&quot;42 The bell began tolling loudly on reactor catastrophes with the explosion at Chernobyl in 1986, the worst nuclear accident in history. Releasing more than a hun­dred times the radiation of the two atomic bombs dropped 0n Japan in 1945, its lethal consequences are still unfolding fourteen years later. Since the early 1990s,many reports. including one by the Russian gov­ernment itself in February 2000, have warned of the possibility of another &quot;Chernobyl-type disaster&quot; or, more exactly, of several accident-prone Russian power stations, even faulty research reactors.' (The world's most dangerous nuclear plants are said to be located in post-Communist Russia and other former Soviet republics.)' Scores of decommissioned but still not denuclearized Soviet-built submarines decaying in the far north great­ly worsen the odds in this new kind of Russian roulette. Here too firsthand reports of &quot;a nuclear accident wait­ing to happen&quot; are increasingly ominous. Ill-maintained floating reactors are highly vulnerable, and many sub­marines are already leaking or dumping radioactive materials into the seas &quot;like little Chernobyls in slow motion. Active-duty Russian nuclear ships also pose a serious threat, their aging missiles susceptible to explosions, one likely to detonate others. If that happens Russian expert warns, &quot;We can end up with hundreds of Chernobyls. Why, then, all the U.S. official and unofficial assur­ances that we are &quot;immeasurably more secure&quot; and ca stop worrying about &quot;worst-case scenarios&quot;? They clear­ly derived from the single, entirely ideological assump­tion that because the Soviet Union no longer exists, the threat of a Russian nuclear attack on the United States no longer exists and we need now worry only about rogue states.&quot; In truth, the possibility of such a Russ­ian attack grew throughout the 1990s and is still growing </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Leave aside the warning that &quot;a Russian version of Milosevic . . . armed with thousands of nuclear war­ warheads&quot; - might come to power</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">and consider the pro­gressive disintegration of the country's nuclear-defense infrastructure.</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Russia still has some six thousand war­heads on hair-trigger alert</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. They are to be launched or not launched depending on information about activity at U.S. missile sites provided by an early-warning net­work of radars, satellites, and computers that now functions only partially and erratically. Russia's command-and-control personnel, who are hardly immune to the social hard­ships and pathologies sweeping the nation, have bare­ly a few minutes to evaluate any threatening information, which as already been false on occasion. (In 1995, a Norwegian weather rocket was briefly mistaken by Russian authorities for an incoming enemy mis­sile.) These new post-Soviet</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">technological and human cir­cumstances</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> of the nuclear age </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">are</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, as American scien­tists have warned repeatedly, &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">increasing the danger of an accidental or unauthorized &quot;attack on the U</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">nited States</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">&quot; from Russian territory. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> It is</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> &quot;arguably already </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the greatest threat to</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> U.S. national survival</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.Assurances to the contrary, scientists emphasize, are &quot;a gross mis­representation of reality.&quot;' Readers may choose to believe that</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">intentional nuclear war</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> nonetheless remains unthinkable. In post- Soviet Russia, however, it </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">has become not only increas­inglythinkable but speakable</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The Kremlin's new security doctrine expanding conditions in which it would use such weapons may be merely semantic and nothing really new. But Russia's ferocious civil war in Chechnya, which did not end with the destruction of Grozny in 2000, is, as I have pointed out before, the first ever in a nuclear country. It has not yet included nuclear warfare, but both sides have crossed a rhetorical Rubicon. Since '999, sev­eral Russian deputies and governors, and even a lead­ing &quot;liberal&quot; newspaper, have proposed using nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons against Chechnya. Said one, think nuclear weapons should stop being virtual.&quot; Russian military spokesmen, we are told, &quot;do not exclude that a nuclear attack could be carried out against the bases of international terrorists in Chechnya.&quot;49 And with that tiny republic in mind, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">t</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">he military has officially adopted a new concept of &quot;limited&quot; nuclear warfare</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> in a single region, a threat against the Chechen resistance still being discussed in May 2000. From the other side, there were persistent reports that terrorists serving the Chechen &quot;holy war&quot; might blow up Russian nuclear power plants or weapons sites. The reports were serious enough to cause Moscow to redouble security at its nuclear facilities and go percent of Russians surveyed to say they fear the possibility.' Such threats on both sides may also be merely rhetorical, but it is an exceedingly dangerous rhetoric never before heard. If nothing else, there has been more loose talk in Russia since 1999 about using nuclear weapons than measures to .prevent loose nukes. And it will likely increase if the Chechens expand their new guerrilla tactics farther into Russia itself, as they have promised to do. And so, post-Soviet Russia still matters to America in the most fateful of ways. The Clinton administration has worsened the dangers incalculably by taking step after step that pushes a Russia coming apart at the nuclear seams to rely more and more on its nuclear stockpiles and infrastructures-by making financial aid conditional on economic &quot;reforms&quot; that impoverished and destabilized the state; by expanding NATO's mili­tary might virtually to Russia's borders; by provocative­ly demonstrating during the bombing of Yugoslavia the overwhelming superiority of U.S. conventional weapons; and more recently by threatening to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in order to build a missile defense system. Rarely, if ever, has there been such a reckless official disregard for U.S. national security or leadership failure to tell the American people about growing threats to their well-being. The Clinton administration and its many supporters in the media, think tanks, and acade­mia never seem to connect the dots between their mis­sionary zeal in Russia and the grave dangers being compounded there. In early 2000, one of the crusade's leading policymakers suddenly told us, after seven years of &quot;happy talk,&quot; that &quot;disasters are inescapable in the short run.&quot; He neglected to say that the disaster is unfolding in a country laden with twentieth-century devices of mass destruction and regressing toward the nineteenth century.&quot; Russia's potential for lethal catastrophies is the most important but not the only reason it still matters. Even in crises and weakness, Russia remains a great power because of its sheer size, which stretches across eleven time zones from Finland and Poland (if we consider Belarus) to China and nearby Alaska; its large portions of the world's energy and mineral reserves; its long his­tory of world-class achievements and power; its highly educated present-day citizens; and, of course, its arse­nals. All this makes Russia inherently not only a major power but a semi-global one. A &quot;world without Russia&quot; would therefore be globalization, to take the concept du jour, without a large part of the globe. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Nor can many large international problems and con­flicts be resolved without Russia</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, especially in a &quot;post-Cold War order&quot; that has at least as much inter­national anarchy as order. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">From the Balkans</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> and the Caspian <strong>to China and Iraq, from nuclear proliferation to</strong> conventional-arms transfers, from <strong>the environment</strong> <strong>and terrorism</strong> to drug trafficking and money laundering, <strong>Russia retains a capacity to affect world affairs for better or worse</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. On the one hand, it was Moscow's diplo­matic intervention in Yugoslavia in 1999 that enabled a desperate Clinton administration to avoid sending American ground troops to Kosovo. On the other, the 1990s also brought the passage of narcotics westward across Russian territory, a flood of illegal Russian money into U.S. banks, and growing markets for Moscow's weapons and nuclear capabilities among states that already worry Washington.&quot; And then there are the vast geopolitical ramifications of developments in what is still the world's largest ter­ritorial country. Nearly a fourth of planet Earth's pop­ulation lives on the borders of the Russian Federation, including most of its major religions and many of its ethnic identities. Many, if not all, of these nations and peoples are likely to be directly or indirectly affected by what happens in post-Communist Russia, again for bet­ter or worse-first and foremost the &quot;near abroad,&quot; as Moscow calls the other fourteen former Soviet republics, but not them alone. Finally, there is a crucial futuristic reason why U.S. policy toward Russia must be given the highest priori­ty and changed fundamentally. Contrary to those Amer­icans who have &quot;rushed to relegate </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Russia</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">to the archives,&quot; believing it will always be enfeebled and may even break into more pieces, that longtime superpower</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">will eventually recover from its present time of troubles</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, as it did after the revolution and civil war of 1917-21, indeed as it always has. But what kind of political state will rise from its knees? One that is democratic or despotic? One open to the West and eager to play a cooperative role in world affairs--or one bent on revising an international order shaped during its weakness and at its expense? One safeguarding and reducing its nuclear stockpiles or one multiplying and proliferating them among states that want them? </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The outcome will depend very significantly on how Russia is treated</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> during its present-day agony, particularly <strong>by the U</strong>nited <strong>S</strong>tates. Whether it is treated wisely and compassionately or is bullied and humiliated</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, as a growing number of Russians believe they have been since the early 1990s. The next American president may make that decision, but our children and grandchildren will reap the benefits or pay the price. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">The collective nature of the dialogue is also important because these arms sales are wasteful if Washington does not use its political capital to demand interoperable systems and joint-training programs. Three years into the Gulf Security Dialogue, there are signs that joint defense cooperation is taking root. In June, Gates praised &quot;the unprecedented cooperation between the nations of the gulf.&quot;[36] Indeed, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">GCC states are pursuing shared early warning and active defense systems</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, increasing membership in U.S.-backed nonproliferation efforts such as the Proliferation Security Initiative, signing energy memoranda of understanding, and building on joint exercises like January's joint combined security exercise in Kuwait.[37] </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">A</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">nother <strong>key component of the dialogue is psychological</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The Bush administration used the Gulf Security Dialogue &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">to convey the U.S. commitment to the</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> peace and <strong>security of</strong> our <strong>GCC allies</strong> as well as encourage regional partners to take the steps necessary to address regional challenges</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot;[38] </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Reinforcing U.S. commitment to defense of the GCC would cement alliances and give the regional Arab leaders the security to side with the U</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates. As President Bush explained in his 2008 state of the union address, &quot;We will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf.&quot;[39] These vital interests are collective. Just as Bush declared a free Iraq to be &quot;a friend of America, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world,&quot;[40] so too is a GCC united against Iranian schemes on the Persian Gulf. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Such moral clarity helps dispel </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the competitive monarchies' natural aversion to defense cooperation</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Al-Ubeid air base in Qatar and its logistics hub in Kuwait, for example, are crucial for operations in Iraq but would not exist if their host states did not sense a U.S. commitment to solidarity against mutual threats.

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">President Barack Obama’s wrongheaded Iran strategy virtually guarantees long-term damaging economic, geopolitical and security consequences for America, the Middle East and the world. He needs to wake up to the fact </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Iran is at war with America and we are losing</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">—badly</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Consider four areas where Iran is winning and why Obama's misguided strategy—sanctions, talk, and “hope” for a revolution inside Iran—is losing the war, the likely consequences, and what we ought to do. First, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Iran is rapidly expanding its influence across the Middle East by force, intimidation and persuasion</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Former Secretary of Defense Robert </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Gates told Bloomberg.com that Iran “didn’t create the Arab Spring </span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">[the populist revolts against authoritarian rule sweeping the region] </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">or start it, but they are clearly trying to exploit it wherever they can</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">,” even in Iraq and Afghanistan. This spring, Tehran increased its deadly aid to our enemies in both Iraq and Afghanistan to hurry our anticipated withdrawal. “</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Iran is very directly supporting extremist Shiite groups, which are killing our troops,” said</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Adm. Mike </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Mullen</span></u>​<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">There is no question they are shipping high-tech weapons in there</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">,” the chairman said, “and the forensics proves that.” Last week </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The Wall Street Journal reported that </span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps​ (</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">IRGC) ships arms to our enemy in Afghanistan</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> too. For example, in February, the British forces in Afghanistan intercepted a shipment of sophisticated rockets near the Iranian border. The Iranian-made rockets have an estimated range of about 13 miles, double the capability of most others in the Taliban’s arsenal. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The Arab Spring is better known for uprisings in countries such as Bahrain. Iran sent its terrorist proxy Hezbollah to help Bahraini Shia organize an uprising to topple that Sunni-dominated government</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. But Saudi Arabia intervened with 1,000 troops to help quell the unrest. Last week</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Ramin </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Mehmanparsat demanded Saudi Arabia withdraw its forces from Bahrain and “prepare the ground for regional cooperation</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; Surprisingly </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the Saudis withdrew some troops, likely because they know we are leaving the region and they must work with the hegemonic Persians</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Iranian officials are also “attempting to influence the political process in Egypt through efforts to connect with the Muslim Brotherhood</span></u>​<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">,” testified Israel’s military intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi​, before a Knesset committee, according to the Jerusalem Post. Kochavi said the Brotherhood, a radical Islamic group, is pressing for elections to take place as soon as possible, because it is “the only group that’s ready for elections.” A victory for the Muslim Brotherhood would be a blow to Israel (likely the peace treaty with Egypt would be abandoned), and the U.S. and Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan fear Egypt will emerge as a radical Islamist state like Iran. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The IRGC is also helping Syrian dictator President Bashar al-Assad to disperse demonstrations using lessons learned during Iran’s 2009 Green Revolution</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">, the bloody period following Iran’s disputed presidential election.

<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">During the Cold War, the technological supremacy of the U.S. industrial base enabled the Pentagon and the Intelligence Community to field systems much more advanced than those of the Soviet Union.</span> <u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Although the U</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited</span> <u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates</span> <u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">continues to enjoy technological leadership,</span></u><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> our share of satellite manufacturing has steadily declined since the end of the Cold War</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> (Figure 2; note that 2009 appears to be an anomaly because of the unusually large number of spacecraft delivered to replenish commercial satellite fleets). As a result,</span> <u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">advanced capabilities are more diffuse</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. For example, the precise navigation and timing data transmitted by the U.S. Air Force operated Global Positioning System (GPS) is a capability that will soon be replicated by Europe’s Galileo, Russia’s Glonass, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi Zenith, and India’s Regional Navigation System. More broadly,</span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">space-enabled information and services that were once the exclusive province of the national security community are now available commercially</span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.

<u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The Pentagon’s first National Security Space Strategy and its recently released budget request for space are attempting <strong>to prioritize procurement</strong> and operations <strong>after a decade of problematic performance</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. But work still needs to be done. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The Air Force’s unclassified space budget saw a nearly 10% boost in fiscal 2012</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">—to $8.7 billion—from the $8 billion request in fiscal 2011. A portion of this is intended to increase and stabilize the buy of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV) as the government assumes the role of sole supporter of the United Launch Alliance and its massive industrial base in light of an unrealized commercial market. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Even with the boost in funding</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. James Cartwright says that </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the projects now scheduled are impossible to execute within the current planning figures</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. This, he says, underscores the need to work with international partners in areas such as space situational awareness, communications and, perhaps, shared missile warning. “We still can’t afford most of the constellations we have up there. . . . At some point you have to come to a position of partnering” to share the financial burden, Cartwright said last week. “We have this construct where we believe everything has got to come from us . . . but we fight in combined constructs” on the ground, at sea and in the air. He advocates for trust with partners to also provide key pieces of space capabilities—such as augmented intelligence collection and, possibly, precision navigation and timing signals. He stopped short, however, of suggesting that the Pentagon could curtail its buy of Global Positioning System III satellites, being developed by Lockheed Martin; this request is for $978 million in development and procurement. Perhaps underscoring the fact that Pentagon leadership still lacks a unified view on this subject, Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn notes that some missions will continue to be handled solely by the U.S., though the “goal is to move away from the world where the U.S. develops unilateral strategy.” Thus, his focus appears to be more on collaboration rather than interdependence. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Another initiative in the National Security Space Strategy is to improve support for the space industrial base, which experts worry has atrophied since the end of the Cold War</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Lynn says </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the U.S. is still the top provider of space capabilities, but</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> that </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">its share of the market is waning. Previously, the U.S. comprised about 66% of the space market; that figure is now less than 40%</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The Air Force’s approach for military space spending is to buy smarter, beginning with more stable and predictable funding</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Gone are the days when the Air Force would simply put a “wedge” of funding into the budget for a program without fully understanding the out-year financial impact. “We need to fully fund programs,” says Maj. Gen. John Hyten, space program director for the Air Force acquisition office. “We don’t want to just put numbers in the budget.” </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Included in the fiscal 2012 budget request is a new strategy to procure satellites, the</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency (</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">EASE</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">) </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">buy of</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> Advanced, Extremely High-Frequency (</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">AEHF</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">) </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">and</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> Space-Based Infrared System (</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Sbirs) satellites</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, both produced at Lockheed Martin’s Sunnyvale, Calif., facility. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The three-pronged EASE strategy includes stable funding for a block buy of two of each satellite type; parallel funding provided separately for continued product improvement and research work</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> (including competitive projects) </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">for the next-generation upgrades or designs; and parallel work on the mission area’s architecture</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Implementation of the procurement portion of EASE is fashioned somewhat after multi-year buys for aircraft. The goal is to incrementally fund buys of two satellites at a time to keep a stable stream of income for the prime contractor and its base of subcontractors, all of which lead to some savings</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. As with aircraft procurements, the goal is to achieve at least 10% savings in the cost of the satellites, but Hyten believes they can get even lower than that. “You take the savings that you find in terms of lower cost on the satellite and reinvest them through a capabilities improvement program,” says Erin Conaton, undersecretary of the Air Force. The Air Force would traditionally spend about $4 billion buying AEHF 5 and 6, Hyten says. In fiscal 2012, it is requesting $550 million as an initial payment for these two satellites; additional funding would be requested up through fiscal 2017 to complete the buys. The Sbirs block buy would follow, beginning in fiscal 2013. The request related to EASE in fiscal 2012 is for $185 million. A major chunk, $550 million, would be requested in fiscal 2013 with five more years of additional funding to complete the buy. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Though multi-year funding has become a regular practice for military aircraft production, lawmakers might eye an incremental satellite funding strategy with more skepticism. The Air Force lacks examples of satellite programs delivering on time and cost, and lawmakers are leery of obligating future funds for projects. “<strong>This is asking Congress to do business in a different way</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">,” Hyten says. Conaton says </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">AEHF</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> and <strong>Sbirs</strong> <strong>were</strong> both <strong>at key points in their production cycles, allowing for them to serve as the pathfinders for EASE</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. However, Congress is expected to review this request this summer, well before the Pentagon has a chance to demonstrate the capabilities of the first AEHF and Sbirs satellites produced with development funding. Officials say that </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">if the EASE concept is accepted by Congress, they plan to implement the strategy for other programs</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">, including</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> Boeing’s </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Wideband Global Satcom and</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> Lockheed Martin’s </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">GPS III</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">Throughout World War II, Vannevar Bush directed the immensely successful Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). The agency was winding down when, in fall 1946, Bush articulated his startling observation: World War II was the first war in human history to be affected decisively by weapons unknown at the outbreak of hostilities. This is probably the most significant military fact of our decade: that </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">upon the current evolution of the instrumentalities of war, the strategy and tactics of warfare must now be conditioned. In World War II this new situation demanded a closer linkage among military men, scientists, and industrialists than had ever before been required, primarily because the new weapons whose evolution determines the course of war are dominantly the products of science</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, as is natural in an essentially scientific and technological age.1 Throughout the Cold War, the linkages of which Dr. Bush spoke were nurtured and strengthened. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Since the</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, which marked the </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">end of the Cold War, these linkages and their supporting infrastructures have begun to fray. This breakdown is a cause for alarm because today, just as in the 1940s, scientific advances and technological innovations are the foundation upon which the great military transformations of the 21st century will depend</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The world is again on the precipice of instability. During the 1990s, armies throughout most of the world were not posted on front lines engaging in mortal combat, nor were the inhabitants of great nations living in constant fear of immediate and deadly attack</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Societies were stable, and people throughout most of the world went about their daily lives unfettered by external military threats. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">This did not mean</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, however, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">that humankind had eradicated armed conflict, nor that conflicting national vital interests would never again lead to global wars. One need only to look at the current situation in the Middle East, some parts of Africa, or some areas of the Balkans to see conflict brewing</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Indeed, on September 11, 2001, a new episode of active conflict was begun. With the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York and the attacks on the Pentagon and aboard United Flight 93, a new wave of asymmetric violence was unleashed on the world. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The global security environment is ever changing, and</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> all aspects of our military structure are undergoing dramatic transformations to remain at the vanguard of peace and security</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Our forces again have been deployed to foreign shores to thwart a military adversary attempting to undermine the goals of the Nation. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">If these transformations are to succeed, the processes used to acquire the new tools of war</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">, as well as the</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> research and development (<strong>R&amp;D</strong>) <strong>infrastructure upon which they depend, must be transformed</strong> to meet the emerging requirements. <strong>Links between the military, the scientific communities, and the industrial communities are more vital now than they have ever been</strong>.

This chapter examines four R&amp;D issues that enable rapid procurement and introduces a few policy options available to ensure that advanced technology development remains available to defense planners. We examine the role of the internal defense R&amp;D infrastructure, the industrial R&amp;D infrastructure, and the processes that have been established to link R&amp;D outputs closely with rapid procurement, fielding of new technologies and systems, and the effect of major program acquisition strategies on research and development. Background What was startling and revolutionary 55 years ago is ordinary and commonplace today. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">New instrumentalities of war are routinely introduced into each new conflict. Weapons, tactics, and strategies that were introduced into one conflict may be decisive factors in the next war and be mainstream tools by the following one</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Concepts that are decisive in a target-rich environment require fundamentally different tools in a target-sparse environment. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The rest of the world studies U.S. procedures and develops asymmetrical responses for the next conflict</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. In short, although the arms race associated with the attrition-based strategy of the Cold War era may be over, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the technological race associated with the information-based strategy of the current era is just beginning. If the technology gap is sufficiently large, information-based strategies may prove decisive in network-centric warfare environments. Should this gap close, with the adversary successfully utilizing symmetric information warfare strategies or asymmetric strategies, the network-centric environment collapses and becomes a classical attrition-warfare environment. <strong>Maintaining a U.S. advantage requires constant improvements, which depend</strong> in turn <strong>on r</strong>esearch <strong>and d</strong>evelopment</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Internal Research and Development Infrastructure Since the earliest days of the Nation, the military services have owned and operated their own internal R&amp;D facilities in conjunction with the old arsenal system. Today, all of the services have organizations that sponsor and facilities that perform science and technology (S&amp;T) research. The Army Research Laboratory, the Naval Research Laboratory, and the Air Force Research Laboratory are the core internal S&amp;T labs for their respective services. The Office of Naval Research and the Offices of Scientific Research for the Army and Air Force sponsor S&amp;T research, utilizing universities to conduct most of the research. In addition to the primary S&amp;T labs, all of the services also operate a number of research facilities tied to their system acquisition commands. For example, the Naval Sea Systems Command manages the labs associated with the Naval Surface Warfare Center and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. The Army’s Tank and Automotive Command manages a vehicle R&amp;D lab; the Air Force manages aeronautics and avionics R&amp;D labs throughout the country. The daily activities at the in-house defense research laboratories are governed by three key forces: priorities and policies established by the chain-of-command authorities, program requirements established by paying sponsors, and external constraints such as environmental limitations imposed by other regulatory and policymaking organizations. By controlling or influencing any or all of these elements, the Army, Navy, and Air Force can influence their laboratories to serve their current and emerging priorities. However, even in a single service, no single person or institution controls all three of these forces. As a result, a dynamic mix of competing forces combines to form a swirl of ever-changing activity at each of the research labs. It is precisely this high level of seemingly chaotic activity that, when properly managed, gives the labs an exceptional degree of agility and flexibility. These qualities allow the labs, quickly and efficiently, to create, analyze, and synthesize new ideas and concepts that become the bases of new and innovative military systems. This same behavior, if not skillfully administered, can also lead to inefficiencies, irrelevancies, and redundancies within the labs. Thus, the service laboratories’ ability to perform their critical role—bonding military requirements, scientific knowledge, and technological innovation to create useful and achievable military system concepts—depends directly on their leaders’ ability to balance the multiplicity of forces acting on their labs. These internal R&amp;D labs have traditionally focused their efforts on supporting the major acquisition programs within their parent commands. As military transformation progresses, all the services are generating radically new system requirements. To support the emerging military missions outlined in chapter 1, smaller, lighter, and more agile major systems are being demanded throughout the military. As discussed in more detail in chapter 2, the sensing, communication, and information processing subsystem requirements necessary to support the major systems are also being rapidly transformed, demanding the latest cutting-edge technologies to sustain them. The rapid pace of technological advancement and of identifying emerging system and subsystem requirements to support the military transformation is redefining the role of internal defense research facilities. Scientists are being called upon to examine new areas of study, to focus on extremely rapid transition from concept to fielded system, and to integrate modern high-tech concepts with legacy fleet systems. This approach presents a dilemma analogous to issues faced in the procurement world. In the constrained resource environment of the defense laboratory system, spending funds on improving legacy systems leaves little money to fund leading-edge transformation-enabling technologies. If the funds are diverted to transformation-enabling technologies, legacy improvement research is curtailed. Since the source of funding for the labs is usually major system program offices, almost all of which are developing systems introduced before DOD embarked on its current military transformation process, the labs are often directed to focus their expertise on legacy and evolutionary improvement programs. To change this focus, new sources of funding must be identified, or funding from legacy-related systems must be redirected. Both these cases present issues that are extremely complex but that must be overcome by the research facilities. For example, people, skills, and facilities may be mismatched as a laboratory changes its focus. The testing facilities important for the development of tracked vehicles may be a burden to maintain as the research shifts to developing wheeled vehicles. People with vast experience developing avionics for manned aircraft may be less capable of conducting leading-edge research in avionics for unmanned aircraft. In light of all these issues, attention must be paid to maintaining the true technological leadership needed to enable the ongoing military transformation. Technological Leadership </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Maintaining a true technological lead, as a nation, is a very complex process. It requires continuous, careful orchestration of numerous enterprises, both public and private</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Over 4,000 governmental organizations in the United States sponsor or conduct scientific research;2 DOD alone accounts for over 700 of them. Almost 2,000 U.S. university facilities are involved in the conduct of scientific research.3 In 1947, DOD was spending around $3 billion for R&amp;D activities. Today, it spends around $48 billion per year.4 Although this level of spending should be sufficient to keep the military equipped and trained to use systems at the leading edge of technology, many disparate forces keep us from reaching that elusive goal. Because the $48 billion is spread across many organizations and is managed by many different constituencies, appropriating the level of funding necessary to carry out adequate and timely research for a specific project is often difficult. In addition, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">since Federal funding of research is an element of the political process, <strong>funding decisions are made on an annual basis</strong>, sometimes <strong>to the detriment of the long-term stability of the project’s funding</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Workforce Issues Workforce issues of particular concern include the aging of a trained and expert workforce without replenishment; pay disparities at entry level, compared to the private sector; a less-than-optimal apprenticeship or mentoring system; and decaying infrastructure. Aging Workforce Since World War II, government laboratories have hired scientists and engineers in waves. Major hiring occurred in the late 1940s and early 1950s as the defense establishments sought to capture the expertise developed during the war and to follow the guidance of research policy experts to strengthen the permanent research establishment lest the country face another deficit of science like that encountered before the war. Another significant hiring spell took place during the early 1960s as the Soviet launch of Sputnik led to a national focus on science and engineering as the solution to society’s ills. The government found a window of opportunity to hire another wave of researchers in the early 1970s as the commercial market for these professionals dried up and vast numbers were laid off as a result of the dramatic decline of the aerospace industry. When the Vietnam War was in full swing, the government had an immediate need for scientific and engineering talent but had a difficult time competing with the aerospace and burgeoning electronics industries for workers. When the commercial industries collapsed, the government took advantage of the situation and filled its labs with new talent. There was another small window of hiring during the early 1980s as President Ronald Reagan led a dramatic defense buildup. The early 1990s saw a small bulge in hiring to begin replacing retiring scientists and engineers who had been hired in the late 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. However, it did not begin to approach the necessary replenishment level. Entry-Level Pay Disparity Since the first Bush administration, the wide pay disparity at the entry-level and early-career level between engineers and scientists employed in the Federal Government and those employed in the private sector has been recognized. This incongruity was particularly acute during the high-tech boom of the 1990s. Starting salaries for government employees were 20 to 40 percent lower than those offered by the high-tech industry, whose appetite for technical talent seemed insatiable. This phenomenon was not limited to government employees; it affected the private-sector defense industry as well. Since many major defense contractors use pay scales closely associated with their counterpart government partners, they too had great difficulty attracting new entry-level technical talent for their research positions. Even universities found themselves losing the hiring competition for newly graduated scientists and engineers. The salaries and benefits that Internet startup companies offered were so great that new graduates naturally gravitated toward them. In the year 2000, the high-tech boom began to turn to a high-tech bust. The marketplace was oversaturated with venture capital and other investment money. Companies could not always produce what they had promised, and even when they did, consumers did not buy their products. As a result, many high-tech companies went out of business, and thousands of engineers and scientists lost their jobs. Thus, as in the early 1970s when the aerospace industry collapsed, employment with the government and the defense industry (with the long-term stability it has come to represent) once again began to look attractive to engineers and scientists. However, unlike the early 1970s, neither the government nor the defense industry in general was in a hiring mode. They were still responding to the reduced budgets and associated workloads associated with the post-Cold War drawdown. Low Turnover and Poor Apprenticeship Relationships As in many other professions, the ability to conduct scientific research and technology development is fostered through a long apprenticeship program. The scientific method, the basis of scientific study and peer review, is a process that demands that new scientific discoveries build upon the old. Without a continuous flow of new people, knowledge of the art of science cannot be passed from one generation to the next. Since the early 1980s, there have been no significant hiring waves of scientists and engineers, other than the very small one of the early 1990s. Even this period came to an abrupt halt when programs began to be canceled and bases began to be closed as the Cold War came to an end. As a result, members of the scientific and engineering workforce today are on average in their late 40s. Many of these people are in their professional prime. This is the time they should be working with a new crop of apprentices to train the next generation of professionals. However, there are few apprentices on the payroll to work with. With nearly 60 percent of the current workforce eligible to retire within 5 years and very few new scientists entering the system, the defense research establishment is already facing severe problems in keeping up with the latest technologies and scientific discoveries. Decaying Infrastructure Leading-edge enterprises get to the top and stay there by having leading-edge facilities, but scarcity of recapitalization funds and rapid advances in technology complicate the process of keeping the defense research infrastructure current. The budget available to the defense research establishment for overhead, including infrastructure capitalization, is at best stable and is in many cases diminishing. At the same time, lab facilities and equipment are both aging and becoming obsolete. As new technologies are developed, new equipment and advanced facilities are required to pursue research. Advanced visualization tools—for example, those that allow scientists to see the effects of structural modifications on turbulence reductions—greatly enhance the research capability of the lab but cost an enormous amount of money. Such money is not normally budgeted into the research program, but without this equipment, the lab ceases to be a state-of-the-art facility capable of performing leading-edge research. Like the debate in the healthcare industry over how many expensive pieces of equipment are needed in each city and where they should be placed, the defense research establishment is faced with the dilemma of where to situate its scarce infrastructure resources. When a new but very expensive investigative tool is developed that directly supports the defense research mission, where should it be located? The tool could be placed in a government laboratory, with access provided to both university researchers and defense contractor researchers. It could be placed at a university, with access available to government and contractor researchers. It could be placed at contractor facilities, with access granted to both university and government researchers. This debate raises the question of research facility rationalization, part of a larger process: the whole defense establishment in the United States is currently working through the issues associated with infrastructure rationalization. How many military bases should we have to support the future defense force structure? What is the appropriate mix of public and private facilities necessary to support the defense mission? The research establishment is part of this debate. It is looking at issues such as¹what mix of university, private industry, and government research facilities is appropriate and necessary to support the defense research mission of the transforming force structures. Defense Research Industrial Base in Support of Transformation The defense research industrial base is undergoing dramatic changes as rapidly as the internal research infrastructure is. Indeed, the whole defense industrial base is being consolidated and redefined as a result of the post-Cold War defense downsizing. In the early 1990s, the government reassessed its defense procurement requirements and acquisition budgets. As a result, the defense market power shrank relative to the overall economy, and industry reacted by significantly consolidating across many product lines. Only four major prime contractors remain of over 50 separate companies that supported aerospace defense requirements in 1990 (see figure 14-1). Companies in the defense industry reacted to the post-Cold War drawdown by adopting one of three strategies: exiting the military-industrial sector; diversifying into nonmilitary production or services; or remaining in the defense industry and expanding military production. The government reacted by relaxing antitrust rule interpretations, defining competitive markets on a global basis, encouraging global competition, promoting consolidations where economies of scale matter, and transferring system-integration function and expertise from the government to prime contractors. The effect of these practices and policies was to reduce significantly the number of industrial facilities available to engage in defense research. In addition, the government no longer encouraged industrial companies to use their own funds to support research programs with the hope of being rewarded with large procurement contracts. The research and procurement of many systems were decoupled. One other factor influenced industrial research: the consolidation of the industrial base left many of the largest companies with enormous debts that needed to be serviced from their current cash flow. This caused some companies to reduce their internal expenditures—in some cases, research expenditures—in many areas that did not directly contribute to near-term revenue. Both the government and its industrial partners are developing processes to link research activities that support the military transformation process closely to the industrial base that will be required to manufacture the systems and provide them to the deployed forces. Rapid Fielding of New Technologies and Systems During the 1990s, to provide a means for rapidly fielding new concepts, DOD and the services introduced several significant transition processes. In the early 1990s, Advanced Technology Demonstrations were introduced and managed by the individual services to identify and demonstrate technologies that showed great promise to serve urgent operational needs. In 1994, DOD introduced the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTD) program to “allow users to gain an understanding of proposed new capabilities for which there is no user experience base.” The Joint Staff established Joint Experimentation Programs in 1998 to allow operational forces to experiment with novel technological advances to compress the time required to field advanced capabilities. This process provides a means of getting technological advances rapidly into the hands of the fighting forces, even before initiation of formal procurement actions. In addition, in the late 1990s, the Navy introduced the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program to link the research community and the operating forces. Both the Air Force and the Army are currently working on similar programs. At the policy level, the concepts of reconstitution, “develop and hold,” and acquisition reform tended to dominate. Implementation and ramifications of some sort of reconstitution policy set the research agenda. How can the research infrastructure be shaped so that future military systems will retain an enduring technological edge even as the force structure and its supporting elements are being reduced? A proposed solution to this issue was a policy recommendation that the United States continue to develop advanced military systems, bringing them completely through the concept and development phase all the way up to the actual full-scale procurement phase. At this point, the program would be shelved and the system procurement package would await a future time when pressing operational requirements would necessitate actual procurement. This proposed develop-and-hold policy was the source of numerous debates. Neither the operational forces nor the research communities felt it was an optimum solution. From these debates, a new policy issue emerged: How could the research infrastructure, needed as a foundation during some future reconstitution phase, be preserved if current requirements and budgets could not support its ongoing operations? The formal policy of encouraging and even mandating technology transfer to civilian uses emerged as the most promising solution to this issue. Under this scenario, government researchers would develop intellectual property that could be licensed to commercial enterprises in return for a stream of royalty payments made to the government research facility. The nonappropriated, privately secured royalties would be used to help maintain the research facility, supplementing the federally appropriated funds it normally receives for this purpose. Over time, however, it appeared that depending on nondefense organizations to support the defense research infrastructure was not going to be a viable policy. Toward the end of the decade, acquisition reform took hold as the primary formal means of rapidly linking advanced research developments and emerging operational requirements. The acquisition process was to be transformed from a linear sequence—develop, procure, create operational doctrine, and train forces to use the system—to a nonlinear, concurrent process: develop system and doctrine together, procure, and train together. This was aimed at considerably compressing the time from concept identification to actual field operation. Advanced Technology Demonstrations In the early 1990s, the defense research community faced a difficult and unforeseen challenge. Basic and early applied research programs were being reduced in scope or eliminated just as they were reaching maturity. Many new research programs had been started or old ones enhanced during the strong defense buildup of the mid-1980s. By the early 1990s, many of these programs were at the point of fruition but had not yet fully matured when the programs they were meant to support were eliminated. The technology was still showing great promise, but program managers were hard-pressed to show how the fully developed technologies could transition into ongoing procurement programs. Without the ability to show a clear transition path, even very promising research programs were in danger of being canceled. To remedy this, the Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) process was established. The purpose of the ATD process was to identify the most promising technological advancements being made in the ongoing research programs and to fund them fully (around $15 million) for 3 years in order to develop their potential on an extraordinary fast track. Each service allocated a percentage of its annual research budget to fund a few of the highest-priority ATDs. Each service also developed its own method for choosing which programs would be funded as ATDs, but all of them required a firm link between the researchers and potential users of the technology. Most programs funded under the ATD program had a program manager of an ongoing acquisition program who would commit both philosophically and fiscally to use the technology at the end of the ATD program if it lived up to its expectations. Over the years, many successful transitions were made from ATDs to system procurements. For example, the Advanced Enclosed Mast/Sensor built by Ingalls Shipyard and installed on the Navy destroyer USS Radford at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard was developed as an ATD by the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division; it is currently specified for inclusion on all LPD-17 class ships.5 Because of the instability of the overall defense procurement budgets, however, some ATDs that were successful as research programs were never fully integrated into procurement programs. Even in these cases, the ATD process proved useful. Researchers were encouraged to meet with acquisition program sponsors and operating forces to examine how advancements in technology could serve the needs of the operating forces. This alone went a long way to help reshape many research programs to be more responsive to emerging operational requirements, even if the proposed ATDs were not approved for funding. Some limitations to the ATD process pointed to the need to reexamine its scope. Although the typical funding of $15 million was a large sum of money for some research programs, it became clear that the ATD process could not fully support advances in computer technology, communications, and data fusion and processing technologies as these grew during the 1990s. Meanwhile, commercial enterprises matured these technologies without defense sponsorship. DOD therefore began looking for ways to capture these new concepts and demonstrate their utility for defense-related requirements. Advanced Concept Technology Development DOD introduced the ACTD program in early 1994 to help encourage and expedite the rapid transition of emerging matured technologies from researchers and developers to the operational users. Since the ACTD process focused on matured technologies, it emphasized technology assessment and integration over technology development. Nonetheless, it served as an interim step from the research lab to the operational field. A typical ACTD lasts about 4 years and operates on a budget of approximately $100 million. Another significant feature of an ACTD is that, by definition, it has some level of jointness built into it. The concept that an ACTD is demonstrating must contribute to the mission of more than one service. Each of the participating services is required to partially fund the program with its own funds. The goal of an ACTD is to provide operational commanders with actual prototypes of advanced systems that demonstrate unique military capabilities. Having prototypes gives the operational commanders a way to evaluate and indeed shape the potential system’s ability to meet operational needs. It also allows commanders to develop and refine a concept of operations to exploit the capability under evaluation. As the operating forces gain experience and understanding of the capability through realistic military demonstrations of prototype systems, they are better able to assess the military efficacy of the proposed capability. A number of successful capabilities have been evaluated and shaped through the ACTD process. The medium-altitude endurance unmanned aerial vehicle, Predator, was one of the earliest ACTDs to be funded. It was flown and operated in Bosnia even before the ACTD was over, and it has been used extensively in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. It has since transitioned into a mainstream acquisition program. The ACTD process has proven quite effective at identifying emerging technological capabilities with high potential operational application. It gives the services an opportunity to test an application before buying it. In the environment of very rapidly changing technology advancements, however, the process can seem slow; one must first build a prototype system, deploy it to the field, develop concepts of operation for its use, conduct operations with the system, and then evaluate its military effectiveness. By the time this process has been completed, it may be difficult and expensive to modify the system to take advantage of the knowledge gained during the demonstration phase. Joint Experimentation Program Toward the end of the decade, the Joint Staff introduced the Joint Experimentation program. The purpose of joint experimentation is to examine new technologies, operational concepts, and force structure (organization) options together rather than in isolation from one another to discover and develop advances in warfighting capabilities. Joint experimentation allows warfighters access to new technologies before systems utilizing them are fully developed. In this way, operational commanders can assess the utility of emerging technologies and modify the technological developments early in the development process so that they will be more useful to the operating forces. The Joint Experimentation Office (J-9) was established in Norfolk, Virginia, to manage the program. It gives the research community a new way to link closely with the operational forces. Concepts identified in the research lab can be introduced into the joint experimentation process even before they are fully developed. This allows the researcher to understand whether the concept is worth pursuing from a military perspective, and, if it is, which aspects should be emphasized. In addition, it allows the operating forces to see developments in the research lab long before they are available for field use. This gives forces the opportunity to begin developing doctrine and training programs while the concept is still being developed. It also allows the operational forces to have more direct input into the direction that research programs will take. All three of these technology transition processes have helped both the researchers and the operational forces link to focus their efforts and set priorities for the use of scarce research budgets. They are only really effective at advancing operational capabilities if they are closely linked to the acquisition and procurement process. If great new technologies and capabilities are identified and developed but not procured and fielded, the operational forces cannot take advantage of their capabilities. Acquisition Reform Throughout the past decade, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">acquisition reform has changed the way DOD procures and fields new systems. <strong>Technology was improving so rapidly that</strong> <strong>the traditional acquisition process could not keep pace</strong>. <strong>New</strong> platforms and <strong>systems were being delivered with technology that was obsolete</strong>, expensive to operate, and difficult to maintain</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Utilization of commercial off-the-shelf components made defense systems more dependent on commercial spare parts inventories, and when commercial companies changed their products, defense systems were no longer supportable. To compress the time from approval of an acquisition program to fielding of the operational system and thus speed the time for development, new initiatives were introduced into the acquisition process. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Under the traditional acquisition process, systems were procured in a sequence. First research was done, then the engineering completed, then the system went into production, and finally the system was evaluated by the operating forces and integrated into operational capabilities</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. This process was useful when the technology being integrated into new systems had not yet matured because it ensured that only fully developed technologies were embedded into new systems. However, as ATDs and ACTDs as well as commercial technological advancements began to yield new concepts faster than the traditional process could accommodate them, a new process of concurrent development had to be introduced. Utilizing concurrent development, integrated engineering (supported by ongoing research) and production occurred simultaneously. Like the traditional process, the introduction into operational doctrine and training programs took place after the system was placed in the field. Although this speeded up the process, operational forces had few feedback loops to the developers to help shape the systems to the operators’ needs. This process did, however, allow the efficient integration of ATDs and ACTDs into the acquisition process. After the Joint Experimentation program was introduced, the acquisition process was modified to allow for direct transition from ATDs and ACTDs into production, coupled closely with user input throughout the process. Utilizing an experimentation-demonstration-acquisition process, integrated engineering (supported by ongoing research) and operational evaluation occur simultaneously. Only after the system is refined through the interaction of both the users and the developers is it put into production. Production runs are scheduled and the system is designed so that the latest technology can be integrated into the system during each succeeding run. This methodology links the researchers, developers, and users as never before. Future Naval Capabilities In the late 1990s, the Navy introduced a new process for closely coupling its research activity with the requirements of its operating forces. Supporting all of the ongoing research activities at levels high enough to ensure that significant progress could be achieved in time to influence high-priority naval requirements was impossible with the limited research resources available. To direct its scarce resources, the Navy established the Future Naval Capabilities program. Senior leadership of both the research and the operations communities meet to establish several specific research priorities. This priority-setting process enables the Navy to focus its resources and attention on significant projects. The close coupling of the research and operations community ensures that the research directly supports emerging operational requirements and the Navy transformation process. The Army, through its Future Combat System focus, and the Air Force, through its Lightning Bolts and Agile Acquisition initiatives, are currently employing comparable priority-setting procedures within their research communities. Acquisition Strategy and Research and Development </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Many platform acquisition programs are experimenting with practices derived from private industry, delegating the jobs of developing, identifying, and specifying advanced technological solutions to the prime contractor</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Rather than specifying the details of platform procurement, the government sets the performance specification and asks the prime vendor to deliver a platform that performs as requested. Private industry uses this process as the primary means of acquisition, paying the vendor only after the product is tested and delivered. In contrast, the government usually pays the vendor progress payments, so that by the end of the procurement, the vendor has been paid 90 percent of the cost of the item. Under this practice, the government assumes the risk of, but does not have the same level of control over, the internal decisions. An attribute of the new acquisition strategy is that the government assigns the role of product and process development, including the supporting research, to the prime vendor. Research funds that in the past were provided to in-house government research laboratories are now given directly to the prime vendors. This process has both positive and negative attributes. Directly funding the prime vendors assures a very close coupling of the research with product development. It enables the prime vendor to have full control of the research priorities and ensures that the research is focused on current requirements. In contrast, when government labs perform research without prime vendor interaction, the coupling between the progress and results of the research and the needs of the prime vendor may be weak. Differences in management structures have meant that research and production schedules are not always synchronized as well as they could be. Direct funding of research by vendors also produces a few areas of concern for defense research. Three issues include technology migration to other programs, strategic integration across services, and long-term technological stewardship. When research is conducted in a government facility, the results of that research usually are available to any government program that can utilize them. In contrast, the results of research conducted in a private facility utilizing program-specific funding may not be available to competing programs or vendors. In fact, the results may not even be made public; complementing programs might not know they exist. This secrecy has the effect of limiting and constraining technology migration that might otherwise accrue to government-funded research. In the same vein, funding vendors for program-specific research may complicate government efforts to rationalize and prioritize its research programs across all of the military services. Coordinating research programs among the Army, Navy, and Air Force enables all of the services to take advantage of advanced technologies developed by any one of them. To keep the close contact across the services that this type of coordination requires, new management processes will need to be established that recognize the vendors’ role in research priority-setting. DOD and the services’ in-house research laboratories have traditionally been the long-term stewards of the technological disciplines associated with their missions. In between major acquisitions programs, in-house laboratories keep a workforce current with the latest techniques and processes so that when the next program begins, the research does not need to start again. Research is a continuous process, requiring continuity of knowledge, processes, and techniques—and of personnel and the mentor-apprenticeship relationship discussed above. If each new research program is placed at a different facility, based solely on the identity of the prime contractor of a major acquisition program, this continuity will be broken. Diminished Paths for Transition The defense drawdown associated with the end of the Cold War decreased the number of platforms being developed. As a result, there are fewer sponsors of platform-associated research and fewer transition paths for research results to migrate. A typical measure of the effectiveness of a research establishment is how well it contributes to new products. If only one ship is being designed at any one time and a number of organizations are developing new technologies for ships, most of the new concepts will not be integrated into that new class of ship because of scheduling and cost constraints. Thus, utilizing traditional metrics, many of the research programs will be deemed failures due to their inability to transition to production in the near term, even if they have made great scientific or technological discoveries. This stigmatization is an artifact of the different timelines associated with research and acquisition. Research operates in an extended timeframe. Discoveries made today may not be utilized for decades, until some other enabling development allows their potential to be fully exploited. But, when new findings are finally incorporated, they may enable profound advancements in the final products into which they are imbedded. Acquisition programs, on the other hand, operate over relatively shorter time periods. A research program that cannot provide results in time to meet the acquisition program’s tight development schedule will not be utilized in that program. Since, by definition, research discoveries cannot be guaranteed to meet a production schedule, most of the research must be accomplished before the acquisition program needs the results. Often, the basic research must be completed before the acquisition program begins so that the technology developed by the research program can be integrated into a new product. The effect of these different timeframes, coupled with the policy of assigning the research role to the prime vendors, yields another area of concern in the ability of the research establishment to support the ongoing defense transformation. If prime vendors of major acquisition programs are also the primary performers of defense research, new processes will need to be established to ensure continuity of research during the period between acquisition programs. In addition, new processes will need to be established to ensure that the results of government-funded research are made available to all users, not just the single prime vendor who performs the research. While some acquisition programs use direct-vendor funding of research, the practice is not ubiquitous. In many situations, both government in-house laboratories and prime-vendor facilities are performing complementary research. A mix of government, private, and university research is the result. Balancing these to support the transformation of the services is the major challenge of the near future. Business Model While the defense acquisition community is working to ensure that its research establishment is shaped and focused to support the military transformation process, private nondefense high-technology companies are also reexamining their research processes. A primary focus is on rationalizing the “make-versus-buy” decision. Many of the largest and most successful industrial companies, such as RCA and Xerox, have begun divesting themselves of their in-house dedicated research laboratories, while others such as IBM and General Electric continue to support and depend on their world-renowned in-house research facilities. In fast-growing industries, especially the electronics industry, large corporations are increasingly looking outside their walls for new products and processes to offer their customers. For example, other companies initially developed many of the products that are now in Microsoft’s inventory. Like almost all high-tech companies, Microsoft has a staff whose mission is to search the outside world and identify products, processes, services, and companies that complement their product line. When they find something they like, they purchase the rights to use it in Microsoft’s inventory; in some cases, Microsoft purchases the whole company to get access to the new technology. Many opportunities exist for DOD to use this practice to satisfy its technology requirements by looking to independent entrepreneurs and nondefense-related industries for already developed advanced technologies. Policy Options Successful transformation of the military to a knowledge-based force structure requires new operational concepts, new equipment to support them, and new training processes to integrate the operational concepts and advanced equipment with the fighting forces. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Maintaining the technological lead in the U.S. military means that all three factors—concepts, equipment, and training—must be on the forward edge of technology</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Force planners and concept generators must understand what advanced technology solutions can offer, while technologists must comprehend the requirements of emerging operational concepts. Both force planners and technologists need to work with the force trainers to ensure that the fighting forces know how to carry out the advanced operational concepts using advanced equipment suites. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Continuously integrating advanced operational concepts supported by the most advanced technological equipment into U.S. fighting forces is key to sustaining their competitive advantage</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Over the past 50 years, the United States has developed a research and technology infrastructure to nurture and sustain advanced technological development related to the military mission. Many processes were developed to enhance the efficiency of technological transition from the lab to the fighting forces. This is a continuous process that evolves with the changing environment. The most important issue in the current environment, from the technological perspective, is ensuring that forces have operational concepts that enable them to perform their mission and that they have the equipment that most efficiently supports their needs. A fighting unit in the heat of battle does not care who invented the technology they are using or who perfected its integration into warfighting equipment—only that they have it, it works, and they know how to use it. In light of all of the issues and obstacles described in this chapter, it is the responsibility of both the operating and the technology communities to develop processes and procedures aimed at supporting future operations efficiently. Technologists from all different environments must participate. In-house government research labs must identify and integrate advanced technological concepts into advanced fighting equipment to support advanced operational concepts. Universities and other private research organizations participate by conducting the basic-level scientific research from which advanced technological solutions to emerging problems could be developed. Defense contractors take part in developing and incorporating advanced technological concepts into the weapons and platform systems they design and build. Nondefense industrial enterprises have a role to play in inventing and developing advanced technological concepts that, even while supporting their own industries, can be carried over to serve defense requirements. Although many of the policies and processes currently in place remain important and serve to manage the technological integration process, a few improvements should be considered, especially in the areas of workforce stability and integration, as well as technology identification and integration. Workforce Stability and Integration The defense community is facing a crisis concerning its technological workforce as a result of the salary disparity with nondefense private industry and previous hiring patterns. Many senior technologists may leave defense service in the near future, and the mentor-apprentice chain will be broken. The government can do a few things about this.6 Many initiatives related to pay levels and monetary incentives are under consideration already. Supporting these incentives alone is not sufficient. In light of the new environment in which prime vendors are increasingly being assigned more responsibilities with respect to technological development and integration, the government should institute processes that foster mentor-apprenticeships across organizational boundaries. For example, junior engineers and scientists employed by government research labs should be assigned as apprentices to senior technologists and developers employed by prime vendors. Employees of prime vendors should be placed as interns and fellows at government or university facilities. During periods of intense activity in an acquisition program, technologists from government laboratories should be routinely called upon to support the prime vendors. During periods of slack activity between acquisition programs, technologists from the defense industry should be asked to support research at the government laboratories. These processes will ensure that technologists on all sides of the partnership are current and that technology flows freely across organizational boundaries. Technology Identification and Integration Although the existing research and technology infrastructure will remain an important element in the future, new processes must also be developed for rapid identification of technological advances taking place outside of the defense industry that could support advanced operational concepts being developed by the military. Better mechanisms are needed for acquiring and integrating these technological advances into operational concepts. For example, the advances in communications technologies and in power systems (batteries) are taking place rapidly, but U.S. troops sometimes miss the opportunity to use them because the acquisition process can be so cumbersome. Programs such as ACTD and the Joint Experimentation program were developed to help alleviate this problem, but neither of these is a direct acquisition process; both of them are “research” programs. The government should create a direct acquisition process under which “technology spotters” identify products developed in the commercial marketplace, procure them, and integrate them directly into field use. The acquisition funds could continue to be managed by the individual services in accordance with Title 10 rules, but direct linkages would be established between the technology acquisition team and the operating units. This process would not work in every situation; for example, with major platform procurements, the full acquisition and testing processes will always be necessary. However, in a world of rapid technological advancement and standardization, many new products, especially at the subsystem level, could be simply purchased and used immediately in the field. Conclusions In a December 11, 2001, speech to the students at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, 3 months after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, President George W. Bush said: </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">While the threats to America have changed, the need for victory has not. We are fighting shadowy, entrenched enemies—enemies using the tools of terror and guerrilla war—yet we are finding new tactics and new weapons to attack and defeat them. This revolution in our military is only beginning, and it promises to change the face of battle</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">....The Predator is a good example. This unmanned aerial vehicle is able to circle over enemy forces, gather intelligence, transmit information instantly back to commanders, then fire on targets with extreme accuracy. Before the war, the Predator had skeptics, because it did not fit the old ways. Now it is clear the military does not have enough unmanned vehicles....What’s different today is our sense of urgency—the need to build this future force while fighting a present war. It’s like overhauling an engine while you’re going at 80 miles an hour. Yet we have no other choice. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Advanced technological development by itself is clearly not sufficient to ensure a successful military transformation. Coupled with advances in doctrine, strategy, tactics, and training, however, advanced technology is a significant force multiplier</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.7 </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Maintaining our technological lead in the future will be critical</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> to the operations of our fighting forces</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Technologists, operators, and acquisition specialists together can create and implement the policies so vital to ensuring this critical requirement. Acquisition Reform and Spiral Development </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The private sector, driven by market forces, is arguably more efficient in the development, production, and sustainment of new products and systems. As such, the focus of early acquisition reform initiatives has been on the adoption of best commercial practices to reduce costs and improve the quality and sustainability of</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> Department of Defense (</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">DOD</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">) </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">weapons systems</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. For example, emphasis was placed on eliminating numerous unique military specifications and standards in favor of commercial specifications and standards. Other important commercially derived initiatives include the adoption of integrated process and product development, single process initiative, and performance-based specifications. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Each of these initiatives has reduced the costs of acquiring and sustaining weapons systems. However, <strong>lengthy cycle times</strong>—that is, the time from initiation of an acquisition program to initial operational capability—<strong>has continued to plague defense acquisition</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Data taken on programs during the 1980s and 1990s indicate the average cycle time for large defense programs is slightly more than 11 years. Current programs such as the F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter are projected to exceed 15 years. Clearly, long cycle times are exacerbated by the highly complex nature of modern weapons systems such as the F-22. Cycle times are also negatively impacted by inefficient funding profiles that stretch development time. Largely, though, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">long cycle times are <strong>the result of the highly structured, risk-adverse</strong> <strong>DOD serial product development process</strong> of sequential developmental phases and milestones—the so-called DOD 5000 process. As such, a current focus of acquisition reform</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> and the intent of the recent rewrite of the DOD 5000.1 and 5000.2 instructions </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">is to establish a more flexible, streamlined process for the development of new weapons systems</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The new product development process, known as </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">spiral development or <strong>evolutionary acquisition, promises significantly shorter acquisition cycle times</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The stated goal is to reduce cycle times by 50 percent or more. In a test of the new spiral development process, the Air Force has established an ambitious set of pilot programs with a stretch goal for a four to one reduction in cycle time. Assuming success in these pilot efforts, the warfighter will receive new weapons systems and capabilities in less than 3 years on average over the traditional 11-year cycle time average. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The key to the new spiral development process is the familiar 80-20 rule. That is, the user accomplishes 80 percent of the objective with 20 percent of the time and effort, the remaining 20 percent requiring the remaining 80 percent of the time and effort</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. In the context of product development, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the acquisition community would strive to develop an 80-percent solution and field this new capability to the warfighter as rapidly as possible</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. As such, immature technologies are bypassed in favor of mature technologies, large software integration efforts are broken into core capabilities and advanced capability modules for later development, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">and growth is built into the initial design to accommodate subsequent or sequential product upgrades or production blocks. <strong>As the initial</strong> design or <strong>block is</strong> being refined and <strong>produced, parallel design</strong> and maturation <strong>efforts are begun for subsequent blocks</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The riskier technologies are matured and advanced hardware and software are added in later production blocks. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">At the end of the full product development cycle, several related blocks of weapons systems might have been produced, each more advanced than the previous one—each advancing toward the ultimate user requirement first envisioned</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. While the initial 80 percent product solution would not completely satisfy the full operational deficiency, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">it provides the warfighter a more immediate new capability closer to the desired solution than the current legacy equipment. This also allows the warfighter an opportunity to train and become familiar with employment, doctrine, support, and feedback lessons for incorporation in later blocks</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Spiral development allows production weapons systems to be fielded at more rapid and predictable intervals, each iteration more advanced</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> than the previous spiral. One can clearly understand the notion of evolutionary acquisition as each successive iteration of the weapon system evolves from the initial product design to the final production block</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, which may require only two or many successive parasequential spirals. Some may argue that this is merely a reapplication of the lessons of the 1970s and 1980s in which preplanned product improvement and F-16-style block production were common product development strategies. While there is some merit in these observations, the primary difference today in implementing spiral development is the clear motivation to reduce cycle time. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">In so doing, <strong>spiral development will also drive complementary changes in other segments of the</strong> product <strong>development process, such as</strong> a spiral <strong>requirements</strong> generation process and flexible <strong>training and support</strong> concepts <strong>to develop, field, and sustain new weapons systems more quickly</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><br />

China’s Military Modernization Since the late 1990s, China’s defense industries have been producing an increasing number of modern weapon systems. Although many fall short of the most advanced systems now entering the U.S. inventory, some Chinese weapons of today are comparable to the U.S. weapons fielded in the 1970s and 1980s and that still make up the bulk of the U.S. inventory. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">To retain its qualitative military advantage over China</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, therefore, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">America will need to continue to develop</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> and field systems that are significantly more advanced than</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> the types that <strong>China</strong> is now in the process of developing and fielding</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. China’s defense industry has benefited from the rapidly increasing technological capabilities in China’s broader economy. China’s integration into the global economy has resulted in steady improvements in the research, development, production, and management of many of China’s state-owned defense industrial enterprises. Similarly, the improvement and the growing exposure to Western teaching and scientific methods of China’s universities and technical schools mean that they are turning out increasingly well-trained and independent-thinking scientists, engineers, and technicians. As salaries and working conditions in China’s defense industries improve, they are able to attract higher-quality university and technical school graduates, employees of high-tech civilian enterprises, and Chinese nationals who have studied or worked abroad. Perhaps the most significant change in China’s defense industries in recent years has been the dramatic increase in resources flowing to them. Between 2000 and 2005, the amount spent on weapons procurement by the People’s Liberation Army more than doubled. The net effect of these changes has been a qualitative improvement in the output of </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">China’s defense industries</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. They </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">are now producing</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> certain </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">systems that</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, while not cutting edge, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">are comparable to</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> many systems now in <strong>the inventories of the U</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates and other advanced militaries. China’s Type 98 tank, for example, is comparable in capability to the main battle tanks of other Western countries, although so far the Type 98 tank has been produced in only small quantities. China has launched two classes of naval destroyers that are expected to have air defense capabilities comparable to those of U.S. cruisers and destroyers equipped with the Aegis air defense system. China is currently producing two classes of modern diesel-electric submarines and is building two new classes of nuclear submarines that are far better than their predecessors. The C-802 antiship missile carried by China’s naval combatants is comparable in capability to early versions of the Harpoon missile that is still used on U.S. naval combatants. Since the 1990s, the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been coproducing, with Russian assistance, the Su-27 fighter jet, which is roughly comparable to the U.S. F-15. An indigenously built fighter jet, the J-10 is comparable to the U.S. F-16 and has reached initial operational capability. China’s PL-9 air-to-air missile is comparable to the U.S. AIM-9M Sidewinder that was in production until 2004, and China is developing a radar-guided missile, the SD-10, that is expected to match up to the U.S. AIM-120 advanced medium-range air-to-air missile. Other systems under development in China include an airborne early warning and control aircraft comparable to the U.S. Airborne Warning and Control System, a surface-to-air missile system expected to be comparable to early versions of the U.S. Patriot, a cruise missile expected to be comparable to the U.S. Tomahawk, and a high-speed antiradiation missile. China has also purchased several weapon systems from Russia that are highly advanced and, in some cases, exceed U.S. capabilities. China’s military is well known for its short-range, conventionally armed ballistic missiles. They provide a unique capability for China and one that is extremely difficult to counter. Carried on road-mobile launchers, they are exceedingly hard to locate and to attack before they are launched. In addition, the latest models are believed to have accuracies of 50 meters or less. China is also reported to be developing a ballistic missile capable of hitting a moving ship at sea. If this latter effort were successful — a big “if” — it would give China a unique and unprecedented military capability. However, a number of shortcomings remain. China has yet to develop a dedicated attack helicopter. Its antisubmarine warfare technology is weak. It appears to be nowhere close to fielding any kind of stealth aircraft. It does not have a super-agile, infrared-guided, air-to-air missile like those of the United States, Russia, and Israel. And it has nothing like the range of precision air-to-ground munitions employed by U.S. air forces. Moreover, narrowing the technological gap will be costly; prior to 2025, China is unlikely to have resources available for defense comparable to those currently available to the United States (see Figure 1). Nonetheless, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the strategic significance of the advances in China’s defense industries could be huge</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. <strong>As long as the products of U.S. defense industries continue to advance, it is unlikely that China’s defense industries will produce systems that directly challenge U.S. technological dominance</strong>. <strong>Conversely, if the U.S. military does not continue to upgrade its technological capabilities</strong>, it is possible that</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> by the end of the next decade, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">China will be able to field a military capable of challenging U.S. dominance in East Asia</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. If China focuses on developing its capabilities for military operations near the coast of East Asia and avoids investing in expensive long-range power projection assets — such as aircraft carriers, heavy bombers, and long-range transports — then, by 2020, China could have the resources to field modern military forces that, while not numerically equal to those fielded by the United States, would at least be of comparable magnitude. Furthermore, China will have the advantage that its home territory is located within the region, whereas East Asia is nearly halfway around the globe from the United States. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Whether the U</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">will retain its military advantage over China, therefore, depends</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> both on China’s actions and </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">on whether the</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">U</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">will replace its current weapon systems with new ones that are qualitatively superior. America currently possesses substantial military and technological advantages over the Chinese military, and these must be retained while China devotes greater resources to military modernization</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. China’s Military Strategy </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">America needs to retain a strategic as well as a technological advantage. <strong>Chinese military doctrinal writings discuss how to defeat</strong> a militarily superior adversary such as <strong>the U</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">We found these writings in openly published <strong>Chinese</strong>-language <strong>books on military strategy, articles in</strong> Chinese <strong>military journals</strong>, reports from Chinese <strong>military newspapers, and recent Western studies of Chinese security policy</strong>. We <strong>found</strong> in the writings</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> at least seven </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">strategic principles that have implications for U.S. forces</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> in the Pacific. The first strategic principle is seizing the initiative early in a conflict. Chinese military analysts note that Iraq, by not seizing the initiative in the 1991 Gulf War, allowed the United States to build up its forces until it had overwhelming superiority. If China is to be victorious against a militarily superior power, China must go on the offensive from the very beginning. In the context of a conflict between the United States and China, this means that U.S. forces stationed permanently in the Western Pacific will be critical, because China is likely to go on the offensive before additional forces can be brought into the theater. A second and related strategic principle for defeating a militarily superior adversary is the importance of surprise. Surprise is valuable not only for an immediate tactical advantage but also as an important way of seizing the initiative. Surprise puts the adversary in the position of reacting to China’s moves, making it easy to maintain the initiative thereafter. In the context of a conflict between the United States and China, this means that the ability of U.S. forces in the Pacific to avoid and survive surprise attacks will be critical. Related to the first two strategic principles is a third one: the value of preemption. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">If China waits for a militarily superior adversary to commence hostilities, it will be difficult for China to seize the initiative, and the adversary will likely wield the preponderance of forces. If, by contrast, China initiates a conflict, China can seize the initiative and may also enjoy an initial advantage in the local balance of forces. Preemption also greatly increases the chances of successfully achieving surprise. In the context of a conflict between the U</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">and China over Taiwan, this means <strong>that China might initiate hostilities by preemptively attacking U.S. forces in the region</strong>, even before China has attacked Taiwan, <strong>on the presumption that the U</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">will inevitably intervene</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> in a conflict with Taiwan. A fourth strategic principle is raising the costs of conflict. At least some </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Chinese</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> military analysts believe that the U</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">is sensitive to casualties and economic costs and that the sudden destruction of a significant portion of our forces would result in a severe psychological shock and a loss of will to continue the conflict</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. When this principle is combined with the preceding two, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">it suggests a belief that a preemptive surprise attack on U.S. forces in the Pacific could cause the U</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">to avoid further combat with China</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Although the last time such a strategy was attempted in the Pacific the ultimate results were not favorable for the country that attacked, the Chinese military doctrinal writings that we examined did not acknowledge such historical counterexamples. A fifth strategic principle is that of limited strategic aims. A militarily inferior country cannot expect to achieve total victory over a militarily superior adversary. But if its aims are limited, the inferior country could create a situation in which the costs to its adversary of reversing the results of an initial offensive exceed the benefits of such a reversal, and therefore the adversary will choose to live with the results. In the context of a conflict between the United States and China, this principle suggests that </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">if China’s leadership believes it can quickly</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> <strong>accomplish its military aims</strong></span></u><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> and present the U</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">with a fait accompli</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> (such as <strong>the</strong> invasion and <strong>occupation of Taiwan</strong>)</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> without threatening any truly vital U.S. interests, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">then China might embark on such a conflict even if its leadership recognizes that the U</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">could ultimately prevail if it desired</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">THE high-intensity scenario postulates <strong>a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable.</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Conflict on such a scale <strong>would embroil other countries far and near and</strong> -horror of horrors -<strong>raise the possibility of a</strong> <strong>nuclear war</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore.</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as <strong>opportunistic powers</strong> elsewhere <strong>may try to overturn the existing world order</strong>. With the US distracted, <strong>Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape</strong>. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> by the likes of Iraq. <u>In south Asia, <strong>hostilities between India and Pakistan</strong>, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, <strong>could enter a new and dangerous phase</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons.</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, <strong>there is little hope of winning a war against China</strong> 50 years later, <strong>short of using nuclear weapons</strong>. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. <strong>Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. There would be no victors in such a war.

India will model U.S. defense acquisition reform<br />
<strong><u>Singh ‘9</u></strong> (Harinder Singh, Research Fellow at Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, MSc Defense Studies, former high-ranking officer in the Indian military, “Defence Acquisitions: The Question of Systemic Inefficienices and Effectiveness,” IDSA Comment, 12-3-2009, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2323:http://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/DefenceAcquisitions_HSingh_031209 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/DefenceAcquisitions_HSingh_031209" rel="nofollow">http://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/DefenceAcquisitions_HSingh_031209</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2323 -->)<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Defence acquisitions in the international context carry enormous political</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> and financial <strong>ramifications</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The following data reveal the enormity of the ‘acquisition’ problem and hence the need to frame durable and highly tolerant procurement procedures, processes and mechanisms. With an annual budgetary allocation of US $660 billion, which is equivalent of the next 45 highest spending nations in the world, the United States leads in military expenditure, followed by China at $145 billion and Russia spending $85 billion for its defence needs.1 The United Kingdom is placed fourth with an estimated expenditure of $66 billion. More significantly and in terms of defence expenditure as a share of GDP, the United States spent 4.6 per cent, China 3.9 per cent, Russia 5.4 per cent, France 2.4 per cent, Australia 1.5 per cent, Japan 1.0 per cent, Germany 1.3 per cent, Canada 1.1 per cent and United Kingdom 2.3 per cent on acquisitions cum operating costs in 2007. To highlight the percentage share of acquisitions vis-à-vis operating costs (O&amp;M), capital expenditure stood at 26 per cent in case of the United States, 23 per cent for United Kingdom, 21 per cent for France, 17 per cent for Japan, 15 per cent for Germany, 15 per cent for Canada and 18 per cent for Australia for the same period. In terms of number of acquisition proposals in 2007, the United States handled some 95 projects, United Kingdom 39 projects and Australia 16 projects, taking into account only those costing 200 million pounds and above.2 The average cost of acquisitions ranged from 9.5, 1.0 and 0.5 billion dollars respectively for each of these countries for the same period.3 In terms of time and cost overruns, the data is even more revealing. The cost overshoots stood at 8 per cent in case of United Kingdom as compared to 25 per cent for United States. But then United States delivered the planned projects with an average delay of 25 per cent as compared to 32 per cent in case of United Kingdom. The foregoing raises some important issues. First is the issue of systemic inefficiencies of the acquisition process in terms of time and cost overruns. And two, how these time and cost overshoots affect the operational readiness of the armed forces. The inadequacies highlighted above surely demand serious introspection. Perhaps a similar concern was reflected in recent remarks of the Indian Vice Chief of the Air Staff, which in all its virtuousness questioned the efficacy of the existing acquisition framework, and in turn, the preparedness of the air force. To draw a simple analogy from what the Air Marshal said, the timely construction of infrastructure for Commonwealth Games 2010 at whatever the cost is essential for successful conduct of the event. Not that the proposed infrastructure shall have no use after the event, but its importance clearly lies in timely fructification. Similarly, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the fielding of desired military capabilities cannot be made hostage to time overruns and apprehensions about high cost</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. A recent seminar on Defence Acquisitions at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi, raised several such questions. The seminar focused on complexities of QR formulation and capability definition, impediments to unbiased technical and commercial evaluation, unnecessary publicity surrounding contractual negotiations and inadequacies in project monitoring and implementation. As it often happens, the debate veered onto two divergent and convoluted paths. While the military component comprising the three services, and rightfully so, continued to lament upon huge acquisition delays and equipment deficiencies, the acquisition bureaucracies missed no opportunity in reiterating the impact of `procedure-isation` of procurement processes and several attempts made at `price discoveries` in recent years. There thus seemed to be a clear lack of convergence in arguments put forth by the various stakeholders. The ensuing debate however missed the big picture i.e., the effectiveness of the existing procurement framework and its negative impact on preparedness of the Indian armed forces. In our continued fixation with first generation reforms (i.e., procedure-isation), the question of ‘effectiveness’ seldom comes up for serious discussion. Can the current acquisition framework deliver desired military capabilities is a question that needs to be asked? To be more precise, the effectiveness of procurement framework needs to be judged from the viewpoint of ‘operational’ and ‘structural’ readiness of the armed forces. Richard K. Betts, the much acclaimed guru on military readiness, emphasizes the importance of an effective and deliverable framework for maintaining battle worthiness of the military force. As Senator Solomon Ortiz, the chairman of the United States House Armed Services Committee’s (HASC) Readiness Subcommittee said, “for militaries to fight effectively – today and in the future – you need to have right people in the right roles with the right equipment and the right training. And how ready we were yesterday determines how well we fight today? And how ready are we today determines how well we fight tomorrow?” The deduction here is plain and simple – an ineffectual procurement mechanism surely impinges upon the operational effectiveness of the armed forces. But then the interesting part is that </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">India is not the only country</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">caught up in this debate. There are many other modern militaries <strong>battling with the complexities of defence procurement</strong>. <strong>A debate rages in the U</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">as well</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. Earlier this year, <strong>the House Armed Services Committee</strong> responsible for congressional oversight on military matters <strong>constituted a panel for review of the defence acquisition processes in the U</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates.4 The HASC panel is tasked </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">to examine the ‘effectiveness’ of the current acquisition framework in the U</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates. And the line of inquiry is quite simple and straightforward – How can the existing acquisition framework be reformed to satisfy the twin objectives of providing “best military wherewithal” and “when it is most needed” to the United States Armed Forces while ensuring “best value” for each dollar spent from taxpayers’ money? The operative words here being ‘timeliness of procurement’ and ‘best value for money spent’ and not ‘procedure-isation’ or ‘price discoveries’ as is the case in the Indian context. The recently released Bernard Gray report on defence acquisition reforms in the United Kingdom also focuses on the effectiveness of the existing procurement framework. The report is indeed an exemplar on acquisition related reform. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">There could be several lessons from the American</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> and British </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">experience</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> in the Indian context</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. The HASC panel review is focused on the following key questions</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">: Is there a proven methodology available to measure the effectiveness of the defence acquisition system? If not, how could one be created or modelled? </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Is the current system effective enough in meeting the twin objectives of ‘timeliness’ of procurement and ‘good value’ for the money spent? What could be the root causes for systemic inefficiencies?</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> The causatives could be found at these levels: How much do the important processes of qualitative requirement (QR) formulation, project validation and budgetary support affect acquisition outcomes? And which one or more of these acts as an impediment to sound decision making? Are there enough trained civilian and military managers to process procurement related decisions? Do they have sufficient knowledge, expertise and authority to take procurement decisions? If not, then what could be the other options to process sound procurement decisions? Does the defence acquisition system generate sufficient domain knowledge, data and analytics to enable good decision making? Are procurement related decisions ever hampered by lack of technical information, empirical data or well documented procurement precedence/s etc? If so, then what options exist to build requisite domain knowledge? Does the defence acquisition system schedule major decision points in a collegiate fashion and bring up issues duly prioritized for review at right times? Is adequate information available to enable informed decision making? If not, then what correctives are required? </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">How responsive is the framework in responding to urgency of the military’s needs? Can the system be tailored to match the duration of ‘capability development’ with ‘threat cycle/s’? And are the current procurement processes responsive enough to cope with sharp changes in technology? If not, then what measures need to be taken?</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> What are the social and cultural biases that often creep into the acquisition system? How could these lead to bad acquisition outcomes? And how could these then be corrected? </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">What measures are being taken worldwide to reform acquisition</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> procedures, <strong>processes</strong> and mechanisms?</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> How efficient are the acquisition processes in the United Kingdom, France and Australia? What lessons do we need to learn from them? What structural changes would be necessary to ensure that the defence acquisition system satisfies the twin objectives of timely acquisitions and good value for taxpayers’ money? </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The foregoing framework <strong>could be relevant in the Indian context as well</strong>. With as many as a few dozen proposals in the pipeline and no major procurements in the offing, the procurement diagnostics clearly needs to shift from ‘procedure-isation’ to ‘effectiveness’</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Firstly, there is the important aspect of realistic definition of required military capabilities. And then is the issue of achievable and affordable qualitative requirements; a ‘knowledge cum experience’ driven expertise is difficult to come by in defence bureaucracies. We need to build expertise to enable framing of realistic qualitative requirements, and till such time these proficiencies are actually built technical consultancies could be hired. Institutional advice from accredited trade bodies such as the CII, FICCI, ASSOCHAM and others is yet another avenue. The bottom line here being that identification of cutting edge military technologies, concepts and capability formulation and benchmarking of qualitative requirements becomes an extensive, cross pollinated and inter-disciplinary action in the long term. Another related aspect is that the current procurement procedures and processes are too sequential and therefore highly time consuming. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">There is a need to break from ‘serial’</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> and ‘iterative’ <strong>procurement processes towards concurrent, smart and timely acquisition actions</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The Bernard Gray report offers several suggestions on this score.</span><br />

Indian defense acquisition reform is key to military modernization in the face of Chinese aggression<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">China has declared that its official defense budget for 2011 will rise by 12.7 percent from the previous year. Last year there was a lot of hoopla surrounding the fact that China had announced a mere 7.5 percent jump in defense budget. It was the first time since the 1980s that China's defense spending increased by a single-digit percentage. But this year we are back to the norm of double-digit increases. While China's civilian leadership has tried to downplay the latest increase, suggesting that much of the increase will go to human resources development, infrastructure and training, it is the response of the Chinese military that should be a matter of concern. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan was unambiguous in suggesting that when it comes to military spending, there is no need for China &quot;to care about what others may think.&quot; The international community has long demanded that China should be more transparent about the intentions behind its rapid defense spending. Now the Chinese military is making its strategic intent clear. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Divisions within China about the future course of nation's foreign policy are more stark than ever</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. It is now being suggested that much like young Japanese officers in the 1930s, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">young Chinese military officers are increasingly taking charge of strategy with the result that rapid military growth is shaping the nation's broader foreign policy objectives. Civil-military relations in China are under stress with the PLA asserting its pride more forcefully than even before</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> and demanding respect from other countries. &quot;A country needs respect, and a military also needs respect,&quot; wrote a major general last year in the PLA's newspaper. Not surprisingly, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">China has been more aggressive in asserting its interests not only vis-a-vis India but also</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> vis-a-vis </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the U</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates, the European Union, Japan and Southeast Asian states. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The <strong>increasing assertion by the Chinese military and changing balance of power in the nation's civil-military relations should be a real cause of concern for China's neighbors</strong>. The pace of <strong>Chinese military modernization</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> has already taken the world by surprise and it is clear that the process </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">is going much faster than many had anticipated</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. A growing economic power, China is now concentrating on the accretion of military might so as to secure and enhance its own strategic interests. China, which has the largest standing army in the world with more than 2.3 million members, continues to make the most dramatic improvements in its nuclear force among the five nuclear powers, and improvements in its conventional military capabilities are even more impressive. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">What has been causing concern in Asia and beyond is the opacity that surrounds China's military buildup</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, with an emerging consensus that Beijing's real military spending is at least double the announced figure. The official figures of the Chinese government do not include the cost of new weapon purchases, research or other big-ticket items for China's highly secretive military. As a result, the real figures are much higher than the revealed amount. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Despite this, <strong>India's own defense-modernization program is faltering</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. This year the Indian government has allocated only 1.8 percent of its GDP to defense, though ostensibly the military expenditure has gone up by 11.58 percent. This is only the second time in over three decades that the defense-to-GDP ratio has fallen below 2 percent of GDP. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">This is happening at a time when India is expected to spend $112 billion on capital defense acquisitions over the next five years in what is being described as &quot;one of the largest procurement cycles in the world.&quot; Indian military planners are shifting their focus away from Pakistan as China takes center-stage in future strategic planning</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Over the past two decades, the military expenditure of India has been around 2.75 percent, but since India has been experiencing significantly higher rates of economic growth over the last decade compared to any other time in its history, the overall resources that it has been able to allocate to its defense needs has grown significantly. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The armed forces have long been asking for an allocation of 3 percent of the nation's GDP to defense. This has received a broad political support in recent years</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The Indian prime minister has been explicit about it, suggesting that &quot;if our economy grows at about 8 percent per annum, it will not be difficult for [the Indian government] to allocate about 3 percent of GDP for national defense.&quot; The Indian Parliament has also underlined the need to aim for the target of 3 percent of GDP. Yet as a percentage of GDP, annual defense spending has declined to one of its lowest levels since 1962. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">But defense expenditures alone will not solve all the problems plaguing Indian defense policy. More damagingly</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, with the exception of this year, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">for the last several years now the defense ministry has been unable to spend its full budgetary allocation. <strong>The defense-acquisition process remains</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> mired in corruption and bureaucratic red tape. A series of defense procurement scandals since the late 1980s have also made the bureaucracy </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">risk averse</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">, thereby delaying the acquisition process.

<strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">China will launch an attack on India before 2012</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">There are <strong>multiple reasons</strong> for a desperate Beijing to teach India the final lesson, thereby ensuring Chinese supremacy in Asia</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> in this century. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The recession</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> that shut the Chinese exports shop <strong>is creating</strong> an <strong>unprecedented internal social unrest</strong>. In turn, the vice-like grip of the communists over the society stands severely threatened</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Unemployment is on the rise</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The unofficial estimate stands at a whopping fourteen percent. Worldwide recession has put thirty million people out of jobs. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Economic slowdown is depleting the foreign exchange reserves. Foreign investors are slowly shifting out</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. To create a domestic market, the massive dole of loans to individuals is turning out to be a nightmare. There appears to be a flight of capital in billions of dollars in the shape of diamond and gold bought in Hong Kong and shipped out towards end 2008. The fear of losing control over the Chinese masses is forcing the communists to compulsorily install filtering software on new computers on sale to crush dissent on the Internet, even though it is impossible to censor in entirety the flow of information as witnessed recently in Tibet, Xinjiang and Iran. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The growing internal unrest is <strong>making Beijing jittery</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The external picture appears to be equally dismal</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The unfolding Obama strategy seems to be scoring goals for democracy and freedom without firing a single shot. While Bush unwittingly united and arrayed against himself Islamic countries and radical Islam worldwide, Obama has put radical Islam in disarray by lowering the intra-societal temperature vis-à-vis America and the Muslim world. He deftly hints at democracy in his talk without directly threatening any group or country and the youth picks it up from there – as in Iran. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">With more and <strong>more Chinese citizens</strong> beginning to <strong>demand political freedom</strong>, the future of the communists is also becoming uncertain. The technological means available in the 21st century to spread democracy is definitely not conducive for the totalitarian regime in Beijing</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">India’s</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> chaotic but <strong>successful democracy is an eyesore for the authoritarian regime in Beijing</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Unlike India, China is handicapped as it lacks the soft power – an essential ingredient to spread influence. This further adds fuel to the fire. Ethnicity-of-China In addition, the growing irrelevance of Pakistan, their right hand that operates against India on their behest, is increasing the Chinese nervousness. Obama’s AF-PAK policy is primarily a PAK-AF policy. It has intelligently set the thief to catch the thief. The stated withdrawal from Iraq by America now allows it to concentrate its military surplus on the single front to successfully execute the mission. This surplus, in combination with other democratic forces, enables America to look deep into resource rich Central Asia, besides containing China’s expansionist ambitions. To offset this adverse scenario, while overtly pretending to side with the West, the Chinese covertly ordered their other proxy, North Korea, to test underground nuclear explosions and carry out trials of missiles that threaten Japan and South Korea. The Chinese anxiety is understandable. Under Bush’s declared policy of being ‘a strategic competitor’ alongside the ‘axis of evil’, they shared a large strategic maneuverability with others of similar hues. However, Obama policies wisely deny such a luxury by reclaiming more and more international strategic space ceded by the previous administration. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The communists in China</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, therefore, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">need a military victory to unite the</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> disillusioned citizenry behind them</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. This will assist in marketing the psychological perception that the 21st century belongs to China and assert their deep belief in the superiority of the Chinese race. To retain the communist party’s hold on power, it is essential to divert attention from the brewing internal dissent</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. In an autocratic system normally the only recipe to unite the citizenry is by mannpulating their nationalistic feelings. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The easy method for Beijing to heighten the feeling of patriotism and forging national unity is to design a war with an adversary. They believe that this will help them to midwife the Chinese century</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. That is the end game rooted in the abiding conviction of the communists that the Chinese race is far superior to Nazi Germany and is destined to “Lord over the Earth”. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">At present, there is no overall cost benefit ratio in integrating <strong>Taiwan</strong> by force with the mainland, since under the new dispensation in Taipei, the island <strong>is ‘behaving’ itself</strong>. <strong>Also, the American presence</strong> around the region <strong>is too strong</strong> for comfort</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. There is also the factor of Japan to be reckoned. Though Beijing is increasing its naval presence in the South China Sea to coerce into submission those opposing its claim on the Sprately Islands, at this point of time in history it will be unwise for recession-hit China to move against the Western interests, including Japan. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Therefore, <strong>the most attractive option is to attack a soft target like India</strong> and forcibly occupy its territory in the Northeast</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Ideally, the Chinese believe that the east-wind should prevail over the west-wind. However, despite their imperial calculations of the past, they lag behind the West, particularly America, by many decades. Hence, they want the east-wind to at least prevail over the other east-wind, i.e., India, to ensure their dominance over Asia. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Beijing’s</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> cleverly <strong>raising the</strong> hackles on its fabricated <strong>dispute in Arunachal Pradesh to an alarming level, is the</strong> preparatory <strong>groundwork</strong> <strong>for</strong> imposing <strong>such a conflict</strong> on India. A sinking <strong>Pakistan will team up with China</strong> to teach India “the final lesson”</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The Chinese leadership wants to rally its population behind the communist rule. As it is, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Beijing is already rattled, with its proxy Pakistan, now literally embroiled in a civil war, losing its sheen against India. <strong>Above all, it is worried over the growing alliance of India with the U</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">and</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> the West, <strong>because the alliance has the potential to create a technologically superior counterpoise</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">All these</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> three <strong>concerns</strong> of the Chinese communists <strong>are best addressed by waging a war against</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> pacifist </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">India</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> to achieve multiple strategic objectives. But India, otherwise the biggest challenge to the supremacy of China in Asia, is least prepared on ground to face the Chinese threat</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. How will India repel the Chinese game plan? Will Indian leadership be able to take the heat of war? Have they laid the groundwork adequately to defend India? Is the Indian military equipped to face the two-front war by Beijing and Islamabad? Is the Indian Civil Administration geared to meet the internal security challenges that the external actors will sponsor simultaneously through their doctrine of unrestricted warfare? The answers is an unequivocal ‘NO’. Pacifist India is not ready by a long shot either on the internal or the external front. It is said that long time back, a king with an excellent military machine at his disposal could not stomach the violence involved in winning wars. So he renounced war in victory. This led to the rise of the pacifist philosophies. The state either refused to defend itself or neglected the instruments that could defend it. Any ‘extreme’ is dangerous, as it tends to create imbalance in statecraft. We saw that in the unjust unilateral aggression in Iraq. It diminished the American aura and recessed the economy. China’s despotic regime is another extreme, scared to permit political dissent. This will fuel an explosion worse than the Tiananmen Square. Despite the use of disproportionate force and the demographic invasion of Tibet, Beijing’s hold remains tenuous. Pakistan’s over-aggressive agenda in the name of jihad haunts it now to the point of fragmentation of the State. Similarly, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">India’s pacifism is the other extreme</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. 26/11s will occur on a regular basis as it infects policy-making. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Such extreme postures on either side invariably generate wars</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Armed with an aggressive Wahabi philosophy, Pakistan, in cohort with China, wants to destabilize a pacifist India. India’s instruments of state steeped in pacifism are unable to rise to its defence. In the past sixty years, the deep-rooted pacifism contributed to the Civil Administration, ceding control of forty per cent of the Union’s territory to the Maoists and ten percent to the insurgents, effecting a shrinking influence internally, as well in the ‘near abroad’. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">India must rapidly shift out from its defeatist posture</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">of pacifism <strong>to deter China</strong>. New Delhi’s stance should</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> modify, not to aggression, but to a firm assertion in statecraft. The state must also exclusively </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">retain the capability of intervention by use of force</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> internally as well as externally. If it permits the non-state actors to develop this capability in competition, then the state will whither away. On the contrary, the state machinery should ensure a fast-paced development in the Red Corridor even it if has to hold Maoists hostage at gunpoint. The state’s firm and just intervention will dissolve the Maoist movement. Keeping in view the imminent threat posed by China, the quickest way to swing out of pacifism to a state of assertion is by injecting military thinking in the Civil Administration to build the sinews. That will enormously increase the deliverables on ground – from Lalgarh to Tawang. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">Air Force The Air Force achieved approximately $33 billion in overhead savings across the Future Years Defense Program. The organizational changes include changes to manpower and personnel, consolidation of two Air Operations Centers in the United States and another two in Europe, and consolidation of three Numbered Air Force staffs in areas where major commands can assume the workload. These moves will save $516 million next year and $4.2 billion over the FYDP. Implementation of better business practices accounts for $2.2 billion in savings next year and $20.6 billion over the FYDP. Actions include: • A 25 percent reduction in the cost of communications infrastructure, using enterprisewide services and consolidated data centers that will save $1.3 billion over the FYDP. • Cuts to fuel and energy costs by Air Force Mobility Command through adoption of commercial best practices in flight planning and use of simulators that will require an investment of $120 million but pay back $715 million over five years. •</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> <strong>Adoption of a new method for acquiring satellites</strong> – <strong>emphasizing block buys</strong>, sustained funding for engineering, fixed price contracts, <strong>and full funding</strong> <strong>over multiple years</strong> <strong>through advance appropriations</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.

Funding for the bomber is on the brink – absent evolutionary acquisition, it’ll get cut<br />
<strong><u>Majumdar ‘11</u></strong> (Dave Majumdar, Defense News, “U.S. Air Force Bomber Plans Hinge On Savings,” 1-17-2011, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2327:http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=5469848 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=5469848" rel="nofollow">http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=5469848</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2327 -->)<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">If the</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> U.S. Air Force wants its bomber</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> and satellite <strong>plans to bear fruit, it must squeeze the money from its own budget through efficiencies</strong> and</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> other </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">savings</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, service officials and analysts said. Air Force Secretary Michael Donley said </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">such savings will fund a host of programs, including the F-35 stealth fighter, the recently announced long-range bomber</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, more satellite-boosting rockets and upgrades for existing fighters. Donley said the service had already begun a broad efficiency drive by Aug. 9, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates ordered the services to save $100 billion over five years. &quot;This work had been underway, but certainly </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the secretary [of defense]</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> gave us a shot in the arm and </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">gave us a great</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, I think, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">inducement to proceed with this work with a simple caveat: <strong>What we found within the Air Force for savings</strong> and efficiencies <strong>would stay in the Air Force</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">,&quot; he told reporters Jan. 12. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Finding those savings will be critical</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, said Dan Gouré, an analyst at the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Va. &quot;It better be a viable strategy; </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">otherwise the Air Force</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> in particular <strong>is out of luck</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The Air Force has so many demands on it for recapitalizing the force,&quot; Gouré said. New Bomber </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The new bomber will be a key beneficiary of the savings drive</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, Donley said. &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Efficiencies will enable continuing investment in</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> establishing <strong>a new program</strong> of record <strong>for this long-range strike platform</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> in the context of continuing work on this broader family of systems,&quot; he said. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The aircraft will be able to be flown by an onboard crew or remotely like a UAV</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, the secretary said. It will be part of a &quot;family of systems&quot; that will also handle ground surveillance and electronic attack. Donley said it would be </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">able to carry nuclear weapons, but would be primarily geared toward conventional war</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, and might not be immediately certified for nuclear missions. Unlike the service's previous next-generation bomber effort, the new aircraft will use proven technologies, he said. &quot;In contrast to the program that was canceled in 2009, Next Generation bomber as it was known, development of this new bomber will leverage more mature technologies, and we think will reduce the risk in the program, allow us to deliver with greater confidence on schedule and in quantities sufficient to support long-term sustainment of long-range bomber capabilities after the current fleet of B-1s and B-52s retire,&quot; Donley said. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Still, Gouré doubts that the service's efforts to save will free up enough money to fund the bomber effort, especially for production</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Is the current reallocation money going to be enough? No, clearly not, when you get to the point of having to build</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">,&quot; he said</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Over the long term, however, Gouré said he believes there is enough money in the budget to pay for a new bomber as production on other programs comes to a close. &quot;If they need this thing, they'll find the money. Not to worry,&quot; he said. F-35 Delay The initial operational capability date for the U.S. Air Force version of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is likely to slip due to recent program changes instituted to help right the troubled triservice effort, Donley said. &quot;I think that's implied with the additional dollars and time required in system development,&quot; he said when asked whether the recent restructuring would delay the in-service date. Donley did not elaborate, but said additional details would follow. Gouré said he was not surprised by the potential slip, but cautioned that slowing down production could raise the purchase price. The secretary said the Air Force would benefit from Gates' decision to put the U.S. Marine Corps vertical landing F-35B variant, the most technically challenged and complex version, on a two-year probationary period. &quot;The major decision from this TBR [technical baseline review] has been to decouple the testing of the U.S. Marine short-takeoff, vertical-landing variant from the conventional and carrier variant to ensure we do not slow progress on the conventional and carrier variant,&quot; he said. Donley also said the service would buy 16 F-35 simulators, which, among other things, will save fuel. &quot;In the Joint Strike Fighter program, it is forecast that up to 50 percent of pilot training will be accomplished through simulators,&quot; he said. Current Fighters Donley said the savings drive would also allow the service to shave the time required to refit F-15C and -E fighters with active electronically scanned array radars and new operational flight programs. Upgrades to the F-15C air superiority variant will wrap up one year early; those for the multirole F-15E Strike Eagle some eight years ahead. Boeing officials said their production facilities were ready to handle the accelerated schedule. The secretary also said the workhorse F-16C multirole fighter would definitely receive a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). &quot;They continue to refine the requirements for F-16 SLEPs going forward,&quot; he said. &quot;What kind? How much? And when? And we are committing resources in that direction.&quot; He said the F-16 work is directly tied to the continuing delays in getting the F-35 into service. Gouré said he is not convinced that the F-16 extensions are necessary, suggesting instead better fleet management to ease the strain or borrowing older F-16s from storage. &quot;If we're going to take a risk in order to modernize the air fleet, this is the decade to take it,&quot; he said. Space Programs Donley also announced a new approach to satellite acquisition. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The Evolutionary Acquisition</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> for <strong>S</strong>pace <strong>E</strong>fficiency <strong>strategy would buy satellites in batches of two or more, use more fixed-price contracts</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, promise more stable research and development funding, and use a more evolutionary developmental approach </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">and</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> &quot;a modified annual funding approach</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot; He said the service was still working out details of </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the new approach</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, which </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">is <strong>meant to reduce</strong> the <strong>costs</strong> <strong>associated with uneven funding and production gaps</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Gouré applauded the plan. &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">If there is one area you can clearly say cried out for acquisition reform, it was the satellite business</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">,&quot; he said. &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">This [is]</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> clearly</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, clearly, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">a true innovation, maybe a revolution. In the end, I suspect [it is] <strong>going to get us further down the road</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot; Ultimately, Gouré said, even with the evolutionary approach to developing and launching new satellites, the end result might be even more technologically advanced machines. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">Sustaining the Air Leg of the Nuclear Triad </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">The Air Force needs to have a plan for</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> a land-based strategic deterrent replacement and for <strong>sustainment of the air leg of the nuclear deterrent force</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. — General Chilton, Commander, US Strategic Command163 The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) determined that </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">DoD must maintain a nuclear triad in order to sustain the nation’s strategic deterrence posture, provide extended deterrence to US allies and partners, and hedge against</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> changes in the security environment or </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">unforeseen <strong>technological failures</strong> of one or more triad legs</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.164 Despite the NPR’s conclusion, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the nuclear triad is on a glide-slope toward a “dyad”</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> of SLBMs and ICBMs</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The Defense Department’s nuclear-capable bomber force program of record consists of twenty penetrating B-2s and seventy-six standoff B-52s.165 When the B-2 loses its ability to penetrate, the air leg of the triad will be reduced to B-52s equipped with nuclear-tipped standoff ALCMs that are approaching the end of their service life and are unsuited for attacking relocatable targets such as road-mobile ICBM launchers of the type being fielded by China, Iran and Russia.166 There are options that will permit DoD to sustain a nuclear-capable bomber force and hedge against uncertainty. First, DoD should develop a new nuclearcapable cruise missile capable of surviving advanced air defenses. Unlike the ALCM, the new missile should be able to carry conventional as well as nuclear warheads and to be launched from a variety of Air Force and Navy aircraft. A smaller, more versatile cruise missile with a range of 500–600 nm that can be carried by fighter-sized aircraft as well as bombers would permit DoD to take advantage of the economies of scale via a larger procurement and increase the overall size of the standoff missile magazine. Second, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the Defense Department should design a new bomber to preserve this option for delivering nuclear weapons</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. Under New START, the Air Force has the latitude to incorporate basic nuclear weapons requirements into a new bomber design without fully equipping, testing, certifying, and declaring it as nuclearcapable</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
And, it’s not just a question of eroding capability – failure to initiate a new bomber program creates the perception that the DoD is formally eliminating a nuclear role for bombers<br />

Loss of the nuclear bomber creates three unique scenarios for nuclear war – allied proliferation, hostile aggression, and crisis escalation<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">The Case for Continuity The case for the continuity of current U.S. nuclear policies and structure involves consideration of their benefits in terms of security, international prestige, domestic politics, and technology.8 From a security perspective, nuclear weapons ensure security because </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the potential usage of nuclear weapons</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> during a conflict raises the cost of war to an unacceptable level.9 Scott Sagan notes that: Nuclear declaratory policy is meant to enhance deterrence of potential adversaries by providing a </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">signal</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> of </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">the intentions</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">, options and proclivities <strong>of the U.S. government in</strong> different <strong>crisis</strong> and war-time <strong>scenarios</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.10 I would argue, however, that </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">an ambiguous U.S. first use policy</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> of nuclear weapons <strong>creates valuable uncertainty</strong> on the part of potential adversaries. This uncertainty, coupled with U.S. nuclear and conventional superiority, <strong>makes overt state aggression</strong> against the U.S. or its’ allies <strong>a</strong> very uncertain and <strong>potentially disastrous proposition, thus not likely to happen</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. After all, no state has started a war with the U.S. since it acquired nuclear weapons. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">No part of the U.S. nuclear triad can be eliminated without creating an adverse impact on deterrence</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. This is the case because </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">each element of the triad fills a unique role that makes U.S. nuclear forces lethal, survivable, and visible</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Submarines offer the greatest degree of survivability, but the lowest degree of accuracy and become vulnerable upon surfacing. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Bombers are the most accurate and only recallable option</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, but they are vulnerable to defensive counter-air missions and groundbased anti-aircraft fire. ICBMs are the most reliable means of delivery and the only sovereignlaunched option, yet are all located at known, stationary sites that are easily targeted by enemy ICBM forces, special operations teams, or terrorist surrogates. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">One may not consider the visibility of nuclear forces to be desirable, but <strong>the visibility of bombers</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> and ICBMs </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">allows for clear signaling to potential adversaries</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> about U.S. intentions during a crisis</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Take the Cuban Missile Crisis for example: President Kennedy used naval and air forces in order to signal his intent toward Premier Khrushchev. This signaling ensured there were no doubts about U.S. willingness to go to war to prevent Soviet missiles from being placed in Cuba. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Future conflicts may require signaling</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> of a similar nature to prevent deadly exchanges</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. For example, if Kim Jong Il were notified that the U.S. was uploading nuclear-armed bombers in response to North Korean deployments of nuclear-armed missiles, he might reconsider his actions</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. From the perspective of international prestige, other powers are retaining and in some cases enhancing their nuclear capability, yet as Younger points out, the U.S. is not modernizing any aspect of its inventory.11 Instead, the U.S. is relying on mathematical projections and estimations regarding the reliability of its systems and deploying them well beyond what most states would consider a reasonable service-life. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Further reductions in strategic nuclear forces could be seen as evidence of retrenchment</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> on the part of the U.S. <strong>by ambitious rising or reemerging powers, thus increasing the risk of war</strong>. <strong>The U.S. could be characterized as a declining power by rising powers who are seeking</strong> either initial or enhanced <strong>nuclear technology</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Rising powers, after all, will work to realign the international balance of power in their favor: one way of doing so is through countering U.S. military capabilities. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">If the U.S. were to reduce its capability by eliminating portions of the triad, then it would essentially be making it easier for other powers to challenge the current U.S. position. Further, <strong>without the potential threat of a nuclear first strike, U.S. allies might feel less secure</strong> about U.S. security commitments, especially in light of current troop commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. <strong>Such insecurity has the potential to lead these allies to pursue nuclear capabilities of their own, as well as embolden hostile states to gamble on a lack of U.S. retaliation for WMD usage</strong> <strong>or conventional aggression</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. For example, when the U.S. considered reducing troop levels in South Korea, the government in Seoul signaled a potential shift in policy toward a nuclear capability to protect itself from possible North Korean aggression.12 This threat resulted in very quick U.S. reassurances about troop levels and its commitment to defending South Korea.</span><br />

Bombers are key – unique visibility prevents crisis escalation and allied proliferation<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">First, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">deterrence</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">, the capstone of American foreign policy since the end of World War II, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">relies on effectively making an adversary believe that the risks involved in changing the status quo outweigh any potential rewards. To achieve effective deterrence, the U</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">must have the capability and, most importantly, credibility to create the desired psychological effect. Moving to a nuclear deterrence strategy that effectively depends on a half dozen deployed submarines undermines both capability and credibility</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Contrary to the admonitions of abolitionists, adopting a monad </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">sends a clear signal to America’s adversaries that the nation does not value nuclear weapons to the degree it once did and will be more reluctant to use a diminished arsenal in the future. This emboldens adversaries and decreases the confidence that US allies have in the nation’s extended deterrence</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Successful deterrence depends completely upon simply and effectively communicating desire and intent to allies and adversaries. Dramatically reducing the size of the arsenal and killing two legs of the triad, while claiming that the United States remains serious about nuclear deterrence, would send a mixed signal. The historical record does not offer analogous examples of arms reductions leading to the maintenance of credibility. On the contrary, the Washington Naval Treaty (1922), which limited the tonnage of major world navies, may have played a key role in leading the Japanese to attack Pearl Harbor.26 Admittedly, such counterfactual claims are difficult to prove. Second, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">since <strong>signaling intent is a vital aspect of successful deterrence, eliminating the bomber leg of the triad would be a mistake</strong>. Designed to remain hidden from the view of an adversary, <strong>ICBMs and SSBNs offer no effective way of conveying American resolve</strong> or an escalation/de-escalation in posture, <strong>should an adversary move toward conflict</strong>. The bomber fleet, however, effectively demonstrates resolve. For example, <strong>if an adversary were to openly challenge the status quo, the president could</strong> order the nation’s B-52s and B-2s on alert, <strong>put them in the air, and/or deploy them to forward bases</strong>. All of <strong>these actions are visible signals of American intent, designed to lead to a de-escalation of tensions</strong>. Without question, <strong>bombers are the most effective tool for overtly demonstrating resolve</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. A related point arises. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">Nuclear-capable bombers are one of the best tools for assuring allies that the U</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">remains committed to providing a credible extended deterrent</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">. <strong>Neither ICBMs nor submarines can provide a visible show of resolve</strong> in the face of danger. Deploying nuclear bombers to an ally’s air base not only assures America’s friends but also deters the nation’s foes</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Third, ICBMs offer two distinct benefits that a submarine force cannot replicate. On the one hand, they raise the cost of entry into the nuclear club as a peer of the United States. ICBMs require expensive and advanced missile technology, which may prove too costly for many potential proliferators. On the other hand, they increase risks for an adversary by driving him to a strategy (counterforce) requiring the elimination of American ICBMs in an effort to prevent a US counterstrike. Forcing an adversary to strike the United States in order to eliminate its nuclear arsenal serves as a strong deterrent when the enemy considers a nuclear attack. Moreover, these missiles are the only leg of the triad that can hit any spot on the earth within half an hour. Fourth, should the United States adopt the plan advocated by abolitionists, the nation’s adversaries would know full well that half the nuclear arsenal would be in port at any given time, vulnerable to destruction by a single nuclear missile targeting each of the two designated nuclear submarine bases. Contrary to what Americans are led to believe, Russia and China maintain advanced submarine-detection capabilities that may enable either nation to detect, track, and sink the half of the nuclear arsenal (six submarines) at sea.27 Moving to a submarine-based monad will also encourage adversaries of the United States to focus technological development on advanced sonar and torpedo technology. Doing so will simplify the calculation for an adversary seeking to neutralize the American arsenal. The United States may soon face a real scenario in which two nuclear missiles and a half dozen torpedoes can destroy the entire operationally deployed strategic nuclear arsenal—something no American should desire. Redundancy, which the triad provides, offers a level of protection that a submarine-based nuclear arsenal would greatly diminish. Increasing American vulnerability and decreasing American capability do not represent a strategy for successful deterrence. As history demonstrates, deterrence works when the United States effectively convinces its adversaries that an attack on America will fail to carry out the desired objectives and will invoke massive retaliation. Any other approach to deterrence is doomed to failure. Relying on what abolitionists refer to as “minimum deterrence” is a recipe for placing the American people at greater risk, not less.28 Even though the United States will likely suffer a terrorist attack, it is certainly not the most dangerous threat the nation faces. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">With the nuclear club expanding and likely to gain new members hostile to the U</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">weakening the nuclear triad</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> is unwise. Doing so not only will undermine American credibility but also <strong>will cause allies to doubt America’s commitment to extended deterrence</strong>. <strong>This could lead allies to pursue their own nuclear arsenals</strong> as a hedge against American weakness and perceived threats yet to materialize</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.</span>
