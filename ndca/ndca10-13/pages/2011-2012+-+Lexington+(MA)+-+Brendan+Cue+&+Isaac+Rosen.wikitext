<span style="font-size: 8pt;">"Unfortunately, </span>the US investment in advanced research ...We need to reconsider<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> what makes an ambitious space program worth a substantial investment of public dollars—and consider again the historical and future importance of </span>advancing space technology and developing truly new and valuable space capabilities for the public, the nation, and the world<span style="font-size: 8pt;">."</span>


Only a federal investment into SPS invigorates US aerospace leadership

Scenario 1 is Hegemony

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kagan 11</span> (Robert Sr., a fellow at Brookings, 1/24/11, “The Price of Power: The benefits of U.S. defense spending far outweigh the costs,”)

"Today the international situation is also one of high risk....<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Those who recommend doing the same with less are only proposing a policy of insufficiency, where the United States makes commitments it cannot meet except at high risk of failure."</span>

Second – Economic Leadership
Aerospace competitiveness //__drives economic growth__// – purely private sector approaches guarantee failure
