<span style="font-size: 10pt;">the evidentiary rules in article III courts protect defendants from abuse at the hands of the government.

A. Due process paradoxically increases the governments reliance on targeted killing.

Taking Anwar al-Awlaki…mark my words



B. Targeted killing increases terrorism.

Targeted killing actually increases the organization strength of large terrorists groups, the groups with the greatest capacity to launch deadly attacks.

JENNA JORDAN 09 [“When Heads Roll: Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Decapitation” Security Studies, 18:719–755, 2009 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC]

Targeted killing operations…terror stock recruitment



Targeted killing guts our ability to gather intelligence to prevent future attacks.

A system of checks and balances is necessary to ensure the state continues to represent the interests of its citizens:

Dennis Mueller [Professor of Economics (Emeritus) at the University of Vienna. CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. Oxford University Press. New York, NY. 1996.]

The specter has…abide by it



C: preventing the erosion of procedural safeguards



Criminal justice and national security obligations should not be conflated.

McCarthy and Velshi 09 [Andrew C. McCarthy is Director of the Center for Law & Counterterrorism at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, Alykhan Velshi, staff attorney at the Center for Law & Counterterrorism, where he focuses on the international law of armed conflict and the use of force, “We Need a National Security Court”, American Enterprise Institute, 2009.]

Terrorism prosecutions confound…permitted to fail.



Trying non-citizen terrorists in the same courts as everyone else creates legal precedents that erode the rights of everyone else.

McCarthy and Velshi 2:

Forcing the criminal…work for terrorists.
