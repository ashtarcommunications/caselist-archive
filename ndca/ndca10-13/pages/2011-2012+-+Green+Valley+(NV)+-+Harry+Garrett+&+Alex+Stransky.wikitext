<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There are three specific scenarios of rogue proliferation that are on the brink in the status quo – missile defense is key to deter all three</span>

**You called our bluff andy - no sps :(**

**<span style="font-family: Arial;">Observation 1 is Welcome to the Desert of the Real</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial;">Our perception of the world does not come to us innocently from the mere facts of events. Instead, something we call the Real mediates this perception. The Real is not the reality lurking beneath representations of the world, but instead a lack introduced in the very act of representation, and indeed the very act of forming the social order. Lurking beneath every fantasy of peace, stability, and resolution of our energy crisis is a threat of disorder and chaos. Interaction with the catastrophic is an inevitable part of our being.</span>**

**Alex and I advocate the following: United States federal government ought to facilitate the development of nuclear pulse propulsion beyond the Earth’s mesosphere by starting the propulsions below the Earth’s mesosphere**


**Observation 2 is the Inconvenient Truth**

**Nuclear power poses a unique opportunity to confront this constant avoidance of the Real. The ideological response to Chernobyl was that of fear mongering rhetoric that allowed for the dominant symbolic authority to reign powerful – an attempt to create disconnect within the real. We can use that same threat of a nuclear catastrophe to forge a new understanding of nature and life that isn’t consumed by ideology. Voting affirmative is an endorsement of radiating the environment to radically alter the symbolic order, and create a new politics of the real.**

What can a Lacanian <span class="Underline"> processes of life</span>.


**And, our response to this so called catastrophe must be to give up all hope and traverse the fantasy, which allows us to recognize and alter the way that we respond to ideological influence. Traversing the fantasy offers no way out of our present conditions, but rather insists that you psychologically get over it – that our solution to our energy crisis fails to work means that no social harmony will ever succeed, but at the same time this recognition opens up the possibility of our embrace of the Real, and this embrace of our lacking situation allows us to challenge symbolic authority.**

**<span style="font-family: Arial;">Our embrace of the catastrophe that follows the break from capitalism allows us to reveal the true catastrophe within: our fear of threats is just ideology that puts us to sleep and allows capitalism to retain its symbolic authority. Our vision of a post-catastrophic world where we have looked death in the eye retroactively enables us to think differently about the present.</span>**

We are activists who study scholars and we are concerned with the militarization of space—it is the byproduct of the neoliberal global economy which sacrifices populations for the sake of a bloated military budget
