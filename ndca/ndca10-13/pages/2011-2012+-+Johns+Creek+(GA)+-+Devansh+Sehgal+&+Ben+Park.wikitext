**<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 15px;">PLAN: The United States Federal Government should invest in the development for the James Webb Space Telescope.</span>**
===Advantage 1 is Science Diplomacy=== 

**Science leadership and diplomacy is slipping in the status quo – specifically the cuts towards NASA are sending a huge blow to our science credibility. The plan is key to reverse this.**
**<span style="font-size: 16px;">Wood, 11</span>** – president of the National Association of Scholars [2/1/11, Peter Wood, “Could Science Leave the University?” [[http://chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/could-science-leave-the-university/28525]]]
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9px;">The university needs science... </span>altogether at least in the U<span style="font-size: 9px; text-decoration: none;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 9px; text-decoration: none;">tates</span><span style="font-size: 9px;">.</span>


**JWST is the cornerstone of sustainableUSscience leadership and diplomacy – spurs scientific interest and literacy – key to future space studies. Only theUShas the capabilities to create it.**

Illingworth 11

[Garth Illingworth, Ph.D., Australian National University, chairs a relatively new committee, the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee, that offers advice to Congress and NSF, NASA and DOE on the implementation of the science program developed by the astronomy science community through studies carried out by the National Academy of Sciences, January 21, 2011, letter to Dr. John P. Holdren, http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/community-advice/JSTAC_Holdren_JWST.pdf]

<span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; font-size: 15px;">The James Webb Space Telescope is a project... </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;">from the perspective of the JSTAC</span>


**Science diplomacy solves multiple scenarios of extinction**

<span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; font-size: 15px;">Imagine for a moment... </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">diplomatic efforts on the global stage.</span>

**Science leadership bolsters international cooperation- key to hegemony and asteroid deflection**
**Friedman, 11** – recently stepped down after 30 years as Executive Director of The Planetary Society. He continues as Director of the Society's LightSail Program and remains involved in space programs and policy. Before co-founding the Society with Carl Sagan and Bruce Murray, Lou was a Navigation and Mission Analysis Engineer and Manager of Advanced Projects at JPL. [Feb 14, 2011, Lou Friedman, The Space Review, “American leadership,” http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1778/1]

==<span style="font-size: 16px;">Scenario 1 is NEO strikes</span>== 
**Huge numbers of NEOs could hit at any time without warning and cause extinction --- lack of detection technology leaves us helpless**
**NRC 10** (National Research Council, “Defending Planet Earth: Near-Earth Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies”, Committee to Review Near-Earth-Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies, http://www.nap.ed u/catalog.php?record_id=12842)

<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 15px;">2. In December 2004, astronomers... </span>__in the relatively near future__.







**The impact is __extinction__ --- //high magnitude// and //aperiodic strikes// shatter traditional considerations of “timeframe” and mean we should treat NEO threats as __immanent__**
**Brownfield 4** (Roger, Gaishiled Project, “A Million Miles a Day”, Presentation at the Planetary Defense Conference: Protecting Earth From Asteroids, 2-26, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&gTable=%20Paper&g|http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&gTable= Paper&g]]</span> ID=17092)

<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">Once upon a time there was... </span><span style="font-size: 8px;">and its attendant fear. </span>


=Advantage 2 is trade off= 



**First – JWST is stuck in logjam – funding is key**

**Svitak, 11** – staff writer for Space News [Feb 18, 2011, Amy Svitak, Space News, “Budget Request Offers No Immediate Relief for JWST,” http://www.spacenews.com/civil/budget-request-jwst.html]



<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9px;">WASHINGTON — </span>__<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 15px;">NASA’s</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9px;">James Webb Space Telescope... gets adopted in its current form</span>


**And cost overruns for the James Webb decks NASA’s budget**

**Klamper, 10** – staff writer for Space News [November 12,2010,<span style="color: black;"> Amy </span>Klamper,<span style="color: black;"> “</span>JWST's Latest $1.5B Cost Overrun Imperils Other High-priority Projects,” <span style="color: black;">http://www.spacenews.com/civil/101112-jwst-cost-imperils-priority-projects.html</span>

**Specifically it’s blocking WFIRST**

**Smith, 10** – President of the Space and Technology Policy Group, LLC, which specializes in news, information and analysis of civil, military and commercial space programs and other technology areas [Sept 16, 2010, Marcia Smith, “Dark Energy Top Priority, But Astronomers Ask if Both US and European Space Missions Are Needed,” http://spacepolicyonline.com/pages/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1109:dark-energy-top-priority-but-astronomers-ask-if-both-us-and-european-space-missions-are-needed-&catid=67:news&Itemid=27]

**There are 2 Impacts – first is Dark Energy:**

**WFIRST would massively contribute to our understanding of dark energy**

**Blandford, et. al, 10** – a Pehong and Adele Chen Professor of Physics and director of the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford University [Roger D. Blandford, Chair, Committee for a Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics National Research Council, //New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics//, 2010, ISBN: 9780309158008, pg. 195-7]



__<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 15px;">Astronomy has made many contributions.... </span>__<span style="font-size: 9px;">would also play an important role. </span>


**Dark energy research key to depleted Argon neutrino detectors – solves port security and non-proliferation efforts.**

**Acosta-Kane et. al. 07** – Department of Physics, Princeton University [12/3/07, D., “Discovery of underground argon with low level of radioactive 39Ar and possible applications to WIMP dark matter detectors,” <span style="color: black;">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0712/0712.0381v1.pdf</span> DH]

Second is Space Colonization:



WFIRST is key to finding exoplanets

NASA, 11 **[“Exoplanets – Microlensing”, April 1st, 2011, <span style="color: black;">http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/exoplanets/</span>, Chetan]**


**<span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; font-size: 16px;">The discovery of >500 extrasolar ... formation and habitability.</span>**


And that sparks a new era of space colonization.
Harrold, 08 **– staff writer for the Gazette [July 18, 2008, Max Harrold, The Gazette, “Earth's twin coming into view; Scientists believe habitable planet will be spotted soon,” Lexis]**
**<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9px;">With less fanfare than H.G. Wells's... </span>__<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 15px;">has said it's okay to look."</span>__**

Every delay in space colonization risks a hundred trillion lives per second

**<span style="font-size: 9px;">As I write these words</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9px;">,.... </span>__<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 15px;">colonization of our supercluster</span>__**
And the Webb is key to future discoveries and unlocking the secrets of exoplanets and dark matter

**__<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 15px;">NASA's James Webb telescope.... </span>__<span style="font-size: 9px;">The discovery space is huge for this observatory."</span>**


Contention 3 is Solvency:



We must act now – the James Webb is on the chopping block

Amos, 11 **– BBC science correspondent, Kennedy Space Center [July 7, 2011, Jonathan Amos, “JWST backed by Nasa amid call to scrap telescope mission,” http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14073222]**



**__<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 15px;">The James Webb Space Telescope remains... </span>____to the launch date__<span style="font-size: 9px;">," he added.</span>**


And even if the Webb won’t be cut in Congress maintaining a flat budget will kill the project

Smith, 11**[Marcia Smith is President of the Space and Technology Policy Group, LLC, which specializes in news, information and analysis of civil, military and commercial space programs and other technology areas. “James Webb Space Telescope Needs More Money to Meet New 2018 Launch Date,” April 27, 2011, http://spacepolicyonline.com/pages/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1539:james-webb-space-telescope-needs-more-money-to-meet-new-2018-launch-date&catid=67:news&Itemid=27]**
