**OBSERVATION ONE IS THE ADVOCACY:** The affirmative recognizes the rights of animals by codifying the right not to be killed and the right not to be property. These rights are borne out of the philosophical duties humans have towards animals, as outlined in the AC. For example the right for animals not to be killed will be codified as people’s duties not to kill animals.

**OBSERVATION TWO IS FRAMEWORK:** <span style="color: #000000;">I value **justice.** T</span>he nature of our relationships with and obligations towards others form the basis of the requirements of justice.

<span style="color: #000000;">Previous philosophical theories try to distill justice into a single principle that is to be applied to all situations. For example, Kantian ethics establishes human dignity or reflective practical reason as the basis for all ethical reasoning. </span>

//<span style="color: #000000;">Emmanuel Levinas and... my own image.</span>//

<span style="color: #000000;">Any coherent conception of ethics arises out of respect for the other. Discussion that precedes a response to the other is internally self-defeating because it tries to attribute characteristics to the other before encountering the other,s. This also allows us to exclude anything outside of our defined interpretation of what the other is.</span>

Beavers. “</span>**<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS;">Introducing Levinas to Undergraduate Philosophers</span>**<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">”. </span>This paper was originally presented as a colloquy paper to the Undergraduate Philosophy Association at the University of Texas at Austin, 1990. <span style="background-color: initial;">[[http://faculty.evansville.edu/tb2/PDFs/UndergradPhil.pdf]]</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">//If we can... on the environment//.</span>

Thus we must respect the other.

//If the otherness... look at God.//

**<span style="color: #000000;">Therefore,</span>**<span style="color: #000000;"> the AFF **burden** is to prove that animals are an other worthy of ethical consideration.</span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">Further,</span>**<span style="color: #000000;"> prefer this framework for three additional reasons:</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">**First**, our self-awareness can only arise through our encounter with the Other. Without the capacity to distinguish that which is in our control from that which is not, the external world would appear to be governed by our will so we could not distinguish our own autonomous action from the decisions of the other. This makes it impossible to concpetualize our autonomy.</span>

**Second,** abstract ideas cannot constitute ethics. This approach towards ethics fails because it has no impact on the way we actually interact with people in the real world and instead, only to refers the abstract idea of a person.

<span style="color: #000000;">**Third**, ethics must accept others because we can never fully understand them. When we encounter the other, it has an independent perspective that eludes my understanding so we have no choice but to respect its otherness</span>

//Levinas suggests in...a power exercised.//

<span style="color: #000000;">My thesis and sole contention is that a proper understanding of the other requires the recognition of animal rights.</span>
Animals constitute an other because we are unable to truly and fully understand them.

<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Thus the resolution asks what principle is most salient to our moral identities – the supposed right to ignore the suffering of those in need, or the obligation to do something about it. The affirmative thesis is that the egoism entailed by a negation is deeply at odds with the fundamental basis of our moral subjectivity.</span>

== == 
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">Regardless of the abstract hypotheticals constructed by moral theorists, we know well how the underlying principle of negation is operationalized in the real world. Liberal capitalism erects psychological and ideological barriers, which in turn effect alienation from those connections which are fundamental to our moral identities. **Mary Dietz**[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn1|****[1]****]]explains that Liberalism employs a universalized conception of individuals as fully autonomous and unencumbered by social context.</span>

== == 

== == 

== == 
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">That the needs of others could hold no salient moral claim upon us is a stunningly counter-intuitive conclusion, and yet the idea that we have no unchosen obligations flows naturally from liberalism’s view of the unencumbered subject. Liberals like Robert Nozick go so far as to suggest that an obligation to help the needy is akin to slavery. This kind of narcissism alienates us from morally salient ties to others. It would be difficult to make sense of our moral life without acknowledging obligations of solidarity derived from our particular identities. **Michael Sandel**</span>
