==Rondo Black Feminism Aff== 
===Ayaan's Poem=== 
**As a black woman,**
**my complexity cannot breach beyond that of a mute, one dimensional character.**
**My identity is never one, but a system of oppression working together**
**But society makes me choice one identity over the other.**
**My identity becomes a tradeoff.**
**This debate community either sees me as black or a female.**
**And fail to realize that I don’t fit either.**
**I am a translucent canvas coated in mediocre, forced half-truths.**
**My lack of sass and neck rolling is strange.**
**It's as if the artist forgot the most important details.**
**I look for a signature to find my origin,**
**but too many names have been etched over each other.**
**So, I wait to reacquaint myself with myself,**
**but white walls block my view.**
**I am their familiar stranger.**
**I am their submissive matriarch.**
**I am their sexualized and raped asexual being.**
**I look to debate to rewrite my fate,**
**to change my community within a community,**
**but they brush me aside and shade in my existence to accentuate my given traits.**
**In a place where intellect and knowledge is valued**
**ears are plugged and songs are hummed as a coping mechanism for discomfort.**
**When can we vocalize true struggle?**
**Turmoil is already present in the physical and metaphysical world**
**But the focus is lead astray to hindrances of the privileged.**
**When can community be the focal point of attention?**
**When can I use the knowledge of my ancestors in place of**
**the social ignorance that is spat in my face by a ruling regime—**
**where hyenas ignorantly laugh at bloodshed.**
**Turn your heads to me, the black woman at the podium.**
**For I speak of injustices unresolved by the government.**
**For I speak in the essence of the community..**
**For I speak for me.**

**Iggy helped me see the true purpose of debate**
**It’s a way to cope with life**
**I was drowning in this activity**
**Because I was slowly losing my soul everytime I had to play the game of a fiat world.**
**Arguments were reality**
**Debate was never a game**
**Tears were staining my face because I was so sad**
**And I told him that I couldn’t take it anymore.**
**He looked at me and yelled**
**IF YOU DON’T FIGHT IN MINNESOTA WHO WILL**
**You have the privlige of being in this space to share with the world our problems**
**To gain knowledge**
**To tell the community to listen**
**And to create a counter hegemonic stance to challenge norms that will inevitable effect you for the rest of the world**
**So start not lil grasshopper gain the language u will need to survive.**
**So I guess its my turn to speak up about the revolution**
**i start to choke as i feel the pressure**
**im scared**
**future debaters are looking at me with tears in their eyes**
**i can’t let them down especially since they already feel neglected in this hostile environment**
**im tired and i haven’t even really started fighting yet.**
**i am a soldier and i didn’t even sign up for this war**
**but yet i can’t have that type of mentality you see**
**because where i come from these people are hurting constantly**
**they don’t know how to express the pain without crying**
**they don’t know how to articulate the problems without being silenced**
**and the silence ….**
**the silence is the reason they aren’t motivated to stay**
**the enemies spit game about resolutions, constitutions, and solutions that are straight lies.**
**the united states federal government social mapping vandalizes us**
**when will this community realize**
**i sit here ashamed that i call myself a debater**
**because I thought we would be making an impact in this world**
**instead of continuing traditions that hurt this world.**
**you know its funny**
**the topic is about increasing transportation infrastructure investment**
**they expect me to defend the government that messed up my Rondo Community,**
**do i really need a card to articulate this to you**
**i see it with my very own eyes**
**the destruction taking a toll on the people**
**the people with the brown faces**

**Glass skewed**
**Flashing lights calling for attention**
**Pavement scattered**
**In fluorescent colors they cry for change**
**Community divided**
**A bright red anticipates a destruction of connection**
**Air thickens**
**As they are cast into the shadows of cookie cutter calamity**
**Impatient drivers**
**Black pavement becomes jagged and jaded**
**Buses blockaded**
**And green is no longer present in comprehension**
**White rage swells up and overwhelms my system**
**And tears of frustration spew down.**
**A glance is not long enough of a look for construction.**
**Kill me. I am product.**
**HOW DO I REACT TO FEDERAL CHANGE IF I HOLD NO POWER BUT SPEECH?**
**Kill me. I am a resource.**
**HOW CAN I EVALUATE MY WORTH IF YOU REFUSE TO EVEN TRY TO ENGAGE WITH MY POWER?**
**Kill us. We are product.**
**MY COMMUNITY MUST COMBAT SUCH AN ANOMOLY OF ETHICS USING OUR LIMITED POWER.**
**Kill us. We are resources.**
**MUST PREVENT WHAT AMERICA DOES BEST AND JUST**
**Kill.**
**Killing the community.**

**The Discussion of Black Feminism is a Crucial Mode to Interact With the Structure and Operation of Oppression—Generating Knowledge From, By and About the Notion of Community, Black Feminist Thought Can Produce an Understanding That Refocuses and Clarifies Our Understanding of All Types of Oppressive Structures—Willingness to Embrace These Differences and The Challenges that Come Along With Them are What Determines if We Make Debate a Progressive and Beneficial Form of Counter-Community, or Merely a Replication of Dominance**

**Therefore, We Affirm an Examination of Transportation Infrastructure Through the Lens of Black Feminist Thought Via the 1AC To Use Debate and the Topic as a Space of True Knowledge and Progressive Community.**

**Observation 2 is Rondo:**

**The Affirmative Turns Our Attention, Our Act of Knowledge Production Towards the Function of Transportation Infrastructure in Our Own Backyards, the Rondo Neighborhood—We Must Understand the Transformative Power of Community, Both As it Existed and Was Supported By the Black Women of Rondo and the Way that Black Feminist Discourse Can Serve to Recreate and Empower This Narrative in Debate Today—Specifically We Listen to the Voices of These Women To Understand How Our Decision To Speak, To Understand Education as a Crucial Space for Anti-Racism is Vital to Producing All Substantive Forms of Change**

==Bataillecycles Aff== 
**Modern transportation infrastructure is built in service of the autonomous self – we drive our cars and burn fossil fuels in the pursuit of freedom. This economy of expenditure conceives of nature as a resource that can only do work – we stockpile resources for their preservation or consumption by the free and autonomous self.**
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Stoekl 7 (Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, Postsustainability, p. 123-128)</span>
The austerity-authenticity-sustainability ... how can we formulate it?

**This fossil fuel economy eschews intimate expenditure in favor of that which is directed toward efficiency and utility. This regime of production and consumption authorizes nuclear warfare, subordinating both nature and humanity to the horizon of a telos. Only affirming excessive expenditure – such as the intimate depletion of bodily energy – opens the possibility for planetary survival, de-linking expenditure from the expectation of return.**
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Stoekl 7 (Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability, p. 52-59)</span>
All this is ultimately important ... in transport, in ecstasy, in despair?

**The contemporary economy of expenditure makes nuclear annihilation inevitable. Cultivating alternative forms of expenditure is key to planetary survival.**
Stoekl 7 (Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University, “Excess and Depletion: Bataille’s Surprisingly Ethical Model of Expenditure,” Reading Bataille Now, Edited by Shannon Winnubst, pgs. 253-254)
The basis for Bataille’s ... not to mention the planet’s, survival.

**Thus, we affirm excessive expenditure through the transportation infrastructure of bodily movement, such as walking and bicycling.**

**The expenditure of bodily energy through walking and cycling constitutes a different form of expenditure from that of the car – no longer directed toward a controlled circulation of autonomous selves, walkers and cyclists needlessly spend bodily energy rather than purposefully consuming energy resources.**
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Stoekl 7 (Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, Postsustainability, p. 187-188)</span>
The universal city, one of whose ... of seemingly endless, quantified waste.

**The affirmation of transportation through the excessive expenditure of bodily energy breaks with the modern fossil fuel economy and its expectation of return – only placing the telos of autonomy in question opens up the possibility for a post-sustainable world and planetary survival.**
Stoekl 7 (Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, Postsustainability, p. 140-145)
Where does that leave Bataille’s ... in the squandering of time, of effort, of focus.

==AT: Saying the word "fuck" is bad== 
**This argument seems to have become increasingly popular against us lately (fuck is gendered/inappropriate => vote neg). Here is our response:**

**Your conception of fuck is worse. It relies on the heteronormative assumption that only men can fuck women. Wrong: Women can fuck women, men can fuck men, ect... This assumption is more violent than our use of the word fuck because it reinforces hierarchies of intimacy. These hierarchies delegitimize queer rights because said individuals and their relationships are not deemed "valid."**

**Additionally, Women Can Fuck Men—All Your Offense is Based off the Idea that Women GET Fucked, While Men DO the Fucking, But there is Zero Reason that this Must be the Case—It is Important That We Instead Recognize that Activity and Agency Within Sex are Not Articulable Solely as Masculine—Our Recognition and Understanding that Women Can Fuck Men is the First Step to Challenging the Patriarchy that You Criticize**

**Furthermore, your argument assumes a static conception of language that locks in a particular meaning. You should vote affirmative to embrace our use of language to change the way that it has constructed reality in the past**
Anna Kurtz and Christopher Oscarson, Members of National Council of Teachers of English Conference on College, Composition and Communication, 2003 ("BookTalk: Revising the Discourse of Hate," ProQuest)

However, Butler also argues that **__the daily, repeated use of words owns a space for another, more empowering kind of performance.__** This alternative performance, Butler insists, can be "the occasion for something we might still call agency, **__the repetition of an original subordination for another purpose. one whose future is partially open"__** (p. 38). __**To think of words as having an "open" future is to recognize that their authority lies less in their historical than in their present uses; it is to acknowledge that people can revise the meaning of words even as we repeat them;**__ it is to embrace the notion that the instability of words opens the possibility that we can use them to (reconstruct a more humane future for ourselves and others. Because words can be revised, Butler contends that __**it would be counterproductive simply to stop using terms that we would deem injurious**__ or oppressive. For __**when we choose not to use offensive words under any circumstance, we preserve their existing meanings as well as their power to injure.**__ If as teachers, for instance, __**w****e were simply to forbid the use of speech that is hurtful to LGBT students we would be effectively denying the fact that such language still exists. To ignore words in this way, Butler insists, won't make them go away.**__ Butler thus suggests that we actually use these words in thoughtful conversation in which we work through the injuries they cause (p. 1.02). Indeed, Butler insists that if we are to reclaim the power that oppressive speech robs from us, we must use, confront. and interrogate terms like "queer." We must ask how such terms affect both the speaker and the subject, what the purpose of their use is, and how their meaning can be altered to empower those whom they name. Thus, as Butler helps us see, __**language is violence, but only if we allow it to be. She encourages us to believe that words can take on new meanings-ones which forbid stasis,**__ challenge our habits, and open the possibility that teachers and students might be able Lo create spaces for learning in which everyone feels safe.

**Repressing words because of their negative connotations or violent effects doesn’t solve and makes it worse—it drives offensive words underground and causes lashouts and violence**
Gay, professor of philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, 1998 (William, Peace Review, December, ebsco)

Many times the first step in reducing linguistic violence is to simply refrain from thc use of offensive and oppressive terms. However, **__just because linguistic violence is not being used, a genuinely pacific discourse is not necessarily present.__** Nonviolent discourse, like the condition of peace, can be negative or positive. "Negative peace" refers to the temporary absence of actual war or the lull between wars, while "positive peace" refers to the negation of war and the presence of justice.
The pacific discourse that is analogous to negative peace can actually perpetuate injustice. **__Broadcasters in local and national news may altogether avoid using terms like "dyke" or "fag" or even "homosexual," but they and their audiences can remain homophobic even when the language of lesbian and gay pride is used.__** A government may cease referring to a particular nation as "a rogue state," but public and private attitudes may continue to foster prejudice toward this nation and its inhabitants. **__When prejudices remain unspoken__**, at least in public thrums, **__their detection and eradication are made even more difficult.__** Of course, we need to find ways to restrain hate speech in order to at least stop linguistic attacks in the public arena. Likewise, we need to find ways to restrain armed conflicts and hostile name calling directed against an adversary of the state. However, **__even if avoidance of linguistic violence is necessary, it is not__ __sufficient.__ __Those who bite their tongues to comply with the demands of political correctness are often ready to lash out vitriolic epithets when these constraints are removed. Thus, the practice of linguistic nonviolence is more like negative peace when the absence of hurtful or harmful terminology merely marks a lull in reliance on linguistic violence or a shift of its use from the public to the private sphere. The merely public or merely formal repression of language and behavior that expresses these attitudes builds up pressure that can erupt in subsequent outbursts of linguistic violence and physical violence.__**
