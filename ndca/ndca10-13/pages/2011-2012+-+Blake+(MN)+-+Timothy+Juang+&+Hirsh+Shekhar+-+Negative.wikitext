=Procedurals= 
==T--Exploration is Human== 
===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Exploration is only human activity</span>=== 
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mindell et al, 9</span> - Slava Gerovitch is a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics and the Program in Science, Technology, and Society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. David A. Mindell is Dibner Professor of the History of Engineering and Manufacturing, Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Director of the Program in Science, Technology, and Society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

What, then, is ... those it encounters.”27
===Vote neg:=== 
===A. Limits – Human exploration is key to limiting down the topic to a core set of affs that involve human settlement=== 
===B. Precision – our definition has intent to define and is rooted in government and scientific policy definitions.=== 

==T--Development is Research and Development== 
===A. The word “development” is limited to research and development and activities to increase exploration=== 
<span style="font-size: 16pt;">SDPA 2005 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(Space Development Promotion Act of the Republic of Korea, Journal of Space Law, 33, 5-31, http://www.spacelaw.olemiss.edu/library/space/Korea/Laws/33jsl175.pdf)</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Article 2 (Definitions) Definitions … or applied information. </span>
===B. The affirmative violates this because BMD neither increases exploration or research and development.=== 

===C. Vote negative to preserve limits – allowing the affirmative to develop BMD opens the floodgates to any type of space weapons. This makes the neg debate impossible because there would be an infinite number of cases to research.=== 

==T--Development is Physical Land Change== 
===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Development means a physical change to land for realistate </span>===

http://www.colliergov.net/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=27257
“Development” is defined … structure or land…”

===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Violation – the aff doesn’t PHYSICALLY change space in a lasting way IE. Teraphorming</span>=== 

===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vote neg for limits – development has to be meaningfully distinguished from “doing stuff in space” or the topic could include literally all and any space projects ever proposed</span>=== 

=Counter-plans= 
==China Do the Plan== 
===Text: The People’s Republic of China should [insert plan text]=== 

===Observation 1 – Competitiveness - The Counterplan competes legitimately by challenging the use of the United States – a major part of the resolution – it competes via net benefits=== 

===Observation 2: Solvency=== 
===China’s new space program has all the capabilities the US does and will be successful – Resources and Tech prove=== 
Gabriele <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Garibaldi</span>, Writer for Global Politician in East Asian News, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">05</span> [Chinese Threat to American Leadership in Space, Global Politician, May 9th, http://globalpolitician.com/2699-china-america]

The rise of China … Department of Defense.

==Condition China== 
===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Text: The United States federal government should [insert plan] </span>only if the Chinese government agrees to negotiate a Code of Conduct for acceptable space practices with the United States.=== 

===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">AND</span>=== 

===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">China will say yes but - now is crucial – China is concerned about future efforts by the US to militarize space – the combination of the counterplan’s CONDITION is key to solving - the plan alone triggers a global space arms race that causes extinction and turns the case. </span>===

==Consult JCS== 
===The United States federal government should initiate binding consultation with United States military leaders including, at least, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commanders, and relevant generals and admirals, over whether the United States should [insert plan.] The United States federal government should advocate the adoption of the proposed mandates, and should implement the results of the consultation.=== 
===The military will accept if the administration negotiates---otherwise it’ll backlash===

More current is … the political leadership.


===The link can only go one way-THE SINGLE BIGGEST LINK to destroying CMR is not consulting-even if there are other alt causes-not consulting uniquely destroys it===

Another challenge for … taken for granted.

==Orbital Colonies CP== 
===Text: The United States federal government should construct and maintain self-sufficient, remote, permanently occupied refuges meant to protect humanity from extinction events. The United States federal government should construct orbital colonies.=== 
===The counterplan __prevents extinction__—even if only a few people survive, it ensures humanity will recover.===

There’s no denying … at serious risk.

===First downgrade was a message – failure to cut policies that are un-necessary and cut our deficits second downgrade is inevitable – that triggers a stock sell off – total economic collapse===
