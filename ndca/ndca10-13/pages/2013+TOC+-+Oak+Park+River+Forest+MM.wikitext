It's the same aff - some cards are different

Infrastructures both evince and reinscribe our social values. Our tendency to equate modern stability with their success means that current approaches perpetuate a strategy of control over all dimensions of experience.
__Edwards, 2002__

Philip Brey, Arie Rip, and Andrew Feenberg, MIT Press, “Infrastructure and Modernity: Force, Time, and Social Organization in the History of Sociotechnical Systems”)

This strategy has never and will never be successful, but its failure is hidden by transportation’s attempt to reconcile time with space; at any reasonable scale of time, all infrastructure inevitably crumbles.

Enframing infrastructure within standard risk calculus presumes the neutrality of objectivity. Ignoring our powerlessness opens us to the haunting of the unknown and makes us lash out in an attempt to reassert certainty.

This refusal of other actors’ perspectives is a totalitarian ideology predicated on the denial of difference – all violence becomes inevitable and justified

Moreover, our insistence upon proximate gratification is the manifestation of a violent logic of control that makes extinction inevitable. Only positive, new engagements with the Earth solve.

Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its investment in relationally planned transportation infrastructure in the United States.

Only our relational mode of planning can account for a multiplicity of experiences

Our understanding of our infrastructures specifically determines the future of politics surrounding them - the affirmative is key to challenge the subpolitization of the systems that surround us.

Preserving the ontological posture of unknowing is a prerequisite to actualizing meaning

<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;">(John Coe, April 23rd 2012, http://www.helium.com/items/2317938-poetry-capitalism)</span>


**<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;">To call for a ballot is to breathe life into the system, a system content on devouring and consuming all beings and potentialities for the sake of dead labor which is turned on its head for more and more production - resistance is a sight for power to exert itself. To vote aff is to vote for production, prefer exhaustion.</span>**
**Bifo 11** – Whit Whitmore’s pen name
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Franco “Bifo” Berardi, //After the Future// pg 106-108 (of my copy), dml)</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nothing, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">not even the system, can avoid the symbolic obligation, and it </span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">AND</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">new concatenation, where collective intelligence is only subjected to the common good.</span>

Trying to create change is bad—traps us within capitalist systems and is depression
Genosko and thoburn 11—philosophers
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Gary and Nick, After the Future pg 6-7, dml)</span>

Activism, Bifo argues, is the narcissistic response of the subject to the infinite
AND
future, and after the redundant subjective forms of which it was made.


Vote negative on presumption - the poem has already been introduced into the word. The artist has no tie to the poem.
Bryant 12 - Professor of Philosophy at Collin College (Levi R., Author of a number of articles on Deleuze, Badiou, Zizek, Lacan, and political theory, July 22nd, 2012, http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2012/07/22/machinic-art-the-matter-of-contradiction/)
An artist friend of mine asked me what I’ll be discussing at The Matter of
AND
sense, and creates an affect for the slaughter of the innocents everywhere.
If they win some model of subjectivity in relation to the artistic piece is good, it would be better to vote negative anyway. Make the aff a suicide bomber.

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The poet</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, irremediably</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">split between exaltation and vulgarity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, between the autonomy that </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">produces </span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">AND</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">nothing we can say of her except the fact that she is dead. </span>
