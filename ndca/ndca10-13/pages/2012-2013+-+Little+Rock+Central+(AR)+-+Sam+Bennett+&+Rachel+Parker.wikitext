**Contention 2 is Shipbuilding**

Knowledge of shipbuilding remains part of American manufacturing. But accelerating cost,
AND
turnover and the shipbuilders’ dependence on a rapidly shrinking supplier base.

**Specifically, it prevents cost overruns**

Global engagement is critical to the U.S. economy,

As naval technology gallops on, can fleets execute the same missions with fewer assets?
AND
A mismatch among policy, strategy, and forces looms.


**We’ll Isolate 2 Scenarios**

**First is China**

**Lack of naval capability only emboldens China- plan prevents miscalculation and escalation, and strengthens US-China relations**
**WSJ ’10**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [19 August 2010, Wall Street Journal, “The Chinese Military Challenge The PLA is seeking to push U.S. forces out of Asian waters,” http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704554104575434740649387972.html, AZhang]</span>

Fifth, China is riding a wave of national overconfidence
AND
alone will recalibrate the balance of sea power.

**The impact is multiple nuclear conflicts**
**Straits Times 2k** <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">(Ching Cheong, Straits times, July 25 2000, lexis nexis)</span>

The high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war
AND
that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation.

**Second is Iran**

**Iran’s asymmetric warfare capabilities have surpassed ours— Plan prevents naval risk aversion, Iranian adventurism, and Strait of Hormuz conflict**
**Singh 2012** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">– Managing editor of the Washington Institute (Michael, “The Real Iranian Threat in the Gulf” January 3, 2012, [[http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-real-iranian-threat-in-the-gulf]])</span>

Even if Iran ignored these considerations and proceeded with an
AND
belligerence nor passivity, but a robust posture that makes Tehran think twice.

**That escalates to nuclear war**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ben-Meir 2007</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">– Professor of international relations at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University (Alon, “Realpolitik: Ending Iran's defiance”, 2/6/12, UPI, , http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2007/02/06/Realpolitik-Ending-Irans-defiance/UPI-69491170778058/)</span>

That Iran stands today able to challenge or even defy the United States in every
AND
to warn Iran of the severe consequences of not halting its nuclear program.

**Plan**
**The United States federal government should substantially increase its Marine Transportation System infrastructure investment in the United States.**

**Contention 3 is Solvency**
**The federal government is key for multiple reasons**

**A. Best solves the expansion of Marine Highways and Shipbuilding Industry**
**Zimmer, 11** [<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nancy, August, “Progress on America’s Marine Highway” graduated from Smith College (B.A., cum laude, 1998), and City University of New York School of Law, (J.D., 2001).

For the United States to compete in the global market it is imperative that it
AND
The budget cuts to this program demonstrate a shortsightedness that is disheartening at best.

**B. Leverages private investment and reduces congestion**

**For more than a decade, Europe and the U.S. have witnessed increasing**

**that is being purchased by the vessel owner and included as a transaction cost.**

C. Has Jurisdiction and key to Leadership

**Over time these constitutional responsibilities have been further defined and**
**AND**
**America’s economic vitality, jobs, and global competitiveness, be recognized and prioritized.**
